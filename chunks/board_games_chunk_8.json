        "description": "18VA is an 18xx game set in Virginia as well as pertinent neighboring areas of Maryland and the District of Columbia. 18VA is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick's one-state games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.<br/><br/>The major hook in this game is the coal trains, which run mainly West-East, taking coal from the mountains to the coast, while the passenger trains run the North-South routes.<br/><br/>Also interesting is the fact that all railroads operate with just the President's share sold, and open with 5 shares and expand to 10 at the owner's discretion.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, place all the cups face down on the table, shuffle them, then group them together. On a turn, a player can capture a stack that's adjacent to one of his own stacks as long as his stack is the same height as or taller than the adjacent stack. As long as a player's color stays on top of the stack, he controls that stack. If one or more stacks are isolated from the main group and all of these stacks are controlled by the same player, he can take possession of them, removing them from the game. When all the cups have been captured, players stack all of the cups they captured and whoever has the highest stack wins.<br/><br/>",

From that day on, a mass of shadows (called Sheol) similar to a black tide began to form until it shrouded the moon completely and the moon &quot;cried&quot; the shadows down to Earth. Although technologically advanced, people had no means to stop the shadows, which slowly filled the Earth and exterminated almost all of mankind. The planet was fully enveloped in layer of clouds so dark that sunlight could not filter through and the survivors took refuge on the Isle of Light, also called the Citadel, the last outpost of mankind. In fact, Lux, a type of light radiation capable of destroying shadows, was discovered too late.<br/><br/>Enclosed between the immense walls that surround the many square kilometers in which the intricate levels of the citadel arise, humans have slowly forgotten the external world shrouded in darkness and exhausted themselves in a series of internal political, cultural and economic struggles. In fact, over the decades, the citadel has become a collection of decadent people, mixing nanotechnology with superstition, millenary beliefs with cyber-empowerments, chaos and the emergence of new castes.<br/><br/>Only the Scouts, explorers of the unknown and raiders of the outside world, have not forgotten that the world belongs to mankind and that mankind shall reclaim it one day. In this game, you are one of them.is set in a not-too-distant future. After the Moon's Weeping, Earth has turned from being the realm of man to a place reigned by shadows. The only bastion of salvation is the Citadel, where the last survivors of humanity found shelter to survive. It is from here that the Scouts head out to explore the desolate lands of Sheol in search of resources.<br/><br/>Sheol is a cooperative game, playable solo or up to 4 people, with an emphasis on storytelling and strategy. Sheol is set in a coherent universe where game mechanics and setting are deeply interconnected. It is organized in campaigns, in turn, subdivided into missions. In each mission, players will have to coordinate their efforts tactically to complete the objectives and defend the central game area (the Citadel) from the enemy invasion. The story will progress, mission after mission, allowing characters to discover the secrets of the Sheol&rsquo;s world and unlock more items and skills.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But the struggle for the Empire's future takes place not only at the noble courts. In Vienna's slums and alleys swashbucklers, musketeers and thugs wage a secret war on behalf of their powerful superiors.<br/><br/>Anno Domini 1666 is a tactical adventure miniatures game in which two players pit their bands against each other in order to achieve specific goals defined by a scenario. The game takes place on boards depicting 17th-century Vienna with a grid overlay. Dice rolls are replaced by cards either played from a player's hand, or drawn blindly from a deck. A scenario's objectives may include defeating the opponents in combat, but also stealing a valuable object or breaking out a hostage, among others.<br/><br/>The theme and characters of the game are based on real-world history, historical novels (such as Three Musketeers) but also feature magic, alchemy, wizards and fantastical creatures. The participating factions are the Poles, the French, the Ottomans and the evil sect Broken Cross. They can get help from the Vienna locals (thugs, urchins, merchants) and famous mercenaries. The process of building a band is fast and streamlined thanks to a draft system.<br/><br/>Game components will included top quality miniatures (with all unique sculpts), several sheets of counters, custom card decks and multiple maps and scenarios.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s Kickstarter campaign is scheduled for spring 2018.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Over nine rounds, each player dispatches family members to attend parties, give gifts, brag about their achievements, engage in spurious gossip, and muscle their way through crowds to get some valuable face-time with the Medici.

Fear my Drunken Monkey Kung Fu!&quot;<br/>&quot;I'm a Yakuza with a gun. Run away!&quot;<br/><br/>The Munchkins are back! Now the game is chop-socky Hong Kong action. The characters are Samurai, Ninja, Yakuza, and Monks. The foes are mooks, demons, and assorted bad guys from all the worst martial arts films you've ever seen. Collect treasures and learn new styles to build up your character's powers. Kill the monsters, take their stuff, and be the first one to 10th level!<br/><br/>Created by Steve Jackson (I). Munchkin Fu is completely compatible with the entire Munchkin line.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOtherPart of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Little Insurgents: Warsaw 1944&rdquo; is a eurogame about scouts delivering orders during the Warsaw Rising in Poland in 1944, when the people of Warsaw rose against the Nazis occupying their city. Young boys worked as a couriers delivering letters and orders between squads of rebels, running through the underground sewage canals of Warsaw. Many of them died on that duty.<br/><br/>In &ldquo;Little Insurgents&rdquo; each player takes command of a unit of three Scouts with the goal of delivering the most orders on time. The scouts from different units are racing against each other to be first, but they also have to co-operate. If the order is not delivered on time crucial parts of the city, or even whole districts can be lost to the occupiers. If too many orders fall into hands of the enemy all players lose.<br/><br/>The game comes with two variants of rules: basic and extended, with basic being easier and involving more random elements. It is suitable for young players and families. The extended variant, dedicated to adults and gamers, involves special actions, more planning and secret goals.<br/><br/>The game will be published by Egmont Polska in the autumn of 2009 with rules in three languages: Polish, English and German.<br/><br/>The game was developed in cooperation with Polish Scout Association (ZHP) and the Warsaw Rising Museum.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Munchkin Conan is a 168-card core set in the Munchkin family of games, with 101 Doors and 67 Treasures. Unlike other core sets, it lacks unique card backs, instead using the standard card back from Munchkin. The included Munchkin-head d6 is yellow with dark red print.<br/><br/>In Munchkin Conan, Robert E. Howard's epic hero gets the full Munchkin treatment. Play a Cimmerian Warrior or a Stygian Wizard! Wield the Sword of the Phoenix and poison your foes with Black Lotus! Slay Thoth-Amon's minions, Pict raiders, and abominable monsters, and hear the lamentations of their women! On many of the cards, the publisher provides context by including relevant quotes from Howard's work.<br/><br/>Munchkin Conan has a new type of card &ndash; birthright &ndash; and the mechanisms are similar to that of classes and races in that you can have only one in play at a time; you may discard a birthright at any time but may play one only on your turn or when you first get it. The Munchkin Conan core set comes with two birthrights: &quot;Noble&quot;, which allows you to have an extra Comrade (see below), and &quot;Barbarian&quot;, which allows you to ignore all &quot;Usable By&quot; and &quot;Not Usable By&quot; restrictions on items. There is no birthright analogue to &quot;Super Munchkin&quot; or &quot;Half-Breed&quot;.<br/><br/>Speaking of races and classes, the races in Munchkin Conan are &quot;Kushite&quot;, &quot;Zamoran&quot;, &quot;Cimmerian&quot;, and &quot;Stygian&quot;; when playing a blender game, they are all considered to be human unless the other sets have non-human races. The classes are &quot;Cleric&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Wizard&quot;, and are identical to the fantasy Munchkin classes with the same names.<br/><br/>The Munchkin Conan hireling is called a Comrade. Comrades fall in the same class as the Hirelings, Minions, Mooks, Sidekicks, etc. that come with other flavors of Munchkin. Each Comrade is associated with a class or birthright, and gives you some of the advantages of that class/birthright. Comrades can carry an item for you, even some that you can't legally use yourself, and their gender matters. They also have the standard Hireling ability to sacrifice themselves to give you an automatic escape when running away.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>",

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Finn vs. Jake, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes. Jake's corn-themed deck features creatures from the episode such as the powerful Husker Knights, the intimidating Legion of Earlings, the heroic Archer Dan and many more! Finn's &quot;Blue Plains&quot; deck features creatures from the episode such as the wise Ancient Scholar, the aptly named Cool Dog, and the most fearsome critter of all &ndash; The Pig!<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!<br/><br/>",

It's a Strategic level Card-Driven board-wargame for 4 players (Muslim, French, Portuguese and Spanish) covering the reign of the Catholic Monarchs and the voyages of the Age of Discovery.<br/><br/>This is a CDG where each player has to reach 45VP to win in the course of 7 maximum turns. Players play cards for their event or to perform actions from a list of available options for each power and at a specific cost for each action. VPs are earned either by military objectives, discoveries of new zones, trade, royal weddings or certain events. In each turn the 4 players alternate playing cards and so on until the end of the turn. The combats are resolved by means of dice rolls with possible support of combat cards and taking into account the type of participating unit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Precuela de &quot;Here I Stand&quot;, el afamado juego de Ed Beach publicado por GMT GAMES.

New roads have been built in the kingdom, with a new city founded at their meeting point which has grown so much that the King has decided to move the capital there and build a new castle.<br/><br/>Numerous corporations of craftsmen were already present in the city, but now guilds are forming, which are larger and more wide-ranging, powerful and in competition with one another. With the goal of obtaining favor with the King, the guilds will gather together the most prestigious personages within them, not to mention those who can bring the largest influx of money or useful talent.<br/><br/>What better place than the central square to find new members? For this reason, each guild places its tents in the central square every week, inviting the persons it considers most interesting to sign up by incentivizing them with precious gifts. This is certainly not a low-cost operation considering that it can cost many pieces of silver to put together the most convincing gift.<br/><br/>At the same time, each guild must build its headquarters, spending large amounts of gold to enlarge it with a range of luxurious rooms suitable for its members; if this were not enough, the guilds must also take into account the King's current tastes on what is most important for a guild worthy of his approval.<br/><br/>Will you manage to make your guild stand out so that it becomes the most important in the city? Which means will you be willing to use in Guilds to win the King's favor?<br/><br/>",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>Carcassonne f&uuml;r 2 is a two-player version of Carcassonne that comes in a metal box and contains 48 tiles and 12 meeples.<br/><br/>",

However, you do not need to play a card to draw from the deck. <br/> If someone draws a Psycho Killer card they must play it on the table in front of them, unless they can evade the Psycho Killer. If they cannot, every player with a weapon card in their hand gets attacked.<br/><br/>When attacked, players must place their Weapon cards face up on the table in front of them. These are called Injury Piles.<br/><br/>Each Psycho Killer and Weapon card is worth a certain amount of points. When they are added to your injury pile they become Injury Points. The game ends when the last Psycho Killer card is drawn and the player with the lowest amount of injury points wins.<br/><br/>Psycho Killer satirises your favourite retro horror and slasher films.

        "description": "Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is a comparatively short and simple game of the naval conflict at sea and on the great rivers in the American Civil War. Easily playable in less than three hours, Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is a strategic contest between two players, one seeking to reunite the Union by force, the other to maintain its new independence in the face of the escalating industrial might and resolve of its northern brother. More of a representation than a detailed simulation of that conflict, the game is intensely engaging, highly interactive and moves along quickly, with players constantly responding and reacting to their opponent&rsquo;s moves.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is not a card-driven game, the cards ensure that each game is very different, and that a strategy which worked in one game may not prove as efficacious in the next. The game is also customizable with a menu of elective rules to provide each side with a variety of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options to further vary play.<br/> Components<br/><br/>*   One 22 x 28 map<br/>    *   One Rule Book<br/>    *   One Play Book<br/>    *   One Players Aid Card<br/>    *   Eight six-sided dice<br/>    *   Two decks of 55 cards each (one Union, one Confederate)<br/>    *   6 Plastic Stands for Leaders<br/>    *   176 5/8&rdquo; ship counters<br/>    *   various round, hexagonal, rectangular cargo, victory point, leader, control and informational counters<br/>    *   30 small red opaque plastic tokens (to mark pieces which have moved)<br/><br/>",

You have to face off against the hordes of mutants controlled by the evil Doctor Zero, a mad scientist who wants to take over the city today...and the whole world tomorrow! In order to get out of this clash, you have to work together to rescue as many citizens as possible using the unique abilities of your characters to counter the bloodthirsty mutants' attacks.<br/><br/>Become a police officer and enter the rainy, neon-lit streets of Hard City. Stop the evil mastermind Doctor Zero, shoot mutants, rescue civilians, and blast some cool synth music really loud while driving your Chevrolet. You will be given a whole arsenal of weapons and various items to help you withstand until reinforcements arrive &mdash; or become Doctor Zero and send your minions to the streets of the city, fight the officers, and finally take control of the whole metropolis!<br/><br/>During each turn of the game, officers act first and spend their action points on various actions, such as moving, shooting mutants, escorting civilians, and using special abilities. Doctor Zero plays differently, having a deck of dedicated cards that determine what they can do: spawn new mutants, move them, or attack officers. The game is scenario-based, and the five episodes form a complete story of Doctor Zero's rise and fall and the officers' epic fight against him. Each episode is playable (and re-playable) on its own, having unique winning conditions and different set-up.<br/><br/>Imagine a strategy dungeon crawler board game, played in the &quot;1 vs. all&quot; mode &mdash; but in a unique &quot;new retro&quot; setting heavily inspired by B-class action movies and the atmosphere of the 1980s era! Who will survive on the streets of mayhem?<br/><br/>",

Players then bid for the right to declare trump.  The bid goes around once, with bids ranging from 30 to 42, plus some special bids. The winning bidder declares a trump. The object is to win &quot;tricks.&quot;<br/><br/>The highest domino of each suit is the double.  Play is then started by the winning bidder by placing a domino to start a trick.  Players must follow suit if possible.  The higher end of the domino led determines the suit for that round. If a player cannot follow suit, they can play any domino.  The trick is won by the highest trump in the trick, or if it contains no trump, by the highest domino of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.<br/><br/>Scoring for a round is one point per trick (7 tricks) plus the &quot;count&quot;. The &quot;count&quot; is determined by dominoes taken that add up to 5 (0-5, 1-4, 2-3) or 10 (6-4, 5-5). They are worth 5 or ten points respectively, giving a total maximum score of 42, and the name of the game.<br/><br/>A match is seven hands, or marks.  Traditionally, scoring is the seven marks required to write the letters ALL.<br/><br/>",

The railroads gain income by passing through a variety of Kansas cities and towns, with sizable income available for those that go through Wichita or Topeka.  There is an additional mechanism and incentive for furthering the railroads westward: the Western quarter of the state is a 'land grant' area where the railroads can gain additional track cubes, and rail lines that reach the Colorado border receive a sizable income bonus.

        "description": "GMT is proud to present Vance von Borries&rsquo; sixth epic game in his award winning series of East Front games, Barbarossa: Crimea. This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>One 22x34 inch map<br/>840 counters<br/>Rule booklet in color<br/>Playbook in color<br/>Various player aid cards for charts and tables in color<br/>Set up cards for each scenario in color<br/>4 Scenario cards 11x17<br/>1 ten sided die<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.<br/><br/>As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/>1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.<br/><br/>2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.<br/><br/>3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.<br/><br/>4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.<br/><br/>5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.<br/><br/>6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?<br/><br/>7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?<br/><br/>8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The forgotten creatures of the forest have awoken from their slumber and nobody knows for sure what is lurking in the Iron Valley. You followed the call of your king. Now it is time for heroic deeds in The Boldest!<br/><br/><br/>Defeat mechanical monsters, retrieve enigmatic artifacts, use helpful items and lead your faction to glory. Each round, three expedition leave into the unknown to explore this mysterious place. You form three groups, one for each expedition, with the heroes in your hand. Only the strongest groups can take part in an expedition, so you need to apportion your power. Can you read your opponents well enough and forestall them? Collect the most experience and become a legend! Are you worthy of the title &ldquo;The Boldest&rdquo;?<br/><br/> <br/>Max Prentis passionately created and illustrated the world of The Boldest. His love for details can be found on every card. The over 100 unique Illustrations let you delve into this rich world. Get ready to explore!<br/> Those of you who are curious and want a glimpse at the game mechanics are in luck because we want to give you a peak under the hood for the new, second game by Sophia Wagner (Noria was her first).<br/> The core mechanics of The Boldest are Hand Management, Programming and Hidden Bidding. <br/>Each player starts with a Faction consisting of 17 Starting Heroes from the 5 Classes (3 Warriors, 3 Technicians, 3 Hunters, 5 Cooks and 3 Pets).<br/> In the Planning Phase you secretly form three Groups with Heroes of the same Class behind your Screen and place them face down one Group per Planning Space.<br/>Every Hero executes a different Action in the following Action Phase but in general they let you take specific Forest Cards or new Heroes. <br/>Pets are the only exception they can be combined with any other Class. Why is that important?<br/> Because in the Action Phase only the strongest Groups can execute their Classes action. <br/>The Planning Spaces are resolved consecutively. First all players reveal their Group in Planning Space 1 and tell the other players the Class they played and the Group Strength (defined by the number of Class icons on the played cards). The strongest Group executes their action and afterwards sends their Leader to the king (this Hero is out of the game) while the remaining Heroes celebrate their success in the Party Tent. <br/>They won&rsquo;t be available next round to that player. Weaker Groups keep their Heroes and get a new one as compensation.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the Classes execute different Actions in a specific order: Warriors always go first followed by Technicians, Hunters and Cooks. The Cooks convince new Heroes with Special Abilities to join your Faction with their delicious dishes. The Warriors, Technicians and Hunters can take specific Forest Cards while other cards block their way. How the Forest changes over the course of three Expeditions of a round is also something you must anticipate during the Planning Phase. In the Action Phase you cannot change your Groups anymore.<br/><br/>After 5 or 6 rounds (depending on the number of players) the player who was able to collect the most experience will be known as &quot;The Boldest&quot;!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A betting card is numbered from 1 to 7, with two copies of each card.<br/><br/>Beginning with the starting player, each player lays one of the seven critter cards on the table, adding it to the foremost or hindmost position. At the end of the initial set up, the seventh critter card is flipped, marking it as the &quot;dark horse&quot; in the race. On a player's turn, they must play an action card and execute its effect, e.g., moving the fourth critter card forward or backward two spaces, moving the number 6 critter card forward or backward one space, or exchanging one of your betting cards with an unused betting card.<br/><br/>Additionally, the player can pick up one of the three &quot;dark horse&quot; tokens, which is worth 5 points if the &quot;dark horse&quot; ends the race in the top three positions; if not, that token is worth -3 points.<br/><br/>After five turns, each player reveals their two betting cards and receives points according to the matching critter card's position: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) for first through seventh place.

        "description": "In May of 1813, Napoleon began the campaign for Germany with a bang - as was his custom. The Prussian and Russian armies attempt to ambush the French main army strung out in road march. Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter. The first major battle of the 1813 campaign ends with thousands of dead and wounded and with the Russian and Prussian armies in full retreat.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Lutzen simulates the first major clash of Napoleons 1813 campaign. Lacking adequate cavalry and handicapped by a large number of raw recruits, the French player must rapidly consolidate his scattered forces to counter the sudden Allied attack. As the player commanding the Allied forces, you must deal the French a decisive blow before Napoleon can react and bring reinforcements to bear.<br/><br/>Lutzen is ideal for multiple players or solitaire study. Each turn represents 20 minutes of real time, and each hex equals 100 meters. The rules are the Lutzen version of the award winning system developed by the Marshall Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. Players are faced with the same tactical dilemmas their historical counterparts faced, though play balance depends upon their own skill.<br/><br/>Content:<br/>Rulebook including historical commentary <br/>1,000 plus die-cut counters <br/>Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; game maps <br/>Organizational displays, Charts &amp; Tables<br/><br/>scale = 100 m/hex; <br/>time = 20 min/GT; <br/>strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grab your binoculars and your birding journal because it's time to hit the trails and see some birds. Choose a habitat each round to visit along the western coast of North America, and see what rare birds you can find. Don't forget to keep an eye on what your fellow birders are tracking down &mdash; they might just lead you to the bird that finishes your watch list and earns you extra points! Who will outsmart their opponents, spot the most birds, and be the best birder?<br/><br/>In Birds of a Feather: Western North America, you and the other players explore different habitats to spot birds. In the first round, each player chooses and reveals a card from hand, then marks off on their score sheet or the app the bird they played as well as all other birds played in the same habitat. The deck contains cards from five habitats, with some birds being more common than others. In the second round, you each play a card again, then you mark all birds in your current habitat as well as all cards played the previous round in that habitat. Apparently word spread about all the great finds! Remove all cards from the first round, then keep playing additional rounds in the same manner.<br/><br/>When each player has only one card left in hand, the game ends. For each ace bird you've seen in a habitat, you score 2 points; for each other non-common bird you've seen, score 1 point; and if you've seen all seven types of birds in a habitat, score 3 bonus points for a total of 10 points in that habitat. Whoever has the most total points wins.<br/><br/>Birds of a Feather: Western North America differs from Birds of Feather thanks to new graphic design and improved rules for two- and three-player games to make them more strategic.<br/><br/>",

Curtis. This battle decided the fate of the trans-Mississippi region. Historically, the Union prevailed and Missouri was denied to the Confederates.<br/><br/>The game covers the two days of the battle, and creates rules for reorganization during the night. Rebels start the game with the initiative as Union brigades race to meet and slow the massive CSA advance, allowing later Union troopers to move into defensive positions.<br/><br/>Initiative passes to the Yankees on the second day, if the Rebels don't win outright on the first day. Victory is determined by killing units and capturing geographical objectives.<br/><br/>Each Game-Turn represents 30 minutes of real time, and each hex covers about 125 yards from hexside to hexside. Each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun. The system created a set of standard rules for all the GBACW games, and then added exclusive rules specific to that battle. 200 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New England Simulations revisits a familiar World War II venue -- the hedgerows of Normandy -- with some refreshing twists in The Killing Ground: Campaign for Normandy, July-August 1944&quot;. The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).<br/><br/>As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.<br/><br/>The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.<br/><br/>The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.<br/><br/>In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.<br/><br/>Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail. The Killing Ground includes five scenarios, all historical.<br/><br/>Game Scale<br/>Units: Primarily regimental with tank and other support units as battalions.<br/>Time: Each game-turn is 1 day.<br/>Map: 2.5km per hex.<br/><br/>A complete game of The Killing Ground will include the following:<br/>1 rules booklet<br/>1 Combat Manual<br/>2 map sections (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; each)<br/>3 different countersheets (900 counters printed front &amp; back)<br/>6 different charts (Combat Results Table, Allied Air Allocation Chart, US Army Support Points chart, British/Canadian Army Support Points chart, Game-Turn Record Track, Scenario Card).<br/>2 six-sided dice<br/>1 game box<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Overlord: D-Day and the Beachhead Battles<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead of Winter is GMT&rsquo;s recreation of Richard Berg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War series&rdquo; series title on the battle of Murfreesboro; also known as The Battle of Stone&rsquo;s River to Union Veterans. Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.<br/><br/>The Series:<br/><br/>The GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Dead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.<br/> One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.<br/><br/>The Team: <br/>While Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.<br/><br/>The GMT game is the revised second version of Dead of Winter: The Battle of Stones River – Murfreesboro, Tennessee by Simulation Design, Inc..<br/><br/><br/>Game Design: Dave Powell<br/>Series Design: Richard H.

The goal of the game is to create one large group of frogs&mdash;an army, if you will&mdash;through tactical manoeuvring and placement of the pieces, which are hexagonal Bakelite frogs. Each player starts with two randomly drawn frogs, and on a turn a player takes the following three actions to build and shift an island of frogs in the center of the table:<br/><br/>     if possible, move a frog of his color that&rsquo;s on the board to a new location (something that&rsquo;s obviously skipped on the first turn)<br/>     add one of the frogs in his supply to the board, and<br/>     draw a new frog from the bag and add it to his supply.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to link all their frogs (with at least seven in play) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game board (newly introduded to the world of Pickomino) invites the players to 14 different BBQ sites. In order to conquer those desired sites, a player puts aside all identical symbols from his dice roll and continues rolling the remaining dice. As soon as his dice roll result reaches the value of an empty BBQ site, he may broil and eat his worms there. However, the opponent players may also establish themselves at the same site (it's another difference from Pickomino) and claim the tasty worms. And only at very precious BBQ sites players can find the latest BBQ trend: roast snails.<br/><br/>Packed in an attractively styled &quot;BBQ Dice&quot;, the game not only fascinates worm-loving Pickomino fans. The new dimension of the &quot;Worm Universe&quot; in &quot;Heckmeck BBQ&quot; also lets players who haven`t tried any tasty worms yet discover their desire for roast snails.<br/><br/>",

Each player, as either the Duke of Wellington or Napoleon, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before their armies clash in an epic battle over three farms forward of the ridge at Waterloo: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte.<br/><br/>Every beautiful card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.<br/><br/>Note on title: Though not an accurate description of their formidable fighting prowess, Wellington himself referred to his men on more than one occasion as Scum of the Earth. &ldquo;The French system of conscription brings together a fair sample of all classes; ours is composed of the scum of the earth&mdash;the mere scum of the earth.

        "description": "Part of the publisher's Heirloom Games Series, this is a reproduction of a game first printed in 1962.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/>Harry&rsquo;s Grand Slam Baseball Game simulates a real baseball game. The Visiting Team bats in the top half of each of the nine innings and the Home Team, in the bottom half. Runners move around the bases, and runs and innings are recorded on a stand-up scoreboard screen. The game uses a special deck of 54 cards, which represent typical baseball plays. When a manager&rsquo;s team is at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will help score runs. When not at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will result in outs for the other team.<br/><br/>The designer on his original edition: &quot;The scoring rules are simple and logical, and differ only slightly from the official rules of baseball. The elements of luck and skill are balanced carefully, so as to make each game an interesting and different contest.&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes rules for the Heirloom edition as well as the original 1962 rules, which contain instructions for playing with 3 or 4 players plus &quot;Slugfest&quot; and &quot;Shutout&quot; variants.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each player draws a hand of 3 cards, which when played will result in a play result. At the beginning of each half inning, the batting team plays a card for the first batter. The play is then resolved and the player draws a card to bring his hand back to three. The pitching team then plays a card to derive a result for the second batter and draws a card to replace into his hand. Play goes like this until three outs are made.<br/><br/>There are two different types of special cards in the game. Substitute cards, when drawn, are immediately played face up in front of the player drawing them, along with another card drawn from the deck and placed, unseen, on top of it. A player may use the substitute card as a &quot;pinch hitter&quot; or &quot;relief pitcher&quot; in the game when his hand does not have a useful card (i.e. a hit when he is at bat or an out when he is pitching). The substitute card is then flipped over and played.<br/><br/>Wild cards are those which only affect base runners and do not resolve an at bat (e.g. wild pitch, passed ball, stolen base, balk). When one of these cards is played, the result is noted, but then play passes back to the opponent, who will play a card to resolve the at bat.<br/><br/>After every three innings, both players return their hands to the deck, reshuffle the deck, and receive a new hand of three cards. After nine innings, whoever has the most runs is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are many move options: stacks can be split at any level, opponent pieces may be moved, yet a move must always end on another stack. In fact, it is the height of the receiver stack that determines the range of possible moves.<br/><br/>",

There are the fast Hetzer tank destroyers, too. Road to Berlin has both regular army and Waffen SS pieces, including SS cavalry. There are also pieces for the German home-defense militia called out in the last days of the Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>The Red Army of Workers and Peasants is also loaded with powerful weapons: The JS-1 and JS-2 heavy tanks lead the way, but there are also all sorts of vehicles not seen before by Panzer Grenadier fans: T-34/85, T-70 and KV-85 tanks; SU-76, SU-85, SU-100, SU-122, SU-152 and JSU-152 assault guns. There&rsquo;s also 122mm artillery for the first time, and Ba64 armored cars.<br/><br/>Returning to the Panzer Grenadier system are the Soviet Guards, the elite of the Soviet armed forces. They bring the modern weapons of 1944 and 1945 plus rocket launchers and a full array of ground forces. We first debuted these in Heroes of the Soviet Union, which will be retired when the last copies are sold, but this is a much fuller treatment.<br/><br/>Just as Eastern Front includes the Armata Romana, so does Road to Berlin bring the Royal Honvedseg, Hungary&rsquo;s army. The Hungarians have excellent cavalry and a number of Hungarian-made armored vehicles that are, well, less than excellent: Turan and Toldi tanks and Nimrod and Zrinyi assault guns.<br/><br/>As for playing surface, Road to Berlin features eight of the semi-rigid mapboards of the type found in Airborne and Eastern Front. These are new to players of the series, with art by Terry Moore Strickland.<br/><br/>And as will be true for all games in the series, there are plentiful replay opportunity: 75 scenarios drawn from the battles of 1944 and 1945 on the Eastern Front. <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThis game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Arctic Front: Finland's War, 1939-1944 – A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book: Deluxe Edition<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Blue Division<br/>    Campaigns & Commanders: War in the East, 1939-1945 – A Panzer Grenadier Campaign Book<br/>    Edelweiss: A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book<br/>    First Axis: Slovakia at War 1939-1945 – A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book<br/>    Fronte Russo: A Panzer Grenadier Expansion Book<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves – Lithuania's Army<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: North Wind<br/>    Red Warriors<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: War on the Equator<br/>    White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book<br/><br/><br/>",

The world trembled.<br/><br/>Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband's sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity. In the final days of battle to determine the fate of the lands, the hordes of Darkness and the great warband clash on four remaining battle fronts that are each located near a border landmark that separate the kingdoms of the Five Realms.<br/><br/>The last four campaigns wage on. The end is near. May the Maker protect us all....<br/><br/>As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms. Although the great races are currently working together in mutual defense, old habits and rivalries are hard to break and this isn't in any way a co-operative game. It's important that your kind emerges victorious from the war with more battle prestige and honor than your temporary and untrustworthy comrades. The player who collects the most Victory Points of one-upmanship for their race by the conclusion of the final battle against the Darkness &ndash; gained by advancing your soldiers in the warband, earning gold for your army captains, reconnoitering the combat fronts with your scouts, and defeating enemies on the battlefields &ndash; has achieved the greatest leadership glory and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Warband: Against the Darkness is perfectly balanced in the design space between Euro and Ameri-style gameplay, combining strategic depth with an evocative fantasy theme and tense player conflict.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a tabletop miniatures wargame that is based mainly on conflicts between Orks stranded on a dead planet, separated into two factions: those that believe in the god Gork and the others the god Mork; Gorkers and Morkers respectively.<br/><br/>Players design Ork mobs comprised of a small number of warriors and their vehicles. The game uses a unique system of movement for trucks, wartraks and bikes to locate riches and beat up rival mobs. The game allows you to build up your mobs similar to Necromunda but does have more humorous appeal to it. One expansion was produced, Digganob, which added some more factions to the mix including Muties (mutant riders) and Diggas (Ork-obsessed humans), along with additional scenarios and special characters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "History has written the story of Waterloo many different ways, but, in the end, it is always the same story.<br/><br/>This is your opportunity to write something different.<br/><br/>Napol&eacute;on 1815 is the third instalment in The Conquerors, a series devoted to the great strategists of history.  Following on from Napol&eacute;on 1806 and Napol&eacute;on 1807, Napol&eacute;on 1815 brings its own unique challenges to this well-tried and highly acclaimed campaign system.<br/><br/>For up to three players, assume the role of Napoleon, Wellington, or Blucher, making the key decisions that will determine the fate of Europe.  As Napoleon, will you adopt your own version of his &ldquo;strategy of the central position,&rdquo; driving a wedge between the enemy armies and then annihilating each of them in turn?  Or perhaps you will choose a different course, or find that change is forced upon you?<br/><br/>Time is of the essence, for if the armies of Wellington and Blucher do join, the emperor&rsquo;s final throw of the dice is likely to end in defeat.<br/><br/>Napol&eacute;on 1815 is intended for both the seasoned grognard as well as eager young conscripts with a desire to understand how history is made.  A simple but historically faithful set of rules means that all the key aspects of campaigning in the Napoleonic era are present for players to interact with.  Both subtle bluff and the blunt application of massive force will have their place as events unfold.<br/><br/>The history books tell us that Waterloo itself was fought on an overcast day, June 18th, that had been preceded by a night of torrential rain.  Denis Sauvage, born on a Waterloo anniversary nearly two hundred years later, has looked back to that other time, a time when armies gathered and the cannon thundered.  This is a game he was destined to create.  Telling a different story is now up to you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1897 and to celebrate sixty years of the reign of Queen Victoria and bring much needed solace to the Country's weary workers, four seaside resorts vie with each other to be the grandest and most opulent, worthy of a Royal visit from Her Majesty herself. The latest in steam technology will be on display to attract and transport visitors to the hotels and guest houses that line the seafronts. Amusements and monuments will be created to edify and delight the visiting holiday-makers. You, as the designer of these developments must complete your resort first and claim your rightful place as Chief Architect, by Royal Appointment! Help is available from enigmatic and mysterious personages: Donkey-boy, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Madame Ice-cream. They may prove invaluable but are fickle and may aid your opponents, too!<br/><br/>Steam Donkey is a card game that is fun but has depth to its strategic play. You will make decisions about when to take cards into your hand from the resort and whether to build in the Park, Beach or Town area. You, as the Architect will have to choose which characters will be of most use to you each turn and which projects they will help you construct. All for the glory of having the most magnificent resort in the land!<br/><br/>An unusual mechanism in the game is that the reverse of each card is as important as its front. The reverse shows holiday-makers (&quot;the Visitors&quot;) arriving at a railway station complete with suitcases and their mechanical dog. The suitcases are color-coded to show the area of the resort to which the Visitors are destined. This area could be either the Park, the Town or the Beach. After they arrive, these same Visitors may be collected to the player's hand &mdash; but at this juncture the fronts of the cards become the focus of play. The players build amusements, lodgings, monuments and transport within the three areas, and this information is shown on the card fronts together with a point value. In order to build, a player discards a prescribed number of cards of the same type as the card being built. Of course, there is a little more to the game than this...<br/><br/>Four Character cards &mdash; Madame Ice-cream, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Donkey-boy &mdash; are swapped between players to enhance card play, and four Kick-on cards in the advanced game &mdash; The Castle, Mechanical Dog, The Bank, and Feral Donkey &mdash; give the owning player a particular advantage and are retained throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kutuzov is an interactive, play it complete in one-sitting card-driven game of sweeping manoeuvres, epic battles, storied sieges, lethal attrition and crucial-to-win troop morale for one to four players from the designer of The Napoleonic Wars and Wellington.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1812 Emperor Napoleon of France gathered the regiments of 20 nations together into the largest military force yet raised in Europe. That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.<br/><br/>Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.<br/><br/>As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.<br/><br/>110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.<br/><br/>Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.<br/><br/>Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.<br/><br/>The Campaign and the Scenarios:<br/><br/>&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?<br/><br/>&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?<br/><br/>In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. <br/>The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Templar: The Secret Treasures is an exciting family game in which the players help the Knights Templar to get their treasures to a secret abbey and hide them inside. Each player can use the different members of the abbey to help them hide the treasures &ndash; but every character is different and needs to be used wisely. Whoever hides the most treasures wins!<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of ten character cards and a starting supply of treasure: one book, one chalice, and a handful of signet rings that come in three types. A harbor with six storehouses is stocked with additional treasures, and three characters &ndash; Abbot Remigius, Vitus, and Prior Severus &ndash; are placed in the 13-room abbey.<br/><br/>For the first round of the game, each player secretly chooses a character card, then they all reveal them simultaneously, with players then carrying out the actions on those cards in player order. Some characters represent monks who help you move through the abbey and hide treasure, others allow you to take treasure from the harbor, open a locked door while closing off another passage, or move treasure that another player has already stashed, among other things. When a player moves Abbot Remigius, the Abbot rewards all players who have stashed treasure in the room in which he ends his movement, with all of the treasure then being marked as scored &ndash; other than duplicate signet rings, which can score again should the Abbot return. (Vitus, who isn't controlled by a card, follows the Abbot closely to spy upon him, thus keeping the Abbot from returning to the most recent room he entered.) If the Prior Severus is in a room, though, the Abbot can't do his thing as Severus would then discover the treasure and learn of the Knights' actions.<br/><br/>After the initial round, a player must play a character card that doesn't match the top character card on any player's discard pile &ndash; which means that you (and others) play both offense and defense with the same character card, restricting the action of others while ideally making good use of the character yourself. When a player lays down The Bells card, he picks up all of his played cards, then restocks the harbor based on the number of his previously played character card.<br/><br/>When the harbor can no longer be filled properly or when a player has placed at least one treasure in each room, the final round is triggered, then players have a final scoring for their rings still in the abbey and for the number of rooms that hold their treasure. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Write a 3 or 4 on a non-flagged island, then give this board to the player on your left. Remove one of the 18 number cards from the shuffled deck without revealing it.<br/><br/>On a turn, reveal a card, which will show a numeral (1-6) and a number of bridges. Write the numeral on an island that doesn't yet have a numeral, writing on a flagged island only if it has at least one bridge connected to it. Then draw the number of bridges on the card from numbered islands to orthogonally adjacent islands, noting that:<br/><br/><br/>    You can't cross bridges.<br/>    At most two bridges can connect orthogonally adjacent islands.<br/>    The number of bridges connected to an island cannot exceed the numeral on that island.<br/><br/><br/>You can skip one or both parts of this card, if you wish to or are forced to. If the number of bridges touching an island equals the numeral on that island, circle that numeral. If you're the first player to circle all the red-flagged islands, all the blue-flagged islands, or six connected islands of any type, you score a bonus and all other players cross off this bonus; they score only a bonus of lower value if they complete one of these goals on a later turn.<br/><br/>After 17 cards have been revealed and played, players then score 2 points for each circled island in addition to any bonus points. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>To play Hashi solo, you play the same way, but you score bonuses only if you complete goals within a certain number of turns.<br/><br/>",

For the battles in Gringo!, both sides run the gamut from mountain assaults to street-fighting, allowing wargamers to see some of the differences between ACW-era tactics and those of the Napoleonic era. The battles included are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buena Vista, the classic battle of the war, with Zach Taylor's decimated army making a valiant stand against Santa Anna and a force three times Taylor's. <br/>    Monterey, with the North Americans launching a three-pronged assault against, into, and through the beautiful city of Monterey, complete with huge fortifications, high peaks, bull rings, cathedrals filled with ammunition, even a telegraph system. <br/>    Cerro Gordo, Scott's first meeting with Santa Anna, on the dangerous mountain roads leading towards the heart of Mexico. <br/>    El Molino del Rey, where Santa Anna makes a last, well-entrenched stand outside Mexico City. Will that Mexican cavalry division ever move? <br/>    Chapultepec, a mini-battle, in which the gringos have to scale the precipitous heights of this immense fortress guarding the roads into the Mexican capital. &quot;Stonewall&quot; (pre-nickname) Jackson, hidden mines, wall-scaling, and those courageous Mexican pre-teen cadets. <br/><br/><br/>The wargame rules are simplier (GBACW v4.3) with reduced command rules (for the smaller armies); they also include extensive rules for street-fighting and the square formation. The game includes some of the most colorful characters in military history: General Zachary Taylor &amp; inept division leaders Twiggs &amp; Pillow for the Americans; head throwing General Pedro Ampudia and Generalissimo Antonio de Santa Anna.<br/><br/>Gringo! is easily the most playable, colorful and challenging of the GBACW series wargames to date. 2 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (1-backprinted), 4 countersheets, plus the usual rules and charts.<br/><br/>Time Scale: 60 minutes per game turn<br/>Map Scale: between 45-125 yards per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Each Strength Point = 50 men<br/>Players: 1-6<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Battle of Churubusco<br/>    Battles with the Gringos, Mexico 1846-62<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fluttering Souls is a captivating, beautifully illustrated two-player game based on the Japanese legend of The White Butterfly. You will compete to collect a kaleidoscope of butterflies in the hope of being visited by The White Butterfly; the soul of a lost loved one.<br/><br/>Legend of the White Butterfly<br/>Many years ago an apprentice merchant named Takahama fell hopelessly in love with a woman named Akiko. They became engaged, but, tragically, Akiko died before they could be wed. <br/>Takahama was distraught. He had built a life and a successful career, but he could not bear to be away from his love. Such was his dedication to Akiko that he abandoned his trade and gave his life to the upkeep of the cemetery where she was buried. <br/>For 50 years Takahama visited Akiko&rsquo;s grave every day with a single pure white rose. One day, Takahama fell so ill he could not go outside. Fearing he may die, his sister and niece came to care for him. While he lay there, unable to move, a butterfly of the purest white landed gently on his pillow. Annoyed, Takahama&rsquo;s niece tried to shoo the butterfly, but it would not stray from the pillow of the dying man. <br/>As Takahama&rsquo;s final breath left his body, so the butterfly flew to the grave of Akiko and disappeared. White butterflies are believed to be the visiting souls of loved ones. Worried that Takahama had not visited her grave that day; Akiko looked over him and did not leave until his soul had joined hers.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Fluttering Souls is a 2 player game, made up of 3 - 5 rounds. In each round players take turns collecting butterflies to earn victory points, either in a set or by themselves. The player that collects the most victory points at the end of a round is awarded a White Butterfly Token; a visit from a lost loved one. The first player to collect 3 White Butterfly Tokens is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Twelve Doctors is an unauthorised, non-profit and non-collectable card game set within the immensely popular Doctor Who universe.<br/><br/>Consisting of two balanced 60-card decks, the game pits two players against each other for the fate of the galaxy. One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.<br/><br/>At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.<br/><br/>The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.<br/><br/>The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.<br/>     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.<br/>     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.<br/>     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).<br/>     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.<br/>     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.<br/>     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.<br/>     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).<br/><br/><br/>",

Roberts Award-winning design team of Wes Erni and Ben Madison at Victory Point Games, is a solitaire States of SiegeTM game where you represent the two largest pre-Columbian Indian &ldquo;mound builder&rdquo; cultures that dominated eastern North America from before the time of Christ until the coming of the European colonists in the 17th century. Your empire represents the earlier Hopewell culture and the later Mississippian culture that derived from it.<br/><br/>Until the arrival of the Spanish late in the game, you will expand your control across the map of North America, extending it over the various chiefdoms encountered and incorporating them into your economic and religious sphere (&ldquo;empire&rdquo;). Your domain will grow and shrink, but be aware that rather than a military advance and retreat, this process represents the rise and decline of culture, religious ideology, and an economic way of life, threatened from outside by competing ideologies and lifestyles as much as by hostile armies.<br/><br/>Your goal is to extend Mound Builder culture and amass as many chiefdoms as possible before rival native powers (and the smallpox-ridden Spanish!) rise up to drive you back to your Mississippi River heartland and extinguish your vast capital city at Cahokia, Illinois &ndash; near modern St. Louis.<br/><br/>",

As the player, you will be presented with choice after choice that will set the course of the game. You will feel responsible for both your losses and your victories. Are you ready to make a dustrun?<br/><br/>You will begin the game by constructing a vehicle for your dustrun by combining cards to create the perfect mix. You will then equip your vehicle with modifications to produce the perfect dustrunner.<br/><br/>In Dustrunner you will be using the core mechanic of drawing two cards face-down and picking one to reveal. You may decide to resolve the first card and discard the second without looking at it, or you may pass on the first, but must then resolve the second. This mechanic is great at creating tension and choice. Enemy cards drawn as the 2nd card have more health, making passing on a raider as a first card all the bit more scary.<br/><br/>There is only one way to win Dustrunner, and that is to reach your base before either the raiders catch you, or you lose all your health. Dustrunner is not a beat your own score game. You either reach the base and win, or you lose. However, there is a scoring system in place for folks who do like to see how well they did.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>ドイス (Dois) is a trick-taking card game from Japan. Dois means two in Portuguese, and in the game there are two decks, one for numbers and one for 4 suits. The decks are shuffled together and players are dealt a hand of 13 cards from the mix. You need at least 3 suit cards and 3 number cards in your hand to begin. Then players play a trick-taking game with trumps, after first predicting how many tricks they will win.<br/><br/>The first play is two cards, a number and suit card. After that, you play one card, a number or a suit card, so that your other card still shows. In this way, you play out 12 tricks and score plus or minus points depending on your prediction. It is recommended to play out 8 games of Dois to get a balanced match.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>&quot;ランクとスートを分けた全く新しいトリックテイキングゲームです。<br/>それぞれのカードを1枚ずつ2枚使い1枚のカードを作り、最初のトリックを行います。2回目以降のトリックはどちらか片方を書き換えて行います。<br/><br/>事前に自分の取れるトリック数を予想してその通りにトリックをとれれば点数が入り、8ディールが終了した時点で最も点数の高いプレイヤーが勝利します。&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a large town in medieval China, several talented artisans &ndash; Masters in their own right &ndash; aspire to become recognized as Zong Shi: the Grand Master craftsman. You are one of these master artisans and together with your apprentice, you are competing with the other Masters to attain this elevated status in the town. To succeed, you'll have to impress the townspeople with your skills. How shall you do it? Will you acquire a specialist's mastery over certain material, or will you enlarge your workshop? Will you create a large number of smaller projects or will you build fewer, but greater, masterworks? That is for you to decide.<br/><br/>Zong Shi blends worker placement, resource management, project completion and special action cards. To set up the game, lay out the project cards (eight types, each with a special power) and masterwork projects (only three at a time) on the game board; draw goods randomly for the two markets; lay out the exchange tiles in the pawn shop; and lay out a certain number of Scrolls of Fortune and material tiles. Players take turns drafting Scrolls (which have one-shot abilities) and materials (needed to complete projects), then the first round begins.<br/><br/>In each round, players take one action with their master or apprentice, then take one action with their other figure. The possible actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Begin a project &ndash; Master only. Pay the material cost, then place the master on the time track in the space shown on the project.<br/>    Go to the market &ndash; Hang out and shoot the breeze until the next phase.<br/>    Go to the temple &ndash; Draw one Scroll (or more if your master is at the temple and donates material).<br/>    Go to the pawn shop &ndash; Choose an exchange tile in the shop and place the exchange tile on your player board. You may then swap one material shown on that tile for the other material on the tile.<br/>    Pay respectful visits &ndash; Visit a townsperson, donate materials of the right type equal to the visit tile you place there, then take the special action associated with that person this game.<br/>    Pass<br/><br/><br/>Those in the market then take turns choosing materials located there. You can hold no more than five materials. Players then advance their master on the time track to represent work on the project. Refill materials in the market, pass the start marker, then begin a new round.<br/><br/>When a player completes his sixth project, players complete that round and one additional full round. Players tally points for completed projects, incomplete projects (which are penalized), number of townspeople visited, a full board of exchange tiles, completion of six projects and unused scrolls and material. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Belote is probably the most played game in France, essentially by adults (youngsters will probably play the &quot;coinche&quot; variant or Tarot during high school).<br/><br/>It has been known since around 1930 in France, and is played as a family game or as a gambling game (even if the latter has been prohibited in bistros).<br/>A 32-card deck is needed (that means a poker deck without cards 2 &ndash; 6 and without jokers). <br/>Belote is a point-trick taking game for 4 players.<br/><br/>Players forms teams of 2. Partners sit at opposite seats.<br/>The dealer gives everybody 3 cards face down, then 2.<br/>After that, the first card of the deck is turned face up. Its suit will serve as trumps.<br/>Then, each player announces whether they will take this card or not. If a player takes it, they receive the face-up card. Then the dealer deals 3 cards to everyone except the taker, who receives only two. That makes for 8 cards for everyone.<br/>If no player takes the card, we take another round were each player announces if they take the card, but also announce the suit that will serve as trumps if they do (instead of the suit of the face-up card).<br/><br/>After that, it is similar to Tarot: First player plays a card, then each player can play a card of the same suit or a trump. If you can't play the led suit, you have to play a trump. If your partner wins the &quot;pli&quot; (trick), you don't have to play a trump.<br/>When 8 &quot;plis&quot; have been played (when no one has cards in their hand), points are counted. The team with the most points win.<br/><br/>Point values for the cards each partnership has taken in tricks:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Trump suit <br/><br/>         Point Value<br/><br/>         Other suits<br/><br/>         Point Value <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         J <br/><br/>         20<br/><br/>         A<br/><br/>         11<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         9<br/><br/>         14<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         A<br/><br/>         11<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         10<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>         Q<br/><br/>         3<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         K<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>         J<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Q<br/><br/>         3<br/><br/>         9<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         8<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>         8<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         7<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>         7<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>     La coinche (belote coinch&eacute;e, belote bridg&eacute;e) in which everyone is dealt all the cards and player bids the number of points they're going to make. The highest bid plays first. This has become the &quot;standard&quot; version in France these days.<br/>     La belote de comptoir is more rapid than belote, and involves heavy alcohol drinking for all players.<br/>     La belote d&eacute;couverte is a variant for 2 players, used essentially to teach the game to a new player.<br/>     Klabberjass (a.k.a.

        "description": "2 Minutes to Midnight is a fresh design exploring the cold war in 5-year turns starting in 1946 and running for 9 turns to 1990.<br/><br/>Living clarifications / errata here: Errata / Clarifications Living Post<br/><br/>The scale and depth of the game is unmatched by any other game on the market for this historical period &ndash; this is a detailed simulation of the cold war covering military, economics, politics, and trade, all in a playable package that hides the complexity and lets you focus on the strategy.<br/>A scenario runs 1-3 hours up to 6-7 hours for the full campaign game.<br/><br/>The game is highly asymmetrical - the US has presidential elections &amp; national debt to worry about, while the Soviets must try to achieve their 5-year plan and navigate freedom (or lack thereof) within the Soviet Union itself, with the risk of the whole Communist system coming crashing down if you reform too quickly.<br/><br/>The primary resource is money, which can be used to:<br/>&bull;    Influence a country, marking it as pro-US or pro-USSR or changing its government type (Communist, Democratic or Authoritarian).<br/>&bull;    Invest and create trade opportunities, improving the economy.<br/>&bull;    Recruit spies<br/>&bull;    Research technology<br/>&bull;    Strengthen strategic forces (ICBM, SLBM, Stealth bombers)<br/>&bull;    Deploy armies into civil wars or proxy wars or send arms &amp; advisors..<br/>&bull;    Calm down an angry populace (and the Russians can apply the KGB for this purpose as well)<br/><br/>The deck also contains around a dozen events per turn which, when pulled, may trigger - or may not - some of those that do not trigger go back into the deck for next turn and some are gone forever. This means that you aren't quite sure what's going to happen in each game &ndash; you can&rsquo;t load a particular country because you know something is going to happen, because there are very few fixed events. The point of the events is to add friction - you&rsquo;re never in complete control and will have to react to changing events.<br/><br/>Technology is represented by a technology tree including nuclear weapons, the space race, armed forces, computing and industry and for the Soviets agricultural progress.<br/><br/>Military is covered in three areas - nuclear, which prevents aggression against your nation; Conventional - which gives options to be more aggressive; Navy - boosting intelligence gathering and ability to invade from the sea, as well as hunting enemy strategic missile submarines.<br/><br/>Spies are deployed by players to try and instigate coups or stamp them out, and for the Soviets to infiltrate and steal western technology. CIA will be busy security those secrets and keeping advanced trade items away from the Soviets.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is an intelligence track - a high intel capability from U2 spy planes, satellites or submarines gives more ability to influence the events as they come out and react quicker than your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game is designed for use with 25mm or 15mm scale miniatures. The game has a flexible integrated game sequence, minimal record keeping and a brilliant system of distinguishing troop quality. The game encourages the players to think tactically.

        "description": "In the heart of the sleeping city, there lies incredible wealth. The city gates are well guarded, but no one is watching what&rsquo;s under their feet. The dead of night provides just enough cover for you to tunnel your way to untold riches and plunder the city from within. But you must act quickly, because a rival thief has the same plan.<br/><br/>In Prowler&rsquo;s Passage, you and your rival burrow into the city through a network of underground passages to grab valuable items while attempting to gain control of key districts. Steal the best items, create the longest passages, and control districts to become the premier prowler!<br/><br/>On your turn, you must (1) place a passage, then (2) collect the tile where you placed your passage, and (3) move control markers for the districts adjacent to that passage. The tile you collect will either be an item tile, which are scored in sets during each scoring phase, or a shovel tile, which allows you to move control markers further. You might also steal statues and/or complete achievements on your turn.<br/><br/>Scoring occurs twice during the game. In each scoring phase, players gain wealth in these 5 categories:<br/><br/>    PASSAGES: Gain 2 wealth for each section in your longest continuous passage.<br/>    STATUES: Gain 1 wealth for each statue you have stolen.<br/>    ITEMS: For each set of items of the same type that you have, you gain wealth. The bigger the set, the more wealth.<br/>    DISTRICTS: For each district you control (i.e., for which the control marker is on your side of the control track), you gain that district reward.<br/>    ACHIEVEMENTS: Gain wealth for the achievements you have claimed. (Final scoring phase only.)<br/><br/><br/>",

Four-page rules folder, map, and 120 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>The Soviets have a massive strength advantage but their heaviest units can't be used north of the arctic circle and all Soviet units must be able to trace a supply line back to Leningrad at all times. Finnish units don't need supply in Finland, they have the advantage of prepared defenses south of the arctic circle, and Finnish units have higher mobility than Soviet units.<br/><br/>The Russians have to successfully invade Finland and take objective cities to win. The Finns simply have to hold out for ten turns.<br/><br/>Playable as a game rather than just as a simulation, unlike many later SPI offerings.<br/><br/>Two games in one. The base game favors an experienced Soviet player, who will often break through the Mannerheim line in a fairly historical manner around turns 7-9. The optional special events, depending on which are rolled, tend to favor the Finns, sometimes reducing the number of turns to just 5, placing tremendous time pressure on the Soviets.  Play the base game several times before adding the optional &quot;What-if&quot; events.<br/><br/>",

You were instantly reminded of the shadow operative who had slipped through the fingers of some of The Rigel Group's best agents. Now it's your chance to catch this criminal before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>As a master agent of the elite global task force, The Rigel Group, you expertly hunt down cunning spies and deadly double agents. You&rsquo;ll need to use your wits, local intel and tools of the trade to lure the spy into your trap. Just be sure you&rsquo;re the predator, and not the prey! This isn't just any spy; one false move could end your mission... permanently.<br/><br/>Harsh Shadows is a solitaire game of espionage. To set up, place nine location cards in a 3x3 grid, then place discovery cards under each location. Place three file cards near the locations, then place case cards under each file. Place decks for arrow cards and additional discovery cards nearby, along with two agent tool cards. The spy and agent cards start in different locations.<br/><br/>You are the agent and go first, moving to an adjacent location and revealing a discovery card, which could be an item, clue, or bomb; item and clue cards go in hand, while bombs force you to discard. You can use a location's special ability and clues to reveal case cards under files. You might be able to place a tracking bug on the spy.<br/><br/>For the spy's turn, the arrow cards move the spy to an adjacent location, where a new discovery card is placed at random. If the spy moves to your location, discard a card. If you can't discard a card or discover you've discarded an item matching a case card, you lose immediately.<br/><br/>When the discovery deck is empty, the spy attempts to escape. You must have placed a tracking bug on the spy, have the three item cards in hand matching the case cards, and make it to the spy's current location before the spy escapes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whether you're a nameless Dark Lord looking to conquer the known world, a Champion of Light holding out against the forces of evil or a Northern barbarian facing claimants to a stolen throne, Dragon Rampant allows you to bring those battles to the tabletop.<br/><br/>Developed from the popular Lion Rampant system, Dragon Rampant is a standalone wargame that recreates the great battles of Fantasy fiction. Scenarios, army lists, and full rules for magic and monsters give players the opportunity to command unruly orc warbands, raise armies of the undead, campaign across an antediluvian world as the warchief of a barbarian tribe, or exploit the power of mighty creatures and extraordinary sorcery.<br/><br/>An army usually consists of 6-8 units comprised of 6-12 individually based figures. These small units move and fight independently, assuming that they follow your orders rather than just doing their own thing. Command and control is just as important on the battlefield as the power of a troll chieftain or the magic of an archmage.<br/><br/>",

Each round you place one of your limited number of Kachina tiles, trying to dominate the largest possible area of the board.<br/><br/>In the Hopi tradition, the world is ruled by kachinas (or spirits) of many different types. Children of the tribe learn about these different spirits through the use of Kachina dolls. To illustrate the tension of different spirits in the world, the tribal elders create games of kachinas vying for dominance. Will the Eagle soar above the Ogre? Will the Clown humiliate the Chief to nothingness? Or maybe the Sun God outshines all in its radiance?<br/><br/>You'll have to plan ahead and use your Kachina tiles to best effect to outscore your opponents in this very strategic tile game. You build the board as you go, so no two games are alike. Each type of tile has a different ability. Can you predict what your fellow players will do and guide your Kachina to dominance?<br/><br/>Reimplemented as<br/><br/>    Völuspá<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Goths are marching on Rome! In Gaul, Vandals and Alans pour across the Rhine. Meanwhile, a usurper from distant Britannia has raised his standard. The survival of the Western Empire depends on one man: Flavius Stilicho, barbarian general, commander-in-chief of the armies of Rome, and defacto ruler of the West.<br/><br/>STILICHO: LAST OF THE ROMANS is the long-anticipated follow-up to designer Robert DeLeskie's popular and challenging solitaire game WARS OF MARCUS AURELIUS. The brain-boiling card angst and nail-biting combats that made that game so compelling are back, along with some new wrinkles that make for a more challenging and nuanced decision space. For example, the Surge mechanism that caused so many gamers to invent new curse words is now more nefarious, with each enemy card having specific surge effects. Rome's enemies sometimes bump into each other, resulting in enemy-on-enemy battles. Regions might go into revolt, garrisons might defect to the banner of the pretender Constantine III, and the wily courtier Olympius might turn the emperor Honorius against you.<br/><br/>No wonder the historical Stilicho only lasted until turn 3! If you want to win, you'll have to last much longer than that, all while taking on tougher and more resilient enemies than poor Marcus had to face, and with less resources at your disposal. Will you prevent the sack of Rome and the fall of the Western Empire?<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The first player of the round lays a card in the center of the table, makes the noise, then points at another player, saying &quot;Ha!&quot; That player must add a card, repeat both sounds in order, then choose someone other than the player who chose him.

(2) A player adds his third card to the pile and correctly repeats all the sounds, ending with &quot;Ouga Bouga!&quot; As a reward, he distributes the cards in the center, as well as any penalty cards previously collected, among all the players.<br/><br/>After a round ends, every player refills his hand to three cards and another round begins.

As part of an ancient tradition, apprentices gather around a fire to drink a strong mushroom potion. The Shaman's quarters are warm and comfortable. The fire burns in the middle of the hut. Smoke moves through a hole in the roof. The sun will set soon.<br/><br/>The Shaman and each apprentice drink from the bowl simmering near the fire. The taste, bitter and revolting. The Shaman's assistant does not drink; he stands calmly beside her. The assistant is invisible. Adorned in animal skins and strange ornaments, the Shaman begins to guide the ritual. A drum is tapped with elderly fingers, creating a primitive disjointed rhythm. The weathered drum is played for some time, then stops abruptly. The Shaman looks about the room. She looks up to the ceiling, observing the smoke escaping into the sky.<br/><br/>&quot;The plants now speak to us.&quot;<br/><br/>In the adventure board game The Mushroom Eaters, 2-5 players are apprentices who have consumed a drink of the psilocybin mushroom. Each player enters into a psychedelic state together. The Shaman is guiding and observing the group, trying to understand who would be the wisest to replace her. While the group travels together, some may wander into faraway realms of their own mind, but when the mushroom wears off everyone will return. The wisest apprentice is chosen to guide the village in the future.<br/><br/>This is the first game in a series to incorporate an &quot;Action Path&quot;. Each player uses a hand of cards to help the group advance along this path. If cards are played correctly, the path may help the individual or the group entirely; if cards are played poorly, the entire group could be affected by the changes in the environment. Players aim to gain Experience by awakening to new understandings, centering one's self in the oblivion of the moment, gaining intense realities witnessed in the Great Paradox, and building wisdom from profound revelations.<br/><br/>",

With one map and a limited number of counters it's an excellent introduction to the series.<br/><br/>August 29, 1756: The Seven Years War erupts in Europe. The Prussian army led by King Frederick II (later &quot;the Great&quot; to his admirers) invades Saxony. &quot;Blitzing&quot; through the neutral Saxon electorate he hopes to open a path to Austria&rsquo;s rich Elbe River valley in Bohemia. The Saxon army does not directly resist the invaders but withdraws into a fortified encampment on the Elbe River around Pirna, there awaiting rescue by the Austrians. The Prussian invasion grinds to a halt here; Frederick has no choice but to lay siege. Meanwhile in northern Bohemia, the Austrian army under Field Marshal Browne gathers its strength in preparation for the relief of its new ally.<br/><br/>Retaining the initiative King Frederick split his army, leaving half to keep the Saxons penned in Pirna, while he marches with the rest into Bohemia in search of the Austrians. On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River. A close fought, ten hour struggle ensues, with charge and counter-charges made across fog masked fields, hills and vineyards before culminating in a street fight amidst burning buildings. Finally, at darkness, the Austrians withdraw in good order, conceding the field.<br/><br/>Although a small battle by Seven Years War standards, the action at Lobositz was significant for having delayed the Austrian relief effort enough to force the Saxon surrender at Pirna. Of greater significance, the Prussians learned that their enemy &ldquo;was no longer the same old Austrians&rdquo; they had previously faced, and a quick victory could not be expected. Lobositz would be the first of many battles in a war to last seven bloody years.<br/><br/>(source: the Clash of arms Website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ark &amp; Noah &ndash; originally shown under the name Diluvium &ndash; is a game of strategy in which players must not only compete for points, but must also work together to build and load the Ark. Everyone shares the task of saving the animals, but in the end there can be only one winner!<br/><br/>In the game, the players are Noah and his sons, and they must find the animal couples and load them on the Ark before the Flood starts. In each round, they will choose which action they will take: Searching for Animals; Collecting Wood, Food or Pitch; Building Corrals in their color; or Loading Animals on the Ark. This choice also determines the round order for the next turn. Players score points by loading animals in the right corrals, possibly in the player's color. Thus, in each round there is a strategical phase (choose action) and a tactical phase (execute action).<br/><br/>",

Five... Four... Three...<br/><br/>The Thing is an unauthorised non-collectable, non-profit game for two to six players, based on the 1982 horror movie masterpiece &quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&quot;, and simulates the paranoid members of an American Antarctic research facility (Outpost 31) being overrun by - or conquering - a parasitic alien organism capable of perfectly imitating its victims. One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.<br/><br/>The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.<br/><br/>The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.<br/><br/>During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.<br/><br/>     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.<br/>     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.<br/><br/><br/>2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer.<br/>3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed.<br/>4. The Outpost #31 team win if the survivors manage to fly to the coast in the helicopter.<br/>5. The Outpost #31 team win if they contact McMurdo base by radio.<br/><br/>Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.<br/><br/>You can find the game here: The THING Card Game now Available!<br/>You can explore the rules here: THING Rulebook<br/>And you can discover the deck guide here: Visual THING Deck Guide<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     The Things<br/>     The Thing: Man Is the Warmest Place To Hide<br/><br/><br/>",

You are American rail luminaries, creating small independent lines to serve local cities. Plying your business acumen, you plan to sell these lines to larger companies. Of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t be where you are today without knowing a thing or two about turning tricky situations to your advantage: You have a scheme in mind to get the big companies what they need, without necessarily having, shall we say, exclusive ownership of it&hellip;.<br/><br/>20th Century Limited condenses the history the American railroad into a sixty-minute game. Players take on the roles of the great railway robber barons as they set up small railroads, turn them into larger rail lines, then sell them off and start all over again. The spread of the North American rail system can happen on your game table in about an hour as the network develops in a fashion similar to the historical model.<br/><br/>The game possesses the simple route-building mechanisms that were used in Transamerica. The placement of pieces is easy to understand, and this simple feature is livened up by the Rail Line cards that dictate the placement of rail segments to recreate the various historical railways of America. The second piece of the puzzle are the Demand cards that serve as a pseudo pick-up-and-deliver system. Players are able to choose what path suits them in the game. You can go for the fulfillment of demands or you can try to build the great rail lines that shaped America. Everything from the Santa Fe to Boston &amp; Maine and many other memorable lines are represented, including the game's namesake: the New York Central Railroad.<br/><br/>",

Buy ingredients in the market, get flour by visiting the mill, bake your bread in the Feudal Lord&rsquo;s oven and try to sell it in nearby villages. Satisfy the demand with high quality bread and improve your reputation to prosper and emerge victorious. Face the difficulties of the harsh medieval life, in which only a few peasants escaped the servile dependence of the Feudal Lord.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the medieval region of the Duchy of Schwaben during the year 1276, in the domains of Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg and under the watchful eye of the Inquisition. The historical base of the game has been verified in ancient documents and history books, and its mechanics are based on readings from original literature of that time. Explore this enigmatic period hidden under layers of mud and ash, and discover the real day to day of the period&rsquo;s peasants.<br/><br/>Pandemain: Traditional Farmers' Bread is played in turns. Each player starts with four workers and they can get another one if certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>There are 5 game rounds divided in 4 phases each, with a variable element at the end of the game. In the game, some actions that are chosen by the players (worker placement), and all actions will lead to the selling of the bread they bake in the nearest villages or to the Feudal Lord, which additionally gives you favors (set collection). Each type of bread is sold at a different price and have different point values. The players must collect the correct ingredients for each recipe, bake high quality or low quality bread and sell it, for which they will receive the gratitude from the villages (set collection), allowing them to make extra actions and receive extra points. The players can hire and improve their master bakers (set collection), which allows them to bake the highest quality bread, provide benefits, and increase their reputation. Cows, oxen and wagons add some variability when the players go to acquire the ingredients.<br/><br/>The Inquisition is also relevant: the players will make donations to the church, which gives them influence to avoid losing points each round and, in return they will give some benefits and points. And not only that, the church also controls the turn order.<br/><br/>What changes every round?<br/>- Bread demand in each village<br/>- Flour available in the market<br/>- Feudal Lord's servant position<br/>- Inquisition advance<br/><br/>What changes every game?<br/>- Available master bakers<br/>- Villagers in the villages<br/>- Feudal Lord's favors<br/>- Benefits when donating to the church<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a real-time, roll-and-write game, where the frantic action around the table mimics the kick-arse fighting action in the game-world! Set in the world of Vengeance and designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi, Noralie Lubbers and Gordon Calleja, Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a stand-along game that transforms the fast-paced dice puzzles of the original Vengeance into roll-and-write mechanics where you&rsquo;re building combos, striking off enemies and scoring points for an action-packed, brain-teasing fighting game that&rsquo;s easy to learn and hard to master.<br/><br/>The aim of Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is to infiltrate a gang den, carve your way through it&rsquo;s rooms and killing the Boss, while completing side objectives printed on the dens themselves.<br/><br/>The game is split into three parts: planning, fighting and montage. In the planning phase players roll and re-roll 4 dice in real time, aiming to roll a combination of dice that match an ability they wish to trigger in the upcoming, fight phase. Assigning dice to an ability allows players to fill their hand back to 4 dice from a large, common pool and repeat the process as quickly as they can manage.<br/><br/>Once the dice pool is depleted, the fighting proper begins. Here players take a set of dice assigned to an ability and execute that ability, moving their piece through rooms full of enemies, and crossing them out when they are hit with the multitude of available abilities. Finally, players heal and upgrade their characters, bring new abilities and items into play to help them on their road to vengeance.<br/><br/>Vengeance: Roll and Fight comes in two boxes: Episode 1 and Episode 2. Both episodes are stand-alone games with the same rules, but with entirely different content: different heroes, dens, bosses, abilities and items.  Each episode accommodates up to 4 players so combining the two increases the player count from 1-4 to 1-8! Content in both Episodes can be switched like-for-like as you choose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).<br/><br/>1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.<br/><br/>Companies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.<br/><br/>The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.<br/><br/>",

It focuses on the efforts of the Imperial Russian navy in its struggles against the navies of Sweden in the Baltic and Turkey in the Black and Mediterranean seas from 1770 to 1807.<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, this volume is completely independent of -- but fully compatible with -- the other volumes in the series. Nothing else is needed to play!<br/><br/>This volume comes with an updated and expanded rule book that adds additional detail specific to the navies included herein. Particularly the introduction of explosive shells, fired from the mighty Russian &quot;edinerogs&quot; (or &quot;unicorns&quot;).<br/><br/>Included are a baker's dozen of battles pitting the Imperial Russian Navy against those of Sweden and Turkey. Each battle is fought by two players (or two teams of players) across one or several conjoined maps depicting shallows and shoals with individually named vessels that have been specifically rated for their abilities in combat.<br/><br/>Players activate these ships through the command abilities of individually rated admirals present at each battle (including the mercenary adventurer and American naval icon: John Paul Jones). Players may also easily create their own scenarios with &quot;design your own&quot; rules and even pit these fleets against those from other volumes in the Flying Colors series. The command system provides an excellent solitaire experience as well.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>    Three 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color maps<br/>    Two countersheets<br/>    Rulebook<br/>    Playbook<br/>    Two Player Aid Cards<br/><br/><br/>Time Scale:   5 to 10 minutes<br/>Map Scale:   100 meters per hex<br/>Unit Scale:   One ship per counter<br/>Players:   1-4<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

These precious metals are delivered by your merchant ship for Victory Points at the Temple, one of the seven locations you'll be visiting in Ophir.<br/><br/>To afford these precious building materials, you must navigate the region's seas against your rivals to collect goods to fulfill the demand at the Market for Coins, or exchange them for Favor at the Temple.<br/><br/>Well-timed trades, efficient cargo storage, and tactical transportation will be the keys to your success. But you must be swift in your travels, because the game ends immediately once the construction of the Temple is complete.

By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte brought all of Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy of every government then in existence.<br/><br/>To restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw and pledged to remain at war against France until the Corsican usurper was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored. For the next ten years, the fate of the French Empire rested on the on the abilities of the man: as a warrior and as a peacemaker.<br/><br/>Now YOU command Napoleon's Grand Armee! From the autumn of 1805 through the climactic summer of 1815, the entire ten-year conflict between France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain, is re-created in ten separate scenarios. Each historical scenario is presented as a separate two-player game with an average playing time of 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>&quot;War and Peace&quot;, Mark McLaughlin's classic wargame on Napoleonic conquest, is here revitalized and enhanced with completely updated graphics and production, and a completely revamped rulebook that incorporates all known errata, additional scenarios, and all official variants and optional rules. What you get with this new version is all of the Napoleonic Campaigns in one box, plus a newly revised Grand Campaign Game, with an all-new map, components, modern artwork, and greatly updated rules with new optional rules for chrome and increased emphasis on the Operational Arts.<br/><br/>The thirteen scenarios (not including the Grand Campaign Game) are as follows:<br/>I. THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1796-97<br/>II. THE ARMY OF THE ORIENT: BONAPARTE IN EGYPT 1798-99<br/>III. MARENGO &ndash; THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1800<br/>IV. THE SUN OF AUSTERLITZ - 1805<br/>V. NAPOLEON&rsquo;S APOGEE: 1806-1807<br/>VI. WAGRAM - 1809<br/>VII. THE CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA - 1812<br/>VIII. STRUGGLE OF NATIONS &ndash; 1813<br/>IX. NAPOLEON AT BAY &ndash; 1814<br/>X. THE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN - 1815<br/>XI. THE PENINSULAR WAR<br/>XII. SPAIN: 1811-1814<br/>XIII. THE FINAL GLORY (Linking 1812, 1813, and 1814)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's long past bedtime, but they sneaked out of the wizards' school to visit the secret midnight market and see the flying brooms and talking cats they heard the grown-ups talk about. Unfortunately they don't get far for while crossing the forest near the wizards' school, Willy the Warden Ghost takes up their trail. Now they have to double back quickly or they are facing detention. But the forest is too dark to find the way back without help. Luckily they have an idea: The Lumies, magical glowing creatures that live in the forest, can light their way back to the school. The wizard students need to stick together to find the Lumies and make it back to the school before Willy catches one of them.<br/><br/>While escaping the Warden Ghost in Wizardry to the power of three, players need to work together, memorize the tree tiles, and use their magic potions and dice enchantments at the right time to make it back without being caught and win as a team.<br/><br/>",

The game went on to win the Best Strategic Card Game Award at the UK Games Expo 2013, along with Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles players use hands of 6 units, drawn from their total 'army' of 36 cards, playing one card per turn at the start of their turn.<br/><br/>Cards have unique formations of Attack Arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played, and the damage they will do. Some cards also have Ranged Attack values. Each card then has a Defence value which, when exceeded by attacking cards, sees that card defeated.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from their army deck to return their hand back up to 6 or retreat a unit that has not engaged in combat during that turn.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.<br/><br/>These factions are differentiated by their exclusive cards and strategies; the Dwarf faction plays more defensively, using some Ranged cards and powerful Berserker units to pick-off assailants, while the Orc army encourages players to attack more vigorously, often committing kamikaze moves to their tactical advantage.<br/><br/>Orcs versus Dwarves is cross-compatible with Elves versus Lizardmen, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict Ranking System, to create Mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Broadsides and Boarding Parties was the first title in Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series of games.  It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.<br/><br/>The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.<br/><br/>The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.<br/><br/><br/>Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally released by Fata Morgana in the 1980s, KREMLIN is a European-style boardgame where players compete to control the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The Jolly Roger KREMLIN features updated art and better components created in the style of 1930s Soviet poster propaganda. This edition has an error on the board that has the name of the game covering part of the graphics and text on the board.<br/><br/>Kremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.<br/><br/>Each turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chiefs tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.<br/><br/>The catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!<br/><br/>Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.<br/><br/>Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.<br/><br/>The turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.<br/><br/>The Jolly Roger version provides three different KREMLIN games in one box.<br/><br/><br/>     The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/>     A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game.<br/>     A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/><br/>",

German troops pour deep into Russia as you husband your forces to blunt the most dangerous attacks, giving up ground grudgingly as you pray for the early onset of Winter. Snow brings respite and fresh forces. But, the relief is short lived as the warm weather of 1942 brings new challenges. A rejuvenated German Army, a shadow of the initial invasion force, is still a force to be reckoned with! Unable to attack everywhere, the German will marshal his panzers and push where he feels success will bring decisive victory. Can you stop him!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Russia Besieged is a multi-layered game experience that includes not only pushing counters on the map, players must also take into account their side&rsquo;s War Economy. The Russian player must deal with production of troops and oil to rebuild depleted forces while the German is on a constant struggle with replacement points to rebuild a proper mix of units to defeat the Red Horde!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Can you do better than the historical counterparts? Play the game and challenge yourself!<br/><br/>",

The hunter wants to see those cute dragons dead, but must get past the dragon keepers. The keepers belong to different tribes but together they have the common goal of protecting the dragons. The keepers use magic in their duels with the evil hunter.<br/><br/>Dragon Keepers was designed by Vital Lacerda and his youngest daughter, Catarina. Says Vital, &quot;She is the one who knows a lot about dragons and I could have never been able to do this design without her.&quot; Dragon Keepers has two different games in the box:<br/><br/>KEEPER GAME: 3&ndash;6 players | 10&ndash;15 minutes | ages 6+<br/>In this competitive mode, the hunter rolls dice to attack the dragons and the players choose which of the attacked dragons they want to defend. The game ends when one player manages to heroically defend three different dragons or if one dragon gets three hits. The winner is the player with more successful defenses.<br/><br/>DRAGON GAME: 2&ndash;4 players | 20&ndash;40 minutes | ages 9+<br/>In this cooperative mode, the keepers work together to defend and train the dragons so that they attack the hunter. Players can take four different actions: Defend, Cure, Train and Attack. Those actions are limited and they need to cooperate and organized as a group to manage to stop the hunter's attacks during the game. The players lose if a dragon is killed by the hunter, or if the battle event deck runs out. The players win if X dragons (where X is determined by the difficulty level) manage to successfully attack the hunter.<br/><br/>",

One can never know what is hiding inside.&quot;<br/><br/>- Adolf Hitler, June '41<br/><br/>In December of 1940, Hitler made the decision to invade Russia and set the date for the middle of 1941. He had good reason to be confident that Russia would collapse under an uncompromising assault. Since the outbreak of hostilities, the German Wehrmacht had accomplished a stunning and unparalleled series of victories: Poland had fallen in one month, Denmark in one day; France, till then regarded as the strongest power in Europe, had capitulated in under six weeks, Holland in under six days; Belgium, Norway, Yugoslavia and Greece took less than three weeks each. The German military might was at its peak and the word Blitzkrieg had entered the language.<br/><br/>Russia, on the other hand had taken over three months to bring Finland to heel, despite overwhelming strength of numbers. The Russian army had not yet recovered from Stalin's purges of 1937-1938 where 400 generals were &ldquo;removed&rdquo; including three field marshals and 13 Army commanders. It was well that Hitler could say, &ldquo;Before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse in Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history. We have only to kick in the front door and the whole rotten Russian edifice will come tumbling down.&rdquo;<br/><br/>On the 22nd of June, 1941, Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of Russia, began. Three million Axis troops in three Army Groups attacked on a front that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea: Army Group North under Field Marshal von Leeb was tasked with taking Leningrad; Army Group South under Field Marshal von Rundstedt was to capture Kiev and seize the Caucasus; Field Marshal von Bock's Army Group Centre, the one that concerns us, had Moscow as an objective, with Timoshenko undertaking the task of defending the capital.<br/><br/>Initially, the operation succeeded beyond Hitler's wildest dreams. Within a day, the Russian Air Force was destroyed on the ground, then vast inroads were made on all fronts accompanied by large scale surrenders of encircled Russian troops. Army Group Centre with its four armies consisting of a total of 48 Divisions, of which nine were armoured, and backed by the Second Air Fleet, had reached the outskirts of Smolensk by the 15th July. This was two-thirds of the way to Moscow and it seemed that nothing could stop von Bock from blowing up the Kremlin within another three or four weeks... or could something stand in his way?<br/><br/>Four things could now cause problems to von Bock: firstly, his supply line is stretched and had almost reached breaking point; secondly, Russian resistance is stiffening; thirdly, his infantry divisions are having difficulty keeping up with the Panzers and finally, a new Russian ally is about to enter the field: General Winter.<br/><br/>Additional concerns may come in November, with three-quarters of a million experienced Siberian veterans freed by garrisoning Soviet Far East, thanks to Stalin's spies in Tokyo revealing Japanese intentions to attack America, and not Russia.<br/><br/>As the German Commander, you must push on to Moscow before it is too late. As the Russian Commander you must re-evoke the Patriotic War and stop the invaders at any cost.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like its predecessor Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves, Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.<br/><br/>Elves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>",

Nevertheless, prohibition is going to represent a gold mine for smugglers who dare to challenge the authorities. From the hooligan to the respected politician, many people have tried their luck on this lucrative market, yet it remains a dangerous activity since the agents of the prohibition &mdash; the Prohis &mdash; roam around...<br/><br/>In Prohis, each player embodies a smuggler who tries to make a fortune by transporting illegal goods &mdash; a highly precarious activity since the other players have the opportunity to check your cargo or even seize it if they find suspicious items.     <br/>         <br/>Each player starts with an Inspector, a Captain, and a hand of four cards, with the deck being comprised of legal goods, illegal goods, and Lieutenants. Four cards are placed face-up on the table. On a turn, a player either draws 1-2 cards from those on display or from the deck, or attempts to smuggle a convoy of 2-4 cards by placing them on the table face down. When smuggling, each other player gets the chance to throw a cargo controller at the smuggled goods, with the highest valued controller taking charge of the inspection. The cargo mover can try to bribe the controller to make this trouble go away, but if that doesn't work an Inspector, the highest rating, can look at three cargo cards, a Captain two, and a Lieutenant one. If the controller reveals an illegal good, the owner of that card gets to seize all of the cargo, placing it and her controller in her warehouse; if all the goods are legal, the shipper claims the cargo in the warehouse and the controller in hand. If a controller awaits among the cargo, then this informant has been revealed and the inspection fails.     <br/>         <br/>When the deck runs out or players all pass on drawing cards, the game ends, with players scoring $4k for each illegal good in the warehouse, $1k for each legal good, and $1-5k for controllers in hand and in the warehouse. Illegal goods in hand cost money, and whoever has the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

It can be played in under 10 minutes and offers surprising depth for a small game.<br/><br/>The goal of Seven7s is to have the most points at the end of the game by having the highest total value of cards in your hard when endgame scoring is initiated. During the game, all players together build a community tableau with seven columns corresponding to the seven different types of cards in the game: 7 Ages of Man, 7 Colors of the Rainbow, 7 Deadly Sins, 7 Holy Virtues, 7 Lucky Gods, 7 Seas, and the 7 Wonders of the World.<br/><br/>To begin, deal each player a starting hand of three cards, and place one card face up in the tableau to start the first column. On your turn, play a single card from your hand to the tableau to a column that matches that card. If no such column exists for that type of card, start a new column. Next, activate that card's ability, then draw back up to three cards in hand. Each of the seven different types of cards has a unique ability that offers lots of strategy and replayability.<br/><br/>The game ends when the seventh card of a column is played. This card is played sideways and counts towards the hand of whoever played it for endgame scoring. Whoever has the most points in hand wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is a few years in the future and the nations of the world concur with the opinion of an unprecedented number of leading scientists: a combination of overpopulation, environmental change, and resource depletion has put the human species at imminent and dire risk. Something needs to be done &ndash; but what? In the span of a few weeks, top advisors and experts in each major world power conclude that the only way their people &ndash; and, indeed, all of humanity &ndash; will survive is via dramatic and immediate global de-population. With no one wanting to put their own people at risk, it will take aggressive and even inhumane acts to somehow save the world.<br/><br/>Tomorrow simulates a near-future in which six world powers struggle to save their people and culture in the face of imminent world calamity. You control one of six powers &ndash; the United States, the European Union, Russia, China, India, or the Arab Caliphate &ndash; in a live-or-die struggle to save the planet and your people, while preserving your culture and heritage for the generations hopefully to follow. Your objective is to contribute to the unavoidable de-population, while maximizing the goodwill of your people and the world. Tomorrow includes many exciting gaming elements:<br/><br/><br/>     High levels of social interaction: Much of the game is conducted via face-to-face diplomacy involving all six players. <br/>     Player determination: This low-luck game forces you to match wits with your antagonists &ndash; not roll dice &ndash; in order to beat them.<br/>     Variety: Every game is different thanks to a range of Event Cards that have many different effects on the action.<br/>     Various types of warfare to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses: You can choose to use Conventional Military or Terror, or even unleash Biological and Nuclear horrors.<br/><br/><br/>",

You win if you utilize your network of rail lines to acquire and deliver goods efficiently to accumulate the largest personal fortune!<br/><br/>The base game provides pre-programmed routes on a board depicting a north-eastern portion of the U.S. with demand cards providing players with an easy way to learn the system through play. Players start with the bare bones of a railroad: an empty train and track connecting some cities. Each turn you and your fellow players take turns building track, operating trains, and delivering loads. The bank will pay you for each delivered load.<br/><br/>With the starting route guided by the board, only two loads per card, and a visual pick-up and delivery guide on every card, the learning curve is greatly shortened.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this classic Italian word game, players use their eight drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/>Aldo Pasetti self-produced the game and was sued by the publisher of Scrabble, that has very, very similar board, tiles and rules. The trial took place in the late '50s and ended with a verdict of acquittal on the basis that game mechanics are not relevant and no confusion can be made between a long name as &quot;Scarabeo&quot; and a short one as &quot;Scrabble&quot;, so it is not even unfair competition. Editrice Giochi had waited for the definitive acquittal: after that, it published the game.<br/><br/>",

The players play on a 165 octagonal shaped board as either the Dwarfs or the Trolls. The 8 Trolls start the game in the middle of the board as they have been ambushed by 32 Dwarves (surrounding them at the outer edge of the board). Trolls and Dwarves have different ways of moving and capturing. Each battle is ended by mutual agreement and then scored. When the first battle is over, the players switch sides. The combined scores from both battles determines the winner.<br/><br/>Thud! is similar to Hnefatafl but is not actually a member of the tafl family (See <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/4049/tafl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/4049/tafl</a>) because the manner of capture has been modernized and the game involves no king piece.<br/><br/>",

Therefore, balance between collecting resources should be kept in mind.<br/><br/>You buy character and building cards from a central market to complete your resource set collections. Certain character and building cards cost 0 and give you 1 resource. For example: 1 beer. Other cards cost more: 1, 2 or 3 coins can give 2 beers or a victory point from the bread category by the end of the round.<br/><br/>Other cards produce coins the moment they're bought, in connection the cards that you already possess.<br/><br/>In Lut&egrave;ce, every player starts with a hand of cards that lets you pick a character and a building in the range of cards available. You collect 5 character and 5 building cards, visible to everyone at the time of selection.<br/><br/>In order to choose the character or building card that you wish to have, place 2 cards facedown that correspond (number or letter) to the desired card in the market.<br/><br/>Before revealing your choices, you can increase the value of your facedown cards by placing coins on your concealed cards. If 2 players want the same card, it is simply discarded and no one gets it!<br/><br/>Increasing the value of the card allows you increase your chance of ensuring your bid, but will draw the attention of other players. If two players' increased values tie, no one gets the card, as it is discarded. Therefore, you have to watch other players and block them and place a daunting bit on your cards!<br/><br/>If you don't have enough money, you also have two cards in your hand that bring you 3 coins each by playing them. At the end of the game, each set of 3 coins = 1 victory point.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, when everyone has drafted one or two cards, the market is replenished with new character and building cards. The cards that weren't selected during the round have a coin added to them (much like passing over a race in Smallworld), making them more attractive to bid upon, as you receive the corresponding coin as well, if you pick up that card. This continues, leaving a mountain of coins on unselected cards after several rounds!<br/><br/>If you didn't win a card on your turn, you get two coins to keep you from crying!<br/><br/>Note: The publisher compares this game to 7 Wonders.<br/><br/>",

Summon ghosts, move them round the board, fight other ghosts, or use one of the numerous action cards that can give you great tactical advantage.<br/><br/>During each player&rsquo;s turn, that player will perform three of the actions available on their Player Board. Each player can activate any Ghost on the main board, provided that its requirements are met. Players can also, at any time during their turn, occupy one or more Action Cards. These greatly enhance players&rsquo; options in the game. The game proceeds clockwise from the first player until the end of the game is triggered; this will happen when a player has completely run out of Haunt Tokens or if they occupy five Action Cards. A final scoring then<br/>happens, and the player with the most Haunt Points (HP) wins.<br/><br/>",

Produce, transform, gather resources, and don't forget to hinder your opponents!<br/><br/>Artificium is a card-driven development game. Some cards produce resources or transform one type of resources into another and award victory points, while others let you perform actions. Carefully planning the chain of cards that you will play during the game turn is the key to success.<br/><br/>Artificium lasts four turns. At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players' individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player's coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins). The player with the most victory points is considered to be the wisest medieval ruler and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barragoon is a fascinating, completely strategic game without any random factor. Complexity and variety of this game with all its unexpected turns will inspire you!<br/><br/>The process:<br/>Both players use their tactical skills to move their tiles and arrange the barragoon pieces to enable them to capture all their opponent`s tiles or to impede their opponent`s progress. <br/>A player has lost when he no longer has any tiles that he can move.<br/><br/>The barragoon piece:<br/>The barragoon piece is the central element of the game. Each of its side shows another symbol. It blocks or frees the tiles to be moved in specific directions, depending on the direction indicated by the uppermost symbol. If a barragoon piece is captured, it can be placed again on the board at a free chosen position. By this, the players can block or attack the opponent or save their own tiles.<br/><br/>The clou: <br/>Each time a tile is captured, two new, additional barragoon pieces have to be put on the board. By this, the board becomes more and more crowded and the risk to get locked up increases. At the same time the chance to beat the opponent increases as well.<br/><br/>",

Offshore is a lightweight competitive strategy game about this highly specialized industry.<br/><br/>In the game, players build oil platforms in the North Sea. Opening a new oil field is, of course, not easy as it requires both technology and temporary co-operation between players. On your turn, you perform one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a technology tile<br/>     Export oil (selling it for points and money)<br/>     Open a new oil field and drill for oil<br/><br/><br/>Opening a new oil field is the most complex action: Alone, or together with one other player, you must have the required technology and also pay the opening cost. Who should use which technology and how the cost should be split must be agreed upon between the players. The players then drill for oil in a small press-your-luck mini game: The players must decide how deep they want to drill, all the while avoiding too much pressure building up as this could result in a blowout. The combination of technology tiles used for opening the field will also influence the drilling in various ways.<br/><br/>The temporary co-operations and players' shared interests in the drilling phases makes for an exciting game in which players share both successes and failures.<br/><br/>",

Starting from the first player, in clockwise direction, each player chooses one customer and encircles flowers in the correct color on their personal sheet. This means that the flowers have been cut from the player's field. When all players have chosen one die, the round ends, then the player on the left of the active player begins the next round. The game ends when at the end of the round a player has:<br/><br/><br/>    Cut all flowers in three colors, or<br/>    Cut all flowers in four of the six fields.<br/><br/><br/>You can score bonus points if you have the fewest unhappy customers.

Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.<br/><br/>When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.<br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles. When a player has both hands free, they can draw two new tiles from the bag; alternatively, any player with a free hand can pick up any tile in any discard area and place it in the world.<br/><br/>At any point during the game, a player can claim one of four gods and that god's followers. Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.<br/><br/>At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can &quot;smash&quot; and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.<br/><br/>Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.<br/><br/>Whichever god has scored the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

After each round, the token is awarded and the objects returned to the bowl to start the next round. Play continues until a certain number of tokens are won.<br/><br/>In the solo version, the player is given 75 seconds to remove the pieces from the bowl with their chopsticks to place each piece in a grid with each row given to one of the shapes and each column given to one of the colors.<br/><br/>",

The Freemen Coalition is a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare, and the Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.<br/><br/>The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.<br/><br/>Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game covers the French insurgency war against FLN in Algeria during 1954-62. It is a conflict of great drama. It cost the lives of at least half a million Algerians, it brought the tumultuous exodus of one million French settlers from Algeria and it brought France itself to the brink of civil war. But to be portrayed as a game has its difficulties, though. How do you recreate the fact that the side which lost militarily won the war? How do you make it interesting to play when FLN never succeeded in creating an army, like the Viet Minh did in the Indochina war, and therefore was never able to rival the French?<br/><br/>To address this, the game contains &ldquo;three games&rdquo; within the game: A political, an insurgency and a military game. Politics are driven by chits which alter four parameters: FLN structure; Algerian population; Pied noir feelings (the French settlers in Algeria) and French public/government. Each one will affect the play, in different ways, when it changes. What eventually ends the game is when the French public reaches 0 and calls for a referendum. Then you check each region whether they will vote to stay with France or become independent. If a majority votes pro-France, the French player win and vice versa. It is through different insurgency or counterinsurgency actions that you will make a region pro-FLN or pro-France. Finally, the military part will allow you to contest or control regions. This will affect your ability to mobilize, tax and conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.<br/><br/>In other words, you will have to fight to control, conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions in order to win the hearts and minds of the population and, through politics, see to it that the public in France either supports you or gets fed up with the war. Some things might help you in one way but at the same time give disadvantages in other aspects. Nothing in war is purely a good decision. There is always a cost.<br/><br/>Each year has four gameturns. You start the game with eight random political chits of 28 possible ones. Each chit may only be played during a certain time span and after you play a chit you will draw a new one.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;operation points&rdquo; are the main engine in the game. You will receive a certain number of points and with these points you will pay for everything you do, like recruiting or bringing in reinforcements, certain movement, fighting and conducting insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.<br/><br/>FLN recruitment will depend on how pro-FLN the Algerian population is and how efficient the FLN structure is. It will also depend on population density and whether they control a region or not. The French can bring in new units and replacements, but it will cost operation points and put pressure on the French public. So the reason to attack is to control/contest as much as possible and to force the opponent to spend operation points to replenish his force.<br/><br/>The counters have no movement points. With a gameturn of three months there is no lack of time to position units anywhere on the map. You follow the road network (as French) but it will cost you operation points when you pass regions which are controlled by the enemy. FLN moves off-road and will have some limitations to whether they may leave a region or not. The numbers represent strength and quality.<br/><br/>Fighting will include combat chits which in certain combination will affect the combat. My first ambition is to minimize the amount of tables in order to make the game faster to play. You roll a number of dice corresponding with your strength and modify your roll with the difference in quality. You get a hit when you roll 5-6. The complexity and difficulties lies more in what to decide and when to do it.<br/><br/>Best regards<br/>Kim Kanger<br/><br/><br/>",

In this way each player develops a unique set of resources which will define their play style throughout the game.<br/><br/>SABOTAGE: Many of the cards have clever effects you can use to manipulate your opponents and gain the upper hand.<br/><br/>ATTACK: Engage your opponent's spies using vehicles, weapons and more from the arsenal you build throughout the game!<br/><br/>This is where the tactical fun of Web of Spies happens. With just 5 cards, you have a lot of choices to make. Where will you move? What assets will you acquire? Will you attack now, or wait until the moment is just right? Balancing your efforts between acquiring powerful assets and using them at the right time is the strategy of Web of Spies!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You join this universe in the earliest days of mankind's ambitious invasion to retake the central planets from the Scourge. Bloody battles and epic conflict awaits as races, generals and individuals take sides. Whether you're fighting for humanity, the Scourge or for your own ends is up to you!<br/><br/>Dropzone Commander is a 10mm scale sci-fi tabletop wargame, devised for mass battles between two or more players. The rules are designed for efficient and dynamic games which can be played on a standard 4'x4' table (although larger tables work well also!)<br/><br/>The rules are based on an alternate activation system, which keeps the action constant and involving. They are also scalable, and will cater for tactical skirmishes as well as titanic clashes of metal and firepower. This is accomplished whilst never sacrificing the character of individual units, and indeed all the colour and eventfulness of battle.<br/><br/>A vast array of war machines will be at your disposal, but this does not belittle the importance of the humble infantryman.<br/><br/>The game is built around the concept of rapid deployment and redeployment of your forces by airborne dropships, exemplifying the pace of combat on the battlefields of the future. This makes for a tactical and fast paced experience, where quick thinking and strokes of genius often bring victory.<br/><br/>",

By rolling dice and activating powerful spells and relics cards, players gain Gold, Magick, Power, and Clouds.<br/><br/>Konja is played over a series of rounds; in each round, each wizard completes their turn before play proceeds to their opponent. On their turn, a wizard first selects from the available Ancestors, which grants the active wizard a Favour, and both wizards a Blessing. Favours and Blessings consist of bonus actions including refreshing Spell cards in hand, buying and selling Relic cards and gaining Clouds.<br/>The active player then rolls the dice, and through manipulation of Relic and Spell cards, create useful dice combinations:<br/><br/><br/>    Single die showing a high number reward Power tokens, which are used strengthen the effects of Relic cards.<br/>    A pair of dice reward Magick tokens, which activate Spell cards in hand.<br/>    Runs ( three or more dice showing consecutive numbers) reward Gold tokens, which are spent to purchase Relic cards from the Offerings and are sacrificed for Clouds.<br/>    Three or more dice showing the same number gains Cloud tokens, which are worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/><br/>The first wizard to accumulate 21 or more points worth of Clouds triggers the last round of the game. Once both wizards have completed their turn thr game ends and the wizard with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.<br/><br/>Afrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out. The game's easy-to-use supply system (no writing) allows for a correct logistical aspect to the game.<br/><br/>This is the second game in Standard Combat Series by The Gamers that began with the game Stalingrad Pocket. The series rules have been refined after lessons learned with the earlier game. This series of games was designed to off-set The Gamers's line of more complex products. Experienced players will feel comfortable with the rules as soon as they read through them.  It is designed as a fast paced fun game giving a reasonable simulation of events. It was not intended to be a definitive simulation of this campaign.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 month<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 Km<br/>Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 8-page SCS system rulebook version 1.5<br/>    One 12-page Afrika specific rulebook<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>",

We've combined several ideas into one fast playing game of Napoleon's 1815 Waterloo Campaign.<br/><br/>With fewer than 20 pieces on the board, strategic movement based on action point allocation, a unique twist on a classic battle card system, the game plays in under 90 minutes.  The game is playable by 2 to 3 players and several games can be played in an evening.  Great for Tournament play!<br/> Each side receives a set number of action points to move pieces and battle.  Each piece on the board is a corps in the French, Anglo-Allied, and Prussian armies, so each side has 4 - 8 pieces on board.  As your pieces move they will gain fatigue, and as they battle they gain fatigue and casualties.<br/><br/>The battle system is card play, matching the cards played based on the type of units in the corps (infantry, cavalry, or artillery).  Victory is determined by the capture of terrain and eliminating enemy units.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>The set contains<br/>- 2 sets of rules<br/>- 2 sets of player aid card<br/>- Mapboard<br/>- 2 French army tracking card sheets<br/>- 1 Allied army tracking card sheets<br/>- 1 Prussian army tracking card sheets<br/>- 5 objective cards<br/>- 68 combat cards<br/>- 8 French unit blocks<br/>- 10 Allied &amp; Prussian unit blocks<br/>- 25 yellow multipurpose market blocks<br/>- 1 six sided die<br/><br/>",

He's placed Paranormal Energy Devices (PEDs) all over the Mercado Building, and it's up to the Ghostbusters to find them and get them out before the fourth Cataclysm begins and the building is completely haunted.<br/><br/>In Ghostbusters: Protect the Barrier Game, you have to keep your eye on the number of ghost figures on the board. If too many ghosts show up, rooms become haunted, and if six rooms become haunted at the same time, you lose the game! However, if all four Ghostbusters escape the building with all eight PEDs before six rooms have been haunted, the players win!<br/><br/>In more detail, players roll dice to determine how many spaces they move this turn and whether a new ghost is added to the board. Players may move up to the number of spaces shown on the die. If they end their movement in a space with a PED, they may pick it up. If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board. If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting. A haunting requires at least two people in the room to attempt a fight with it.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters: Protect the Barrier Game &mdash; a new version of the Kinderspiel des Jahres-winning Geister, Geister, Schatzsuchmeister! &mdash; includes four ways to play: Basic Battle, Basic Battle with Rowan, Advanced Adventure, and Advanced Adventure with Rowan. Rowan is a special ghost figure included in this version that cannot be killed. When this ghost's card comes up in the deck, you draw the next card, then move it to that room. If that room becomes a haunting, this ghost automatically moves to the next room.<br/><br/>",

The square, 5x5 board tile is the island where the war of the gods will take place, with the first row of fields on opposing sides representing the start fields and the rest representing the battlefield. During the game, you will move and stack multiple pieces on top of each other, forming columns and initiating attacks against your opponent. On your turn, you may either move pieces or reincarnate a defeated piece.  You can move a piece 1 field forward, left, or right, but not backwards or diagonally.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of two moves. One piece can move twice or Two pieces can each move once. When a piece moves into a field with 1 or more already existing pieces, it is always placed directly on top of the other piece(s). Players can also Reincarnate a defeated piece. You do not need to show your opponent it's value. If you move to a field containing an opponent&rsquo;s piece a battle occurs with each player revealing their piece&rsquo;s strength. The weaker of the two is removed from the game. In case of a tie, both pieces stay in the field but only the one in the top can move, blocking their opponent. Also, once a piece has reached an opponent&rsquo;s start field, it may not be moved anymore, neither by you nor by any action of your opponent.<br/><br/>You win the game by being the first player to build a statue of 5 pieces on an opponent&rsquo;s single start field.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CrossFire: Rules and Organization for Company-Level WW-II Gaming , combat mechanics that simulate the interplay of fire and movement combined with a command system that represents unit flexibility. Emphasis is on infantry combat.<br/><br/>Crossfire is an innovative set of rules very unlike most other systems out there.  &quot;Turns&quot; (having the &quot;initiative&quot; is the term in Crossfire which loosely matches the concept of a &quot;turn&quot;) are not sequential (as in &quot;step 1 movement, step 2 artillery fire, step 3 melee, etc, etc&quot;) and distances and moves are not measured (we do some measurement in our house rules).  This different approach makes for a breathlessly exciting game system where critical situations are developed realistically and resolved quickly. The mechanics also make for amazingly quick games.  Scenarios that have previously taken more than a day to complete are finished within a few hours.  Once you try this game, you won't want to go back to others, believe me!<br/><br/>Crossfire focuses on infantry action at the company level with squads as the smallest element. Some people play with house rules which add more detail to the armor rules - but the existing rules work fine as Crossfire is primarily and infantry orientated rule set.<br/><br/>Crossfire is actually a step up from our 1:1 preferences, with figures mounted on stands of 2-3 figures representing a squad.  This was a bit of a nervous jump from 1:1 for me, but the result has been very rewarding.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that the idea of squads moving about is a bit like Avalon Hill's Squad Leader which we played years and years ago.  That was a great game.<br/><br/>Also Available: Hit the Dirt! (CrossFire Scenarios) 21 scenarios for Cross Fire in a booklet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.&quot;<br/><br/>Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.<br/><br/>These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.<br/><br/>Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.<br/><br/>But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty's Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat). In NWBM this changes. The player may spend the advantage to gain specific game benefits, automatically. Thus, rather than being hoarded, this &quot;twist of fate&quot; is likely to hop back and forth, as each player strives to save a desperate situation.<br/><br/>What is most amazing about NWBM is how much of a &quot;game&quot; it actually is, offering both players challenges and fateful decisions to make, in this classic face-off of well-known leadership. What will you do?<br/><br/>",

Carefully plan your moves and try to control your opponents' moves. On your turn, play a card, place three students, and advance mother nature a certain number of steps across the islands. The island on which mother nature lands is evaluated, and whoever controls it can erect one of their own towers, possibly taking control from an opponent. Additionally, adjacent islands controlled by the same player can merge with that one.<br/><br/>The game ends if only three islands remain, if the students run out, or if a player builds all of their towers. At this point, the player who built the most towers wins.<br/><br/>With three different game modes, including team play, Eriantys always offers different and interesting games. In addition, if you play with the expert version, you can use the fantastic skills of the special characters; each adds many possibilities, enriching the fun and beauty of the challenge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While on a week&rsquo;s holiday in Edinburgh, Mary visits Mary King&rsquo;s Close where her presence attracts the spirit of her long dead ancestor, now a hungry ghost that wants to live again in Mary&rsquo;s body. The two Marys engage in a battle for control of the living Mary&rsquo;s mortal body.<br/><br/>Players use control cards and power cards to exert their influence on Mary King&rsquo;s psyche, represented by 12 tiles arranged in a 4 x 3 grid. These tiles are flipped back and forth throughout the game as the players gain and lose control of them.<br/><br/>The game progresses over five days, starting on Monday and ending on Friday. Each player gets one turn each day, with the ghost player always going first. As the week progresses, the mortal and the ghost become more exhausted and more desperate: the number of control cards each may play decreases and the number of ideas they may pursue increases. At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, both players suffer penalties based on the tiles of Mary that their opponent controls.<br/><br/>A player may immediately win the game by completing their image of Mary using the 12 tiles, or if their opponent runs out of cards. If neither player completes their image of Mary by the end of Friday, the winner is determined by a scoring system based on their remaining cards and their control of Mary.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are 10 characters to choose from (all included), each with three different special abilities. Landing just one hit wins a round, and a game is best three out of five rounds. Games take only a few minutes to play.<br/><br/>The duel takes place along an 18-space linear track. Players draw from a common deck of 25 of numbered cards (five copies of each number 1 through 5), and use these cards to move, attack, dashing strike, block, and push. Each character's special ability cards add a new dimension to the base gameplay, and create 45 different character matchups.<br/><br/>Flash Duel was designed and balanced by David Sirlin, the multiplayer balancer of Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Puzzle Strike. The core gameplay was inspired by Reiner Knizia's game En Garde.<br/><br/>This game has received a follow-up in Flash Duel: Second Edition, which adds 10 new characters, slight balance changes to the original characters, support for up to 5 players, and new gameplay modes<br/><br/>",

There it is, the starting signal!<br/><br/>Dashing ahead with your chariot, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed&hellip; circling the spina in the center of the arena to complete the first lap. The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot's speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it's time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into view&hellip;or should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?<br/><br/>In Chariot Race, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena's circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.<br/><br/>However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.<br/><br/>",

You compete with the other lovely ladies in your town by strategically growing your dowry, while being careful not to gain too much infamy, or the duke may pass you over for another bride!<br/><br/>You play as a middle-class Victorian woman who would kill to be a duchess. Since you were not lucky enough to be born into the aristocracy, the only way to attract a noble is to have a large enough dowry. Fortunately, when your parents died, they left you with a small dowry and some land. You must build wealth through investments and strategic serial marriages.<br/><br/>Gameplay is divided into rounds; each round consists of four separate phases: drafting, investment, husband, and housekeeping. In each round, each player drafts a hand of cards, pick-and-pass style. Certain cards are played into players' tableaus. Instant cards are used and discarded. Players using death cards partially reset their tableau and get income. Players discard down to eight cards in hand, then draft four new cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has no current husband, no more than 9 infamy, spends 120 crowns, and plays a remarry card to marry the Duke. That player wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Gamers who cherish the finer things in life such as wonderfully painted armies, fighting over luxurious terrain and doing so in the company of friends. No need for the use of protractors to wheel a unit. Arguments over whether a charge is 2mm out of range are not something you&rsquo;ll need to worry about. In essence it&rsquo;s a very relaxing game that can produce stunning conflicts - conflicts that can see one side appear doomed only for them to pull victory from the icy grasp of Mistress Defeat!<br/><br/>The book itself is glorious. Hardback covers binding 184 full-colour pages filled with atmospheric anecdotes and the most sumptuous photographs of model soldiers you will have seen. It&rsquo;s every wargamer&rsquo;s dream!<br/><br/>The 2nd Edition was published in August 2018.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sheepshead is a trick-taking card game related to the Skat family of games. It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.<br/><br/>Sheepshead is played with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, for a total of 32 cards. A sheepshead deck is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from a standard deck.<br/><br/>Card strength:<br/>Card strength in sheepshead is different than in most other games. It is one of the most difficult things for some beginners to grasp.<br/><br/>There are 14 cards in the trump suit: all four queens, all four jacks, and all of the diamonds. In order of strength from greatest to least:<br/><br/>Q&clubs; Q&spades; Q&hearts; Q&diams;<br/>J&clubs; J&spades; J&hearts; J&diams;<br/>A&diams; 10&diams; K&diams; 9&diams; 8&diams; 7&diams;<br/>Also, there are 6 of each &quot;fail&quot; suit (18 total).<br/>A, 10, K, 9, 8, and 7 of &clubs;, &spades;, and &hearts;<br/><br/>Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;throwing off&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;schmearing&quot;.<br/><br/>Card point values:<br/>Each card is given a separate point value as follows:<br/>Ace &mdash; 11 points<br/>Ten &mdash; 10 points<br/>King &mdash; 4 points<br/>Queen &mdash; 3 points<br/>Jack &mdash; 2 points<br/>9, 8, 7 &mdash; 0 points<br/><br/>The strongest cards (queens and jacks) are not worth the most points, giving Sheepshead some of its unusual character.<br/>There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, the player who picked up the blind loses, and that player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more peculiar situations, such as the Leaster.)<br/><br/>This is one of the few traditional card games with a hidden partner.<br/><br/>Jack of Diamonds is a random partner method where the picker receives a partner without needing to call or lead a suit. The picker can still choose to &quot;go it alone&quot;, but needs to declare before the hand begins.<br/><br/>",

Players compete in two teams, out of which just one individual will be crowned the winner. Hebrew units are split between Northern and Southern kingdoms, but Hebrew players will have the opportunity to use both these factions through the game. Similarly there are eleven Heathen kingdoms for the Heathen players to use. Play happens at an individual, human level as well as at the movement of nations level.<br/><br/>Each player has two Farmers, two Merchants and two Priests. A number of these can be placed after conquest into lands occupied by the kingdom just played. Farmers collect two bronze coins for plains and one for hills. Merchants collect two silver coins for ports and one for roads. Priests collect two gold coins for temples and one for cities. Players may have only one of their Patriarchs in any one land. Players may share occupation of a land, but only one type of Patriarch may be in each land.<br/><br/>Players use the coins generated by their Patriarchs to buy artefacts that influence game play but can instead choose to secure objectives on the Kingdom track to highlight the development of the nation and score victory points of course! A variety of strategies are available, and players must make choices throughout the game in order to emerge victorious.<br/><br/>",

With the promise of her famous fruit salad, Ama sends her grandchildren down to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market to collect fruit... and to get out of her hair! Collecting different fruit is no easy task, as the fruit boats &ndash; full of mango, banana, papaya, guava, grapefruit, rambutan, and the famous starfruit &ndash; are constantly shifting around the Khlong Damnoen Saduak Canal of Thailand.<br/><br/>In Floating Market, the players are Ama's eager grandchildren, competing to be the first to collect five different types of fruit for Ama... AND get the first bowl of fruit salad! Each player has customers (Ama&rsquo;s grandchildren), which they will assign to fruit boats (to collect fruit) and to buildings (to receive special abilities). Each player will also add a die to the dice pool each round in an attempt to influence a die roll that determines which fruit boat will hand out fruit.<br/><br/>Floating Market utilizes polyhedral dice, worker placement, and dice speculation to create a unique and accessible experience for gamers of all levels. The rules and turns are simple and intuitive and the game teaches quickly, making it perfect for a family or group of new gamers. Experienced gamers will appreciate the unique blend of new and familiar mechanics and the quick, fun gameplay that uses polyhedral dice in a new and interesting way.<br/><br/>",

Moved by boundless curiosity, the little ones draw these spirits in their notebooks to understand their nature and learn from them.<br/><br/>With a set-collection core mechanism, the goal of Yokai Sketch is to score more yokai points than the other player by completing sketches of the elusive forest spirits. The game consists of two decks of cards: in one are four types of yokai, each associated with an element (water, fire, earth, and wind) and a numerical value that corresponds to victory points, and in the other, sketches made by humans, two of the four elements, and possibly a special ability.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the yokai cards are stacked in four decks (one for each element) and three sketch cards are dealt face down to players. On their turn, players draw a new sketch card and slide one of their four cards under one of the four decks in the center of the table so that it reveals the element associated with that yokai. If by doing this the yokai reaches or exceeds the number of sketches needed to draw it (adding the sketches on both sides of the card), the player who has accumulated the most sketches on their side of the table takes it.<br/><br/>The winner's sketch cards will be placed in the discard pile, and the other player's will stay where they are as they will be used for the next yokai card of that type. If there is a tie in the number of sketches on both sides of the card, the yokai is frightened and lost. In this case, neither player manages to finish the drawing and all the sketch cards on both sides of that yokai pile are discarded. Sketch cards can also include powers: calling the yokai or distracting it to move cards. The game ends when one or more yokai decks are empty.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In order to win, a player must first put their opponent&rsquo;s Avatar at Death&rsquo;s Door by reducing its life total to 0. After that, the player must then deliver the final Death Blow to the dying Avatar, which rewards them with the win. A player also wins if their opponent attempts to draw a card from an empty deck&mdash;either the Atlas or Spellbook&mdash; or if their opponent surrenders.<br/><br/>Sorcery: Contested Realm is played over a series of turns. Players take their turn, one at a time, following 3 phases:<br/><br/>Start Phase<br/>Untap Step: Untap your Avatar, minions, and relics.<br/>Draw Step: Draw a card from your Spellbook or Atlas. If you are the first player, skip this step on your first turn of the game.<br/>Start Step: &ldquo;At the start of turn&rdquo; abilities trigger.<br/><br/>Main Phase<br/>You may, in any order:<br/>Cast spells; Activate abilities; Interact with relics; Move with a minion; Attack with a minion;<br/><br/>End Phase<br/>Rest Step: Remove damage from all minions.<br/>End Step: &ldquo;Until the end of turn&rdquo; abilities end, and the turn passes to your opponent.<br/><br/>",

These land cards give you victory points, and the first player who has gained seven points wins.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, players choose twelve unit cards to construct a deck of their own. On your turn, you execute four phases: control, maintenance, income, and military. Military is the most important phase in a turn, during which you can muster, deploy, or move your units. You can also gain food. You consume action points to execute these actions. You need food to muster units and activate them. Managing food and maximizing synergies of units are the keys to winning the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/><br/>プレイヤーは領主となり、12枚のユニットを指揮して3つの地域に配置された土地カードの獲得を目指します。<br/>土地カードには勝利点が記述されており、先に7勝利点を獲得したプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/>ゲームの前に、プレイヤーは12枚のユニットカードからなる自分のデッキをつくります。<br/>ゲームはターン性で、ターンは4つのフェイズ（支配・維持・収入・軍事）からなります。<br/>ターンのメインとなる軍事フェイズでは、ユニットを召集・地域に派遣・地域から地域へ移動、という行動がとれます。また、食糧を直接的に入れることもできます。<br/>これらの行動はアクションポイントによって実施されます。<br/>ユニットの招集には食糧が必要であり、また、地域でユニットが活動するためにも食糧が必要となります。<br/>食料のマネジメントとユニットのシナジーを最大化することがゲームのカギです。<br/><br/>",

War had been waged in Bavaria against the Prussians, Catalonia against the Spaniards, under the great pyramids against the relentless Turk and even at New Orleans against those upstart Americans. Now new challengers have arisen and a completely foreign army is arrayed across the battlefield. The Tri-Color fluttered in the breeze as rocket shells burst in the air. A new type of warfare was about to be unleashed.<br/><br/>Manoeuvre: Distant Lands is a stand alone expansion for Manoeuvre. Four new armies are included to allow you to bring the fight from the frozen north to the sub-continent and the mythic east. Included in this set are counters and cards for Sweden, the splintered Kingdoms of India, the Chinese 8-Banner Army and the crumbling remains of the Japanese Shogunate. Also included is a set of 8 new land tiles that will force veteran players to learn new tactics among the swamps and fields of the Orient as well as the forests of Scandinavia.<br/><br/>Sweden: The Swedes are reminiscent of the more traditional European powers and fit nicely into the current game hierarchy to allow for more balanced tournament play. The Swedish army fits the mold of both the Prussians and Russians but falls into line just below them in overall strength.<br/><br/>Indians: The Kingdoms of the Marathas, Mughals, Mysore and Sikhs from the Punjab have banded together to overthrow the colonial powers of the day. Their problem is overcoming the lack of a true leader that makes it difficult to set aside their rivalries and squabbling. They have speed rivaling the Ottomans but far less of a capacity to use it well. They are a true guerilla force adept at denying their opponents resources or freedom to maneuver.<br/><br/>Tokugawa Shogunate: The Shogunate is crumbling. The army seeks to modernize against the will of the Shogun and in a few years Japan will step into the Industrial age. However, at the turn of the 19th Century, insular clans still dominated the military. Every Daimyo leads his own army into battle with their own guns, cavalry, samurai and teppo. Only the Shogun can be called on to make any Clan work with another. Beware the deadly fury of the Banzai charge and even cornered units will fight to the bitter end and the last man.<br/><br/>China: The Chinese 8-Banner army boasts a core of elite units, including three cavalry units that can stand their ground against any European foe. Unfortunately, the Han conscripts and the peasants that form the Tuan Lian are ill-suited and under-equipped in relation to their Manchu and Mongol horsemen. Will rockets and witchcraft bring disruption to the orderly European battlefield?<br/><br/>&quot;I have not imagined that the Napoleonic experience can be brought to the orient!&quot;<br/>- Thunder Wong, Playtester Extraordinaire<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>32 Unit counters (8 for each nationality)<br/>240 Cards (60 for each nationality)<br/>8 Terrain tiles<br/>Rules for the new abilities and some advanced Manoeuvre additions.<br/>3 Advance-to-Contact Counters<br/><br/>Designers: Jeff Horger and Joe Roush<br/><br/>",

It is a game of skill and can be played by two to six players playing individually or with four people, playing in two teams of two.<br/><br/>Durak uses the Russian deck of 36 cards or can be played with a standard deck of cards with the 2-5 inclusive removed.<br/><br/>Popular variants of the game include Podkidnoy Durak (Throw-In Durak) and Perevodnoy Durak (Transfer Durak) where the key difference is that in Perevodnoy Durak a defender may pass the attack to the next player by playing a card that matches the rank of the attacking card.<br/><br/>",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!<br/><br/>Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game: Rick and Morty 2-Pack is a standalone game that includes, as you might expect, the characters Rick and Morty.

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Natur&quot; contains historical events related to nature, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

In Maui, you want to find and place beachgoers on your sand so that they create pleasing patterns, while also placing their towels close to the ocean or under the shade of trees or umbrellas to earn the most points. However, getting too close to either of these areas is risky and might ruin their plans!<br/><br/>In the game, you have your own beach board with room for 13 towels, the board has seven rows in which towels can be placed, and during set-up, you randomly place eight umbrellas in designated locations on your board. Each player places one random towel in the left most column of their board; each towel has three different patterns on it. Place six random tiles in the two rows of the market and one sand dollar in each row.<br/><br/>On a turn, either take all the sand dollars from either row of the market or take a towel from the market; towels cost 0, 1, or 2 sand dollars, with those dollars being placed in the market row. When you place a towel, you must match at least one pattern with the towel that's rightmost on your beach board and you want to match as many patterns as possible. For each match you make, you advance that pattern's scoring marker 1-3 spaces on the score board; the closer to the ocean or the shade the more points you score, but if you place part of a towel outside the play area, you're penalized.<br/><br/>If you cover an umbrella, you receive its bonus, whether that's advancing a pattern's scoring marker or receiving one of two types of pearls.<br/><br/>When someone places a towel in the final column of their beach board, you complete the round, then see who's scored the most points from patterns, pearls, and leftover sand dollars, which are each worth a point. Instead of playing with umbrellas, you can flip your beach board to find a septet of sand crabs. Whenever you cover a crab with a towel, the crab crawls onto that portion of the towel, costing you both that pattern and a few points.<br/><br/>",

The setting is 12th century England, before the signing of the Magna Carta, as the daring outlaws of Sherwood Forest oppose the Sheriff of Nottingham, Sir Guy of Guisbourne, and the evil Prince John. In the absence of King Richard, it is a land beset by the oppressions of nobles and clergy whose only concern is their own well-being. As Robin Hood, you must enlist the support of the local populace (including Little John, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck) and rob the rich to give to the poor. As the Sheriff of Nottingham, you must insure the safe passage of the wealthy through the area, tax local villages to raise money, capture and hang the outlaw leaders, and help to prevent the return of good King Richard from the Crusades.<br/>In a typical Game-Turn, Robin Hood will move his forces from area to area, trying to best position them for recruiting new units and ambushing travelers passing through Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff Player will position his forces in an attempt to protect the travelers and possibly trap and capture the outlaws. Battles occur when both Players have forces in the same area, and are resolved by die rolls representing Archery and Melee Combat.<br/><br/>",

Will you risk it all on illicit plants, plan to convey a careful mix of med-kits and energy crystals, or rush to deliver as quickly as possible to get that special ship? Don't push too hard or the price will fall faster than re-entry to atmosphere, and your hopes will fall with it.<br/><br/>Load your ship with available goods and once your ship is full, the goods shipped will modify their own value.

LOCATIONS are played and attached to the map, then descriptive story entries are read that set up actions to be triggered and decisions to be made.

Players may want to play other CHARACTERS from their hand to complete a quest or thwart an enemy.<br/><br/>Competitive: A player's goal in the main COMPETITIVE game mode is to gain the MOST QUEST POINTS over the course of a day, 12 game rounds, tracked on a QUEST TRACK, which can take about 60-90 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Cooperative: In the COOPERATIVE mode, players work, fight, move and complete their quests together to each get a set number of quest points before the end of the day, in 12 game rounds.<br/><br/>Solo: In the SOLO mode, players can choose to play a short game of 6 game rounds, attempting to get a set number of quest points before lunch, or a full game of 12 game rounds, attempting to get even more quest points before the end of the day.<br/><br/>",

Endbringers summon monsters from myth and nightmare, breeding hybrids that can destroy an enemy's forces, eventually building up enough power to destroy the world. After a world is destroyed, the Endbringers travel through dimensional portals to other, parallel worlds where the contest begins again.<br/><br/>Hecatomb's unusual stacking mechanic gives the game a three-dimensional feel. Five-sided Hecatomb cards depict a variety of horrid creatures, from terrible beasts and demons to crazed shamans. Cards feature four clear edges, with scores for power and abilities on the fifth edge. Players can create frightening creature hybrids called Abominations by stacking cards on top of each other. Each Abomination combines the powers and special abilities of all the creatures used to assemble it. The clear edges allow players to see the total power scores and abilities of up to 5 cards stacked together.<br/><br/>Designed for two or more players, Hecatomb's base set is made up of 144 cards. The starter game contains 40 random cards, a rulebook, and a counter sheet, and had a suggested retail price of $12.99. Booster packs contain 13 cards and had a suggested retail price of $4.99.<br/><br/>This game has been discontinued as of 5/24/2006 there were two expansions for it:<br/><br/>Last Hallow's Eve: Released 10/28/2005 (144 new cards)<br/>Blanket of Lies: Released 02/24/2006 (72 New Cards)<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately most of them have failed to learn any significant magic in their first year. Susie coasts by on her natural talents, Malkar would sooner sell his soul for power than read a book, Nyvetta has forgone that option along with opposable thumbs upon accidentally turning herself into a bear, Flitter is only here to steal magic items to sell on the black market, and Bramblethrone spends too long talking to trees to get anything done. As a group of students, they could not be worse.<br/><br/>Wizard's Academy is a co-operative game of magical experimentation for 1-6 players. In each game, the players select a scenario, such as summoning and binding a demon to steal its powers, defending the academy against an attack by an army of Imps, or (in the most difficult scenario) facing an academy inspector whom they must impress with their mastery of magic.<br/><br/>Players move around the academy collecting glyphs in order to cast spells.

However, there may be a &quot;phantom&quot; who attempts to confuse you.<br/><br/>In the base game, ten cards are dealt to four players, so players have hands of only two or three cards. As in a trick-taking game, each player plays one card face down in turn order. While doing this, each player forecasts who has the highest card (that is, the culprit). Each card has a color (suit), and you have to show that color when you play the card; this allows opponents to narrow down the number of your card, but some cards have a special effect, so big numbers don't win automatically. Points are awarded to whoever played the highest card (the culprit) and to whoever correctly forecasted that player winning.<br/><br/>Tricks and the Phantom is not just card luck. It is a strategy inference game that requires you to read each other's psychology.<br/><br/>",

These rare individuals, known as &ldquo;Catalyst&rdquo;, use this energy to act together in a sort of interconnected network. Can you make the most of their superhuman abilities to lead your city to fame and fortune?<br/><br/>This is a simple yet deep game of engine-building and powerful combos. You will carefully build up your chain of actions, and then finally pull the trigger to perform all them at the same time!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, a random Goal card is revealed. This will set various ways to score extra victory points at the end of the game, thus deeply affecting the available strategies.<br/> The game is turn-based and on your turn you must choose to perform one action among the following three:<br/><br/>-Take a number of coins equal to the highest cost visible on the Catalyst cards displayed on the board.<br/><br/>-Pay the indicated number of coins to recruit one of the available Catalyst cards on the board. The cost is altered by the current position of the card on the board. Once recruited, you can put the Catalyst card in one of the buildings you have managed to build.<br/><br/>-Activate one of your recruited Catalyst cards to perform its effect. These will provide you several bonuses and actions like gaining extra coins, building new buildings, recruiting other catalyst cards from the board, obtaining military power tokens which will score for majorities at the end of the game, or allowing you to immediately activate other Catalyst cards. Whenever you activate a Catalyst card which is located in one of your buildings, the building provides an additional effect.<br/><br/>Activated Catalyst cards go into your scoring pile, while buildings always remain in front of you.<br/><br/>Buildings are also extremely important due to the fact each additional scoring indicated on the Goal card is related to a specific building; this means that you can score for it only if you first have managed to build that building.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out of cards, there is a final round and then the game ends: players score points according to the Goal card as well as for the majority of Military power tokens and activated Catalyst cards. Whoever gathered the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

As the army fights to contain the tide of evil creatures teeming up out of the black clouds, the kingdom&rsquo;s best soldiers, the rangers, must venture down into the shadows to gather information, rescue prisoners, and ambush enemy supply lines. It is a desperate fight against overwhelming odds, but every little victory brings another day of hope.<br/><br/>Rangers of Shadow Deep is a solo and co-operative tabletop miniatures game, in which players create their ranger, gather companions, and play through a series of missions in their fight to hold back the darkness. If their rangers survive, they will grow in power and ability, and be sent on more difficult, dangerous and intricate assignments.<br/><br/>So, what is going to make this &lsquo;Deluxe&rsquo;, I hear you ask? Well, to start off, it&rsquo;s getting top-notch production &ndash; traditional printing and binding, with a faux leather cover heat stamped with the artwork and text, and high-quality paper stock. The layout is being completely reworked, and the book will feature a dozen pieces of new artwork by Barrett Stanley. Additionally, I&rsquo;m taking the chance to incorporate the character building elements (most notably the spells) from Temple of Madness into the main rulebook, so that all of the character building will be in one place. I am also updating or modifying a few of the rules that I, and others, have been playtesting. Finally, I have introduced a &lsquo;challenge level&rsquo; for each of the scenarios in the book, which increases the difficulty of each scenario. This is for those that were finding the scenarios too easy for 3 or 4 players, for those who just like their games tougher, or for those who might want to play the scenarios again with higher-level rangers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description by the publisher<br/><br/>",

In more detail, the game board shows a map of a city with certain locations being connected by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored parade float cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two locations, and you're trying to connect those two locations with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.<br/><br/>On a turn, you either draw two parade float cards from the deck or discard parade float cards to claim a route between two locations by placing your ghost trains on it; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two locations shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect locations on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)<br/><br/>If you create a route all the way from the Dark Forest region to the Seashore region, you collect the &quot;trick or treat&quot; bonus.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the tactical card game We Will Wok You, you must provide delicious dishes for the visitors at a wok music festival. However, some dastardly thief has stolen your ingredients! You need to replace them and come up with new dishes as soon as possible...<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players lay out 12-18 wok cards which show the dishes they can make or the special powers available to them in the kitchen. Lay out four lines of ingredient cards, with three cards each in the top two rows and two cards each in the bottom two rows; place six coin cards next to the top two rows, and four coins next to the bottom two rows. Each player starts with three coin cards in hand. On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Takes one coin card from one of the two rows of coin cards.<br/>    Buys all the ingredients in a row by paying however many coins lie next to that row.<br/>    Takes a wok card by playing ingredient cards with four matching symbols onto the table in front of you.<br/><br/><br/>When you take a coin, you reduce the cost to buy the ingredient cards in the two adjacent rows; when you buy ingredients, you place the coins used on the appropriate coin row next to the ingredients, raising the cost for future purchases. You also replace the ingredients with two or three cards from the deck as appropriate. When both ingredient rows next to a coin row are empty, each player takes one final turn, then the game ends.<br/><br/>Players then see which woks score for them: Some score the listed number of points; some require you to play a combination of ingredients onto them (whether from your ingredient cards on the table or those in your hand) in order to score anything; some score for each ingredient of a certain type or two placed onto them; and some score only for cards from your hand. The &quot;men at wok&quot; cards provide special abilities, boosting the points scored for certain types of woks, or allowing you to substitute one ingredient for another on one wok card, or transforming a wok into a fixed number of points with no ingredients required. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

No one knows how to play this mysterious game &mdash; until now when this ancient game is reborn as Ominoes.<br/><br/>In this abstract strategy/tactical game, 2-4 players want to collect their favored gods &mdash; Horus, Ra, Apep, and Khepri &mdash; in groups to earn points. They do this by rolling custom dice that both determine actions and are placed on the game board to count as a piece of the player's color. On a turn, the active player does the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Roll: Take a die and roll it.<br/>    Move: Move a die on the board that matches the rolled color exactly three spaces.<br/>    Place: Placing the die just rolled on the board, possibly scoring a group.<br/><br/><br/>The dice have four faces matching the players colors, with unused colors in a two- or three-player game being scorable by anyone. The other two faces &mdash; &quot;Yay-Ra&quot; and &quot;Ominotep&quot; &mdash; allow the player to move or reroll any die, respectively, and they count as wild once on the board. Groups of four (or more) dice of a color are scored immediately and give their player points equal to their number. The first player to 13 points (or 21 points in a two-player game)wins!<br/><br/>Quick to learn, easy to play but with layers of light tactics. Ominoes is 15 minutes of play.<br/><br/>",

To begin with, you are all loyal to the quest and each other. But once the Ring is discovered it will cast a shadow of doubt and deceit over those who seek to steal it. You may decide that being a lone wolf is a far smarter choice than loyalty, even if it means the death of your former companions.<br/><br/>You will meet monsters, find treasure and use items to stay alive and escape with the Ring before the dungeon seals itself shut, imprisoning for all eternity anyone who remains.<br/><br/>The game has a simple but clever mechanic; great for young and/or new gamers to learn fast and take part while still giving more experienced gamers a satisfying time at the table.

Choose a starting player at random. This player rolls all the dice, uses one of them (drawing an action or cash card, stealing an action or cash card from an opponent, or using their special power), then they choose the next player who will take a turn. Once all the dice have been used, whoever didn't get to use a die becomes the starting player for the next round.<br/><br/>A &quot;Crash&quot; card is shuffled into the bottom four cards of the action deck, and when it's drawn, everyone without a parachute &mdash; or the lifeboat hiding in the action deck &mdash; plunges to their death.

        "description": "Star Trek CCG 2nd edition is a reinvention of the original star trek customizable card game. One major difference in Second Edition was the addition of a cost system to equipment, events, personnel, and ships. A card's cost is listed in the top left-hand corner of a card, directly preceding the card's title as a single digit number (currently anywhere from 0 to 9). A player receives seven 'counters' at the beginning of each turn; to play a card, the player must spend a number of counters equal to the cost of the card. Only interrupts (of the card types in a player's deck) do not have a cost and are treated as 0-cost.Another major change in the gameplay of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition's lengthy procedure of a 'seed phase', which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an 'on-the-fly' method for constructing dilemma combinations. While First Edition attempted to sometimes literally represent instances from the Star Trek universe in the game, Second Edition has focused more on a consistency of gameplay as a priority over design consideration with regard to remaining faithful to the source material.

        "description": "...und Tsch&uuml;ss! means &quot;So Long!&quot; and is a simple card game where players compete for successive scoring cards on the table by laying cards with the lowest total. The trick is, there is one scoring card fewer than the number of players, so someone always goes empty handed. A bit like musical chairs.<br/><br/>The deck has blue cards numbered 1 to 15 and red cards numbered -5 and -10. According to the number of players, you're dealt a hand and then the scoring cards are laid out. So with 6 players, you get 9 cards and compete for 5 on the table. The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier. Get it wrong and you've no chance of getting points. Play twice through the deck and the highest points scored wins.<br/><br/>Part of the Goldsieber à la Carte line of games.<br/><br/>",

The young and extremely talented acrobat Amelie Moreau had an accident during a dangerous feat. Insurance detective Hans Peter Kaiser begins his investigation. Everything points to an accident, but Kaiser is sure there is more to it. As private detectives, you all investigate a real crime case together!<br/><br/>One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the murderer, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.<br/><br/>As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!<br/><br/>You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.<br/>You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.<br/><br/>Languages<br/>This game is available in:<br/>German: Ein Drahtseilakt<br/>British: A balancing act (coming soon)<br/>French: Sur le fil (coming soon)<br/>Italian: In bilico su un filo (coming soon)<br/>Spain: Bailando sobre la cuerda floja (coming soon)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up yet again to present the third chapter in this game series, No Retreat 3: The French &amp; Polish Fronts.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Phony War&rdquo; ended in May of 1940 as the German Army unleashed blitzkrieg attacks into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in preparation for their audacious plan to invade France. Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.<br/>In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Manoeuvring forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.<br/><br/>Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/>But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, complete with a 2-sided mounted map and oversized counters, the 1939 Polish Campaign was also added.<br/><br/>This little-simulated battle will see many new concepts implemented into the &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; game system. Given that both sides had never seen battle before and the units were mostly untried and green, a &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; game system is in use, adding much replayability to this simulation. Since that this game is fast, a complete contest will consist of two plays, with each gamer taking both sides in turn, trying to best the opponent&rsquo;s performance. Some intriguing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; hypothetical historical options are also added: Could have France intervened more effectively, the USSR acted differently? What if Czechoslovakia was never taken over by the Nazis? Poland better prepared? All these and more are yours to try out. No Retreat!<br/><br/>French Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Game: The May/June 1940 campaign, but with an added twist. Both players will draw/choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan Card&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives. There are over 6 different cards from each side, all taken from actual historical plans; the success of which will add critical Victory Points if the game does not end in &ldquo;Sudden death&rdquo;. What if Hitler had attacked in winter 1939 like initially planned? Or the French Air Force had been better prepared?<br/>Historical Game:  The May/June 1940 campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives.<br/>Simulation Game: Both sides will be given the plans/set-up used during the actual campaign. Fall Gelb no5 for the Germans, Plan Dyle A or B for the French. The game also starting with the offensive already underway, Liege taken and Holland invaded.<br/>Operation Dynamo: In this scenario the German &ldquo;Sickle cut&rdquo; maneuverer towards the sea is almost completed! As the Allies, will you be able to save the British expeditionary Corps, evacuating it at Dunkirk, or even better, pierce the enemy lines and re-join the main French Army down south?<br/><br/>Polish Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Game: The September 1939 campaign, but with extra choices. Both players will secretly deploy most of their troops on smaller strategic maps. One side or the other could have some extra &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; choices for the deployment of their troops.<br/>Historical Game:  The September 1939 campaign, with the exact historical set-ups of both forces. For this contest the players will take each side in turns. So the scenario will be played two times.<br/>Alternative History game: Players will explore many &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; alternatives.

        "description": "Orl&eacute;ans Stories is based on the bag-building mechanism known from Orl&eacute;ans, with this mechanisms having been further developed into a storytelling experience in which players go through different eras and face different challenges. Broadly speaking, instead of focusing on the city of Orl&eacute;ans and trade with the surrounding villages, player are now settling the Loire Valley. Players must farm and produce, found villages, and build fortresses and churches. They will experience times of prosperity and success, but also times of deprivation; they must defy hunger and plague, fight for their land, and perhaps conquer foreign lands to secure the lives of their settlers. In the end, however, there is peace and the joint administration of territories and villages.<br/><br/>The game includes two stories: &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; and &quot;The King's Favor&quot;. &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; is an epic story that spans eight so-called eras, and each era features different conditions and emphases. Sometimes knights settle down, with whose help you can conquer foreign territories, sometimes the plague threatens to decimate the population of settlers unless all have worked together to develop medicine.<br/><br/>&quot;The King's Favor&quot; is shorter, simpler, and more suitable as an introduction to the game. Over five eras, certain tasks have to be fulfilled by the end of each era, and those who fail to do so will drop out mercilessly. The threat of having to end the game prematurely provides a constant thrill, but all tasks are achievable, so that (usually) all players experience the end of the fifth era &mdash; but those who have concentrated only on the tasks will be punished because at this point everyone's achievements will be compared in the king's castle, and you will receive victory points for territory size, buildings, goods, and coins.<br/><br/>The different eras affect the parameters of play as well as the rules of the game, creating new strategic possibilities. This challenges players to constantly adapt to current conditions, giving you the impression of experiencing a story, but unlike in legacy games, these stories can be repeated as often as you like. The changes from era to era require a new way of looking at things from a distance, but this is made easier for players by a story booklet in which players will find not only all relevant information and rule peculiarities, but also hints of how to prepare for the upcoming game in the form of a narrated story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Six Separate Scenarios PLUS Campaign Game PLUS Links to Other Games of the Series.<br/><br/>August 1914 - The Schlieffen Plan<br/><br/>War has come. Germany is faced with mortal enemies on two fronts. She must eliminate one threat, or face being crushed between the two. The German strategist von Schlieffen plans one of the great military gambles of all time. His scheme is to concentrate to knock France out of the war before Russia can fully mobilize. The bulk of German forces will move through neutral Belgium. Graf von Schlieffen intends to fall on the flank of the French armies. He believes the French will over commit to regaining their lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. The Schlieffen plan runs into complications from the moment it is launched. The Belgians fight back. The British join the fray. The French display surprising flexibility. Can the invading German armies still defeat France? Or will the French, British, and Belgians stop them? This time, it is up to you.<br/><br/>May 1915 - Artois<br/><br/>The immediate threat to France is over. The Germans have re-deployed substantial forces to the Eastern Front. French and British reinforcements arrive in increasingly telling numbers. The French believe the opportunity has come to expel the invaders. Both sides have used the lull since 1914 to dig in. Trench lines stretch from Switzerland to the English Channel. The Germans may be weaker, but they stand inside the most extensive field fortifications the world has yet seen.<br/>February 1916 - Verdun<br/><br/>The Germans reduced the Russian threat in 1915. Now the German Field Marshal von Falkenhayn believes he can eliminate France through a battle of attrition. An epic struggle that will sear the bodies and souls of both nations begins. Both sides will feel the effects of losses on a national scale. Yet neither will shrink from the cost of the sacrifice.<br/><br/>July 1916 - The Somme<br/><br/>The new British Army is ready. With German attention focused on Verdun, the British feel they have a chance to break through. An intense, week long bombardment will pulverize the German lines before the attack begins. The British climb over the top and begin to cross no-man's land. The Germans survived the shelling and doggedly defend their line. Bitter fighting will last for months in the valley of the Somme.<br/>April 1917 - Nivelle's Offensive<br/>The French are now led by General Nivelle, a hero of Verdun. He plans a two pronged attack against the German salient pointing at Paris. He intends for his &quot;Army of the Rupture&quot; to be through German lines in a day. The problem is the Germans also see the potential of his plan. They retreat to the formidable defenses of the Hindenburg Line. Nivelle plows ahead regardless. The soldiers of the French army are rather unhappy with the result.<br/><br/>March 1918 - The Great Offensive<br/><br/>The Russians are out of the war. The Germans now concentrate in France with divisions trained in new assault tactics. The Stosstrupen are aimed at the weak point of depleted British lines. The Germans will have to win before tanks and American troops will tip the scales against them. Can the British and French hold out until a counter-offensive is possible? Or will the war drag on into yet another year?<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>     1680 Die-Cut Counters (6 countersheets)<br/>     One 34in x 22in Map (5-2)<br/>     Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables<br/><br/><br/>Scale is 20km/hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division/Brigade<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE SOO LINE is a train game set in Michigan&rsquo;s Upper Peninsula. As in many such games, the players invest in railroad companies, building track to increase the company&rsquo;s income and paying dividends to the shareholders. And as in several of Amabel Holland&rsquo;s railroad games, track-leasing and cooperation is required to get past high build costs, strict hex limits, and tight cube supplies.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s the thing, though: this is a weird game. For one thing, there are only three railroads to invest in, and the majority shareholder makes all decisions when a company operates. This means that when playing with four or five, some players will not be running companies themselves, and will need to rely on savvy investments to stay competitive. Included in these investments are five Private Companies. Privates are seeded with goods at the start of the game and pay a fixed income each round, and each time a railroad delivers goods. Once their goods are gone, the Private closes and the owner derives no further benefit.<br/><br/>If a railroad withholds money instead of paying dividends, its share value drops, sometimes drastically. Given enough time, the stock values for all three railroads will tank - the trick is to end the game before that happens, and when you have the most valuable portfolio. As is usually the case in these kinds of things, the winner is the player with the most money - cash on hand plus the value of your stocks. (Note, however, that no play money is provided. If you don&rsquo;t have poker chips, greenbacks will do in a pinch and make the game very interesting.)<br/><br/>Also, there is a cat on the priority deal card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chandragupta brings the art of war in ancient India to GMT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of History&rdquo; Series.  Beginning with Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s victories over the Nanda clan, the game follows the brief but rapid rise of the Mauryan dynasty, from Chandragupta&rsquo;s expulsion of Seleucus from the Indus river valley to the conquest of the last independent kingdom on the subcontinent, Kalinga, by his grandson Ashoka.  The Mauryan empire became the largest and most powerful in India&rsquo;s history &ndash; a distinction that would remain unchallenged until the arrival of the Mughals some 1,700 years later.<br/><br/>Chandragupta simulates the traditional &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; division of the Indian military system, with the elephant corps reigning supreme, and the hordes of light infantry regarded as little more than fodder for chariots&rsquo; wheels and trampling pachyderms.  Chariots still play a prominent role on the Indian battlefield of the era, but the cavalry, with its versatility and endurance, is a potent competitor.  In Chandragupta, victory goes to the commander who can master the unique aspects of the differing Indian military &ldquo;classes&rdquo; &ndash; the professional, lifelong soldiers called Maulas, the mercenary levies, unpredictable tribal allies, and the militias of the powerful trade guilds.  While Maulas and mercenaries are commanded under a single hierarchical command structure, the tribals and the trade guilds are led by independent chiefs.<br/><br/>Units include cataphracted elephants, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; four- (and sometimes eight-!) wheeled chariots, and even an &ldquo;elCH&rdquo; unit &ndash; yes, elephant-pulled chariots.  Rules include Combined Chariot/Infantry and Elephant/Infantry lines, Dharmayudda or &ldquo;just&rdquo; warfare, Guild enmity, and Tribal loyalty.  EL units can even breach camp walls and pull down city gates (if they don&rsquo;t rampage first).<br/><br/>Fans of GBoH will appreciate the exciting variety in Chandragupta&rsquo;s scenarios, from huge set-piece battles on flat plains, to tribal suppressions, a night assault on a military camp, and street fighting in the city of Takshashila.  Chandragupta is the 13th volume in the series.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/><br/>     Pataliputra (319 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s mentor, the Brahmin Chanakya, brashly challenges the Nanda dynasty with a cadre of mercenaries.<br/>     Maghada (317 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta again confronts the Nandas, who are this time led by the formidable general Bhadrasala.<br/>     Mayalaketu (317 BC) &ndash; Chanakya attacks the turncoat general Mayalaketu and his rebel army in camp.<br/>     Takshashila (316 BC) &ndash; the Thracian general Eudamus, allied to Indian king Ambhi, defends the city of Takshashila against Chandragupta&rsquo;s assault.<br/>     Gandhara (304 BC) &ndash; former officer of Alexander the Great, now &ldquo;Master of Babylonia,&rdquo; Seleucus I Nicator crosses the Indus river to invade Gandhara, and is confronted by the Mauryan army at the river&rsquo;s banks.<br/>     Revolt in the Provinces (275 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s grandson, Ashoka, brings a relief force to lift a rebel siege of Takshashila and rescue the aging Chanakya who is holed up in the city&rsquo;s palace.<br/>     Khashas (274 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s son, Bhindusara, puts down a confederation of the independent Khasha kings with an attack on their mountain strongholds.<br/>     Kalinga (261 BC) &ndash; the most famous battle of the Mauryan era, Ashoka&rsquo;s army attacks the kingdom of Kalinga in a huge &ndash; and bloody -- set-piece battle.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each turn, you throw boulders to bid for travelers, who vary in number depending on the weather for that day. Travelers include fat merchants, pilgrims, poor monks (who make good eating), and if you are lucky, royal personages. As travelers come to your bridge, you use them to collect tolls. But watch out! Knights, bandits, dragons, and vicious Billy Goats Gruff prowl the countryside. You'll have to use some of your boulders to chase them away (which means you&rsquo;ll have fewer left to use on your bridge!).<br/><br/>Although you need to collect tolls from travelers so you can buy building supplies, working on your bridge makes you hungry, so you will have to eat some of your travelers instead. It is important to balance tolls with food in order to make your bridge very appealing to travelers. If you eat too many travelers or just collect money, you won't be able to fix up your bridge. The player who uses toll-money, food, and boulders to build the most impressive troll bridge operation wins the game.<br/><br/>First of two &quot;Troll&quot; games by the designer, the second being Trollhalla.<br/><br/>",

The Army of the Potomac and its generals had failed the test of battle again and again. In September, Robert E. Lee invaded the North. One more victory might have turned the war in favor of the Confederacy.<br/><br/>In desperation, Lincoln placed George B. Mc-Clellan in command. The pursuing Union army caught up to the Confederates at Antietam Creek.<br/>With the Confederates outnumbered 2 to 1, and on Union soil, McClellan had the chance to end the war in a single day. It was the bloodiest day in the history of America. In A GLEAM OF BAYONETS, the map illustrates the orchards, corn and wheat fields, as well as the &lsquo;Bloody Lane&rsquo;, which were bitterly fought over.

        "description": "Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.<br/><br/>There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.<br/><br/>During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.<br/><br/>A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).<br/><br/>If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.<br/><br/>The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Monkey Business<br/><br/><br/>",

This was one of the largest and most difficult urban operations of the post-WWII era, and marked a major defeat for Daesh and its so-called &ldquo;Islamic State.&rdquo; The game is thus able to combine low complexity (and hence be accessible to even neophyte wargamers) with a rich and detailed treatment of this important battle.<br/><br/>Unlike most wargames where there is a single measure for victory or loss, We Are Coming, Nineveh assesses three key aspects of the campaign: the speed at which the operation is completed, the casualties suffered by Iraqi government forces, and the collateral damage done to Mosul. One might outperform the historical case, capturing the Old City faster&mdash;but at a terrible civilian cost.<br/><br/>",

The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.<br/><br/>The new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.<br/><br/>",

Peaceful coexistence brings wealth and prosperity to all, but the fearsome Aztec gods favor those who are mighty in war and bring to them their subdued enemies as cruel offerings...<br/><br/>Only one of the four tribes will be granted the right to stay in this blessed land when the Time of Exile comes at the end of the Fifth Age of the Sun. Guide your tribe to build the mightiest empire through the Five Ages, win the favor of the gods, and become the greatest ruler in the land of Aztl&agrave;n.<br/><br/>Aztl&aacute;n can be played by three or four players (or two players with the &quot;Aztec Gods&quot; variant). In a multi-player game, each player guides one of the four tribes. A game is divided into five stages, called ages; at the beginning of each age, each player secretly chooses one of his power cards, and then one at a time places a certain number of his tribe pawns in one of the territories on the game board, which is divided into five different types of territory: deserts, terraced fields, jungles, mountains/volcanoes, and cities. The power card chosen for the age indicates the strength of that player's tribe and identifies one type of territory (of the five different types). The greater the domains of that player, and the greater the number of territories of that type included within them, the higher the victory point score.<br/><br/>If a territory is disputed by several players, the strongest tribe may defeat the weaker ones &ndash; but war is not the only path to victory and peaceful coexistence with the other tribes sometimes brings greater rewards. At the end of the fifth age, the player who scores the most victory points wins. His tribe rules Aztl&aacute;n, while the time of Exile befalls his opponents!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The legend says that in a time of grave danger, masters of the elemental orders will leave their ancestral retreats and join forces to restore peace to the world. From the once-dormant Tekirin volcano, the vengeful Magmaroth has emerged. Born of earth and fire, its goal is to mold the world to its image: primal and ruthless. The time is now for the masters to face their destiny.<br/><br/>The Masters' Trials: Wrath of Magmaroth is a cooperative dice-crafting game in which players represent the masters from the orders that have banded together to face the evil elemental. Each player has a board that represents their character and five dice which they use to apply the effects of their abilities. Each round, they face new minions, generate mana, and get to master new abilities, adding them on their characters. After ten rounds, they come face-to-face with the powerful Magmaroth, which they have to defeat before the whole volcano collapses around them.<br/><br/>The Masters' Trials uses the dice-crafting mechanism made popular in the game Dice City but in a new and exciting way. Each player's character consists of three different boards that represent their class, order, and weapon. These boards determine their initial abilities as well as the ones that the players can master during the game. By combining them in different ways, you can create new characters, allowing for a different experience in each game!<br/><br/>Build your character the best way possible, work together with your fellow players, roll your dice, and use the powerful techniques you have mastered in order to defeat Magmaroth before he destroys everything!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monster Match is unique among speed games for one simple reason: more than 1 person can get a match every round. This sounds minor but it makes a huge difference in game play.<br/><br/>There is usually a dominant player in any given speed game which makes the game frustrating for the other players who have a hard time getting points. In Monster Match, it is possible for every player to score in a round. This makes the game more fun for a greater number of players and it adds a layer of strategy to the game as players decide whether to grab the first match they see or search longer for a match that might be worth more points. Another unique element in Monster Match is that the number of cards on the table changes every round. This creates a dynamic landscape which directly affects your strategic decisions each round between grabbing quickly or taking more time to find a high point card. The end result is a game that is more fun and engaging than other alternatives on the market.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>- Scatter 10 Monster Cards face-up on the table.<br/>- Roll the special Monster Dice.<br/>- Everyone races to find a monster that matches the roll.<br/>- Touch a card with your finger to claim it.  You cannot change your claim once you've touched a card.  <br/>- Each player scores 1 - 3 points depending on the number of donuts on the card they claimed. Incorrect claims lose points.<br/>- The Monster Dice passes to the left.  Rinse and repeat.<br/>- Be the first to claim the &quot;Zilch&quot; token if there are no matches after the die roll.  Get a random card as points and then scatter 10 new Monster Cards on the table.<br/>- The game ends immediately when you cannot replenish the table with 10 new Monster Cards after a Zilch has occurred.<br/><br/>",

To encourage the development, global funds are awarding prizes to companies that are outstanding in different areas. You control one of those companies and want to compete for the biggest, best and most beautiful space station the world has ever seen. But the competition is hard...<br/><br/>In Space Station you start your space station with a core module card on the table, then over six years (rounds) you expand it by paying and placing new module cards. Each year you start with a five card hand, crew tokens and new MegaCredits (money), with the amount of crew and money determined by the structure of your space station. You use money primarily to pay for new modules, and the crew gives you special effects on many of your modules.<br/><br/>During the year, the players take turns doing actions such as building, using module actions, playing event cards, repairing or passing. When everyone passes, the year ends and victory points are awarded: There are six kinds (colors) of modules and for each kind, the player(s) with the most modules of that kind is awarded a victory point. Players' crew tokens are then reset, and player may discard a card before refilling their hand and getting money for the next year.<br/><br/>At the end of the sixth year, the player with most victory point wins.<br/><br/>",

Even despite all the warnings, we were still clogging our sky with smoke and dust driven by short sighted greed. Our planet once green and beautiful, keeps on turning into deathly gray colors.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why the world&rsquo;s brightest minds set into motion this great undertaking. The plan is to transform what we&rsquo;ve already created, into something that would heal our poisoned world and ensure our survival. It&rsquo;s in your hands to design the most efficiently working city, that will take us closer to salvation.<br/>The game&rsquo;s theme is strictly linked with the idea of solarpunk. The core concept is set around the state of the environment we live in. Increasing pollution might air and water to become luxury goods. The solution? Conscious urban planning to use city buildings to produce clean energy, oxygen, and water.<br/><br/>Various buildings are already being used in the real world in such manner and we can find examples like Bosco Verticale in Milan or Pasona Urban Farm in Tokyo.<br/><br/>Solar City is a game where players design the future city. In each turn players choose one of the 3 actions:<br/><br/>● Build a Skyscraper that will bring you profits in the moment of activation<br/>● Build a Public Buildings, that will improve the city structures&rsquo; performance.<br/>● Activate the Vertical Farm &ndash; cover the Skyscrapers in green, activate the wind turbines, release the water flow, install photovoltaic panels, transforming it into a real factory of bioenergy and oxygen.<br/><br/>Each action will activate a part of the city. The player who did that will get the profits from the buildings placed there and, more importantly, will block the possibility of activating this part of the city for the other players. This mechanic force players to adapt their strategy to new situations with each passing minute.<br/><br/>The game contains over a dozen different building types. In every game only six of the will be used. Additionally, the game contains random set of Public Buildings. Thanks to that, every Solar City game will be an unique experience.<br/><br/>The game takes place over the set number of rounds (depending on the player count) or up until the moment when one player fills their entire board. The winner is the one who contributed more to the positive change in worlds environment (gathered the most Oxygen Points).<br/><br/>",

Prepare your plan and your equipment, watch the location that you want to rob, recruit skilled specialists and be ready for anything! Use your specialists to make a fortune while staying one step ahead of the rival gangs, perform Heists all around the world, but don&rsquo;t forget the golden rule: never rob twice in the same city! Now, it&rsquo;s time to roll the dice&hellip;<br/><br/>---- ---- ----<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME:<br/>Recruit the best specialists and assemble your dream team. Rob casinos, Banks and jewelries from the biggest cities in the world. Gain millions and become a legend.<br/><br/>---- ---- ----<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/>A seemingly simple action, such as choosing 1 die from a small common pool, becomes surprisingly multifaceted here. 1 die, only 1 die per round. And a maximum of 12 rounds available to create the perfect gang of specialists to perform 7 heists. Each Specialist requires 1 die to be recruited and 1 die to be activated. Obviously you would like to recruit 1 Specialist per round, because only having a large gang you can make the most profitable heists.

But at the beginning of each round you will get that one, single die.<br/><br/>You will therefore need to be able to recover other dice from bonuses or through the same effects of the specialists you have recruited. Ah, yes, the specialists ... If you have many with the same competence you can get very powerful activations and unlock unique skills. But it will be hard to perform the heists, because very different skills are required in each city. If, on the other hand, your gang is varied, you will have easier access to different casinos, banks or jewelries. But will the weaker activations be enough to provide you with dice, equipment and anything you need for the next rounds? <br/>Finally, remember that you are not alone at the table and that the other gangs are not sitting back.<br/><br/>Which die to choose? How to create the best gang? Differentiate or specialize? Spend the dice or keep them for later? Behind a system of relatively simple rules, there are deep choices that require a good dose of strategy and planning. And the ability to face unforeseen situations.

        "description": "Tabletop baseball simulation game.<br/><br/>In 1971, Time Inc (owner of Sports Illustrated magazine) published their first baseball game, titled Sports Illustrated Major League Baseball.  It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.<br/><br/>Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.<br/><br/>The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.<br/><br/>Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.<br/><br/>",

The clash between the two civilizations is harsh and desperate: the warring creatures can control the field, manipulate the elements, bend the enemy&rsquo;s will. All of it for just one goal: carry the Fragment to their own Portal, to rush back to their dying planet, before anyone else does it. And you, are ready to save your world from extinction?<br/><br/>Soulgivers is a strategy, 1vs1 and 2vs2 game. The goal of Soulgivers is to capture the Fragment, which is located in the center of the board, and deliver it to one of your two Portals.<br/><br/>There are two populations fighting for the Fragment in order to survive a dreadful illness called Decay: Shells and Specters. Both factions are made up of a party of 10 characters, each one of them characterized by particular Abilities and/or an Aura. The two players face off by playing three characters at a time.<br/><br/>Soulgivers gets its name from the fact that when a hero dies, they leave their Soul imbued with their abilities on the battlefield. This Soul can be absorbed by the teammates of the fallen hero, an action that will gift them with added abilities. Only the best and most strategic combination of Soulgivers and Souls will allow you to save your population.<br/><br/>",

This will reveal a different action on the other side which you can use at a later time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you ever have two of the same action available on your turn you may choose to double up. This means that on a single turn you can flip two chips and do double the amount of work.<br/><br/>During play you acquire loan contracts for famous objects, like 'the dice tower of a Roman soldier' or 'the skull of the neanderthal man', from other museums.

The result was The Battle of the Bulge, a brutal struggle in a dismal winter landscape set against an enemy imbued with a fanatic conviction that victory could be snatched from defeat. It was the United States Army's greatest and fiercest battle of World War II. Over a million men and thousands of guns, tanks, and other fighting vehicles were engaged. In those &quot;Bitter Woods,&quot; fighting against heavy odds, the American soldier slowed and then stopped the spearhead of two elite Panzer Armies, forever emblazing themselves in the annals of military history.<br/><br/>Compass Games presents the Designer Edition of this Charles S. Roberts and ORIGINS award nominee. New to this edition are updated unit counter graphics, additional scenarios, and an extended campaign game to allow the Allied counterattack to be fully realized. In addition to the 6 and 8 turn tournament games, Patton's famous relief of Bastogne can be recreated via scenario play. Specific rules include: Mechanized Exploitation Movement, Hidden Fuel Dumps, Leader Units, Reserves, Random Events, Bridge Demolition, Kampfgruppe Peiper Breakout, Skorzeny Infiltration, Air Power, and Artillery Support.<br/><br/>Designer Edition Bitter Woods is the premier edition of this highly acclaimed regimental level Battle of the Bulge game and includes all aspects of the original game plus the expansion edition. The potential for mechanized exploitation movement and an appropriate Allied counterattack capability ensure an exciting challenge for both sides.

Set in 14th century Italy, Ventura puts players in control of warring noble houses, each vying for control of the country's growing wealth. Balance your house&rsquo;s earnings and maintain your hired soldiers to keep your family&rsquo;s noble standing. Remember, the best armies are also the ones that cost the most!<br/><br/>With more than 120 plastic pieces, 40 Territory tiles, 4 Family Boards, a scoring board, and over 100 cards, Ventura will whisk players into a world of warring mercenaries and noble families, all seeking control of Italy&rsquo;s burgeoning wealth.<br/><br/>Added...<br/><br/>Players build a variable map from randomly drawn hexagonal terrain tiles, then maneuver numbered pieces representing groups of associated cards, various types of military units and their leaders.<br/><br/>But the game is financial as well as military. Because everything in this game costs money. Pay money to draw a card. Pay more money to PLAY a card. And once those troops are in action, you better be prepared to pay them every turn or they'll leave. You can use your money (florins) to buy victory points directly (only 30 to win the game). BUT, that leaves you with precious little funds for your defense. Can your opponent(s) field an army fast enough to take out your capital (for the win) before you get there with money?<br/><br/>",

It is a game of high interactive play where both players have a set of ten operation points and a number of supply dumps. <br/>By spending operations points you will be able to perform different, mostly non-combat, actions. By expending a supply dump you will also be allowed to perform combat missions. But there will be a limited number of supply dumps to expend and they will also be needed to keep units in supply. When you spend operation points you will only be allowed to spend one, two or three points in a row before it is your opponents turn to spend his.<br/><br/>This creates a game where you, in the long term, will have to plan and save supply and at the same time be prepared to react to your opponent's actions. <br/>In the short term you will be forced to make decisions based upon the number of operation points you have been given to spend in a row and the missions you need to accomplish.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    22&quot; x 34&quot;  map    <br/>    352 each .6&quot; Game Counters<br/>    24 pages rulebook<br/>    4 ea. 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Charts<br/>    3 ea. 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Information<br/><br/><br/>5 Scenarios + Campaign Game<br/><br/>Map Scale:    12.5 miles per hex<br/>Unit Size:    Regiments / Battalions<br/>Time Scale:    1 month per turn<br/><br/>",

Explore the depths and try to bring the most precious items to the surface. Mark your presence in the different areas to control them and claim their riches.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the six dice up to three times, keeping and re-rolling dice as you wish, to simulate a dive. Dice show the numbers 1-5 and a treasure chest, and when you stop rolling, you place shells on one of the levels that you reached. If, for example, you rolled 1-1-2-3-5-5, you place two shells on level 1, one shell on level 2, or one shell on level 3. You can't place shells on level 5 because you didn't dive through level 4 to get there. If you roll a perfect sequence of 1-2-3-4-5-chest, then you grab one of the five random treasure chests, which are worth 5-8 points, then take another turn. If you don't roll a 1, then you don't place any shells at all!<br/><br/>When the fifth chest has been claimed, the game ends immediately. Alternatively, when someone places their last shell, each other player takes one final turn. On each of the five levels, whoever has placed the most shells scores the main treasure token for that level; whoever has the secondmost shells takes the secondary treasure token, and in a game with 4-5 players, the player with the thirdmost shells also scores. Ties are broken in favor of whoever has the most shells on the level immediately above the one being evaluated. Players sum their points from tokens and chest, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of SPI's Power Politics series, the historical simulation of the military and political conflict of 1918-1921 which abolished the Czarist regime and created the foundation of the Soviet Union.  Each player controls one or more factions drawn from the revolutionary, counter-revolutionary, nationalist and interventionist forces which historically participated.  For this reason, players may even find it advantageous to attack their own forces.  Victory depends first on the side one wants (either revolutionary or counter-revolutionary) winning the war and second on being the  player most successful defeating the forces of the losing side.<br/><br/>Special rules cover the Politburo Central Committee, Purges, the Czar and the Imperial Gold.  Optional rules permit any number of players, as well as solitaire.  A large number of named leader counters are included.  Also there are historical notes, design notes and a 2-page summary of the rules.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by: <br/><br/>    Russian Civil War 1918-1922 (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.<br/><br/>Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.<br/><br/>Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.<br/><br/>",

White begins by placing 1 stone on any empty space. <br/><br/>2. From then on, starting with black, players take turns.

If the players&rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren&rsquo;t the same size.

        "description": "Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany and Italy, was a man of extraordinary culture, energy, and ability. His contemporaries called him &quot;stupor mundi&quot; (&quot;the wonder of the world&quot;), and many historians consider him Europe's first modern ruler. The kingdom Frederick established in Sicily and southern Italy ran on an efficient bureaucracy similar to modern, centrally governed kingdoms.<br/><br/>As one of Frederick II's vassals in Stupor Mundi, you will summon allies from around the Mediterranean, build structures in your castle, and promote specialists to improve your kingdom. You may improve your chances by upgrading your castles: towers house additional allies, walls store more resources, and keeps aid in managing action cards. Through a clever card-selection mechanism, you will have to choose actions carefully, some of which will trigger edicts that affect Frederick's palace, and determine the rewards players may receive from their allies. Do you stay loyal to the Emperor, or do you support independent allies? Keep a close eye on what your opponents do and form alliances at the right time &mdash; or go your own way when things get too heated...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take heed for every move could be your last!<br/><br/>Carthage is a deck-building board game in which players move around a hex-based arena and face off in gladiatorial warfare to earn crowd favor, gain armor, and battle to the death. This game uses blended mechanisms of deck-building, hand management, and a whole lot of ruthless &quot;take-that&quot; combat. A round begins with the combat phase where players play action cards, after which they spend crowd favor points to build better combat options, lobby the crowd for advantages, or assemble their starting deck into a more lethal combination of tactics.<br/><br/>​Carthage utilizes deck-building and miniatures to give players a progressive game experience...ending in a vicious crescendo of blood and glory! Gladiators start in the theater as weak combatants, but as their actions gain crowd favor, they can develop their tactics (deck) into a lethal combination of damage, armor, and movement on the hex-based arena.<br/><br/>Featuring a unique modular ruleset which allows players to alter the game complexity, play time, and strategic depth!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT web site :)<br/><br/>Glory III is the third game in GMT's popular American Civil War series, Glory. This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.<br/><br/>Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.<br/><br/>Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws. Has Jubal bitten off more than he can chew? Grab your wallet, roll the die and find out!<br/><br/>Designed gloriously by Richard H Berg, Developed with consummate skill and dedication by a new star on the industry horizon, Jim Dauphinais, playtested to a fine edge, and featuring the usual eye-popping, drool-inducing GMT graphics, Glory III is the best game yet in the Glory series.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>     1 22 x 34 backprinted map<br/>     2 counter sheets<br/>     Rulebook<br/>     1 die<br/>     Player Aid Cards <br/><br/><br/>Designer: Richard Berg<br/>Developer: Jim Dauphinais<br/><br/>Game 3 in the GMT Glory: The Battles of First & Second Manassas and Chickamauga, 1861-63 Civil War game series. This series features battles recreated at the Brigade level with each game in the series featuring 2 battles from the Civil War. In this edition of the series the two battles are Antietam and Cedar Creek.<br/><br/>The Glory system features a unique chit activation mechanic. This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.  Scenarios run from 2 hours for Burnside's late afternoon attack at Antietam, up to 6 hours for Cedar Creek and up to 12 hours for the full battle of Antietam (if it needs to go the distance for a decision).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.<br/><br/>(7 of the games are described below)<br/><br/>The Wheel of History : 2-5 players<br/><br/>This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.<br/><br/>The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players<br/><br/>This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>Mercator : 3-7 players<br/><br/>This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.<br/><br/>Imperium : 3-5 players<br/><br/>The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.<br/><br/>Senator : 2-3 players<br/><br/>You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus : 3-5 players<br/><br/>A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.<br/><br/>Consul : 2-4 players<br/><br/>This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.<br/><br/>Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.<br/><br/>",

One of which is the addition of transporting lumber&mdash;a huge export from the region&mdash;that can't be carried by E-trains, but by engineering the right 7-train route you can add a significant amount of revenue to your bottom line.<br/><br/>Finally, one big departure from the '22 family is that 1822PNW does away with concessions and instead features a merger mechanic that more closely mirrors the way in which the major companies staked their claim in the PNW.<br/><br/>All of the features combine for a refreshing and exciting take on the genre-defining 1822 series.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sigismundus Augustus: Dei gratia rex Poloniae is a board game for 3 to 5 players. During the game, each player rules one of the 16th-century noble families. The aim is to establish the position of the House in Rzeczpospolita and in the international arena. To gain more prestige than other players and win the game, each House has to fight for the influence in Sejm or for authority among neighbors, while also maintaining a strong and effective army.<br/><br/>Famous families compete in a game for the title of the first magnate in Rzeczpospolita. Who meets the challenge gains eternal glory and enters the history books!<br/><br/><br/>Sigismundus Augustus ist ein Brettspiel f&uuml;r 3 bis 5 Spieler. Die Spieler leiten die Adelsgeschlechter aus dem 16. Jahrhundert. Der Zweck ist die Begr&uuml;ndung ihrer Position in Rzeczpospolita und auf internationaler Ebene. Um das zu erzielen, muss jedes Adelsgeschlechtr um den Einfl uss im Sejm und das Geh&ouml;r bei den Nachbarn k&auml;mpfen und eine kr&auml;ftige und erfolgreiche Armee haben.<br/><br/>Im Wettbewerb um den Titel der ersten Magnaten von Rzeczpospolita stehen auch andere Adelsgeschlechte. Wer stellt sich der Herausforderung, verschafft sich ewigen Ruhm und geht in die Geschichte ein?<br/><br/><br/>Rzeczpospolita szlachecka w najlepszym wydaniu! Pokieruj jednym z magnackich rod&oacute;w walcząc o potęgę i wpływy w jednym z największych mocarstw XVI-wiecznej Europy.<br/><br/>Dr&oacute;g do celu jest wiele. Możesz wykazać się żołnierską fantazją, wejść na ścieżkę polityki zagranicznej i pozyskać potężnych sojusznik&oacute;w z innych państw Europy, lub też zyskać sławę i poparcie na sejmach decydując o wewnętrznej polityce Rzeczpospolitej. Nie zaniedbuj jednak kultury - stań się mecenasem sztuki, przyjmując pod swoją opiekę artyst&oacute;w, kt&oacute;rzy będą wychwalali Tw&oacute;j r&oacute;d w swoich nieśmiertelnych dziełach. W walce o tytuł pierwszego magnata Rzeczpospolitej będziesz miał licznych konkurent&oacute;w. Czy sprostasz wyzwaniu i osiągniesz wieczną chwałę oraz stałe miejsce w historii Rzeczpospolitej?<br/><br/>Akcja gry Sigismundus Augustus zaczyna się w 1548 r. od objęcia rząd&oacute;w przez Zygmunta Augusta. Kończy się zaś śmiercią monarchy w 1572 r. W tym czasie graczom przyjdzie decydować o najważniejszych sprawach państwowych dotyczących wewnętrznej sytuacji kraju oraz roli Polski na arenie międzynarodowej.<br/><br/>Gra oparta jest na dw&oacute;ch gł&oacute;wnych mechanikach (licytacja oraz worker placement), kt&oacute;re znakomicie oddają klimat XVI-wiecznej Polski. W trakcie swojej rundy gracze będą wysyłać klient&oacute;w swojego rodu, aby wykonywali dla nich najr&oacute;żniejsze sprawy: od prowadzenia zaciągu, poprzez pozyskiwanie ważnych osobistości i stronnik&oacute;w, aż po zagraniczne misje dyplomatyczne. Mechanika licytacji zostanie natomiast wykorzystana podczas rozgrywania kolejnych sejm&oacute;w, na kt&oacute;re szlachta była zwoływana przez panującego władcę. Gracze, w trakcie trwania szlacheckich zjazd&oacute;w, dzięki pozyskanemu poparciu posł&oacute;w, senator&oacute;w oraz kr&oacute;la, będą walczyć o obsadzenie najważniejszych urzęd&oacute;w w państwie. Zadecydują r&oacute;wnież o uchwaleniu, lub nie, najistotniejszych dla &oacute;wczesnych dziej&oacute;w RP ustaw. Nie będzie to jednak czysta gra, w kt&oacute;rej niejednokrotnie złoto odegra istotną rolę w pozyskaniu poparcia.<br/><br/>W Sigismundus Augustus występuje także element walki. W grze funkcjonują 3 rodzaje jednostek: piechota, husaria i artyleria. Dzięki użyciu prywatnych armii gracze będą mogli skutecznie zaszkodzić innym graczom porywając ich sprzymierzeńc&oacute;w, grabiąc ich majątek lub też dokonując zajazdu na dw&oacute;r znienawidzonego rodu.<br/><br/>",

At stake is control of Midway Atoll in the Central Pacific. The US player must risk his navy's three carriers to try to keep it; the Japanese player must risk his four carriers to try to take it.<br/><br/>The atoll and the aircraft carriers are each represented by their own card. Players throw reconnaissance cards to find and fix the enemy's location, then play other cards representing attacking squadrons. Some find their targets, others don't. Sometimes the enemy shows up over your fleet without warning. Everything often hinges - literally and figuratively - on the timely throw of one card.<br/><br/>Lightning Game Series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over the past centuries, the Ruhr region in Germany has been shaped and dominated by coal mining. At the end of 2018, the last coal mine in Bottrop closed its doors, bringing to an end an era in the Ruhr region that is second to none.<br/><br/>The game Schichtwechsel takes up this theme and shows simplified typical areas around the coal mining in the Ruhr area of the 1950s. As a player and administrator of a coal mine, you experience an exciting competition and live through a piece of Ruhr Valley history. You bring coal and overburden from underground to the surface, let your miner go through a &quot;shift at the colliery&quot;, produce coke, or build the typical colliery settlements.<br/><br/>A game of Schichtwechsel takes place over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases: The preparation phase in which, among other things, the amount of mined coal is determined; the action phase in which players use their action pieces wisely in turn; and a small end-of-round evaluation. After the fifth round is a final scoring. Schichtwechsel offers you many possibilities to get the best out of your coal mine in order to score as many victory points as possible at the end.<br/><br/>This game is the revised and improved version of the game Die letzte Zeche, which was created between June 2017 and March 2018 as a contribution of the games group Fair-Spielt of the Spielezentrum Herne to the funding project &quot;GL&Uuml;CK AUF JUGEND&quot;. The RAG Foundation's sponsorship project honors the achievements of coal mining on the occasion of the coal phase-out and the closure of the last mines at the end of 2018.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player is building a time line of cards. A card contains an event and the year in which it occurred. Players start with just one card, which are then placed face up under their &quot;Time lock.&quot; On his/her turn, a player rolls the dice to see which category he will have and then is read an event from the next card. The player must then indicate the position on his own time line where the card should be placed. If he's correct he takes possession of the card and places it above his Time lock (timeline) and he may stop or continue trying another card. If at any time a player does not correctly insert the card into the right place on their Time line, they lose all the cards they have accumulated this turn in order to keep cards permanently, players must end their turn with a correct answer.  First player with 10 cards in the correct order in their Time line wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1969 is a push-your-luck style game in which players take the role of the leader of a particular nation's space program attempting the first successful lunar landing mission.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players use their income to hire scientists to research technology to improve their chances of success, hire spies to slow other players down, purchase cards to influence their missions and their competitors, or attempt easier, preparatory missions. Players gain victory points for performing well on prep missions, attracting famous scientists to their cause and, of course, how far they got on the Moon landing mission.<br/>The core of the game are the mission tests, which consist of rolling five dice. Dice have success, neutral, and failure results, which add respectively to your success rating, do nothing, or subtract from it. The total of your successes will determine the points you earn from the mission and whether you'll get a bonus on the final lunar mission or not. Die rolls can be affected by technology and your success can be influenced by having scientists research relevant tech and by cards played by any player.<br/><br/>1969 combines simple dice mechanics with elements of resource management and even some light engine building to make an interesting lightweight experience. There are some mechanics of player interference (meaning players can disrupt each other's progress), but these elements can be avoided if desired.<br/><br/>",

If you can't play in time to the rhythm, you're penalized, so you must talk quickly to share information and decide which cards to play.

As a mighty king, you have a grand opportunity to expand your empire by building new villages here. Unfortunately, many of your fellow rulers also hope to stake their claim in this new world. Whose villages will stand, and whose will fall?<br/><br/>Each card has a gold value, and your goal is to earn 100 gold pieces across multiple rounds by building villages. Do this by collecting three unit cards of the same color and laying them down. If an enemy puts down a card you'd like to have, it's time for battle! Send out your village's finest hero or hire one in secret by playing it face-down from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Play the stronger card, and you'll be able to take a prisoner from your enemy's village and make it part of your own.<br/><br/>However, it's not enough to simply send your most powerful units to attack neighboring kingdoms. Each unit has its own winning strategies: knights excel at defense, the wizard's power falters only when facing enemies of the same color, the dragon's strength increases with each enemy he defeats, and heroes become much stronger when you're in last place. These are only a few of the 15 different unit types you'll command. With the right combination of luck and skill, you'll always come out on top.<br/><br/>War is one way to expand your empire, but it is certainly not the only way. Perhaps you'd like to avoid conflict altogether. Take on the role of a benevolent king who gives freely to other players, and you'll win bonus gold for being the first to empty their hand and end the round. However you choose to play, there are strategic choices to be made. How will you rule?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mexican Train is a fairly recently developed variation of Domino train type games that has become extremely popular.  Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.<br/><br/>Although Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominos, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the &quot;Mexican train&quot;, and a &quot;woo woo!&quot; train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as &quot;Mexican Train Dominoes&quot; that include all the necessary components to play.<br/><br/>A double-twelve domino set has 91 tiles. The goal is for the players to get rid of their dominoes. Starting with the highest double tile placed in the middle of the table, which is the station, each player creates a line of dominoes. This is their train. Another train, the &quot;Mexican Train,&quot; can be played on by anyone. In the event that a player cannot play at all, even after drawing a new tile, she must place a marker (often little colored plastic trains that come with the game) on their train which allows others to play on her train temporarily until the marker is removed.<br/><br/>As soon as one player is out of dominoes, the other players add up the value of their remaining tiles. At the end of the evening, the player with the lowest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grifters operate on the fringes of The Dystopian Universe, eager to take advantage of every opportunity to profit from the chaos caused by the resistance. Players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills. During the game, the players' criminal teams will steal ISK from the government, powerful corporations, and each other via cons, blackmail, daring heists, and a multitude of other nefarious deeds. As always, money is power in The Dystopian Universe and the player with the most ISK at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Grifters: Nexus is a standalone game that is also an expansion for Grifters, which was released by Indie Boards and Cards in 2016. Nexus uses the same core &quot;cool down&quot; mechanisms found in Grifters, and introduces 15 new specialist cards, new mechanisms and a new job card system.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TROLL, published by Oink Games in 2015, is a revised version of Dragon Teeth Washer, originally published by Drosselmeyer in 2012. In TROLL, each player takes the role of a thief, trying to steal precious jewels from the hideous troll.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of six tokens, with numbers from 0 to 5. Depending the number of the players, some troll cards are not used (Troll cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). On a round, players attempt to steal from the target troll by playing his or her tokens in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a &quot;3&quot; token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.<br/><br/>After all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the troll is &quot;9&quot; and Amy played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Carlos &quot;2&quot;, and Dave &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Carlos (2), Amy (3), and Dave (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) jewels respectively. However, Becky will receive a penalty point (-2), since she woke up the troll. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the troll's rampage.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds/days (set of rounds), depending the number of the players. The player with the most jewels at the game end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Like traditional werewolf games, Ultimate Werewolf Extreme has all sorts of roles and a moderator to run the game, but Extreme reworks this in several ways:<br/><br/><br/>     A free, moderator assisting app that helps create and execute games with ease - automatically scanning each player's face and role using micro QR code technology<br/>    An abundance of information on each card: role name, role description, role art, team, traditional balance value, info value, moderator difficulty, wake order, wake frequency, game length impact, and special considerations.<br/>     A new role-balancing system based on information vs. the number of werewolves in any size game.<br/>     Optional rules to increase difficulty, such as invisible Lycans, alternate nominees, celebrations after werewolf elimination that reduce village abilities, and elected judges that determine whether a nominated player is eliminated or not.<br/>     Enough cards in the base game to play three simultaneous games of Ultimate Werewolf Extreme.<br/><br/><br/>Most importantly, the game is integrated with a new app that makes moderating easier than ever before. No more writing down all of the roles and who is assigned to them, or trying to remember some of the complex interactions that happen when using multiple special abilities. The app has two major parts: A deck configuration tool, and a game moderator assistant. The deck configuration tool creates a deck based on user-set parameters, such as number of players, moderator difficulty, info value, or traditional role balance.<br/><br/>The game moderator assistant automatically scans cards, player names, and player faces, placing them into the app and using that information to run the game. While a moderator is still required to run the game and monitor the app, much of the critical bookkeeping, such as tracking the players who are still in the game, which actions should happen in what order at night, and timing each of the games all happen automatically. This app is not needed to play, but it will make moderating a breeze with a timer, turn order, and loads of special features!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper &amp; Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.<br/><br/>To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.<br/><br/>The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.<br/><br/>Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Les Colons de Catane: Le jeu de dés.<br/><br/>",

Players need to combine cards to hit and slay the monsters before they destroy the castle. The card combos available in Munchkin Panic are created from a unique mixing of the decks of the two source games. Each defeated monster becomes a trophy and gives up its treasure to the victor. If players work together to defeat the monsters, the player with the highest point count becomes Master Munchkin &mdash; but players must balance their self-interest with the cooperation necessary to survive. If players get too greedy, the monsters will stomp the castle flat while the players are too busy fighting amongst themselves!<br/><br/>",

The tree trunk &mdash; which is the game container in many versions &mdash; is placed in the middle of the table with the lid on it. On a turn, a player announces that they'll play 1-3 cards, then they turn the cards over from their deck one by one, placing them on the tree as required by what's depicted on the card. If the card shows only foliage, then you can place it anywhere; if it shows a flower or monkey, then you must make the card hang over the edge so that the &quot;ground&quot; depicted on the card has no part of the tree underneath it. The snake must be placed between two other cards, the toucan tossed on top from a foot away, the leopard dropped straight onto the tree from a foot above, and the bat dropped onto the tree &mdash; but only after you close your eyes before extending your arm over the table! The beehive card can't be covered by anything except foliage and flowers, while the chameleon copies the card previously played.<br/><br/>If any cards fall off the tree while you're adding something to it, then you place those cards (and any cards that you've yet to place that turn) in a personal penalty pile. As soon as someone places their final card, the game ends. Players count the cards remaining in their deck with those in their penalty pile, and whoever has the fewest cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft, known worldwide for his short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;. In the game, you evoke the powers of the Ancient Ones to drive your fellow cultists mad while securing your path to victory. To play, you first deal each player two cards from a deck that contains cards numbered 6-12, then you count out 17 face-down cards, flip the remainder face up, shuffle the deck, then lay it out in a row so that all players can see the cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, you either take 1-3 cards, open a portal, or open an investigation. When you take card, you pick up the first 1-3 cards in the row, then add them to your hand. To open a portal, you lay down three or more cards of the same type, then take the portal matching the number on those cards. Each portal has a different power, and you can use any one portal power on your turn. If someone else claims a portal that you own, too bad! You just lost the portal! To open an investigation, discard cards numbered 6-12, after which every other player gains as many madness tokens as the number of investigations this round.<br/><br/>A round ends when one player runs out of cards or the card row runs out. In the latter case, everyone takes one final turn, then all players gain madness tokens equal to the number of different types of cards in their hand. If a player empties their hand, that player loses half of their madness tokens while everyone else gains one.<br/><br/>The game ends the round that a player has collected ten or more madness tokens.<br/><br/>",

Both sides are as evenly matched as one gets during the war, and there is a constant stream of reinforcement keeping both players in the game up to the end.<br/><br/>2nd Bull Run is one of General Robert E. Lee's greatest victories, in which he smashed John Pope's politically riddled Union army, setting the stage for the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) several weeks later.<br/><br/>Red Badge of Courage uses version 4.3 of the GBACW system, building on lessons learned from the two previous battle games in the series.

As the scout team explores further, the jungle divides into many sections, and some of your teammates might even get lost (never to be found again).<br/><br/>",

The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.<br/><br/>Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.<br/><br/>The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.<br/><br/>A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.<br/><br/>The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.<br/><br/>Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series<br/><br/>",

Each movement card has from two to four programmed moves &mdash; straight, turn, rotate any direction and leap over a space &mdash; with some moves being mandatory when played and others being optional.<br/><br/>Your tranquil koi pond begins with some decorative stone and a few lily pads, but you will also receive natural beauty cards in your hand that allow a player to add more lily pads, cherry blossoms, ornamental stone and frogs &mdash; which both enhances the beauty of the pond and causes turmoil beneath the still waters for the other koi. Lily pads are great as they spawn dragonflies every turn, each of which is worth 3 victory points when eaten. Cherry blossoms ripple the surface of the water as they land, causing all living things to scatter in the opposite direction &mdash; and if you play the blossoms wisely, right into your mouth! Stones prevent fish from entering a space and are best placed to block an opponent's path to a meal. Frogs are delicious 1 VP meals all their own, but they also eat dragonflies in adjacent spaces, so often they are placed to deprive opponents of their dinner.<br/><br/>As the weather changes and a new event card is revealed for the day in KOI, so must your strategy change. At the end of seven days, the game comes to an end, with the best-fed fish being declared the winner. Be wise, be quick, or go hungry. Persevere and you shall succeed.<br/><br/>Also features a solo play mode, where you must outscore a programmed AI opponent, with adjustable difficulty settings.<br/><br/>",

Two full battles are included:<br/> Cedar Mountain<br/>August 9th, 1862.  With the Peninsular Campaign winding down, Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Maj. Gens. Stonewall Jackson and A.P. Hill to attack Maj. Gen. John Pope&rsquo;s new Federal Army of Virginia  with 27,000 troops.<br/><br/>Gen. John Pope, hoping to draw attention away from Maj. Gen. George McClellan&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Peninsula, moved against the rail junction at Gordonsville, Va.   Stonewall Jackson found USA Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&rsquo;s division isolated.  Jackson crossed the Rapidan River to engage.  Pope ordered Brig. Gen. James Ricketts&rsquo;s division to unite with Banks&rsquo;s forces on high ground near Cedar Run, seven miles south of the town of Culpeper.  These two forces met in the afternoon heat.<br/> South Mountain<br/>September 14th, 1862.  After the CSA success at Second Bull Run Gen. Robert E. Lee believed the demoralized USA armies could not respond to any bold action.  Thusly, he planned a campaign to raid Maryland and Pennsylvania and to threaten Washington D.C. itself.  Once again Lee confidently divided his army to both move north and neutralize the large Union garrison at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.<br/><br/>However, the Union Army under Gen. George B. McClellan was quick to recover from the Bull Run defeat and was already in pursuit of Lee.  The gods of war smiled on the Union troops as a copy of Lee&rsquo;s orders fell into Union hands.  An attack through the lightly held gaps at South Mountain would cut Lee&rsquo;s army in two and perhaps end the war.  At 6:00 am the Union Army moved.<br/><br/>The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:<br/>This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game -Terrible Swift Sword (SPI)- designed by Richard Berg in 1976.  Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles.  The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level. <br/><br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Twin Peaks contains two battle games each with its own full size map on one double-sided mapsheet. Experienced players will be able to play either in one sitting.  Both battles highlight the effects of fatigue from the late summer heat and the difficult terrain.  The optional fatigue rules are mandatory in both battles.  The Cedar Mountain battle also includes optional units which could have joined the battle.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance, The Initial Campaigns on the Western Front in WWI realistically covers the battles fought in Belgium, France, and Germany during the first months of World War One.<br/><br/>1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance (translation: Offensive to excess) is a comprehensively researched model that explores this fascinating set of campaigns with an accurate order of battle and detailed game map. The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent &ldquo;Open Flank&rdquo; present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies&rsquo; armies in 1914.<br/><br/>The Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.<br/><br/>1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a playable &ldquo;Monster Game&rdquo; designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a game that the &ldquo;WW1 enthusiast&rdquo; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.<br/><br/>Time Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.<br/>Map Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.<br/>Unit Scale: Division/Brigade.<br/>Number of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).<br/><br/>Game Designer: Michael Resch<br/>Research and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren<br/>Developed by: Dick Vohlers<br/>Map Design Assistance: S.

Amidst all the merriment, a terrible crime occurs &mdash; the robbery of the priceless Lebombo Bone artefact.<br/><br/>Evidence of the theft has been scattered across the museum grounds. Only Ada Lovelace &mdash; pioneer of the Analytical Machine and part-time sleuth &mdash; is up to the challenge of solving the crime. Time is of the essence and she must work quickly to examine each room of the museum and assess each piece of evidence. She has only minutes before the trail goes cold.<br/><br/>In Ada Lovelace: Consulting Mathematician, players assemble polyomino pieces on a map of the Archimedes&rsquo; Museum of Mathematics, aiming to capture key pieces of criminal evidence. Doing so may grant the player extra abilities they can use in future turns, allowing them to more efficiently search the map. After five rounds, the player scores points based on how many pieces of evidence were captured, how many rooms were searched, and how many abilities were unlocked.<br/><br/>Ada Lovelace: Consulting Mathematician is a solo roll-and-write game. It was a finalist in the GenCan't Roll and Write Contest, 2017.<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is to faithfully simulate World War II in the European Theater, with simple rules, in exciting games of short duration (3-5 hours).<br/><br/>The warring factions and the countries that comprise them at the start of the game are:<br/>&bull; Axis (Germany and Finland).<br/>&bull; Allies (United Kingdom and France)<br/>&bull; Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Other major and minor countries will join the war later on in the game. Each player controls one side. With two players, one player leads the Allies and the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Twenty-two three-month turns are played, starting in winter 1940, when Germany is preparing to invade France (having started World War II by invading Poland) and the Soviet Union has already attacked Finland.<br/><br/>Player can do several actions in each turn:<br/>1. Supply<br/>2. Reinforcements (Major Powers)<br/>3. Armor Production<br/>4. Air Missions<br/>5. Submarine Missions (Axis only)<br/>6. Development<br/>7. Lend Lease (Allies only).<br/><br/>Moving and attacking do not spend any action but players need to have enough supply (action 1) to do them.<br/>Players can also perform Submarine Warfare and Strategic Bombing if they have enough Air and Submarine Missions (actions 4 and 5)<br/><br/>",

Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.<br/><br/>The Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.<br/><br/>Designed by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?&quot;<br/><br/>This is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 &quot;flats&quot; of tiles total (16 &quot;fixed&quot;, 38 &quot;standard&quot;, and 38 &quot;rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Maelstrom Expansion Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad.<br/><br/>&quot;Roads to Stalingrad&quot; is the first volume of the Campaign Commander Series and depicts the campaign in southern Russia from the summer of 1942 to the end of the winter of 1943. After a terrible first winter in Russia, the German troops reorganized and readied themselves to launch the offensive to end the war. The soviets got ready first; they launched an attack to retake Kharkov that ended in disaster for the troops involved. After finishing this offensive the Axis forces - numbering many Hungarians, Romanians and Italians - launched, at the beginning of July 1942 the operation code named &quot;Case Blue&quot;. German advance seemed unstoppable, reaching the Caucasus and the banks of the river Volga. At the city of Stalingrad the German army would experience a real nightmare fighting through August to October in an attempt to conquer it. Control of the city meant that the Germans could cut the traffic along the Volga, while for the Soviets it became a symbol of resistance against the invaders. Both Stalin and Hitler sent more and more troops to the cauldron of that destroyed city, into the fiercest and bloodiest battle ever known in history. In the event, conquering the city was rather useless to the Germans since, beginning on the 19th of November, Operation Uranus was launched and Marshall Zhukov could trap the German 6th Army into the ruins just won. Successive soviet offensives destroyed the Italian, Romanian and Hungarian armies on the river Don, forcing the Germans to evacuate their conquests in the Caucasus and endangering even the survival of the whole German Army Group South. Only the timely intervention of Marshall Erich von Manstein allowed the Germans to stop the Soviet advance and stabilize the front, thus saving an already catastrophic situation.<br/><br/>The game is played at the operational level - with a zonal map at a 1:120000 scale. Designed for two players, one handles the Axis while the other commands the Soviets. The game has an estimated playing time of 3-4 hours and uses a double system of counters/map and cards in its mechanics. Players must use appropriately their troops and resources to obtain victory points either by destroying enemy forces or by occupying cities on the map. This is not a card driven game, cards are used for causing certain events, influence the outcome of battles and to place on map the necessary resources and reinforcements to fight on.<br/><br/>The game starts in summer, the Axis player has the initiative and will mercilessly and relentlessly pound the Soviets. The Soviet player will have to hope for the winter - a card to be played given certain conditions - to stop the Axis advance and defeat them.<br/><br/>As the other titles in the series, this game has very simple rules and has been designed to make games wholly interactive, creating a solid and enjoyable experience for those who simply cannot find the time and space to play a longer and more complex game.<br/><br/>The Axis player must face the historical disjunctive, should he concentrate on taking the Caucasus, Stalingrad or both? The Soviet player will have to be patient and force his enemy to overextend his resources, at the same time managing to accumulate forces for a lethal winter offensive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>King Philip&rsquo;s War, is about an all but forgotten New England Indian Uprising that nearly brought the Puritans to their knees. In the end, over 6000 Indians were slain or captured and sold into slavery. Over 2600 Colonials were captured or killed. In the end King Philip (The Wampanoag sachem, Metacomet) himself was ambushed, beheaded, and quartered. King Philip's hands were sent to the authorities in Plymouth as proof of his demise. Countless Indian villages had been burned; twelve Colonial settlements were completely destroyed and six more heavily damaged. Boston itself very nearly came under attack. In all, 1200 homes were burned, 8000 head of cattle lost, and vast stores of food destroyed. Some sources claim one soldier in ten on both sides was either injured or killed.<br/><br/>The game's treatment of this broad conflict is simplified. Only a handful of key settlements are named for historical interest while rivers and settlements are placed not so much for geographic and historic accuracy but for ease of play. The forces involved are also necessarily reduced to create a simpler, quicker game. But, taking these factors into account, King Philip&rsquo;s War is as faithful a historical reproduction of the conflict as any quick and simple board game can be. Moreover, KPW&rsquo;s massive destruction, ongoing tension, along with its magnificent art, its singular system of alliances and its unique combat effects die make the game delicious to look at and a real treat to play.

        "description": "FOR-EX is the game of currency trading. An opaque, nerdy, butterfly-effect game, players take on the roles of international financiers who trade and manipulate currency values. Each of the game's several currencies only has value relative to one another, and these fluctuate according to player investments and divestments.<br/><br/>Players primarily make money by making long-term contracts to trade an amount of currency X for its equivalent in currency Y. Those contracts will be resolved several turns hence, during which time the exchange rate may have changed. But the contract is resolved according to the original, agreed-upon rate, enabling players to make profit. Players can (and should) make contracts promising money they don't yet have, and may use the resultant loans to give them a temporary leg-up (provided that they think they can make up the difference before the loan comes due).<br/><br/>Once the game begins, there is zero randomness; every subtle, lovely tweak to the game state is the net result of the decisions each player makes. The game concludes when a player goes bankrupt, or when the last dividend has been paid. At that point, all monies are converted to the single strongest currency, and the player with the most money of that type wins.<br/><br/>",

Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player leads a crime syndicate and relies on their lieutenants and henchmen to become the most influential around rich districts of the city.<br/><br/>Set in a Steampunk universe, Noxford gives you the opportunity to take control of a Victorian city made up of cards. In turn, players place in the game either cards depicting influence of their syndicate, or neutral cards representing rich districts (victory points) as well as barracks (which cancel syndicate influence around those areas). Cards must be placed so that they touch at least two cards already in play and must have at least two edges aligned on the edges of the cards that it touches.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player plays their last syndicate card. Then, players win neutral districts if they have more syndicate cards than their opponents around. Neutral districts give 1 victory point per symbol on them, and a +2 bonus if the district depicts the favorite field of the player's syndicate. The player with the most victory points controls the city and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.<br/><br/>Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.<br/><br/>Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.<br/><br/>If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.<br/><br/>",

During a turn, you ask for information about three different references in which you are interested. The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand.<br/><br/>After each round ends, players can try to uncover the scandal.

A combined-arms assault, plus the use of new artillery techniques, initially smashed the German trench line.  In several places, the attackers suffered almost no casualties and, by the end of the day, recorded gains of three to four miles. Would it be possible, this time, to break through to the &ldquo;green fields beyond&rdquo;? British euphoria over the success of the offensive was dampered only by the loss of 47% of their tanks on the first day.<br/><br/>A two player game simulating the British assault to breach the &ldquo;Hindenburg Line&rdquo; between November 20 and December 3, 1917. One player controls the British forces, the other the German forces. The object of the game is to control a certain number of areas on the map or, for the British, to exit units off the map into certain perimeter zones.  An area-movement game which uses impulse mechanics (where players alternate &quot;mini-turns&quot;) similar to popular games like Breakout: Normandy and Monty's Gamble: Market Garden. The impulse nature of the game means little or no down time for each player while waiting for the other to complete a move or attack.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day broken down into 4 phases and impulses<br/>Area: 1 inch equals 1/6 mile / 268 meters<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (240 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Breakthrough: Cambrai rulebook<br/>One 12-page Breakthrough: Cambrai playbook<br/>Six single-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>Four 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as a deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>Yomi: Round 1 is a standalone item that contains four characters (out of twenty) for the second edition of Yomi. With these characters, you can compete in 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, and solo modes, with each player in the game needing one character deck. The character decks in Yomi: Round 1 can also be played against those in Yomi: Round 2 or any of the individual character decks that comprise the second edition of Yomi. As for the characters, they are:<br/><br/>&bull; Grave<br/><br/><br/>    Versatile and powerful, including one of the most powerful super moves in the game.<br/>    If you can read the opponent well, you'll get more Dragonheart attacks than usual.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Jaina<br/><br/><br/>    Jaina can attack a lot and buyback her attacks by paying life.<br/>    She can take risks with Unstable Power in order to get even more super moves than usual. <br/>    Even her blocked moves deal more damage than other characters'.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Midori<br/><br/><br/>    Midori can transform into a green dragon, and then his moves are much more powerful.<br/>    He's a grappler with good defense.<br/>    In Dragon Form, he can block to fetch cards from his discard pile to build a great hand.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Setsuki<br/><br/><br/>    After doing a combo, Setsuki can usually refill her hand.<br/>    Very fast attacks. <br/>    Some ninja tricks to recur certain cards and to escape danger.<br/><br/><br/>Note: This item contains:<br/>Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina<br/>Yomi Starter Set: Midori versus Setsuki<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swords and Bagpipes tells a story about the confrontation between England and Scotland. It is the First War of Scottish Independence. The victory is possible only if all clans unite!<br/><br/>But Scottish aristocrats often prefer personal enrichment to fighting for freedom. At the same time, King Edward I of England, nicknamed Hammer of the Scotts, pays generously to those who join his side!<br/><br/>Each round, English army invades the lands of Scotland. Players take on the roles of Scottish clan leaders. They hire troops and send them to battle. Then each rival secretly decides which side he will support: England or Scotland. The Choice tokens are flipped simultaneously. Each side sums up their strengths (the traitors join the English army). Then the winning side of the battle is proclaimed.<br/><br/>Swords and Bagpipes is based on the famous Prisoner’s Dilemma. As a rule, treachery brings more gold. At the end, the richest player wins the game! However, if England conquers Scotland, the winner is not the richest player, but the player who had betrayed fewer times. Since Scotland can be defeated but not broken, its clans will need to rally around the most loyal clan!<br/><br/>Remember the movie Braveheart with Mel Gibson? Freedom-loving patriots, corrupt aristocrats, and the cruelty of the English king. It's all there in the game, and it&rsquo;s what its participants will experience!<br/><br/>",

This is standard play. Once activated, player rolling doubles of monster die&rsquo;s face-up number has to turn monster die down 1.  A double 6 turns monster die to 5, a double 5 turns it to 4 &amp; so on. When monster die is on 1, snake eyes (double 1s) ends game. Monster gets in FoS &amp; eats you! BUT . . . either player can be a hero by tossing 1 of their outside standing meeps onto monster die! That meep is forever gone (but not forgotten). However, next double 1s ends the game unless another jumps on. Sacrificing a meep doesn&rsquo;t need a 7 &amp; can be done in or out of FoS but only when monster die is on 1.<br/>     OMG mode activates monster die when the game starts. Faster game but it sucks to be human.<br/><br/><br/>",

WHO WILL BE VICTORIOUS?<br/>You command an army of soldiers, machines, scouts and miners. <br/>Devise a plan and deploy your troops. Use strategic attack and clever deception to break through your opponent's line, but beware of bombs and enemy spies. Capture the flag, and victory is yours!&quot;<br/><br/>Two players position their game pieces on a chess-like board but in a configuration unknown to each other: token values can only be seen from one side. <br/>On a turn, a player moves a token horizontally or vertically. If the token lands on a square occupied by the enemy, the two tokens are revealed and their values compared. If a special power doesn't come into play, the lowest value is taken off the board.<br/><br/>To win, a player must discover the opponent's flag piece.<br/><br/>Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition plays similar to classic Stratego with some slight rule variations and a sci-fi/futuristic theme.<br/><br/>This version is played on a 10x8 with 30 pieces on each team versus the traditional 10x10 grid with 40 pieces to each side. The Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition uses the alternate highest to lowest numbering system for it's pieces, 10 as the Marshal, 2 as the Scout and 1 as the Spotter.<br/><br/>This edition introduces 2 &quot;Spotter&quot; pieces to each side.<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/>&quot;Spotters target and identify the enemy calling in laser barrages from orbiting battleships to destroy them.<br/><br/>Spotter Special Attack: Spotters may move, then use their special attack. A Spotter may attempt to attack and capture any piece on the square in front of it by guessing the piece's rank. Tell you opponent that you are 'Spotting' the piece, then guess. Your opponent must reveal the piece's rank.<br/><br/>If your guess is correct, that piece is captured. The Spotter does not move to the captured piece's square.<br/><br/>If your guess is not correct, nothing happens. But your Spotter is revealed!<br/><br/>Note: Spotters can 'spot' and capture Bombs and the Flag.<br/>Spotters may attack normally instead of Spotting.&quot;<br/><br/>A simple strategy for the Spotter is placing him behind a crater. When an enemy attacks down one of the Corridor lanes their piece is revealed. If they capture your piece and move forward, the Spotter can then flank them from the side 'guessing' their rank with complete certainty.<br/><br/>",

You must contend with adverse weather, unpredictable storms, and the unrest, fatigue, and disease that will spread among your crew as the voyage advances.<br/><br/>All of this is abstracted in a game that uses a deck of 54 cards, some markers, and 1 pawn to track the position of your fleet (if you don't have markers and 1 pawn, you can even use coins).<br/><br/>Adamastor is essentially a hand/tableau management game with multiple use cards, that can be played in 15 minutes. Each card in play has the potential to help or to hinder you during your journey. Different events will trigger when certain combinations of icons are in play. Most of these events will hurt, but some might help. The challenges that the sailors faced in these heroic journeys are also abstracted in a system in which you will gain traumas. These cards will increase as the game progresses, making your task even more difficult.<br/><br/>Masterful command of these cards will lead you to a successful voyage full of wealth and adventure, but be wary as danger and disaster could reside with every pull from the deck.<br/><br/>",

Max and the ghost chasers begin the game in rooms of their choice.  The Max and his chasers move room to room.  Max moves invisibly, showing himself only from time to time.  The creatures living around the castle determine when Max must show himself.  After each game round, one animal is removed from the board.  When all animals of one type have been removed, Max must show which room he is in and how he got there.  Max has a code of honor and will not enter the same room twice during the chase.<br/><br/>Unlike Max, the chasers may enter each room as often as they like.  They try to force Max into a dead end to catch him.  All the chasers win if one of the chasers enters the room where Max is.  If the last animal is removed from the board with Max having not been found, the player playing the role of Max is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The scale will be 525 yards (480 meters) per hex, 1 hour per turn, 500-800 men per strength point.<br/><br/>The Battles Simulated:<br/>Abensberg, April 19-20<br/>Eckm&uuml;hl, April 21-22<br/>Aspern-Essling, May 21-22<br/>Wagram, July 5-6<br/>3 maps, 2 counter sheets, 2 card decks, etc.<br/><br/>Abensberg and Eckm&uuml;hl are each playable as single-map battle games as well as a two-map game of the double battle. Aspern-Essling and Wagram are played on the same map. Hence there are four separate battles in this package, played on a total of 3 full-sized maps. Campaign Game options link the four battles.<br/><br/>An Additional bonus scenario was added at the last moment as the game went into production: The Battle of Teugen-Hausen, April 19.<br/><br/>Part of the &quot;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG)&quot;-Series - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB)-Series&quot;<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve heard the stories - ships being ripped in half by a giant creature, maelstroms swallowing ships into the sea, &amp; dead sea creatures washing ashore with strange markings. The tides are changing, &amp; not for the better. The stories have struck fear in even the most fearless of Captains! They have decided to band together &amp; prepare for what evil may be waking. Choose your ship, make sail to the ports, &amp; gather everything you can to ready your ship&hellip;before it&rsquo;s too late!<br/><br/>Davy Jones' Locker: The Kraken Wakes is a cooperative, pirate-themed game for 1-4 players split into 2 Acts. In Act 1, players will be using up actions to move around the map &amp; upgrade their ship as much as possible before Act 2 begins. Exploring Ports, Visiting Markets, defeating Raiding Ships, Exploring Shipwrecks, &amp; battling Naval Ships are just a few of the ways players can gain stat increases, gold, or equipment for their ships! Throughout Act 1, players will also encounter odd stories - pods of beached whales with strange markings, pools of red in the middle of the sea, &amp; stories of ships being dragged down to Davy Jones' from nowhere... As the stories grow more present, so does the reason behind them: The Kraken!<br/><br/>Once The Kraken wakes, Act 2 begins! Players will be sucked into a huge whirlpool &amp; have to fight through the Kraken, its 8 tentacles, &amp; ever-changing whirlpool currents. Ships will sink, but that doesn't mean they are out of the fight! Other players can rescue the stranded crew from the sea, allowing them to man parts of their own ship &amp; keep pushing through the battle to send the Kraken back down to Davy Jones' Locker!<br/><br/>",

Not only that, the race for honor has also begun!<br/><br/>But to some, power isn't earned &ndash; it's taken!<br/><br/>The players play the role of the Boss' lieutenants, who are supposed to manage the Family's business and plot to get their leader cleared. But turncoats hide among them, people who want the Boss to be found guilty just so that they can lay claim to the Family by force, or because it's their job as undercover FBI agents!<br/><br/>Nostra City is a fictional-reality game starring a New-York crime syndicate as it appears in Gangster movies: a cruel and violent world where, under the cover of a tradition of silence and loyalty, everything is allowed.<br/><br/>",

As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!<br/><br/>Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.<br/><br/>On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:<br/><br/><br/>     Sell at the fair price =&gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. <br/>     Get a good deal =&gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.<br/><br/><br/>Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!<br/><br/>",

(The twelve categories are book, film/TV, music/song, famous person, generic person, shape/color, number, matter, item, place, animal, and verb.) They then set down a square of nine (3x3) category tiles on the table (including the one she just drew). In turns, other players choose a category. If it matches the word to be guessed, the &quot;Master of Mysteries&quot; says so and sets the tile aside; if not, they must either give a clue matching this category, then flip the tile (which cannot be chosen again), or discard the tile and place it back in the bag. At the end of each turn, the active player can make one guess, and if their answer is right, both the guesser and the Master of Mysteries scores as many points as the number of non-discarded tiles chosen  during that round.<br/><br/>After a clue has been given or a tile discarded, any player can interrupt the game by saying they know the answer. Any other players can then do the same. Then, in clockwise order, each of them gives one answer, and either wins this round or is eliminated until next round.<br/><br/>After a certain number of rounds (depending on the number of players), the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game combines highly accurate information on the forces the Warsaw Pact actually deployed with now de-classified reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency regarding WP capabilities. The map has been extensively updated using satellite photography. Finally, the game system has been reworked to better reflect the fluid, fast-paced, and deadly nature of modern warfare. Here is the ultimate Cold War game, remastered, and playable in a single sitting.<br/><br/>NATO is a division/brigade-level simulation of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. The game map depicts the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  The time frame covers the first 14 days of war, after which one side or the other has usually run out of an army. The game offers four different Scenarios covering 1) a surprise attack from a standing start, 2) an attempt by the WP to quietly prepare without tipping NATO off beforehand, 3) an extended buildup of forces by both sides before war breaks out, and 4) an introductory scenario covering the invasion of Denmark.<br/><br/>Each Scenario can be played with an Order of Battle from 1983, when NATO was still relatively weak, or with an Order of Battle from 1988, when NATO had rearmed and reorganized and was at the peak of its strength. The difference is impressive.<br/><br/>The game features infantry, armor, airborne and airmobile troops, and marines, with easy mechanics to leverage combined arms operations. It also has extensive options for employing helicopters, airpower, chemical weapons, and, as a last resort, nuclear weapons. The combat system is built around the concept that the best defense is a good offense, and features artillery, tactical and operational air strikes, flank attacks, concentric attacks, reserves, counterattacks, and deep exploitation, allowing for a rich set of tactical nuances in play. This is not a game where the WP attacks and NATO defends. Both players have to attack relentlessly if they want to defeat their opponent.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature edition of the classic Bruce Maxwell game has been upgraded with new units, new scenarios, new terrain, new tables, and new player aid cards. Additional enhancements introduced in this edition include:<br/><br/>&bull; Super-sized components feature 9/16&rdquo; counters and two game maps with larger hexes<br/>&bull; Game map information has been updated and includes all-new map artwork<br/>&bull; New units have been added, unit information has been updated and all units produced with new artwork<br/>&bull; Existing scenarios have been updated and two new scenarios added<br/>&bull; Orders of Battle for both 1983 and 1988 are provided for all Scenarios, allowing players to see the impact of the Reagan Era rearmament programs<br/>&bull; The game system has been redesigned and the new rules include extensive illustrations, examples of play, and Designer&rsquo;s Notes to aid clarity<br/>&bull; Each rules section now begins with a Veterans' Summary, allowing experienced players to skip many rules sections that embody classic game mechanics they already know<br/>&bull; Rules details and restrictions have been summarized graphically in Player Aids for faster reference and easier play<br/>&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are provided for Scenario setup and Reinforcement charts<br/>&bull; A new set of Designer&rsquo;s Notes contain a wealth of historical information on what the West discovered after the Warsaw Pact collapsed and most of its members joined NATO.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>&bull; Complexity: 7 out of 10<br/>&bull; Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>&bull; Time Scale: 24 hours per turn<br/>&bull; Map Scale: 15 miles per hex<br/>&bull; Unit Scale: regiments, brigades, and divisions, abstract air and naval forces<br/>&bull; Players: one to four<br/>&bull; Playing Time: 3-8 hours, depending upon the scenario<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; One Rules Booklet<br/>&bull; One Play Booklet with Scenarios &amp; Designer&rsquo;s Notes<br/>&bull; Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; Maps<br/>&bull; Four Counter Sheets (9/16&quot; size playing pieces)<br/>&bull; One WP Player Charts &amp; Tables Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Player Charts &amp; Tables Card<br/>&bull; One WP Sequence of Play Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Sequence of Play Card<br/>&bull; One Warsaw Pact Strategic Surprise Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One Warsaw Pact Extended Buildup Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Strategic Surprise Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Extended Buildup Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; Two 6-Sided Dice<br/>&bull; One Game Box and Lid<br/><br/>",

The players move about the city, collecting artifacts and stories, and then return to the Adventurer's Club to tell made-up stories of adventure. This game plays something like a board game, though the board is made entirely of cards. The mechanics revolve around collecting sets of cards, while trying to avoid meeting Professor Elemental, and deciding which destinations to pretend to return from. The cards are filled with humorous text and whimsical illustrations by Harold Fay.<br/><br/>",

Each morning the Grade Ones arrive with rocks they've gathered, then haul away the rocks that you don't need anymore &ndash; but there aren't enough Grade One initiates to go around, so there will be competition for the best selection of rocks. The Grade Ones will give their new rocks to whoever gives them the fewest old rocks to haul away.<br/><br/>Keep in mind while creating your garden, however, that certain combinations of rocks must be avoided! Every afternoon, the Feng Shui Masters come by to check your work. You'll receive demerits for any forbidden combinations &ndash; but you'll also receive demerits for your laziness if you don't add new stones each day, so you must find a balance.<br/><br/>The Masters' final evaluation will come with no advance warning. The Initiate who has the fewest demerits will advance to Grade Three, while the one with the most demerits will be kicked down to Grade One, joining the others in the daily search for new rocks...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain &ndash; to this day it's been climbed by almost 4,000 alpinists from around the world, with more and more coming each year. Most of them are tourists without the experience or skills needed to climb an eight-thousander. Without proper help they wouldn't make it to the Himalayas, let alone brave the mighty Chomolungma.<br/><br/>Fortunately, that's where you come in, an experienced mountaineer and mountain guide. You've got Broad Peak, K2 and other eight-thousanders under your belt, and you've climbed Mount Everest several times. This time you face a far greater challenge: You must lead a bunch of tourists to the peak and safely get them back to base. You gaze at the mountain and you know this to be true &ndash; what is child's play for you might be the last adventure of your clients.<br/><br/>You must plan where to set up camp and how to deal with acclimatization, who to take up to the peak and when, and who to lead down the mountain. When you look at your clients' enthusiastic faces, you know that their lives are in your hands.<br/><br/>In Mount Everest players take control of a team of two expert mountaineers who must lead as many tourists as they can to the peak and, of course, safely bring them back. Each player gets an identical deck of cards that are used for moving around the board. Players must decide where to set up camps and how much oxygen to bring to the top; only oxygen lets players get acclimatization cards, which allow tourists to survive the climb. Players must also decide what type of customers they want: the athletic, fairly competent climbers, or the wealthier and more prestigious amateurs. Climbing with one tourist in tow is easy, but the key to victory lies in guiding whole groups. Unfortunately, the more people you take with you, the higher the likelihood is of something going wrong. Also, as it is in the mountains, the weather will be a crucial factor. If a player can coordinate an expedition that avoids a crisis at the peak, he should be able to lead the happy tourists back to base.<br/><br/>Who will become the best Himalayan guide?<br/><br/>",

The city is run by moneybags, though, and now it's time to seize opportunities as swindlers and cutpurses to claim your share of their wealth.<br/><br/>Swindler combines press-your-luck with take-that mechanisms for a fun and thematic game set in Victorian London. Each round, players must steal from one of the five moneybags, drawing tokens from the chosen bag. Each bag is filled with coins, jewelry, and other loot &mdash; but each bag also contains at least one skull! If you draw a skull, you've pressed your luck too far and got caught in the act. Not only will you lose the loot you stole that round, you also lose everything you stole from the same bag in previous rounds. The moneybag not only found your hand in their pocket, but they also recognized the small but precious ring on your finger...<br/><br/>It's wise not to sit on the loot too long in case you get caught. Dealers will pay you for the loot you turn in, giving you points. You can also use your loot to complete orders, but one of your fellow swindlers might be faster and push you aside to complete a task, costing you valuable points. Thankfully, you don't have to swindle on your own! Hire accomplices to gain advantages or affect the other players with disadvantages.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after a set number of rounds will be recognized as the most notorious swindler of London and thus win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each character receives a face-down role card at the start of the game, and in a game with 4-5 players some role cards are placed in the center of the table. On a turn, you take one of three actions:<br/><br/>1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action. You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.<br/><br/>2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.<br/><br/>3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins &mdash; or until a player has lost all of their coins, in which case the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game. The rules suggest that you use certain characters in your first games, but once you know the game, you can try many other distributions.<br/><br/>Note that this second edition of Mascarade includes 17 role cards, with these cards being a mix of roles from the original base game and the 2014 expansion.<br/><br/>",

The 1906 Universal Exposition is approaching and, as one of the 40 exhibiting nations, you are confident that your engineers and scientists will impress the world. Who will exhibit the most impressive technological advancements? Which energy source will prevail: the majestic power of Steam or the more elegant and efficient Electricity? Can you prevail in prestige and glory against the other competing nations?<br/><br/>In Expo 1906, players will win by totaling more prestige points at the end of the game than their opponents. Points are awarded for completing Projects which represent historical inventions of the period. To complete a Project, a player must purchase Resources and place them in a proper combinations together with a Project in his Laboratory. This is a challenging task as Projects come in many different shapes and must fit together with their resources in an already tight space. Soon the available room in the Laboratory will reduce and players will face the puzzle solving aspect of the game.<br/> Strategy plays an important role too: to speed up the completion of a Project players can acquire Technologies, which can either reduce the number of Resources required to complete a Project or enhance the type of actions at their disposal. This will require careful management of the available space in their Laboratory too. Also, by registering ideas at the Patents'Office players can become leader in the development of specific Resources and accumulate more prestige points when completing Projects. Setting priorities between all these actions will become critical as players rush to prepare in time for the upcoming World Exposition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The hardboiled detective in the Thirties. Players work as operatives for the Continental Detective Agency entering the exciting, exotic and dangerous underworld of 1934 San Francisco. From Chinatown to Nob Hill, from gambling dens to drawing rooms, from forgery to murder, Gumshoe splendidly captures the rough and tumble world of &lsquo;the hard-boiled detective&rsquo;.<br/><br/>There is one case to solve each day over a period of nine days from July 3rd to July 11th 1934. The &lsquo;Old Man of the Continental Detective Agency&rsquo; gives out assignments. Everything players need to dig out the clues, search out the suspects and figure out the solutions is here: detailed 1930s maps of San Francisco and the Bay Area, directories alphabetically listing thousands of people and places encountered in investigations, a case book with hundreds of clues to unravel, police mug shots with vital statistics on dozens of known criminals, dated newspapers, a fingerprint file, time sheets for recording the time spent on each clue, and case reports with the solutions to the cases.<br/><br/>Gumshoe is not a role-playing game or a board game. It is a detective investigation game for the individual or team who work to solve a large number of cases.  Game is from the makers of the innovative and award-winning Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.  Gumshoe introduces several new gaming concepts, it continues the traditions of simple rules, elaborate and well-constructed plots, excellent writing and faithfulness to its period style, which made the Consulting Detective series so popular worldwide.<br/><br/>",

Your board and cards represent your ecosystem at a micro level.--<br/><br/>Your actions on the central board will allow you to expand, move your territories and even take territories from your opponents.<br/>Your actions in your ecosystem will allow you to play animal species cards, feed them by transferring the resources produced by your plants and make them reproduce in order to make your ecosystem prosper. Finally, to best optimize your future cycles, you will need to draw new cards to deal with new situations.<br/>--The cubes on your animal species cards represent the population of that species in your ecosystem.--<br/><br/>Once you and your opponents have exhausted your options, the current cycle will end and you will start a new one. All the organic matter of your ecosystem used during this cycle will be put back in your bag, so it will be used again by your plants for the next cycle.<br/>Once all the cycles have been played, you can determine who wins the game by adding up all the victory points:<br/><br/>--But be careful, if you have no more cubes on species cards, their populations will die out and they will not be taken into account for the calculation of victory points. Finally, beware of your distribution in the central landscape, a fragmented ecosystem is much less optimal and can grant malus.--<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Triumph of Chaos: The Russian Civil War 1918-1921 v2 DELUXE EDITION&quot;  is a two-player card driven strategic board wargame wherein the players assume the roles  of the RED (Communist Forces) and the WHITE (reactionary forces).  This epic conflict resulted in the toppling of three centuries  of Romanov rule and its replacement by a totalitarian communist ideology.  Set against a backdrop of the vast and spectacular Russian countryside, only the Russian winter could surpass the brutality of the fighting.  Belligerents  included the various Russian republics, anarchist and independence movements, adherents of the old regime, foreign contingents of volunteers and the overt intervention of the Major Powers.<br/><br/><br/>With Triumph of Chaos v2 DELUXE EDITION, the original wargame published in 2005 has been enhanced to provide a richer playing experience (more Social Revolutionaries, eastern warlords and a gaggle of obscure personalities and entities), a bigger map (enlarged 40% and including the Trans Siberian rail line all the way to Vladivostok),  better play aids and redesigned cards (setting the stage for more player angst). The basic structure of the original game is still there with three phases to a turn: Political (players compete to push or pull fractions to their side), Action (players alternate playing cards to move, fight, enact events and build up their armies) and Logistics (replacements and a variety of new intriguing game mechanics):  Triumph of Chaos v2 DELUXE EDITION remains the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of chaos, continuously shifting front lines and rich flavor.<br/> Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the box: a beautiful 44&rsquo;&rsquo; x 34&rdquo; double map, 220 cards (action, leader, political decks), 3 sheets of counters (including approximately 400 military units, 40+ leaders and a bundle of other game tokens), rulebook &amp; supplement, very helpful play aids and few game bits (wood and dice).<br/><br/>Designer: D. B. Dockter<br/>Artists: Tim Schleif, Terry Leeds, D.B. Dockter<br/><br/>So, how does Triumph of Chaos v2 compare with v1 (which was published back in 2005 and then expanded in 2007 by the Comrades' Guide)? The categories of improvement:<br/><br/>* A richer game experience&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>     More card angst/decision tension: Significant revisions to the Action Cards (the majority of them) to reflect learnings from new research and hopefully make the choices faced by each player more gut wrenching. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Invited the Socialist Revolutionaries to the party: The SRs now occupy a &ldquo;buffer position&rdquo; between RED &amp; WHITE in the east as the game begins; making for a nail-biting opening. The SRs may go either way as governed by a track and play of both Political and Action cards with significant ramifications for both players. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Leader state: A few leaders now have an alternative &ldquo;state&rdquo; (ex: Kolchak: drug abuse, Mai-Mavesky: debauchery, etc), making them more unreliable than your usual wargame leader counter. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Far east part of the story added: Japan, Far-East warlords and red partisans are all now apart of play. <br/><br/><br/>* A little less clunky game engine&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>     A few tweaks to the basic game engine: artillery, tanks and air are now simply &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that modify combat die rolls. A Resource Center mechanic now controls where replacements may be spent (much more reflective of historic constraints). <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Infighting: Gameplay impacts the composition of each player&rsquo;s in-fighting pool; changing the internal political dynamics that both players must manage. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Better Faction rules: A streamlining of the Ukraine and Poland rules. Nips and tucks to Makhno, West Ukraine and Finland. <br/><br/><br/>* ..and improved kit &amp; bits (game look &amp; feel)<br/><br/><br/>     Doubled the map: Most of that is a result of simply &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo; the original map by 40% (for our tired/old eyes) and adding the Far East and Trans-Siberian railroad all the way to glorious Vladivostok. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bigger counters: Armies &amp; leaders are now represented by 1&quot; x 1/2&quot; in counters (basically double the size as before), while corps have 5/8&quot; counters and only informational markers get the wargame traditionally small &frac12;&quot; counters. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bigger &amp; better game aids: Faction Control Table larger and contains better information regarding the factions&hellip;force composition charts now provided&hellip;summaries of game mechanics/combat..and components explained, abbreviations, changes vs v1.0 summary!<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt three cards, which are played out in tricks, and points are also scored for holding combinations of cards in the same suit. It is the possible to bet extra points on who has the best combination or will win the tricks, and the bluffing, talking and joking that goes with this are an important part of the game. Truco is usually played by four players in partnerships, but it can also be played by two or six.<br/><br/>(Taken from the website <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pagat.com/put/truc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pagat.com/put/truc.html</a> )<br/><br/>",

This rule book contains all the rules you need to recreate your gunfights and twelve blood-soaked scenarios.<br/><br/>Initiative order is determined randomly by placing cards face down next to each character. The cards are then revealed and play proceeds in the order of the cards from high to low. Various actions or cards can alter this if you so desire and are lucky enough but in general the winds of fate decide who goes when.<br/><br/>Once activated each model has three actions each turn, these must be declared at the start of each figures activation. This speeds things up and allows you opponent to play the odd special effect on you and catch you off guard.<br/><br/>Movement is simple. There are no terrain modifiers to worry about and other than reduced movement rates for climbing and jumping.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and simple as befits the game, and while it is possible to kill somebody in a single shot attrition is going to be the real deciding factor for most characters.<br/><br/>Weapons come in one of four types; Pistol, Rifle, Repeater and Shotgun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the Anima: Beyond Fantasy roleplaying game setting, Anima: Tactics is a skirmish-level miniatures combat game that pits heroic characters against each other in the struggle between Light and Dark. The system uses 10-sided dice as well as character statcards and asset cards that provide new abilities for the characters.<br/><br/>Each player brings a party of heroes to the field of battle, choosing characters, equipment, and other advantages with total levels no more than the fixed value selected for the game (250 levels for a standard game). No party may contain characters from both the Light and Darkness faction, unless all characters in the party are drawn from the same affiliation (there are eight affiliations in the game, such as the Church, the Empire, or the Black Sun trading cartel).<br/><br/>In the standard 250 LV game, each player will have 4 ~ 6 models. The winner is the player with the most levels of characters still on the battlefield at the end of ten turns.<br/><br/>There are two starter sets available right now - Light faction and Dark faction:<br/>Each starter set includes<br/>2 unpainted pewter figures (around 100 LV)<br/>2 advantage cards<br/>1 rulebook<br/>1 ten-sided die<br/>Several action counters and state counters.<br/><br/>",

Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules.<br/> Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade).  Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg.<br/> The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play.  Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day!<br/><br/>One thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs.<br/> The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road. You can even attempt to speed the arrival of your off-board forces, but at increased risk of their arriving later instead.<br/><br/><br/>Winning involves a combination of taking and holding victory hexes, exiting units, and inflicting casualties. You can also earn victory points to compensate for units whose arrival is delayed-but only if you didn&rsquo;t try to force march them to an earlier arrival!  Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground.<br/><br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and  exciting.<br/> Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later.  Fans of either the Civil War or the Clash of Giants series will not be disappointed.<br/><br/><br/>",

(Close to the Mark!), all players want to collect numbers close to what they already have, but not identical numbers.<br/><br/>Each player gets a scoring sheet and claims a different color from the five colored dice in the game. On a turn, one player rolls all five dice once. Each player must combine the number on their die with the number on any other die, then write this sum in a circle on their scoring sheet that's either their color or the color of the other die they're using. Each scoring sheet has 25 circles in it in a 5x5 grid, with each color appearing five times. When a player writes a sum in a circle that differs from an adjacent circle by exactly one, the player ticks the box between these circles.<br/><br/>After 25 turns, the game ends. For each row and column of boxes (with the 4x4 grid of boxes being located within the 5x5 grid of circles), the player scores 0, 1, 3, 6, or 10 points for ticking off 0-4 boxes. In addition, the player scores 2 points for 3, 4, 10 and 11 they wrote down and 4 points for each 2 and 12. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Batman: Everybody Lies is a crime-solving deduction game for 2-4 players set in rich lore of the Batman comics universe. Players take on the roles of four key investigators &ndash; instinctive journalist Warren Spacey, tenacious reporter Vicki Vale, brutish detective Harvey Bullock, or the cunning Catwoman &ndash; who are drawn into a series of mysterious events unfolding in Gotham City.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players cooperatively make decisions running the investigation and trying to solve a series of challenging cases. They visit famous locations in Gotham City (like the Batcave, Arkham Asylum, Blackgate Penitentiary, and the Gotham City Gazette) and cross paths with well-known Batman characters (like Batman, The Penguin, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, and more) while trying to chase leads, identify suspects, and gather enough information to help save Gotham City. The game also adds a brand new hidden agenda mechanic, which assigns secret goals and unique win conditions for each player based upon which DC character they portray.<br/><br/>In Batman: Everybody Lies, players utilize a variety of physical and digital game components &ndash; a deck of cards with essential clues and plot twists, various physical handouts, and a dedicated website with access to in-world resources from the Gotham City Gazette archives &ndash; for a truly immersive experience. The game also features another new thematic treat &ndash; Scenes &ndash; that bring memorable gameplay moments to life via original comic book illustrations that feel torn straight from the pages and panels of the beloved comics.<br/><br/>Beginning with an introductory Prologue designed to get players acquainted with the game rules, Batman: Everybody Lies then continues with three big cases to solve, each taking roughly 2-3 hours to play. Each case can be played separately as stand-alone episodes, yet should players crack all four cases, they will unravel a master narrative with an epic climax. Every scenario ends with a final report with questions verifying how well the team has investigated the case.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Add to that three further ways of either bettering your score or hindering your opponents.<br/><br/>Concept and Goal of the Game<br/>Each turn, carefully place a construction block to help build either the military redoubt, the church, or the seigneurial mill. At the end of each turn, players gain points based on the placement of these blocks. Three times during the game, it will snow and this is when players receive extra points based on the number of cubes of their colour present in the level being tallied up. The snowdrifts are then added to each building, fitting around and hiding the level that has just been tallied, therefore limiting the remaining space available to gain points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/>Each turn, a player draws a card illustrating a type of construction block, taking the one indicated from the stock pile. They need to add the block to one of the buildings in line with the rules of play: a wall must not be more than 3 cubes high; blocks must be within limits shown on the foundation tiles; blocks must not be inserted underneath another one already in play etc. Once the block has been placed, one point is awarded for each newly added cube of the player&rsquo;s colour, with further points being added for all the cubes already in play of the same color that this new block touches. Therefore, players should try to have as many of the cubes already in play of their colour touching those of corresponding colour in the newly placed block to maximize their score per turn. Also, strategically played ally cards and colourless blocks allow players to increase their scores.<br/>When a snowflake card is drawn from the construction-block deck, the game stops, and points are awarded to each player based on the number of cubes of their colour found in the level being tallied. The snowdrifts are then added. This happens three times during the game. When the first snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the first level of each of the three construction sites. When the second snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the second level. Finally, when the third snowflake is drawn the tally is done for the third and final level, and the game ends. The tally sticks placed next to each building indicate how points are attributed each level. On the tally sticks there are +, - and x 2 symbols indicating how many points players win or lose based on the number of cubes of their colour in the level being tallied.<br/><br/>End of the Game <br/>The game ends when the third snow flake is turned over. Points are tallied for a final time for the third floor of each construction site. The player having the most points on the points&rsquo; board is declared the winner and earns the title of Royal Engineer for New France.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another fast paced card-game by Jacques Zeimet in the vein of Kakerlakensalat und Kakerlakensuppe (also by 3 Magier Spiele).<br/><br/>The game consists of 120 animal cards (dog, cow, donkey, goat, cat as well as parrot and 5 special tarantula cards).<br/><br/>Each player gets a share of cards and forms their own face-down stack. The goal of the game is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. To do so, cards are placed clockwise around a five-sided Tarantula tile in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Before turning over the top card from their stack, a player might have to imitate the animal on the previous player's card (by saying &quot;wuff&quot;, &quot;eee-ah&quot; etc.). This depends on some features of the previous card: If it shows one or two spiders the player has to &quot;imitate&quot; once or twice, else they have to remain silent.<br/><br/>Then the player may put their top card down in the next slot clockwise around the Tarantula tile, except when there are two animals on the previous card. Then the new card goes in the next but one slot ...  All in a time limit of 2 seconds max.<br/>And finally, if the new card is a Tarantula, all players have to smack their hand down on the table (to &quot;chase it off&quot;).<br/><br/>If anyone makes a mistake or is too slow, they have to take all cards on the table into their own stack and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Several additional expert rules make it even more complicated to get rid of the cards and provoke more mistakes, e.g. cards have to be placed on previous donkeys as these are to stubborn to move on or curious dogs change the direction of placing cards (clockwise to counter-clockwise and vice versa).<br/><br/>Announced for Essen 2009.<br/><br/>",

One player plays as Pickle Rick as he tries to escape a heavily armed compound, while the other player takes on the roles of both the Russians and Jaguar as they try to stop him. The Pickle Rick player uses weapons cards to dole out damage and Air Vents to get out of jams as they try to get to the rooftop. The game includes both Pickle Rick and Jaguar miniatures that are moved across a dynamic board made up of tiles that are constantly being added, rotated, and flipped.<br/><br/>Adding to the off-the-wall fun is the game's packaging: It looks like a pickle!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For a long, long time, goblins and fairies have lived in a magical world right beneath our noses. If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called &quot;fairy rings&quot;, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think...<br/><br/>Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule!, a card game of rhyme and reason for kids of all ages, is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of four Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into five rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. Four cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the &quot;Fairy Ring&quot;. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain six Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins or with six Fairies wins.<br/><br/>",

In this dodgeball card game, go head to head with your opponents collecting cards while throwing and avoiding squishy, adorable Avocados. Play Throw Throw Avocado as a standalone sequel, or use the BONUS deck of cards included and combine them with the cards from Throw Throw Burrito to unlock a new combo game using all four throwables!<br/><br/>How it works: Place a pair of avocados on a table and draw cards. Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Avocado Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy avocados. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Avocado War. Duel to determine the winner. During an Avocado Duel, two players must stand back to back, walk three paces, and FIRE.<br/><br/>There is no distinct turn structure. All players are picking and passing cards constantly, similar to Spoons. Once a player has a match of any of the varieties, play will change to the various Avocado Duels - Double Brawl, Legs Duel, Freeze War - where some or all players will throw the squishy Avocado at other players.<br/><br/>To win a player has to accumulate a set number of points. Collecting matching cards and matching battle cards earns positive points, and losing Avocado Duels earns negative points. The first player to reach a specified amount (usually five), wins.<br/><br/>- A fun new sequel to Throw Throw Burrito, the world&rsquo;s first ever dodgeball card game.<br/>- Collect matching cards, earn points and throw Avocados at one another.<br/>- Includes 120 cards, instruction manual, 6 Avocado Boo Boos, 1 Fear Me Badge and 2 foam Avocados soft enough to throw at your Great-Aunt Martha without feeling guilty.<br/>- Includes a BONUS combo pack of 36 cards that can be combined with your Throw Throw Burrito cards to play the ultimate, epic combo game!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

(However, a couple cards do feature scantily dressed women.)<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and 12 cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern.  Each card has colored symbols along each side, a point value, and special instructions. On your turn, you turn over one face-down card then spin any face-up card 180 degrees.  After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols.  &quot;Popping&quot; a card means you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful) and then (usually) add it to your score pile.  Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards.  The game is played until one player has 100 points or has captured a combination of submarine and dirigible cards.<br/><br/>Unlike most of Cheapass Games's games, this one is professionally manufactured with full color, laminated cards with rounded corners.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally published in issue #51 (July 1981) of Dragon Magazine.<br/><br/>A tongue-in-cheek version of &quot;classic&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons (some even say Mertwig's Maze is a similar treatment of Advanced D&amp;D).  As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)<br/><br/>Treasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.<br/><br/>Terrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.<br/><br/>A surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons &amp; armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.<br/><br/>A significantly revised version was published as part of The Best of Dragon Magazine Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Through incessant wars for its control, the Lords of Time put the source of immortality at risk. To prevent its drying up and their own demise, they created the Time Arena: a sacred place where they fight, invoking the spirits of warriors from ancient time or from distant galaxies. Those who manage to dominate time and destroy the opponent's Totem gain the right to access the source and thus ensure the lineage of the Lords of Time.<br/><br/>Time Arena is a confrontation game for two players or two teams. You control four fighters, and your aim is to destroy your opponents' Totem &mdash; but time is running out, and you have only five minutes&hellip; When the timer shows &laquo; 0 &raquo;, you lose the game!<br/><br/>In more detail, players take turns performing their team's actions, after which the other player's (or team's) turn begins. Each player has five minutes, which they can use as they wish all along the game. At the beginning of the game, the first player triggers the Arena Clock, which counts their time. When they decide their turn is over, for whatever reason they might decide, they pass play by pressing the Arena Clock. This both ends their countdown and starts the opponent's.<br/><br/>You will also have to deal with another time factor since each of the characters forming your team has a specific recharge time. When a character is destroyed in the Time Arena, its sand timer is turned over, and the character returns to play after all the sand has run out.<br/><br/>",

Both have been out of print for over a decade. The series has marched on with four more installments and has attracted many new players. These first two games will be available again in a new, updated dual package. In one box, you will get the first two volumes of the MPBS including:<br/><br/>    Two additional battles for This Accursed Civil War: Cheriton 1644 and Cropredy Bridge 1644. Both battles were in designer Ben Hull's original Desk Top Published version, with Cheriton 1644 appearing later in C3i.  The Edgehill 1642 variant from Gustav Adolf the Great will be included as well.<br/>    For all battles, infantry and cavalry units will not be shared between battles for ease of setup and storage.<br/>    The battle specific cards introduced in Saints in Armor with be provided with Turn Track, Victory Conditions, Dead and Pursuit boxes to improve their utility (5 back printed cards)<br/>    The This Accursed Civil War Playbook will be brought up to the current series standard for ease of use.<br/>    Orders of battle and maps will be updated to reflect the latest scholarship.<br/>    Last but not least: the counters will feature formation icons requested by so many players over the years!<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>The Battles are:<br/>  <br/><br/>    Edgehill 1642: Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    First Newbury 1643: Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry. Essex&rsquo;s stand on Round Hill stopped the Royalist and saved the rebellion.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Cheriton 1644: Sir William Waller&rsquo;s Southern and Western Association Armies with the help of the London Trained Bands defeated Hopton&rsquo;s Royalists in the rolling hills and hedges. The first in a series of victories in early to mid-1644 the signaled a turning tide in the war.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Cropredy Bridge 1644: Confident from his victory at Cheriton, Sir William Waller seeks to exploit a gap in the Royalist Main Army on the march. Waller divided his forces and attempted to trap part of the Royalist Army, but difficult terrain and quick reaction by the Royalists turned the tables and left much of Waller&rsquo;s army trapped and he was given a stinging rebuke.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Marston Moor 1644: The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to affect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arose: Cromwell, a name inextricably linked with the English Civil War and the key player in the following two civil wars.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Second Newbury 1644: The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Naseby 1645: The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634: Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Wittstock 1636: The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Second Breitenfeld 1642: Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>    Jankau 1645: Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign against the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emperor himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>Components:<br/><br/>    Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series Rulebook<br/>    &ldquo;This Accursed Civil War&rdquo; Playbook<br/>    &ldquo;Sweden Fights On&rdquo; Playbook<br/>    5 Counter Sheets<br/>    1 Series Marker Sheet<br/>    4.5 Back Printed Map Sheets (For 11 Battles)<br/>    6 Two-Sided Battle Specific Player Aid Cards<br/>    2 11x17 Folded Player Aid Cards<br/>    1 Orders Summary Card<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment. Because of the presence of the GD, the Soviets were unable to force a breakthrough and decided to commit the 3rd Mech Corps into the meat grinder to force the issue...<br/><br/>Designer Wig Graves conducted extensive research, combing both German and Soviet sources to create the order of battle. The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps. While the Germans are primarily on the defense, careful counter-attacks against the relatively immobile Soviet formations can prove to be key to victory. And if the Soviets do not preserve their forces carefully, they will end with the historical result: stable German lines and an entire mechanized corps wrecked.<br/><br/>GD &rsquo;42 uses the new Tactical Combat Series rules.

It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.<br/><br/>For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!<br/><br/>The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points.  <br/>Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls.  <br/>Controlled cities gain revenue. Those can be spent on Battle Cards and fortification.<br/><br/>Battles are resolved by playing Battle Cards (yellow(numerical) or red(special cards), combined with Influence, fortifications, and die roll.<br/><br/>TURN SEQUENCE<br/>Income phase: based on controlled cities<br/>Political phase: vote for War or Peace<br/>Battle Cards collection  <br/>Purchase fortifications and/or cards.  <br/>Player Order phase<br/>Event(s) phase<br/>Foreign Intervention phase<br/>Player Turns: In player order, each player resolves:  <br/>1-Expansion moves<br/>2-Combat only if 2+ Yellow cards; Resolve battle, then repeat combat if needed.<br/>Pretender Points: Players gain points (depending on regions they control), then Influence points (up to 6), then discard all cards.<br/>GAME END: check on turn 8 and 9, automatic on 10<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>1 mounted game board <br/>80 cards (a la Tarot) <br/>20 resin cast castles and 10 resin cast strongholds <br/>die-cut coin markers and garrisons representing the factions of France, England, Navarre, Brittany, Flanders and Burgandy.<br/><br/><br/>     Sequel Renaissance<br/><br/><br/>",

It seemed as if all hope was lost, but before their edict could be carried out, a group of defectors managed to wrest control of the Ridback, a Class&ndash;II jumpship, and flee with as many of the condemned as they could save.<br/><br/>It has been close to seven years that these refugees from Earth have called the Ridback home, and finally the crew has found a planet with promise. They have managed to establish outposts around it, and now the great burden falls on you to expand these small &ldquo;alphas&rdquo; into a full-fledged Beta Colony. Success will mean that your people will be able to begin life anew on exoplanet 14 Bos c, or, as they have renamed it, &quot;Victus&quot; &mdash; Latin for &quot;way of life&quot;.<br/><br/>In Beta Colony, you play as one of five Directors working to create prosperous colonies. If you earn the most Confidence Points (CP), you will be elected as the first leader of Victus. Players will collect the needed building materials to produce and erect colonization pods &ndash; Defense Stations, Science and Tech Towers, Living Quarters, Agriculture Pods, and Water Treatment Centers &ndash; on the varied terrain of Victus.<br/><br/>Using a unique &quot;rolldell&quot; mechanism (dice + rondel), Beta Colony is a mid-weight strategic game for players of all levels. Each round, the start player rolls their set of four colored dice. All other players duplicate that roll with their own dice. Players take two actions each round, one action at a time in turn order, with each action using two dice. Players will use one die to move and one die to activate the location to which they moved. Die color and value affect how each of the seven unique locations are used. Players will build colonization pods at each of three colonies to gain the confidence of the settlers and lead them to glory!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>タロットストーリア (Tarot Storia) is a game for one player playing solitaire or for two players playing co-operatively. The game is published in a Japanese / English edition.<br/><br/>In the game, the player starts with one hand card, then draws a second. From these two, they play a card to the tableau. Cards are played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down. In the one-player game, a column is restricted to 4 cards, in the two player, the limit is 3 cards. Alternately, you may exchange a played card with a hand card. But next turn, after drawing, you must play down two cards so your hand is back down to one before drawing.<br/><br/>Once all the cards are played, cards are turned face-down if any card on its right is of a lower number. Then the player tries to find paths in the tableau from the far left to the far right side. Think of this as telling the story. Any cards that are not part of a valid path are also turned down.<br/><br/>Now you score for colour groups, and deduct points for face-down cards and gaps in the tableau. After keeping a column, shuffle the deck over and play a second round to get your final score and the King's opinion!<br/><br/>For two players, it's the same--with both players working a hand of two cards each. You cannot consult about which card to play, but after choosing, you may confer about placing. The final score this time reflects a test of your friendship.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>&quot;You shall be rewarded if your tale amuses me.&quot;<br/><br/>The eccentric king issued the edict to all over the country. You are a bard who is willing to take up that challenge. You have to make up a tale by mixing stories in the world and enchant the king with the tale.<br/><br/>With 22 beautifully illustrated tarot cards with four background colours, this card game demands you make a succession of tough decisions. You will be excited to see how the storyline barely keeps consistency.<br/><br/>Basically, you play a card from two cards in your hand each turn. When you have played all cards, the first round ends and you score according to the card positions. With some of these cards remaining in play, the game proceeds to the second round in the same way. The total of two rounds is your final score.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:    <br/>「わしを満足させる話が出来た者には褒美を取らせる」<br/>変わり者の王様は国中にお触れを出しました。あなたはそれを聞きつけた名うての吟遊詩人。古今東西のお伽話をうまく繋いで、王様を魅了しましょう。<br/><br/>タロットカード（大アルカナ）の構成をそのままに、色の要素を取り入れることで選択が悩ましいカードゲームへ進化させました。お話がギリギリで繋がる綱渡りの連続にあなたは興奮を覚えることでしょう。<br/><br/>基本的なゲームの流れは２枚の手札の内、どちらを場に出すのか、の繰り返しです。カードを全て出しきった時にラウンドが終わり、配置に対し得点が出ます。１周目の配置を一部引き継ぎ、２周目が始まります。計２周した総得点があなたのスコアとなります。<br/><br/>",

Their network of towers covers most of the Unnamed Continent, but now the old postal service is fighting back. Driven by the determination of newly &quot;volunteered&quot; Post Master Moist Von Lipwig, the Ankh-Morpork Post Office has challenged the Clacks operators to a race from Ankh-Morpork to Genua.<br/><br/>Play against your friends and claim the title of Fastest Clacks Operator on the line, or play together as a team to win the race across the Discworld and prove that Clacks is here to stay. In more detail, Clacks: A Discworld Board Game contains rules for a player vs. player game, a co-operative race game against the Post Office, and a children's introductory game.<br/><br/>",

In both the play and the game, Cyrano writes poetry to woo a woman for another man. The game Cyrano lasts a number of rounds, and each round starts with a player revealing a theme card and two rhyme cards (&quot;-aid&quot;, &quot;-ed&quot; and so on with homonyms being acceptable). Each player then composes a quatrain (a poem of four lines) with two of the lines ending with one of the rhymes and the other two ending with the other rhyme. Players read their poems and score points Boggle-style, with each unique ending word being worth one point; these points are recorded by blacking out squares on a ladder, which represents the lover&rsquo;s climb toward his object of affection.<br/><br/>Everyone then secretly votes on which poem he or she most appreciated, whether for its beauty, adherence to theme, or some other artistic qualification. Players reveal their votes simultaneously, and for each player who voted the same way you did, you receive one point, with these points being recorded by the maiden&rsquo;s descent from the tower. Whichever player first brings the loves onto the same floor of the tower wins, with ties being broken by a rhyming duel.<br/><br/>",

Grandma and Grandpa will pitch in, too, but the guests might show up at any time. Try to quickly tidy up more stuff than anyone else. Can each family member finish straightening up, and get ready to receive the guests with out any mishaps?<br/><br/>In Before the Guests Arrive, you do your best to tidy up a messy house for a party. To set up the game, shuffle the guests card into a small pack of cards and place it on the bottom of the deck. Lay out 10-13 cards in an interlocking series of rows and columns. On a turn, choose a row or column, and take all cards in it, adding them to your collection; if at most three cards are in the display, first refill the display, then choose a row or column.<br/><br/>After taking cards, you can tidy up with one member of the family. The Mom, Dad, Girl, and Boy can each tidy up two types of stuff at a time, whereas Baby, Grandma, and Grandpa can each tidy up only one type. Stuff comes in five colors, and each color has three types of stuff, e.g., baby stuff (yellow) has blocks, bears, and lollipops. Yellow stuff can be tidied only by Baby, Grandma, and Grandpa, whereas red stuff can be tidied only by the Girl or Grandma. When tidying up a type of stuff, you can tidy as much of that type of stuff (i.e., stuff with the same illustration) as you like, so it's useful to get a bunch of the same stuff and tidy it all up together.<br/><br/>When refilling the house, if the guest card appears, then the game ends, with everyone having one final chance to tidy up or discard a single card. Players then score points for the stars on what they've tidied, then lose points for stuff not tidied and family members not used. Whoever scores the most wins!<br/><br/>",

With the shadows to thank, the Borgia family is at the peak of their power. In a week the Cardinals will gather for the Conclave. With your reputation you could never win the seat, but you may be able to control who does!<br/><br/>HOOK: It's like Coup meets Liar's Dice! A quick and glorious game of lies and deceit! Richly thematic and completely immersive.<br/><br/>WINNING CONDITION: Having secretly controlled the Cardinal who has the most influence at the end of the game.<br/><br/>MECHANICS: Players are randomly given an identity at the beginning of the game. It is imperative that they keep their identity secret from the other players. These identities represent the Cardinal who they want to gain the most influence.<br/><br/>6 cards representing Cardinals, are randomly placed in an ascending ladder-like line up. A Cardinals position on this ladder determines how much, if any, influence they will gain at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Using dice and bluffing in a similar fashion to Liar's Dice, players will be able to manipulate a Cardinal's position on the ladder; or manipulate how much influence they have; or even accuse another player of the Cardinal they are controlling.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, if another player has accurately paired you with a Rumor Card, one that matches your secret identity, you lose; regardless of how much influence you may have acquired for your Cardinal.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a deck of eight unique ability cards. Every turn, each player draws three cards, then chooses one to play.

        "description": "For two hundred years, war waged back and forth across the border between England and Scotland. By 1482, the unfortunate town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, once the richest port town in Scotland, had changed hands thirteen times. By the time Henry VIII ascended the throne of England in 1509, the fifty-mile-wide stretch of rolling hills and stunning vistas that straddle the border had seen decades of hardship and atrocity.<br/><br/>Yet still the hardy families living on these frontier lands persevered. Unable to count on crops surviving until the harvest, they subsisted primarily on the livestock they could shepherd in the fields near their homesteads. When supplies ran low, raiding to steal what they needed from their neighbors was often the answer. Raids were often carefully planned operations with several border families uniting to steal livestock from a common foe in the dead of night. Cattle and sheep were the likely targets, often with hundreds of these creatures being stolen in a single raid. The reiver&rsquo;s goal was to herd their quarry to safety before the retaliatory &ldquo;hot trod&rdquo; pursuit could catch up and force an engagement.<br/><br/>To combat this constant hostility, England and Scotland established the system of March Law. Each nation divided its border lands into an East, Middle, and West March with each of these six territories administered by a Warden responsible for keeping the peace. The Wardens were drawn from the most powerful families on the Borders, clans of great renown that could put upwards of a thousand men in the saddle in times of need. The March Law would have succeeded too, but for the fact that these same great families were usually the ones best equipped and most inclined to raid their neighbors.<br/><br/>In Border Reivers, each player rules over one of the Marches as leader of one of the six major riding families of the border: Grey, Fenwick, Dacre, Maxwell, Kerr, or Hume. Your goal is to increase the wealth and fame of your clan throughout the reigns of Henry and Elizabeth to end the century as the most famous Border Reiver of all time. Players gain VPs from successful combats, amassing large herds of livestock, and by elevating their Notoriety above the other players in the regions of the map.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It has all the standard new rules and actions that make it Fluxx, plus a few new ones that go with the theme, including the Composting rule (which lets you draw from the bottom of the discard pile) and new types of &quot;eating&quot; goals (which let you win the game if your Keeper says it eats one of the other Keepers in play).<br/><br/>Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.<br/><br/>Nature Fluxx features the same cards and gameplay as EcoFluxx, but with updated card frame art and packaging.<br/><br/>",

Mongol strategy gives individual generals a high degree of independence in deciding how to invade and conquer new territories, so long as they keep to the overall objectives.

To prevent enemy rulers from being able to regain control of their armies, the Mongols drive the rulers out and pursue them relentlessly wherever they flee.<br/><br/>In KHAN it's your task to chase out the 8 different rulers of the lands that you are invading and to conquer as many valuable areas as you can. The general that fulfills this task the best will be proclaimed the next Great Khan.<br/><br/>Each player invades areas by placing his yurts on the board. A player can then conquer two or more adjacent areas by laying one of the variously shaped conquer tiles over the yurts (not all the yurts need to be the player's own). Conquer tiles will bring the player victory points - the larger the conquer tile, the greater the number of victory points. At the end of the game the players with the largest connected conquered territories will gain additional victory points. The player who then has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Climate change has taken its toll on Earth and new resources are needed to fuel a very technically advanced society gathered into ever growing megacities around the globe. Research during the last 50 years has shown that the Moon has several very pure and effective mineral resources that are needed on Earth. This year, mining corporations has established bases on the Moon with the purpose of building a transportation network to mine valuable mineral resources. As these resources are of global interest, the top 20 nations on Earth have invested in a freight rocket &ldquo;Future One&rdquo; scheduled to fly to the moon and transport minerals back to Earth.<br/>When the game starts, the corporations got eleven months to gather as much minerals as possible before the rocket leaves the moon.<br/>Players are opportunistic investors &ndash;most wealth at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>The players (referred to as &ldquo;investors&rdquo; in this game) see an excellent opportunity to make credits (=money) by investing in and running private companies and mining corporations on the moon. The corporations establish bases on the moon and build road networks to valuable mining resources, mining as much resources as possible until the freight rocket leaves the moon with its cargo of minerals.<br/><br/>The winner is the wealthiest investor when the rocket leaves.

        "description": "Roads to Moscow: Battles of Mozhaysk and Mtsensk, 1941 is a two-player game depicting battles in the Soviet Union during the drive on Moscow in October 1941. The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.<br/><br/>Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.<br/> Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves. The game includes special rules for Soviet rocket artillery, NKVD, and self-propelled gun units, and fuel supply shortages, and much more, all without overwhelming play of the game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 12 hours<br/>Hex: 1.4km (Mozhaysk ), 1.2km (Mtsensk)<br/>Unit: Company to Battalion for most combat units, with Brigade &amp; Division HQs<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>    Three counter sheets (528 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; Mapsheet (front &amp; back printed)<br/>    4 Player Aid set-up cards<br/>    1 Charts &amp; Tables card<br/>    Rule book<br/>    Play book<br/>    1 ten-sided die<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER: Mark Guttag<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

        "description": "&quot;Fifth Corps: The Soviet Breakthrough at Fulda&quot; is one of several games in the Central Front Series published by SPI in the 1980s. &quot;Fifth Corps&quot; appeared in the September/October 1980 issue of Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #82. Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.<br/><br/>Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &quot;contain all enemy breakouts&quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action... The race was on for the important Pomcus and Reforger sites.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June of 1757, Frederick the Great and his highly trained Royal Army of Prussia approaches an Austrian army encamped along a low range of hills. Hoping just one more victory will force the Austrians to sue for peace, Frederick sets in motion his master tactic, the &quot;oblique maneuver&quot; against the enemy right flank. Only now the Austrians are under a new commander, the imperturbable Field Marshal von Daun. He calmly redeploys his forces and the Prussian turning maneuver instead becomes a brutal frontal assault. That night some 10,000 Prussians lay dead on the field, with another 5,000 captured. Frederick suffers his first defeat in the Seven Years War.<br/><br/>Based on the popular La Bataille system, Kolin offers the first authentic treatment of battles during the Age of Reason. Special command and movement rules reflect the inflexible and difficult nature of commanding armies of the day compared to their Napoleonic descendants. Players must master infantry, cavalry, and artillery tactics at a time when trained manpower is extremely valuable, and not mere &quot;cannon-fodder&quot;.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>    420 counters<br/>    3 34&quot; x 22&quot; period maps<br/>    2nd edition standard rules<br/>    Exclusive rules book<br/>    Separate charts and tables <br/>    Insightful historical commentary by Dr. Christopher Duffy.<br/><br/><br/>",

The game depicts February 10, 1943, a day which would come to be known to the Spanish as &ldquo;Black Wednesday.&rdquo; The battle is a microcosm of Soviet offensive operations in World War II.

Further support for the attack came from the T&middot;26, T&middot;34, and KV -1 tanks of the 1st Red Banner Tank Brigade. It was a full Soviet combined arms force striking a skilled dug in enemy.<br/><br/>The Game: Black Wednesday is a full-force TCS treatment of a typical Eastern Front action-massive preparatory barrages against front-line trenches, waves of stubborn Soviet infantrymen, embattled knots of hedgehogged defenders.<br/><br/>Black Wednesday highlights the doctrine and capabilities of massed Red Army troops and the skill, and elan of the elite Spanish Volunteers.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/>     Streamlined Third Edition Game System with the same series rules as Hunters from the Sky. <br/>     Furious situation as the Soviets make a massed assault, the Spanish conduct a grim defense and the Germans come to counterattack.<br/>     First game ever to allow players to fire the largest Railroad Gun in history - the 800mm Gun DORA-as a variant. <br/>     Player Skill is highly rewarded. <br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 20 minutes<br/>Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters<br/>Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium-High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-50 hours<br/><br/><br/>Game number 7 in the Gamers Tactical Combat Series.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.<br/><br/>In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.<br/><br/>The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.<br/><br/>Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.<br/><br/>Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics. As both games go forward, they will continue to draw from the same wealth of fantastically detailed miniatures.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Dust Tactics<br/>    Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>History&rsquo;s best-known naval battle was just one part of the ongoing four-year struggle to control the seas around Germany&rsquo;s coasts. If the German High Seas Fleet could catch and destroy a portion of the much larger British Grand Fleet, the blockade suffocating Imperial Germany might finally be broken.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Jutland is an extensively updated version of the earlier GWAS Vol. II: The North and Baltic Seas published in 1998. It covers not only the signature battle, but also the many other sorties of the High Seas Fleet like the Scarborough, Lowestoft and Gorleston Raids, the Battle of Dogger Bank and Helgoland Bight.<br/><br/>Like all games in the Series: Great War at Sea (Avalanche Press) series, this one is packed with scenarios. Along with the operations in the North Sea, the game also includes the bitterly-fought naval war in the Baltic Sea. Here the roles are reversed, with the smaller Imperial Russian Navy aggressively seeking an advantage against the larger German forces. The Russian cruiser raids are all covered, as well as the climactic Battle of Moon Sound.<br/><br/>The scenario book includes not only more than 40 scenarios, it&rsquo;s packed with the background information about the ships, the men and the battles.<br/><br/>The map covers the North and Baltic Seas, as well as the waters around the British Isles; it&rsquo;s a bit larger than the map in the previous edition. The smaller navies of the region are all represented as well: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s the major powers that get most of the ships. The Royal Navy is huge, with ships ranging from ancient paddle-driven minesweepers to modern battle cruisers like Repulse and Renown. Famous ships like the battleships Dreadnought and Iron Duke, the inaptly-named battle cruiser Invincible, and early aircraft carriers like Engadine and Argus are all here.<br/><br/>The German High Seas Fleet has all the ships that challenged England, from the tiny coast defense ship Siegfried up to the huge battleships Sachsen and W&uuml;rttemburg. The Germans have zeppelins and submarines to help redress the balance somewhat, but it will take skilled play to overcome Britain&rsquo;s sea dogs.<br/><br/>Russia has modern dreadnoughts, but will depend on her armored cruisers and a squadron of older battleships for most missions.<br/><br/>As with other games in the series, the tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.<br/><br/><br/>     32 miles/sea zone campaign scale<br/>     420 1-inch counters, 420 1/2-inch counters<br/>     34&quot; x 22&quot; operational map<br/>     24&quot; x 24&quot; tactical map<br/>     16 page rules, 128 page scenario book<br/><br/><br/>",

Interaction between players is the key of the game system.<br/><br/>The game is played with a wide hand of cards that varies from turn to turn due to players&acute; exploits and events. Cards are the resources of each player (troops, leaders, fleets, diplomacy...) and are played in rounds for events and to send military expeditions to expand your Empire. The game has 3 turns and the end of each one is unpredictable. Each Empire has his own tailored 35-card deck to reflect its own unique characteristics and style of play.<br/><br/>",

That, or be turned over to the mercies of the Baroness&rsquo;s keep guards.<br/><br/>It isn&rsquo;t much of a choice really.<br/><br/>In Runika and the Six-sided Spellbooks, you take on the role of a student at Luniorn&rsquo;s academy. Play against your friends or in one of four solo challenges. Draft customised dice, roll them, and move them into specific runic patterns to cast spells and survive the school year.<br/><br/>If you like dice games that tend towards skill over luck, or if you love the plucky heroes and heroines of young adult fiction or stories of magical apprentices, then you will like Runika. The game is all about making use of the resources in front of you to solve a puzzle that changes every turn.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Each copy of Runika and the Six-sided Spellbooks comes with:<br/><br/><br/>     80 dice (20 in 4 different elements)<br/>     4 spell master cards<br/>     4 player boards with rotating elemental disks<br/>     4 summary cards<br/>     40 mini-American cards (rune and merit cards)<br/>     53 tokens<br/>     1 bag<br/>     1 rulebook<br/>     1 guide to your first game<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will draft new wizards, heroes, and magical creatures into their ranks, building up an army to defeat and defend the different districts of Gateway.<br/><br/>After successfully liberating a district, the player gains access to its unusual power, such as cheaper resources, additional defenses, or even the ability to magically damage foes from afar. Be warned: Not only will other rebel insurgents attempt to steal your districts away from you, but you'll also have to battle against the forces of Chancellor Gideon and an invading onslaught of terrible monsters called the Drueggar.<br/><br/>To aid you in this are Runestones - powerful one-time-use spells that can turn the tide of battle instantly or provide the player with a temporary boost to his coffers. However, once used, Runestones become empty shells and are discarded for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>To win the game, players must collect victory points by defeating the city guard and Drueggar Horde, controlling important districts, or through special insurgent abilities they draft into their ranks. Don't delay and play the waiting game -- if the Drueggar manage to take all the city districts, it&rsquo;s game over for both the insurgents and the innocent citizens of Gateway!<br/><br/>",

This is your way to exclusive perks, superior card effects and to lead the eternal ranking. It might be a tiny victory point at the end of the evening that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>While in a three-player match the challenger is up against the two other players and their combined forces, the two-player set-up is another, very tough duel situation for both sides.

        "description": "&quot;Into the Woods: the Battle of Shiloh&quot; is the eighth installment of the Great Battles of the American Civil War (GBACW) series, published by GMT Games.<br/><br/>The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:<br/>This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest-lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game &ndash; Terrible Swift Sword (SPI) &ndash; designed by Richard Berg in 1976. Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the often chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.<br/><br/>Into the Woods: the Battle of Shiloh includes ten scenarios. They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two-map battles depicting both the first and second day of the struggle. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The game reflects the Confederate surprise, the &quot;greenness&quot; of many units on both sides, as well as the unique role Albert Sidney Johnston played in the Confederate attack.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 hour<br/>Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade (mostly Regiments)<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>One 11 x 17&quot; double-sided full color map<br/>Four &amp; half double-sided countersheets of 1,260 1/2&quot; counters (4 full sheet &amp; 1 half sheet - zero blank counters)<br/>One 44-page GBACW Series Rule Booklet<br/>One 56-page Shiloh Battle Book<br/>Two 4 page Player Aid Card Folders<br/>Two double-sided Battle Events Chart/Ammo Resupply Charts<br/>Two double-sided Terrain Effects Charts/Disorder Tables<br/>One double-sided Turn Track Cards<br/>One double-sided Alert Schedule/Union Brigade Missions Card<br/>Two double-sided Efficiency/Activation Charts<br/>Two 10-sided dice (1 blue &amp; 1 gray)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium-High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 1-4<br/>Playing Time: 3 to 8 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes in order to rid yourself of cards and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and players take turns revealing one card at a time in separate piles. If two face-up cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the totem in the center of the table. The faster player then gives his face-up cards to his unfortunate adversary. To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the totem by mistake. Whoops! Mess up like this, and you must take the face-up cards of all opponents. Other cards force all players to grab for the totem at once or otherwise change game play.<br/><br/>Jungle Speed: Rabbids adds a few twists to the basic Jungle Speed game, starting with a &quot;Raving Rabbids&quot; character that sits atop the token. If a player grabs this Rabbid &ndash; even when someone grabs the totem by mistake &ndash; she can give a card from her face-down stack to the player of her choice. Other cards have players race to create rabbit ears on their head or grab the Rabbid without knocking over the totem. Another special card forces everyone but the active player to close their eyes, while the active player moves the totem to some point on the table within reach of everyone; the other players (with eyes still closed) then race to find the totem first using only their hands. Don't gouge your neighbor too much!<br/><br/>",

Score the most runs by drafting the best dice and stringing together powerful combos! Slowly set up the base runners with singles, and then hit a grand slam, or steal bases to sneak your runners home! The rolls of the dice make each round a whole new ball game. Everyone gets to play even when it&rsquo;s not their turn, so the strategic thinking never ends! Dust off home plate, get out your leather glove, and PLAY BALL!<br/><br/>Baseball Highlights: The Dice Game is played with a set of 9 Play dice, 6 Power dice, 1 Pitcher&rsquo;s die, a game board, and a game sheet for each player.<br/><br/>Each round the active player will roll the Play dice and any Power dice they have unlocked to place them each of the matching 6 board areas. Then, the active player will select one of these 6 areas and will use the dice from that area to cross off boxes in the matching track on their player game sheet. Once they are done, the inactive players select 1 die from 2 different areas to cross off 2 boxes in the matching tracks on their game sheets.<br/><br/>Marking off boxes in the 6 tracks (and the bonus Clutch Hits track) will place new runners on base and advance your existing runners for singles, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, and stolen bases. Each time you advance a base runner to home, you will score 1 run. The player who scores the most runs by the end of the game wins. But be careful, the result on the Pitcher&rsquo;s die may remove some of your base runners before they can score!<br/><br/>Baseball Highlights: The Dice Game is for 1 to 4 players ages 8 and up. Average game length is 20 minutes with mostly simultaneous play.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 Game Board, 25 Sheet Baseball Scorepad, 16 Custom Dice, 1 Rulebook, 16 Wooden Markers<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>Baseball Highlights: The Dice Game is Game #26 in the Gryphon Bookshelf Series of Games.<br/><br/>",

First experiments showed it could push back the frontiers of technology, and even open new horizons for human capabilities. This news was more than enough to stir up the greed of humankind's greatest factions. Each has sent fleets to take over nearby planets where Titanium is abundant &ndash; and even seems to be in constant expansion. From that point on, armed conflicts were bound to happen, and this war will be settled only by controlling the Titanium deposits...<br/><br/>As leaders of these great factions in Titanium Wars, players will purchase buildings to master new technologies and increase their earnings, build their own fleet of custom battleships to defeat their opponents, and expand their space empire. They will have to prove bold, insightful and tactful if they want any chance to win this fierce war.<br/><br/>",

It's been sitting in storage for the past five years and is eager to get rolling again &mdash; and the players of this game will make that happen!<br/><br/>In this smart and innovative tile-laying game, players build new tracks for Rollecate to ride on. But Rollecate is very eager and can't wait to roll, turning this game into an exciting race against the clock. Causing Rollecate to derail is costly, so players have to try to avoid that.<br/><br/>This game combines tile laying, press-your-luck dice rolling, and tactical set building mechanisms into a swift game that is fun to play for all kinds of players.<br/><br/>The game consists of 55 playing cards, four custom dice, and a wooden train figure.

You must groom them for success by bidding on how well you think they can perform at the show. After everyone has placed their bids the action begins as the pups start facing off! If your pups can win the number of showdowns you bid before the round ends you will earn the reward treats. But watch out&hellip; if you miss your bid you must gain the penalty poos. The player who can collect the most treats is the winner!<br/><br/>Pups is a lighthearted twist on classic trick-taking card games. 45 vibrant and adorable illustrations make up the deck in Pups and these cards are split between 5 unique suits: Lap dogs, Working dogs, Guard dogs, Family dogs and Mutts as a unique fifth suit. Combine a Mutt card with any other suit in the game to increase its value!<br/><br/>Players place their bids each round by picking a bid card from the center of the table. The 1, 2 and 3 bid cards are all double sided, with one side displaying a safer &ldquo;At Least&rdquo; bid, and the other side displaying the more difficult (but more lucrative) &ldquo;Exactly&rdquo; bid.<br/><br/>Pups is a fun and thoughtful game that is easy to learn for both gamers and non-games alike. It was designed to introduce a new generation to the fun of trick taking games while proving unique and challenging to veterans of the genre.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the lighthouse company is understaffed, with only three workers to man the six lighthouses. To make matters worse, a storm is coming up the coast. You have to manage which three lighthouse will be turned on at any one time to move your sailboats. Some moves will help all players, while others will help only you. How far will you manage to get you sailboats before the storm catches you?<br/><br/>In more detail, each player has an identical deck of fourteen cards. The game is played over twelve rounds, and each round a player has a hand of three cards. Each turn, the player plays a card to move a number of boats, some their own and some belonging to other players. The cards also adjust which lighthouses are lit, and the boats may move only if the lighthouse they are approaching is lit. At the end of each round, the storm move closer to the boats on the board. Any boats caught by the storm are out of the game and will score points for the last lighthouse that was passed. The game ends when the storm reaches the harbor at the end of the twelfth round. Player add the points earned for each of their boats and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 6, 1944 - 7:09 am<br/><br/>A commanding voice shouts &ldquo;Crowbar!&rdquo; from the carefully monitored radios of Ranger Flotilla headquarters aboard the LSI command ship St. James. With that signal, the 225 men of Dog, Easy and Fox Companies of Force &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the 2nd Ranger Battalion launched one of the most incredible and seemingly impossible assaults of military history.<br/><br/>Tasked with landing on the beaches of Normandy, France and scaling the towering 100-foot cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc in the face of determined German defenders, the Rangers were the only force that could possibly meet this challenge. Despite initially heading in the wrong direction and landing in jumbled order, the elite Rangers were eager to begin their ascent. Their mission was to find and destroy the six huge 150mm artillery pieces that were deployed in the area. These guns had to be neutralized lest they rain down a massive barrage on the American forces landing at nearby Omaha Beach. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the Rangers were also ordered to set up roadblocks on the Vierville-Grandcamp highway to delay and harass any Wehrmacht reinforcements from reaching and counterattacking the D-Day landings.<br/><br/>The Ranger battalion climbed the massive heights against stiff resistance and advanced inland, suffering severe casualties in the process. They took many of the German positions, but no guns were to be found. The Rangers then fought off vicious counterattacks, launched by the German 726th and 914th Grenadier Regiments, and were nearly pushed back into the sea. But under the inspired leadership of Lt. Col. James Earl Rudder, the Rangers held on and eventually found and destroyed the concealed guns and established the needed roadblocks. Bravery and perseverance won the day for the Rangers as they completed another successful chapter in their glorious history.<br/><br/>Crowbar!: The Rangers at Pointe Du Hoc is a solitaire wargame (with two-player and cooperative variants) which abstractly simulates the ebb, flow and risk of the Pointe du Hoc assault, with you playing the attacking Rangers. The game system traces its parentage to the popular &quot;In Magnificent Style&quot; game and mirrors its speed of play, tough decision-making and heart-pounding push-your-luck excitement. But Crowbar! has been updated to allow for an even smoother gameplay experience. For example, instead of the old &ldquo;dice matrix&rdquo; system to determine unit movement results, the game now utilizes four custom Movement Dice. Each die is made up of different results, escalating the possible risk/reward ratio. Dice are thrown one at a time and can be read instantly to determine what happens to the unit. The system also challenges you with even more events, including constant German counterattacks, ammunition shortages, artillery bombardments, booby traps and other surprises. Your goal is to meet your various objectives as quickly as possible, before the German defenders can dig in even deeper and before they can organize effective counterattacks. Ultimate success or failure in the game is measured by how well you do as compared to the actual heroic accomplishments of the Rangers on that historic day. Are you up to the challenge?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

His final wish was that his descendants would share his fortune and the plots of his ranch, with the richest becoming the new head of the family. After all, for him the most important thing was that his money stayed in the family! Pappy thought of everything and left an outline of his belongings. In Pappy Winchester, you and the other heirs are now assembled around this map to divvy up Pappy's possessions...<br/><br/>The game board features 19 plots of land, divided into seven desert plots, six prairie plots, and six forest plots, with train tracks and a river running crossways through the land, and a saloon set apart from everything else. To set up play, give each player $8,000 and two secret objective cards, then place a bonus token face down on each plot of land.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player draws a plot token at random, then players hold an auction for that plot, with the winner marking it with one of their tokens, then revealing the bonus token and carrying out its effects. This token might let you look at the face-down mine or ranch cards to determine the value of those plots; move the train or boat along the tracks or river, with players owning properties adjacent to this vehicle's location earning money; or collect funds from the saloon. The winner of the auction then divides their bid as equally as possible among all other players, with any remainder being placed on the saloon.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a duel token, and when a player is involved in an auction that's down to them and someone else, they can decide to sped that token. If they do, a third player shuffles two duel cards &mdash; one showing a gun being fired, and the other not &mdash; then each bidder takes one of them, with the player holding the firing gun winning the auction.<br/><br/>Five piles of banknotes are laid out at the start of play, with a different shared objective card placed on each pile. If the completion of an auction allows a player to meet one or more of the objectives, such as owning one of each type of land or having three plots that don't touch the river, then that player claims the banknotes under that card. After the 19th auction, players reveal their secret objectives, earning money for how well they've met those goals, and whoever owns the most plots of land receives $5,000. Whoever now holds the most money wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Play as your favorite heroes from Cartoon Network's past and present hit shows: Adventure Time, The Amazing World of Gumball, Clarence, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Regular Show, Samurai Jack, and Steven Universe to take them down! Every main deck card is unique and brimming with Cartoon Network fan service!<br/><br/>In Cartoon Network Crossover Crisis Deck-Building Game, a wacky take on the Cerberus Engine, you'll find everything you've come to expect in a Cryptozoic game: high drama and hijinks! WEAKNESS cards are all unique, dangerous, and may cause a wringing of hands and stomping of feet. Fortunately, PRATFALL cards (which replace Vulnerabilities) are a great way to exit any scene (and get rid of Weaknesses).<br/><br/>Never before seen EVENT cards change things up in crazy ways when they appear out of the main deck. They may literally cause a stomping of feet. Or outlandish zoo animal noises, and more! You never know who will be the next victim, but everyone is in on the hilarity! In the end, only one player will be left laughing as this is a competitive game. You didn't really think all these characters would work together in peace and harmony, did you?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle of Britain by Richard Borg, a remastering and upgrading of the classic, much loved old TSR classic. This upgraded version takes all the brilliant mechanics and features of the original game and adds new features to give an even more exciting and satisfying gaming experience, including new streamlined dogfighting and fuel rules, ace fighter squadrons and the ability to play shorter scenarios in 1-2 hours or the full campaign game in 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>Take command of RAF Fighter Command, marshalling your too few fighter squadrons to protect your homeland&rsquo;s cities, industrial resources, airfields and vital radar chain against the waves of Luftwaffe bombers intent on destroying them and the swarms of fighters intent on shooting the RAF out of the sky. Can you thwart the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s bombing missions, tear the heart out of their bomber and fighter squadrons and survive long enough to win the game?<br/><br/>Take command of Luftflotte 2 and 3 in Northern France and Luftlotte 5 in Norway and use your numerous bomber squadrons, protected by your numerous fighter squadrons, to complete a number of specific bombing missions to win the game. But don&rsquo;t be fooled by your starting strength! Your losses will not be replaced as the Spitfires and Hurricanes carve holes in your ranks. Your medium bombers are not really suited to mass strategic bombing and will struggle to complete their missions. Your fighter squadrons, although mainly composed of the excellent Messerschmidt 109, will struggle with fuel, not having the range and endurance to protect your bombers properly.<br/><br/>In addition, the Plastic Soldier Company has added its plastic miniature expertise to create some fantastic little 1/300th scale plastic airplane models.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in a number of impulses, with faster planes getting to move more often.  A maneuver can take several impulses to complete and is marked with a maneuver marker in the hex that shows the plane's final position.  The object is simply to shoot the other players down before they shoot you down.<br/><br/>The basic game is relatively simple and pays some attention to realism (e.g., it has a unique system of simulating different maneuvers).  Some attempt was made with additional rules to attempt to add some sense of &quot;realism&quot; (with added complexity):  ammo and fuel limits, critical hits, pilot quality, spotting, multiple planes on each side, etc.<br/><br/>Includes 95 counters.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     Mustangs: Expansion Module <br/><br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the adversary, whose goal is to prevent the other players (the investigators) from escaping through a variety of unique actions. As an investigator, your only goals are to survive and escape.<br/><br/>Investigators move around the board in a point-to-point fashion using their base movement speed. They may sprint to move more quickly, but they need to keep an eye on their stamina so they don't become exhausted. Additionally, investigators can pick up and use items, lock and unlock doors, or use their flashlights to try and find the adversary. Meanwhile, the adversary is secretly moving around the board, trying to stop the investigators from escaping. There are a variety of investigators to choose from, each with their own special abilities. The adversary also has multiple attacks and abilities that change how you play the game.<br/><br/>Will you fix the car and drive out, or will you override the gate and try to sneak out? The investigators will need to decide if they want to stick together to watch each other's backs, or split up to race towards the exit. Either way, they must move quickly - the longer the game takes, the more chances the adversary has to stop them!<br/><br/>The game ends when either all of the investigators escape (meaning the investigators won) or the adversary achieves their win condition (which is different for each adversary).<br/><br/>",

You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more ?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty ? What is his mobile ? What is the murder weapon ? And some subsidiary questions, of course.<br/><br/>Do not miss the culprit otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you will not reveal will decide you.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions.

As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.<br/><br/>Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.<br/><br/>Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.<br/><br/>Game length is variable and selected at outset.

You then use these cards to play a trick-taking game with all other players, with none of you knowing the true value of any card played until the end of each trick. Your neighbor's preference rank is the card's strength. Card 1 is highest and 0 is lowest, but if 1 and 0 appear in the same trick, 0 wins.<br/><br/>Because you are playing with someone else's favorite things, each trick provokes unique insights into your fellow players and sparks interesting conversations. Does Paul like Power Rangers more than Anthony likes Banana Milkshake or Archie likes Italian Disco? These are the deductions and judgement calls you'll need to make in My Favourite Things.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alias consists of many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.<br/><br/>Based on Alias' success, Tactic has kept publishing re-implemented versions of the same basegame, such as Fame Alias, Junior Alias, Junior Alias: Travel, Muumi Alias, Family Alias,  Party Alias,  High School Musical Party Alias, and has also licensed Noteability as Musiikki Alias.<br/><br/>Tactic gives the official launch year of Alias as 1991, but the first edition was actually available already in 1990 and a limited release of the game may have been issued as early as 1989.<br/><br/>Expansions in the form of additional decks of cards have been published since the early 1990's.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From time beyond memory, a great evil overlord has plagued the land, his ruthless cruelty matched only by his ruthlessly poor decorating taste. That evil overlord has died, and numerous pretenders are vying to take over his throne. And everyone knows that the first step on the journey to becoming a legendary evil boss is to set up a nefarious lair.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s where you come in. You are a dungeon decorator who specializes in setting up cozy underground spaces with just the right &ldquo;lair-y&rdquo; feel for your clients. You will compete against your opponents to build the best dungeon with all the right accoutrements, so that your villainous clients can move in, feel at home, and get right down to evilling.<br/><br/>Dungeon Decorators is a competitive &ldquo;light euro&rdquo; tile-drafting strategy game for 2 to 4 players. Select tiles that give you the right combination of chilling chambers, harrowing hallways and dire decorations, then play goal cards to score points. The player who scores the most points achieves victory by impressing the client and setting them on their path to becoming the next legendary evil!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Conflict is resolved by dice rolls; the die results can be a number or a symbol, which might allow the player to use a special weapon. Instead of a character sheet, the players have equipment &quot;backpacks&quot; which can be filled with weapons, potions, keys, etc., depending on what they find during their adventure.<br/><br/>Heroica: Fortaan is a castle, so the players move through rooms on a grid of grey flat LEGO bricks. The set-up includes a throne room and various gates to be passed through (provided one finds the right keys).<br/><br/>Heroica: Fortaan can be combined with any or all other games in the Series: LEGO Heroica series.<br/><br/>",

One day, a petty argument boiled over to a fight, and once the fight grew to the point that the royal guards had to be called in, there was no way to contain the situation. It was going to be Kune v Lakia!<br/><br/><br/>KUNE v LAKIA: A Chronicle Of A Royal Lapine Divorce Foretold is a game for two players, each acting for the Duke or the Princess during the divorce proceedings.<br/><br/>A starting hand of five assets (manors, jewelry and abundant wealth) is drawn, and the players use those assets to influence members of the royal lapine court (the abbot, the sorceress, the duke's sister, the king, and the knight). The favors gained and plots hatched are represented by cards added to each player's deck. These cards can be used to further influence courtiers, hide property, and hinder the opponent's ability to do the same.<br/><br/>Much like in a real-life divorce, this is a highly interactive process, and not an easy one at that. In a game of behind-the-scenes plotting and intrigue, only the most clever player will emerge victorious in the struggle for prestige, property and power!<br/><br/>",

The saying means, &quot;When a crow cries, I must leave this place. Even if I must kill crows all over the world, I want to stay with you a little while longer.&quot; The song expresses his longing for amorous time to be prolonged for even just a short while.<br/><br/>In the game Sanzen Sekai: I'd kill all the crows in the world to be with you a little longer, now titled Crows Overkill in its newest edition, players roleplay guests in a red-light district. Many birds gather in front of each player. The players must kill or move birds to prevent them from crying. If birds in front of a player cry, that player must leave the red-light district to go home (i.e. drop out of the game). The player who manages to stay in the red-light district for the longest time wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, players attempt to be the last one called away from the red-light district by the cry of crows, warblers, and roosters.  The game consists of two decks of cards &mdash; birds and shamisen &mdash; along with a time board. Each turn follows this sequence:<br/><br/><br/>    Cards are drawn from both decks. Birds are placed on the table in front of the current player, while shamisen cards go into their hand.<br/>    Shamisen cards are then played to eliminate birds.<br/>    A check is made against the time board to see whether the remaining birds cry and the current player is eliminated.<br/><br/><br/>The turns continue until one player remains in the game and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

As long as the segment is different, cogineers gain cognition (game points) for doing so. When a mechanism is repaired fully it can no longer be modified by the other cogineers who all have their own agenda for repairs. There is bonus cognition and bonus turns to be awarded for clever repairs as well.<br/><br/>COGZ is a very simple game though it hides a huge amount of strategic depth which is normally discovered as cogineers gain experience.

As the U.S. commander, you maneuver your task forces and conduct air searches in a tension-packed contest to find the Japanese carriers before they locate and attack yours.  Simple game mechanics control Japanese movement and determine the timing and strengths of their attacks. You will not know that a Japanese air strike is headed your way until it is detected by radar and you scramble your fighters to intercept.<br/><br/>The game has a total of nine scenarios.   Four learning scenarios take you through the rules by programmed instruction using slices of the real battle.  The other five are full-scale, fully replayable games.  These include one-day scenarios for each day of the action, a two-day scenario for the whole battle, a hypothetical scenario presuming different US plans, and a hypothetical scenario in which Midway was never fought and the Japanese come armed with the full Pearl Harbor striking force.<br/><br/>Carrier Battle: Philippine Sea is based on Carrier: The Southwest Pacific Campaign – 1942-1943 (Victory Games, 1990) but is a new, standalone wargame.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>",

It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!<br/><br/>HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.<br/><br/>WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.<br/><br/>MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.<br/><br/>After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.<br/><br/>When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.<br/><br/>Darkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.<br/><br/>",

It is time for elves, knights, and dwarves to tremble; a time for orcs to have unhygienic habits; a time for arrogant wizards to be put in their place; a time to write your epic tale. Do well and minstrels will sing about your deeds for generations. Do badly, and you will not even have your name scrawled on the privy wall. It is time for your mighty deeds to be chronicled on your Dragonscroll.&quot;<br/><br/>In Dragonscroll, players take on the role of young dragons, each trying to become the most infamous in the land. Each player has a number of Dragonscroll cards, containing tasks to increase their renown and add to their story.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws and places a tile, which is added to the known world. These tiles may reveal enemies, such as wizards, elves and orcs; villages; or even lost royalty, optimistically eager for a lift home. The player then flies to a new location before raining fireballs down on any unsuspecting foes, using the flaming tower of death to determine where they land. At any point during his turn, he also has one bonus action, chosen from one of three double-sided cards. After choosing a bonus, the card is turned over, showing a different bonus action. A player may also eat three creatures to increase the number of fireballs he shoots.<br/><br/>If a dragon manages to complete a task from one of his Dragonscroll cards, he may add it to his story. The dragon with the most illustrious story at the end of the game wins, and his tale will be recorded as Dragonscroll.<br/><br/>Dragonscroll includes four dragon models and five buildings as the trademark large-scale Fragor components, in addition to wooden fireballs, wizard meeples, goat meeples, 64 large terrain tiles, 60 cards, and &quot;a fireball flaming tower of death&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Ball-ROG&quot; by co-designer Gordon Lamont.<br/><br/>",

Whichever letter appears the most in a position is the crowd favorite; those letters stay revealed, while all other letters are turned face-down again. Whichever player (or players) has the most cards revealed at the end of a round scores a point; if a player has all five cards revealed, she scores two points. Whoever scores seven points first wins.<br/><br/>What's It To Ya? can also be played in teams, with one player on a team trying to match the ranking of the other member. Scoring is handled the same as in the group game, and the first team to earn seven points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1793. France cowers under the Reign of Terror, and not even the innocent are safe from the Committee of Public Safety and their precious guillotine. In the midst of this turmoil, one man uses courage and cunning to fight the brutality: The Scarlet Pimpernel. Along with his League of followers, The Scarlet Pimpernel rescues the innocent from under the very noses of the Committee, leaving behind only a card showing a small pimpernel flower. The man behind the rescues, Englishman Sir Percy Blakeney, must keep his identity a secret from all but his closest associates.<br/><br/>In The Scarlet Pimpernel, you play as members of the league helping the Scarlet Pimpernel accomplish seven missions, rescuing the innocent from the guillotine. No mission will be as important as the last, for you save the young Dauphin, heir to the French throne, by whisking him away to Vienna. As a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, you help carry out missions by securing the route and location, obtaining the required number of supporters and resources (horses, carts, papers, and disguises), and filling the five mission spaces. This task is done by placing your cubes in various locations on the board to score points. Although players work together to accomplish missions, only the player with the highest score at the end of the game will become the Scarlet Pimpernel&rsquo;s most trusted advisor.<br/><br/>Gameplay starts with the player who has the first player marker and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must either TAKE AN ACTION or PASS. You may additionally USE A REST CUBE after your initial action. The round ends when each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it, OR all players have passed in succession. You then move on to completing the mission.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must take an action or pass. Actions available to you on your turn include the basic action on your player tile OR actions listed on any ONE Special Favor tile you have collected. The basic action on your player tile allows a choice between two actions: Move Your Pawn or Place a Cube. Special favor tiles give you two actions denoted by the &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol.<br/><br/>Play continues until each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it OR all players have passed in succession. When this happens you immediately complete the current mission. After the seventh mission is completed, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Panzer Grenadier: Elsenborn Ridge covers the fierce fighting on the &quot;north shoulder&quot; of the Battle of the Bulge between the American First Army and the German Sixth SS Panzer Army and Fifth Panzer Army. The heroic stand at St. Vith by 7th Armored Division, the &quot;panzer graveyard&quot; of Krinkelt, the destruction of 1st SS Panzer Division &mdash; it's all here, and more.<br/><br/>Elsenborn Ridge is a stand-alone game in the Series: Panzer Grenadier (Avalanche) series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 35 scenarios. These include fierce tank battles and infantry actions, including the failed drive of Jochen Peiper's battle group toward the Meuse River, 3rd Armored Division's destruction of 2nd SS Panzer Division, the American stand along Elsenborn Ridge and the collapse of the 106th Infantry Division.<br/><br/>Pieces include American paratroopers, German Tiger II tanks, American P47 fighter-bombers, German &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; rocket launchers, and much more. Both German regular army and Waffen SS troops are present. There are four semi-rigid mapboards, created by artist Guy Riessen.<br/><br/>The 2015 printing of Elsenborn Ridge sports a new cover, and includes the Panzer Grenadier Fourth Edition rules.<br/><br/>",

The puzzle boards show an arrangement of squares that can be covered with two tiles (on the easy side) or three (on the hard side); the tiles to be used are depicted on the board.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player reveals her board, finds the tiles needed, then races to place them appropriately. The first player to do so flips a sandtimer, then grabs gems from a bag, 2-4 depending on the number of players in the game. The next player to complete her puzzle in time grabs one fewer gem, and so on.<br/><br/>The player who has accumulated the most gems after seven rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

The more you struggle to survive, the more the other survivors begin to look delicious to you&hellip;<br/><br/>Who Should We Eat? is a semi-cooperative game of desert island survival and resorting to cannibalism way too quickly. You know that not all of you will make it off the island, which means that only the strong will survive, but deep down you also feel something supernatural about this place &mdash; that the veil between the spirit world and this mortal existence is pa&shy;per thin.

No one speaks of it, or even acknowledges its existence, but when it comes to taking out the garbage, it's all about the art of the dodge. In the pursuit of avoidance, each dexterously stacked banana peel represents a small victory. That candy wrapper hidden in the deep recesses of your room is a silent success. But the greenish milk carton you secretly stashed under your roommate's bed, that was a stroke of genius! That is, until you get caught making a mess while everyone else pretends they would never be so childish &mdash; as to get caught. Be careful and be cunning because only the champion can gloat in a hammock while everyone else lugs out the trash on garbage day.<br/><br/>In Garbage Day, players take turns stacking garbage cards one at a time onto the overflowing garbage can, or stashing garbage cards in their rooms. But once a player's room gets too full, they must clean it by stacking all the cards from that room on top of the garbage can, very carefully, one by one. If garbage cards fall off the garbage can during your turn, place them in your overflow pile. If your overflow pile gets too big, you're eliminated from the game. If all other players have been eliminated, you win!<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of four suits, two have one through twelve cards, two have one through fifteen cards.  The suits are ranked high to low, with the fifteen suits in the middle.  Each turn, players have to play a card onto the last card played.  In order for the play to be legal, the card played must be 'higher' in either suit or numeric value.  If you play a card that beats the last card in both categories (suit and value), then you must play another card with the same restrictions.  If you cannot play a card, then you take penalty.  The first person to play his entire hand ends the hand, and everyone scores the value of the remaining cards in his hand.  During subsequent hands, the player with the highest score (the current loser) can decide to reverse the suit order (mirror it) to make his hand better.<br/><br/>",

The offensive soon faltered. In December, General O'Connor led the outnumbered Allies in a counter-attack that crushed the 10th Army and threw the remnants out of Cyrenaica. So began two years of fluid, seesaw operations waged by Axis and Allies at the edge of the desert on the rim of Africa.<br/><br/>Western Desert, Europa VI, simulates the campaigns in Egypt and Libya from December 1940 until January 1943, as well as the peripheral operations on Malta and Cyprus, and in Syria and Lebanon. <br/>Two 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps display the battlegrounds from Tripoli to the Levant, along with Cyprus, Crete, Malta, and part of Sicily. Over a dozen types of terrain are charted. More than 400 die cut cardboard counters represent the military units that took part in the campaign. The Italian 10th Army and 5th Army, Rommel's Afrika Korps, and the British 9th Army and 8th Army (containing troops of many na-tionalities) are deployed as individual battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions &mdash; each with its historical strengths and capabilities. Aircraft units are groups of approximately 40-50 planes organized by type (such as fighter or dive-bomber) and model (from obsolete CR.42 biplanes to Me109's and Spitfires). The rules utilize basic Europa game mechanics as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in more detail.<br/><br/>Western Desert is designed to be played by itself as a separate game and also to mate readily with The Europa Series games.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    two 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps<br/>    480 die cut counters<br/>    complete set of rules<br/>    chart set<br/>    two dices<br/><br/><br/>Playing Time: 6+ hours<br/>Number of Players: 2 players<br/>Complexity: Master<br/><br/>Design: John M.

In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies.<br/><br/>In EONS, players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious...<br/><br/>Players build stars using elements commonly found in the universe, Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Iron.  Once they build stars, the stars perform fusion, and can produce resources for the player to use to build additional stars, planets or other cosmic events.  Each cosmic body the player builds is worth Essence, representing the power and influence the Architect has in the universe, and that Essence can be used to purchase more elements from the elemental stockpile to build more items.  Players can also destroy stars and collect resources from the dead stars, and this is where the game turns to strategy and planning.  Every cosmic body that is destroyed will decrease the entropy countdown, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.<br/><br/>Remaining cosmic bodies that grant victory points are totaled, and the player with the most victory points, wins!  Although the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game, you will find that the game is also a resource management game, as if you deny resources that stars need to undergo fusion, they will die and accelerate endgame.  Be prepared, build judiciously and destroy when you must to defend your universe!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A royal family with a penchant for towers has decreed the builders of the kingdom &ndash; the players &ndash; to perk up the kingdom's skyline with new spires. In answer to their call, players compete to catch the eye of the royal family and ultimately, the title of Royal Builder. Players must be careful though. If they build a spire taller than the royal palace, they'll be penalized instead of praised.<br/><br/>Spires combines hand management, a unique take on trick-taking, and set collection into a 25-minute game. Players compete for cards in different markets to try to build out their tableaus.<br/><br/>Every player aims to fill their tableau with spires of each type but must be careful not to add more than three of any one type of card. Once the spire exceeds three cards, all cards of that type become a penalty to their final score. Competing for cards can be tricky as rival builders can force you to take cards that push you over the three-card limit, but not to worry! You can also win cards that allow you to manage your tableau.<br/><br/>The builder with the most points, including spires and bonuses (special cards, symbol majorities, etc.), wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HOCKEY BLAST is an &quot;old-school&quot; card-chart-and-dice simulation of pro hockey. Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.  It was introduced by PLAAY Games in April of 2010.<br/><br/>The game differs significantly from similarly-themed hockey games in a number of ways.<br/><br/>First, it re-creates hockey action totally differently than existing games like APBA and Strat-O-Matic.  Rather than re-creating a hockey game pass-by-pass and shot-by-shot, HOCKEY BLAST re-creates the action minute-by-minute.  The game charts crystallize each minute's action, and a unique &quot;lull&quot; mechanism allows the gamer to fast-forward past uneventful minutes.  The result is a hockey game that plays quickly, yet captures all the nuances and excitement of real hockey.<br/><br/>Second, HOCKEY BLAST realistically incorporates momentum and fights into the game play. In HOCKEY BLAST, a team plays better when it has momentum.  It can gain momentum in a number of ways--by landing a big hit, scoring a goal, making a spectacular save, or having one of its players win a fight. In other hockey games, fights can occur, but have no real effect on the game other than to send participants to the penalty box.  In HOCKEY BLAST, the classic hockey &quot;enforcer&quot; persona has a real role, just as in real hockey.<br/><br/>Another way HOCKEY BLAST is different is that it provides fans with instructions on how to rate their own players and teams.  The company encourages this, and even posts user-created card sets for free download on its website, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.plaay.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.plaay.com</a>.<br/><br/>The game comes in a two-piece labeled box with a game book that contains all the necessary charts, a hockey rink game board, a set of strategy cards, dice, markers for momentum and penalties, an instructions booklet, scoresheets, and two sample teams.  Full player card sets based on historical pro hockey seasons are available, along with a fictional player card series that is updated annually.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nemo is gone, but his machines have opened a whole new world to us! The floors of Neptune's seas lay open to us, ready to surrender their bounties. Equip and upgrade your mining machines, then guide them to the rich mineral seams beneath the ocean. Control the supply of resources to bend the market to your will. Become the master of Nautilus Industries!<br/><br/>In the game, players take on the role of an enterprising business owner, with each trying to exploit the riches of the sea as well as the marketplace to earn the most money by the end of the game. Players take a series of simple actions, such as programming a mining robot, increasing warehouse capacity, swapping mining zone order, or purchasing stocks.<br/><br/>Each round, players have three actions they must take before the market phase. During this phase, players collect and sell resources, in turn order. Each sea zone is mined in a specific order, and players have the option each round to sell or hold their resources for a later round. When resources are sold, the market price of that resource decreases to reflect the supply/demand of that resource; stocks of the company using that resource also increase in value. Accordingly, if a resource is not sold, the market price for that resource increases. Players must decide when to sell and when to hold. Should you flood the market to bring down the price so your neighbor makes less money? Do you think the player beside you will hold out for a higher price, or will they sell just to spite you?<br/><br/>Nautilus Industries is easy to learn because of the simple actions you take, yet dynamic because of the way the markets, stocks, and players affect the gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. 3: The Solomon Islands is the third game in the Last Hundred Yards Series. This game focuses on the vicious and brutal Solomons Campaign, including actions to control the islands of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and New Georgia.<br/><br/>When you play the Solomon Islands Campaign missions, you will experience some of the fiercest small unit actions in the Pacific Theater. The game will focus on actions involving the 1st (The Old Breed) and 3rd (Fighting Third) Marine Divisions, as well as the Army&rsquo;s 25th Infantry Division&mdash;the unit that finally drove the Japanese off the island, earning them the nickname &ldquo;Tropic Lightning.&rdquo;<br/> Take to the jungles of Guadalcanal with the 1st Marine Division as they begin the first ground offensive of the war. Landed onto Guadalcanal and with intermittent naval support as the struggle for naval supremacy raged offshore, the Marines fought tooth and nail to secure their small foothold around Henderson Airfield. They fought against Japanese Reinforcements coming from all over the South Pacific area. Engage in bitter jungle fighting with the 3rd Marine Division as they attempt to hold and expand the beachhead on Bougainville Island against the Imperial Japanese 6th Infantry Division.<br/><br/>Finally, serve with the 25th Infantry Division&rsquo;s famed 27th Regiment, the &ldquo;Wolfhounds,&rdquo; as they try to reduce Japanese positions on Guadalcanal&rsquo;s Galloping Horse Ridge (an action that is portrayed in the movie &ldquo;The Thin Red Line&rdquo;). You will also fight with the Wolfhounds in the jungle around Munda Point for the airfield on New Georgia. Each of these actions involved tense jungle warfare and the routing out of fanatical Japanese units from hidden bunkers and pillboxes. You will understand the nerve-racking frustration of clearing an enemy position, only to have infiltrators attack you yet again from a different direction, at night!<br/> This volume introduces new weapons and terrain including flamethrowers, anti-tank halftracks, light and heavy jungle. Each mission will provide new challenges with different elements, forces, and situations encountered, making this volume an exciting and nail-biting addition to The Last Hundred Yard Series.<br/><br/>This game is a stand alone game. It does NOT require ownership of The Last Hundred Yards to be played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mysterious building rise over the hill, bathed with a crepuscular light. Astonished by the strange aura of the Pagoda, you decide to investigate it. Suddenly, a laugh, a shadow which is not yours and an eye with ominous pretensions turns alive. You have broken the peace of ten powerful Japanese spirits (called Yokai) who rested there! Will you find a way to calm their wrath?<br/><br/>A game of Yokai Pagoda is played through 3 rounds, playing always one card per turn, until someone ends the current round. To play a game, you shuffle the 100 number cards (divided by 10 kinds of Yokai, numbered from 1 to 10), lay out two cards face-up to start the two discard piles, then deal seven cards to each player.  Place the rest as the Pagoda deck, between the discard piles.<br/><br/>When you play card, deal with one of the following effects:<br/><br/>     Playing the same Yokai or the same number allows you to give someone one card from your hand.<br/>     With a different Yokai and a higher number you can take one random card from the deck -or- the first face-up card from the opposite dicard pile.<br/>     With a different Yokai and a lower number you can go on with the round as nothing happened -or- end the current round, but only if you have a total amount of three or less points in your hands. But... you must take only into account the lowest card of each kind of Yokai you have!<br/><br/><br/>At that moment, everyone keeps the cards from their hand into a personal reserve. After 3 rounds, the one with less points in their reserve wins but... again you must take only into account the lowest card of each kind of Yokai you have.<br/><br/>Try to match the balance between lose cards or keep the exact amount you need to reduce your score when other player ends the round. In Yokai Pagoda, knowing when to give a card, keep playing or end the round makes the difference!<br/><br/>",

Then move the initial unit that attacked to create the hole...the decisions are yours!<br/><br/>Breakthroughs will occur, having the right units in position to expoit your opportunities is critical.

In 1845, India's first railway was incorporated, the Madras Railway. Sixteen years later, on a warm April day in 1853, a 14-carriage train carrying 400 passengers was hauled 21 miles by three steam locomotives - the Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan - and passenger railway service was thus initiated in India. From there, as they say, the rest is history, and India today has the world's fourth-largest railway network.<br/><br/>18 India is an operational railroad game for 2 to 5 people that plays in about 3 hours. The game is inspired by 1829 Mainline by Francis Tresham, and while the venerable Mr. Tresham created some novel mechanics for that game, many of them are not ideal for players that eschew in-game randomness. In 18 India, those random elements are transformed into an amazing level of pre-game variability, which gives each session of the game a different character.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 22 June 1941, under the codeword &quot;Dortmund&quot;, the German Wehrmacht and other Axis powers started the invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 150 divisions &ndash; ca. 3,6 million troops &ndash; of the Axis invaded the USSR along a front of 2,900 km. In addition to troops, Barbarossa involved 600,000 motor vehicles, 750,000 horses, 3350 tanks, 7300 guns, and nearly 2000 planes &ndash; the largest invasion in the history of warfare.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN THE EAST is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought on the Eastern Front from the beginning of the invasion in summer 1941 until the dramatic end in Berlin in spring 1945. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II.<br/><br/>The game is recommended for two or four players: one/two control the Soviet Red Army and the other one/two control Germany and the other Axis powers. In a threesome, one player controls one faction while the other two players control the other faction. The game is furthermore suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, a play with Fog of War is suggested.<br/><br/>Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over an astonishing 125x87 cm (49&quot;x34&quot;) full laminated multicolor mapboard, the only paper component in the box is the rules manual. In total, more than 600 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:<br/>&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts of BITE and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.<br/>&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.<br/>&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Technology Research, Strategic Warfare with the bombing of Germany and U-boat campaigns in the oceans, Amphibious Landings, Airborne Assaults, and more.<br/><br/>In BLOCKS IN THE EAST, a hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 km) across, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally corps size) with 300 planes, 300 tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc. The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).<br/><br/>Players can compete in the full 1941 Codeword Dortmund Campaign, in one of four six-turn scenarios (&quot;Operation Barbarossa 1941&quot;, &quot;Case Blue - The Drive to Baku 1942&quot;, &quot;Operation Citadel - The Battle of Kursk 1943&quot; and &quot;Bagration Offensive in Summer 1944&quot;), or one of the shorter, easy-to-learn scenarios (&quot;Road to Rostov&quot;, which lasts six turns, or any of these scenarios: &quot;Road to Leningrad&quot;, &quot;Road to Moscow&quot; or &quot;Short Barbarossa&quot;). Each scenario has different victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 49 turns.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN THE EAST can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the West and Blocks in Afrika.<br/><br/>",

Preceded by a devastating orbital attack, a warlike alien race known as the Hydra has besieged the planet, their invasion force carried on enormous drop ships that dwarf city blocks and rain devastation from above. The Hydra&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to eradicate the last survivors of their ancient nemesis, the Ghin, an alien race that has taken refuge on Earth. Humanity is caught in the apocalyptic crossfire. As widespread panic grips the populace, governments topple, economies crumble, and order dissolves. In these desperate days, mankind&rsquo;s only hope lies with the Ghin and one of their most brilliant minds: Dr. Cronos, a being as guilty of atrocities against humanity as those who hunt him.<br/><br/>LEVEL 7 [INVASION] is a standalone semi-cooperative game of global strategy set in the LEVEL 7 universe that follows the events of LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE], LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE]: Lockdown, and LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. As the planet is battered by the Hydra's relentless assault, you'll control Earth's desperation-forged coalitions in an effort to turn back the invasion. But soldiers aren't enough. You and your allies must manage your resources carefully to combat the threats of hysteria, famine, and population loss as well. Endure long enough, and you might buy the time for Dr. Cronos to develop the advanced weaponry required to defeat the invading Hydra. The survival of the human race depends on your next move!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You have been robbed and left for dead in the middle of nowhere. Without proper clothes or equipment, you must reach the civilized village before you die from hunger, thirst or exhaustion. But there are wild animals lurking, mountains blocking the way, and a wide variety of unpleasant diseases waiting to invade your body. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, you feel a taunting raindrop on your cheek&hellip;<br/><br/>In Wilderness, 2 to 8 players race to the nearest civilized village &ndash; but the village is not near, and the way there is not paved. You will have to find water, search for food, avoid wolves, bears and snakes, endure sicknesses and keep your strength up to be able to get there.<br/><br/>Each player's health is tracked with three parameters: thirst, hunger and exhaustion. Every turn you get more thirsty and hungry and exhausted. The thirstier and hungrier you are, the more exhausted you become, and that determines how much energy you will have each turn. If the exhaustion hits the bottom, you die. The energy is used to walk, but also to search for food or rest. To regain your strength (reduce your exhaustion) you also have to sleep. One of the biggest risks is encountering a predator since they attack you with two dice and you defend with only one and increase exhaustion equal to the difference. And they can scent you from a mile away...<br/><br/>The game board is discovered gradually as players progress across it, and there are six turns each day (four day turns, two night turns). Each day has different special rules and each landscape tile has its own challenges. Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.<br/><br/>Besides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.<br/><br/>The hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011. FryxGames is releasing a professionally published version in the first half of 2012, and this version will have improved game play and graphics. For example, search for food has replaced hunting. It is not very likely that you have the equipment you need to hunt. Instead, food will be slightly easier to find but will not fill your stomach as much as before.<br/><br/>",

But you're not the only ambitious young fox around here...<br/><br/>Each round in Master Fox, you flip three cards to reveal the animals you must capture, then shuffle the pawns inside the box, put on your fox blindfolds, and start feeling around with your hand for the right pawns! But your bag isn't big enough to hold more than four catches, so you can't grab everything you touch...<br/><br/>Whenever you think you have the right pawns, shout &quot;Stop!&quot; to end the round.

        "description": "Freeman's Farm 1777 is the first in our Battle Formations game series. These games are based on a new game system that has been designed for solitaire and two-player gaming.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to break three of the formations of the opposing side.  This is done by activating your formations and choosing the best actions for it to undertake given the state of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Should you fire your artillery or attack with your infantry?  Or should you move your formation to a part of the battlefield that provides an advantage?  Or reinforce a faltering formation with troops from a stronger formation?  Whatever choice you make, there is a cost to the morale of your active formation.<br/><br/>Further, you are limited by the number of times you can call upon a formation, and once called upon you must decide how long you want it to press the attack.<br/><br/>Each time you call upon a formation your army gains momentum.  As your army builds momentum it allows you to press your formations to continue attacking, but the cost is a reduction in the momentum the army has built up as well as reductions in the morale of the attacking formations.<br/><br/>Each formation has a fixed number of troop markers that can be hit in combat and are also subject to breaking from morale loss.  Each formation can only be activated when its activation card is played, and these are limited and not always available.  Each formation reduces its morale when activated and when continuing attacks.<br/><br/>Formations are broken when they fail a morale test OR when all their troop markers are eliminated.<br/><br/>Players decide which formations to activate and how far to push once they begin attacking. Push just enough and they can win the day.  Push too much and a failed morale test will break them.<br/><br/>Freeman's Farm has been designed for easy set up and quick game play. Game unit placement is shown on the game board and units are wooden markers representing troop and artillery formations. The game was developed for solitaire play AND for two players.  In solitaire mode players can play as either the American or the British against the solitaire player game engine.<br/><br/>",

The different factions of bugs &mdash; ants, flies, bees, mosquitos and cockroaches &mdash; find themselves in an ever-shifting balance of power and only those who ally themselves with the most powerful will seize the day.<br/><br/>Bug Council of Backyardia is a trick-taking game that utilizes a mancala mechanism to dynamically shift which suits are powerful throughout the game, which is played over three rounds. Each round, players receive eleven cards to play ten tricks. During the tricks, the leader plays a suit and the rest of the players follow with a card of the same suit, if possible. Whoever plays the strongest card of the strongest suit wins the trick and collects it for scoring! Meanwhile, whoever plays the lowest on-suit card gets to visit the Bug Council; this player chooses a faction tile, collects its strength cubes, then distributes them in a clockwise fashion around the council, thus altering the strength of the suits.<br/><br/>At the end of ten tricks, players use their remaining card to claim their allegiance to the faction matching its suit. If you play your cards right and manipulate the council to your favor, you can get a nice allegiance bonus to add to the tricks you've won.<br/><br/>At the end of three rounds, whoever has the most points wins the game and will be forever remembered in the annals of Backyardia history!<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

Arena mode lets 2-8 players fight one another in a battle royale setting.<br/> In a two player game, players choose which team to control, the fantasy team consisting of Brog, Gildri, and Randar, or the Wasteland team consisting of Exile, Firebug, Penny, and Lost Boy. <br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has the same deck of ten cards, which contain seven &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards and three &ldquo;0&rdquo;cards. The first player draws five cards, and adds the total of their values. That number represents the number of actions the player can use for their team. Actions can be moving one space or attacking. These actions can be spread across the entire team, or used by only one character, depending on a character&rsquo;s traits. <br/>During an attack, the attacking player rolls the number of dice equivalent to the attacking character&rsquo;s attack stat. The defending player rolls the number of dice equal to the defending character&rsquo;s defense dice. The number of reds rolled are added up, and the defender takes damage equal to the number of reds the attacking character rolls above the total of their defending roll.<br/> Each player then adds up the number of green dice they rolled, and earns one coin for each green die.<br/> coins are saved up and used to buy new weapons from the weapon marketplace, to destroy &ldquo;zero&rdquo; cards in their hands, to purchase better cards from the main deck, or upgrade their individual character stats.<br/> Each character has an upgrade shop. Players can choose any of the available stats to upgrade in any order for any of their characters, and spend the appropriate amount of tokens to get those upgrades. When a character is fully upgraded, that character unlocks their special power, which is unique for each character.<br/> When a character is killed, the player who killed that character earns the number of victory points printed on the character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card, and the player whose character was killed draws a &ldquo;zero&rdquo; card from the &ldquo;zeroes&rdquo; pile for every victory point listed on the killed character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card and adds it to their discard pile. The killed character respawns in their base immediately, but that character cannot move or attack on their next turn, and effectively loses a turn while respawning. <br/>The first player to reach ten victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are six different (but equal) gambling joints where bits representing money are distributed at the beginning of each round. The object of the game is to finish with the most money. Players simultaneously choose a card from their hands to play. Each card corresponds to one of the six gambling joints and depicts either a gambler or a cop. The cards are revealed, and in each gambling joint where a gambler has been played, the money will be awarded, &agrave; la Hoity Toity/Adel Verplichtet, to the gambler unless a cop has also been played in the joint, in which case the cop gets it; if a cop  shows up but no gambler, the money stays where it is for the next round. When two gamblers or two cops both claim the money in the same joint, a negotiation mechanism which may involve the roll of a die comes into play. You have to do well in the simultaneity sweeps to get into contention at all, but doing well in the negotiation can make the difference between coming in first or second.<br/><br/>The game comes in a small package about the size of a videotape and is attractively decorated in a sort of mid-1970s Gil Kane/Joe Giella DC Comics style.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Iron and Oak is game of ship-to-ship combat set during the American Civil War. As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.<br/><br/>You command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.<br/><br/>Many of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.<br/><br/>In addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.<br/><br/>If you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.<br/><br/>Two or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.<br/><br/>This innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.<br/><br/>At its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers? Will the Atlanta defeat the two Union monitors in kind or again slip aground and strike her colors. This time, you get to determine the outcome. You are not bound by history&rsquo;s stories.<br/><br/>",

Will you take on challenges or hire help, develop your town or command its heroes? Your strategies, risks, and fortune can transform your village into a thriving city or forgotten ruins.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Villagers and Villains is a card game with over 100 unique cards. The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 6 distinct Phases. During each Phase, all players (Mayors) have a chance to take specific actions. The Mayor who builds the most successful village wins.<br/><br/>Game play: <br/>Villagers and Villains is a building game. In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size. At that time the game is scored.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>In the end each town is scored based on a variety of facets and features. Players have to assess which facet will score the most points as the game is played--and circumstances dictate.<br/><br/>Features: <br/>The game ships with a basic and advanced version for experienced and novice gamers and special 2-player game rules. In the advanced game players gain access to the king's favor, special card powers, and pairing options for final scoring. In addition, the home site offers a variety of rules variations for added game play. While chance plays a part in the game (via a die-roll for certain elements) choices in recruiting, and how to use town's abilities and resources play a large role.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>100 different playing cards (challenges, citizens, heroes, buildings)<br/>10 starting cards (5 citizens, 5 angry mobs)<br/>5 player aid cards<br/>a die<br/>1 kings favor token<br/>1 start marker<br/>1 score pad<br/>2 punch-out sheets of gold coin tokens<br/>rules sheet.<br/><br/>",

Only a few hours remain before human existence wanes forever.<br/><br/>The cause is still unknown, and no matter how you struggle, your life will soon come to an end. With only few hours until your departure, what are you going to do? A whirlwind of emotions rushes through you, and a glimpse of self-awareness blossoms. Will you be able to discover who you really are before The End?<br/><br/>So Long, My World is a psychologial horror card game for 1-5 players, with a unique art style and immersive, emotive theme. It is the first board game that asks the players to think about their own death and its implications through a dreamlike, procedural narrative.<br/><br/>So Long, My World is the first board game that brings philosophy to the table. In particular, it is based on existentialism, structuralism and psychoanalysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>In Solo Mode, the player must fight against the cognitive disruption that is affecting every human being, trying to unlock Vision cards (memories and thoughts of people and places you may visit before the End) and prevent them from disappearing forever. Each turn, a previously unlocked Vision may become locked again. Each scenario has a specific setup with different sets of cards, conditions, and different endings. The more endings you achieve, the more Words (archetypical signifiers of human consciousness) you will discover, unlocking new powers and scenarios.<br/><br/>In multiplayer, you choose amongst Vision cards in order to gather Feelings (in the form of tokens) and use them to discover your true self by playing Remnant cards from your hand. Remnant Cards can change a person's heart or alter the perception of time, so use them wisely to hinder, or even help your opponents.<br/><br/>Is morality universal or a mere construct?<br/>If nobody can remember of you, has life a purpose?<br/>If soul has its place inside of my body, does it means that the soul is a physical being?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the many questions the players will face.<br/><br/>",

While they may dominate 6 squads, others may swear their allegiance to the infernal magi. The cave is endless. Battles for territory will forever ensue. The forbidden wizards must raise troops from their species, create Warriors from the weak and shoddy, inspire Command and demand the allegiance of their greatest Warlord. The warrior path begins!<br/><br/>Warcults is an introduction to a Warrior Path - the first expansion for CAVE EVIL.<br/><br/>A Warrior path is a way to play Cave Evil. It is a modified Sequence of Play to accommodate players that prefer to play with just a Warlord Character or with both a Warlord and a Necromancer.<br/><br/>The Warlord is a branch of Necro command and is under the allegiance of a Necromancer. The Necromancer is NOT needed to play!<br/><br/>A Warlord commands an army and the divisions of command below them.<br/>Apart from WARCULTS features, the game introduces new actions and adjustments to the overall Sequence of Play.<br/><br/>Victory is dependent on each scenario.<br/><br/>",

The more than 2,380 counters represent every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought there, including US, German, British, French, Canadian and Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider and headquarters units are all fully represented. The four maps are an accurate representation of the region. Compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-44 1:50,000 US Army maps, they shows all roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with all the towns and villages that became bastions of the American defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn&rsquo;t be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.<br/><br/>PLAYERS may use single maps for six smaller scenarios. There is also a campaign game that utilizes all four sections and portrays three weeks  (50 game turns). In that one the Germans race for the Meuse, the last hurdle before the open country leading to Antwerp, in the face of increasing concentrations of Allied infantry, armor and air power. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.<br/><br/>THIS edition of Wacht am Rhein presents modifications to the combat, artillery and supply systems of the first edition in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare. For example, an &ldquo;exploitation mode&rdquo; has been added in order to allow mechanized units to take advantage of breakthroughs in the enemy line. Other changes include the addition of &ldquo;vantage points,&rdquo; which function as high ground, enabling units to spot more effectively for artillery, as well as &ldquo;constricted terrain,&rdquo; which represents the channeling caused by steep gullies and ravines.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>     Map: 1 mile per hex<br/>     Time: 3 Game Turns per day<br/>     Units: Infantry and Artillery units are battalions.

Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The premise here is that all of the players are Knights working together to build three new towers before King Duncan returns home to his castle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, your only building tool is a bizarre device made of satin cord, wooden balls, and what appears to be an elastic ponytail holder.  (Clearly, the material culture of the Middle Ages is full of surprises!) You use this device to pick up, move, and deposit various building blocks and the wooden figures of the Prince, the Princess, and the Ghost who top the towers.<br/><br/>Which towers you are required to build (i.e. what blocks in what order) are determined by drawing cards.  If you succeed in constructing the tower illustrated before the timer runs out, then you keep that card.  If you fail, King Duncan moves forward one space.  Collect three cards before he gets to the castle and you win.<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;PanzerArmee Afrika: Rommel in the Desert, April 1941 - November 1942&quot;, is a wargame simulation of the North African Campaign between April 1941 and November 1942.  Battalion, Regiment and Brigade-sized units represent the actual forces which took part in the fighting. Included in the game is a Variable Orders-of-Battle Chart that offers variations in forces to demonstrate how history might have been different.<br/><br/>The game spans the entire 20-month campaign, allowing players to recreate the famous battles of the period between the British-led Commonwealth forces and the Axis forces of Germany and Italy, to include Rommel's Panzer Army Africa. Set at an operational level, players must manage their military forces and precious supplies better than their opponent to achieve victory.  The Axis aims at capturing Alexandria, the key to the Suez Canal.  The British player has to prevent all this.<br/><br/>When originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #40 (Sep/Oct 1973), it was meant to be a very different treatment of a subject made familiar to wargamers in Afrika Korps (1964) by  The Avalon Hill Game Co . Different it indeed was, introducing a number of novel twists to what seemed to otherwise be a very traditional-style hex-and-counter wargame.  It became a classic in its own right alongside Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>The game is a very tense, very suspenseful contest of sweeping maneuver, lunging attacks, desperate retrogrades, filled with threat, counter-threat, surprises, and more.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 month<br/>Hex: 12 miles / 19 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory (SPI/Strategy &amp; Tactics version):<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; color mapsheet<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 10-page multi-fold rules booklet<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Avalon Hill version):<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; five color multi-hinged mounted mapboard<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&quot; counters - 60 are blank)<br/>One 8-page PanzerArmee Afrika rules booklet<br/>One side-printed errata TEC card<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Complexity: Low-Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 8-10 Hours<br/><br/>",

The city of Black Hills is right in the middle of this struggle, and a tough mayor is needed to put things in their place.<br/><br/>Black Hills is a resource management game for 2-4 players in which they need to accumulate resources to exchange them for status points. The first player to obtain five status points is appointed as the brand new mayor of Black Hills and wins.<br/><br/>The game has three different resources: wood, gold pieces and leather. In every round, each player chooses two character cards from the four cards they receive. There are 16 character cards between cowboys, settlers and indians; each character has its own ability and should be placed in one of four locations: woods, plains, city or the jail. Depending on the character and the locations, players acquire different resources or can invest their previously amassed goods in the city in exchange for status points.<br/><br/>The second deck of cards is the deck of the events. Every player can buy an event for the price of one gold piece and use it whenever they want. The events affect the regular development of the game, granting extra status points, closing locations, or forcing the rest of the players to lose some of their resources.<br/><br/>Don't want to invest your gold in event cards? Are you a more aggressive kind of player? Do you hate to manage resources? Keep calm because this is the Wild West and what would it be without some hired gunmen? In Black Hills, you can also use your money to hire a gunman to try to steal all the resources from your fellow players.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Come to the city of Black Hill and find your luck, but watch out because you could end up with nothing in your pockets or a bullet in your head!<br/><br/>",

Since then a force known as Tenebris has enveloped the seven kingdoms of Telios in darkness. After an endless age of war humanity was on the verge of destruction &mdash; but just as the last light was fading away from the land, when humanity was on the brink of ruin and all seemed lost, hope broke through.<br/><br/>Three adventurers made their way to the great valley where the ancient city of Lux used to stand. They were drawn by the very stones in the land which seem to call out to them. These stones soon became known as speaking stones as they were able to speak into the very souls of the adventurers, granting them power to push back the Tenebris. Once they arrived they found out they were not the only ones summoned by the stones.<br/><br/>The Stonebound Saga is a skirmish style card game that offers a variety of elements such as resource management, dice rolling, card positioning and tactical gameplay. The game is for 2 to 6 players played on a large grid-based playmat. Matches take 45 minutes to an hour to complete.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a group of adventurers who have made their way to the valley to train and prepare for the upcoming battle against Tenebris (Standard play is 3 characters per player). Throughout the game players will use speaking stone cards drawn from a community resource deck in order to perform various abilities in battle.<br/><br/>The Stonebound Saga is a great mix of unit positioning and strategy requiring each player to carefully plan their turns and manage their resources to achieve victory against their opponent. With a large number of character cards to fit many play styles, each match is always a unique experience.<br/><br/>",

Throughout their journey, they have the chance to invoke the ancient Maya deities, make the production flourish, build their pyramid temple and capital, and expand the borders of their territory.<br/><br/>Ahau is a homage to the breathtaking Maya culture, bringing their history closer to the players. The cultural and historical aspects of the game were closely checked by Mayanist David S.

        "description": "A war game that fits in the pocket! In Pocket Battles: Confederacy vs Union &mdash; the fourth title in the Pocket Battles series &mdash; tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army; just determine the size of the battle, then create your own army from a pool of existing troops. Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits that can affect their whole unit or army.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: Two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide at the start of the game how many points they will give to their armies, which then determines how many points you must defeat to win.<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose which faction of your army to send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just one token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round costs you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus one. (If one token is on a unit, it costs two additional tokens to activate it again; with three tokens on the unit, it costs four additional tokens, etc.)<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy your units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment costs no Order tokens. The battle ends when one army has eliminated at least half of the points in the opposing army.<br/><br/>",

Also different is the ability to play trump on a non-trump lead, even while holding the lead suit in your hand, the only constraint being that you cannot undertrump once someone else has played trump on the non-trump lead unless that is all you can play.<br/>The other feature of Jass is called the &ldquo;Weis&rdquo; which is done during the play of the first trick. It is used to announce sets of cards, i.e. a run of three in a suit or the 4 obers etc. which are worth a specified point amount. After the trick, whoever held the best Weis scores for it and any others they hold, as well as their partner being able to score any weis that they have.<br/><br/>",

It pits Manstein&rsquo;s Army Group South against the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts in three encirclement battles&mdash;Kirovograd, Korsun, and Kamenets-Podoliskiy. Both sides confront difficult strategic and tactical problems. The still potent German army holds a vulnerable position. Poor logistics hampers the maturing Red Army.<br/><br/>However, the game attempts to portray the logistical weakness of the Red Army at this time in the war, and make it a challenge for the Soviet player to keep the Germans encircled or even just on the run. The game also attempts to portray Hitler's &quot;no retreat&quot; mandate (via the victory conditions), and thus limit the German player's ability to conduct a mobile defense.<br/><br/>Contains &quot;series rules&quot; shared by every game in the series and game-specific rules unique to itself.<br/><br/>OCS games emphasize supply management and mobility as primary aspects of operational combat (i.e. at the unit scale of battalion/regiment/division) in WWII.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Six dual-side printed countersheets (4 combat, 2 markers - 1,540 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 40-page OCS version 2.0i rules booklet<br/>One 24-page Hube's Pocket specific rules booklet<br/>Two 4-sided OCS v2.0i Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 10-100 Hours<br/><br/>",

The players must prevent the Dark Legion and one of its vile leaders from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings news of monstrous foes and terrifying events as the heroes explore the modular Citadel. Promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry and abilities, while secret missions can cause chaos for the heroes!<br/><br/>The narrative-led design of Siege of the Citadel updates and balances the gameplay of the original release and adds new campaigns based on major events from the Mutant Chronicles universe and new creatures, such as the Praetorian Stalkers.<br/><br/>During each mission a different player will control the Dark Legion forces, while their fellow players attempt to fight their way through the citadel.<br/><br/>Players select one of five factions (each with a unique faction ability) with two figures representing a team. Characters have 5 wounds, but their team shares promotional points, which are now tracked in units of 10 and through rank cards as the heroes increase in experience. Teams have secret secondary missions which may be at odds with the rest of the teams in the game and doomtrooper cards can give tactical advantages or be discarded to take an extra action.<br/><br/>As players take it in turns to play the Dark Legion they get to control the vast Citadel of Alakhai on Venus, its defences and the terrifying creatures ready to do battle with humankind. Each turn they will summon reinforcements, play event cards to further challenge the doomtroopers and try to defeat their friends with the forces of the Dark Legion. If the Dark Legion player does well at the role, his doomtrooper team gains promotion points to advance their characters&rsquo; rank for when they play the next mission!<br/><br/>",

During that crucial night, amid the flashes of German anti-aircraft fire, many paratroopers were scattered a long way from their drop zones as their planes were either destroyed or unable to reach their drop points.<br/><br/>You are among those troopers. But as luck turns out, the winds have blown you directly where you are needed the most! As you were descending, you discovered a terrible sight: the Germans have installed two 24.0 cm Guns in a hidden bunker. Those cannons are set to fire at the beaches of Normandy. You alone can stop them from killing the Allied troops!<br/><br/>During your jump, you lost your equipment bag which contained all your necessary gear. The only thing you have left is your trusted Colt .45 and your ingenuity. As you fold your parachute, you look at your watch: it&rsquo;s 0700, the landings are starting. Will you have time to sabotage the German battery before they decimate your comrades? All you need are some explosives...<br/><br/>This game started out as a variant of Zombie in My Pocket, but now has become its own game, with Event cards, inside and outside tiles, scenario cards, item tiles and character cards.<br/><br/>Airborne In Your Pocket: Free Trial Version can be simple (Basic Game) or more involving (Scenarios &amp; Campaigns), as the player wishes. Advanced Game and Scenarios allow you to play as American, British, Canadian, French and even German soldiers.

That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.<br/><br/>Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side.

They will lead you toward either fortune or disaster &mdash; and thankfully no matter what course of action they take, if you don't agree with their choices, you can always start a mutiny and become the next captain yourself...<br/><br/>Each turn, the captain chooses a destination for the ship, a target that it will attack. Once the ship is attacking, the players (more or less!) co-operate to defeat their victim, then they divide the treasure amongst themselves &mdash; but your gold is never secure until you bury it on Treasure Island.<br/><br/>As you carry out the attack, unrest is always brewing in the kettle. Each time the captain makes a choice, it's possible for one of the other players to call &quot;Mutiny&quot; and try to overthrow them to become the new captain. And when the mutiny begins, you need to decide how to use your cards during the mutiny and the looming battle. How much will you co-operate when you assault an enemy, and what will you keep to yourself to prepare for when the next mutiny starts?<br/><br/>As is fitting for a pirate, your greatest desire is for gold, and you'll do anything to reach your goal. In the end, whoever collects the most gold becomes the richest pirate in Tortuga!<br/><br/>",

Players then argue their case for why they should win, and the table votes.<br/><br/>Note: Superfight went through a major reprint in late 2014. The rules and about 30% of the cards were refined to improve the game after it sold out of its original print runs. The Cards Against Humanity/Apples to Apples mechanism has been replaced by a table vote and one-one one battles, but the battle royale and villain rulesets keep the old single-judge mechanism if the table prefers it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.<br/><br/>",

This edition includes over 200 beautifully sculpted plastic miniatures and two ways to play: Classic Britannia (traditional play for 4 gamers on the standard board) and Duel Britannia (faster play for 2 gamers on a new board).<br/><br/>Britannia allows players to recreate the turbulent history of Britain from the coming of the Romans (AD 43) to conquest by the Normans (AD 1085). Each player controls several tribes and leaders including the Angles, Saxons, Irish, Norsemen, Danes, Boudicca, King Arthur, Offa, and many other recognisable names from British history. The power of each tribe will rise and fall as the game progresses through the centuries, so players must work out when to expand and when to consolidate each.<br/><br/>Classic Britannia plays in the way all Britannia fans know and love, benefiting from Lew Pulsipher&rsquo;s continued development and player feedback. Duel Britannia is a new, fast-playing adaptation for two players, on a new board including Ireland.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SCOPE is a 2 to 4 player game, set in the Battle of Stalingrad, where players take on the role of sniper teams on both sides. The objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy snipers or enemy troops for a total value of points depending on the scenario being played.<br/><br/>A fast and immersive game of 5-15 minutes per match, with various levels of difficulty and rules that are explained in two minutes on the clock. When you try it, you won&rsquo;t be able to stop playing it.<br/><br/>SCOPE is a game of strategy, cunning, and bluffing that will make you feel like a real sniper, searching and selecting your targets, shooting wisely and changing position so as not to be discovered and eliminated.<br/><br/><br/>RULES:GAME SET UP: each player places their Area Cards face down, in a rectangular matrix that forms their Front. You can arrange the cards anywhere. The number and type of cards depends on the chosen Scenario. A player can look at their cards whenever they want during the course of the game.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: The player who first eliminates all the Snipers of the rival team or who first reaches the Objective Points of the chosen Scenario wins.<br/><br/><br/>BASIC GAME:Two players alternate turns during the game. In a turn, each player must perform only one of the following two actions:<br/><br/>MOVE: the player takes the 4 cards of any Quadrant (group of 2&times;2 Area Cards) from their Front, and rearrange them as they wish in the same Quadrant.<br/><br/>SEARCH: The player reveals an enemy Area Card. If the card contains a Sniper or Unit, the player can Shoot and eliminate it.<br/><br/>If you decide to Shoot, remove the Area Card and place it in your scoring zone. Then, place your Shot Card in the center of a Quadrant of your Front where there is at least one Sniper. The removed card is replaced by an Empty Area card of the same Front. If the revealed card is a Decoy the player is obliged to Shoot without removing the Decoy from the Front.<br/><br/>The Shot Card represents the loud noise of the shot. It is placed on the Quadrant from where the Sniper has Shot. It remains in that position until the start of their next turn.<br/><br/><br/>ADVANCED MODE:Advanced Mode adds rules to the Basic Game, making it a more complete and challenging game experience. In this game mode, Unit Cards provide more actions to choose from in turn, so that the player has more options depending on the allied units present in the Front. Similar to the Basic Game, players can only use only one action per turn.<br/><br/>SNIPER: provides the SEARCH (and Shoot) action of the Basic Game.<br/><br/>OFFICER: reveal an allied Officer position to gain an extra MOVE action.<br/><br/>SCOUT: reveal two adjacent cards without being able to Shoot.<br/><br/>MORTAR: reveal an allied Mortar position to attack and eliminate any card (also a Decoy).<br/><br/>MACHINE GUN: can Shoot at adjacent cards and stop Infantry assaults.<br/><br/>INFANTRY: can invade the enemy Front and return as reinforcements after being eliminated.<br/><br/><br/>3-4 PLAYERS GAME:In 4 Player Games each side is divided into Snipers and Units. So that each player controls one of this Divisions. It is played by teams. The round is divided into 4 turns, in which the corresponding player can only use an action from the cards of their Division.<br/><br/>In 3 Player Games a player leads the two Divisions on the same side.<br/><br/>",

The copilot must now take the lead, but other crewmembers distrust him. The crew believes there are infiltrators amongst them. But who? A skirmish occurs. Will all infiltrators get exposed?<br/><br/>Each crewmember either belongs to the honest crew, or is among the few infiltrators who know one another. At the start you receive 3 identity cards, 2 or 1 honest and 1 or 2 infiltrator. The card you have double, determines your identity. You place these secret cards, mixed, face down in front of you. Then each player looks at 1 card per neighbor. By placing a knowledge tile at a card, you show (or perhaps lie about) what you see. You'll never see more than 1 of another player's 3 cards. So you must combine your own knowledge with the claims of others! But who can you trust?? In order to keep from being unmasked, the infiltrators will naturally act as if they're trying to deduce who might betray the crew.<br/><br/>During skirmishes, some crewmembers will receive first the &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot;, then they can graduate to a status of &quot;Reliable&quot;, and then one of these two reliable crewmembers will become the new Captain. This Captain must start to form a final crew that excludes the infiltrators from access to the cockpit.<br/><br/>With each skirmish, a player sees one identity card held by another player and shares this knowledge (but possibly lies). So each player knows cards self and must value the claims of others. With all players knowing different things, the deductive logic gets deeper and deeper as you theorize about who is who, while also holding possible lies in mind! Will you make it back to the ground safely?<br/><br/>",

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!<br/><br/>Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.<br/><br/>You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.<br/><br/>If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.<br/><br/>In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.<br/><br/>At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.<br/><br/>As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Le Bois des Couadsous, you have a forest to cross to find lots of hazelnuts, and the first player to find five nuts wins the game.<br/><br/>On the table, you have a grid of 3x3 forest cards. The backs of each card are identical, and on the front they feature one of three images &mdash; mushroom, leaf or stone &mdash; in one of three colors: yellow, red or blue. In the twelve spaces adjacent to this grid are placed cards showing 1-3 hazelnuts.<br/><br/>A player starts: he puts his squirrel card before a row/column of his choice and cross it by announcing out loud what he thinks on the back of the forest card. It begins with the first card, the player announces for example &quot;leaf&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; (according if the elements or colors are in play) then turns the card over and compares the guess to the actual picture. Initially, we discover, that the cards are random. If the guess it correct, the player continues the path to the hazelnuts that await us on the other side. If it is wrong, it stops there, and the next player start.<br/><br/>If the next player starts on the same row/column, he already knows what there is on the front of this card, unless he remembers more since it was the visible item at the beginning...!<br/><br/>Players play with colors or the elements: initially it is them who choose. But as soon as a player has reaches a nut, everyone changes: those who played on the elements switches to colors and vice versa. One must therefore be remember everything and well remember what others reveal!<br/><br/>",

Each day, they work to claim the best stalls across the market and attract customers to sample their wares or be enthralled by their amazing spectacles.<br/><br/>It is going to be an extra busy day so the families fight even harder to claim the their needed space. The ancient families of snake charmers, water sellers, rug merchants, magicians, and food sellers work hard vying for the best stalls.<br/><br/>In Morocco, players will send their workers out to try and claim stalls at the market. When enough  workers from the same family have made it to a stall, that family claims it and clears out any adjacent juice sellers.<br/><br/>Morocco is played over two separate phases: scout the market and assign workers. In the first phase, players use the nearby roof to scout the market and determine where the busiest stalls will be. In the second phase, players use the gained information to send workers out into the market.<br/><br/>",

The map contains the Golan Heights and the surrounding area. The major combatants are; Israel, Syria and Jordan with possible intervention by US or Soviet Union forces.<br/><br/>Catalogue Description.<br/>The Middle East Is home to some of the largest, most heavily-armed, and politically influential military forces on the planet- and is also a seething mass of national, religious and ethnic animosities, where conflict Is always likely, and likely to command international attention (and involvement). This simulation lets you explore the most likely of these hypothetical conflicts, a fifth Arab-Israeli war, on Israel's northern and eastern borders. Parameters of the conflict are determined by the Scenario Generation System in a random, yet logical, fashion; a scenario will thus rarely start under the same conditions as one already played. Two conventional, set-piece Campaign scenarios are also provided, while five Battle scenarios act as an introduction to the game system. FLASHPOINT: GOLAN accurately depicts the intense, rapid pace of modern air-land warfare with a highly interactive sequence of play wherein each enemy move or action can be detected and immediately reacted to. A medium-complexity game with moderate solitaire suitability, this game features 780 counters representing regiments, brigades and battalion size units; two 22x32&quot; full-color mapsheets; rules and playing aids.<br/><br/>",

The active player must guess a number that is close to - but not higher - than the correct answer. Players take turns either making a guess that is higher than the previous player, or calling out a DARE if they believe the previous player guessed too high. When a Dare is called the answer is checked and the player who was wrong must keep the card for &quot;Silly goose points&quot;. Once a player has collected a certain number of cards, the game ends, and the player with the most silly goose points loses. Everyone else wins. <br/> Nearly no table space is required, and the game therefore works well as a party game in nearly any setting.<br/><br/>&quot;How Dare you?&quot; comes with 2 optional advanced rules that spice up the gameplay:<br/><br/>&quot;Doubling&quot;: If you guess a number that is at least twice that of the previous player, you gain a doubling card. This card negates one &quot;silly goose point&quot;. This variant tempts players to make higher guesses.<br/><br/>&quot;Double Dare&quot;: If you are dared, you can either accept the dare and check the answer like normal, or you can reply with a &quot;Double Dare&quot;. The player who is wrong will now get double punishment (two cards instead of one). But the player who initiated the dare, now has the option to chicken out and withdraw their dare. If they do, they must instead guess a higher number before the round continues as normal.<br/><br/>",

The number of offensive plays and defensive plays varies with each edition and one special teams card are included. Each player secretly chooses his play. The defensive play (which has clear &quot;windows&quot; on it)is played on top of the offensive play to reveal five possible outcomes of the play. To find the result you roll two six sided dice and add them together. The dice roll determines which &quot;window&quot; the players look at and this is the result of the play.

        "description": "Hornet is an area control game with simultaneous action selection and a dual-layered resource system. The game board is a modular board built of hex tiles representing a landscape with fields of flowers and hornet nests of various sizes. The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.<br/><br/>Box back text:<br/>Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit. Each player controls a pair of hornets swiftly flying about in flower fields collecting nectar and producing as much honey as they possibly can. The buzziest honey maker will win the game!<br/><br/>",

For the players in charge of the Hungarian defense, there is no time left for organizing and sedition. This is a hopeless war of survival, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Combining card and action management mechanisms of modern euro games with the theme and feel of a classic block wargame, players can experience the rush of a true no-win scenario, and see how long they can keep the flame of the revolution going under the pressure of the unstoppable march of the Soviet military machine.<br/><br/>The game can be played by up to two revolutionary players against either a live or an automated opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is pure, impulse-driven, tanks vs. tank, squad vs. squad, leader vs. leader, RPD vs. M60, Lock &lsquo;n Load system gaming.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll command a bucket of 1985-era weaponry on a Marc von Martial-drawn, mounted 22&quot; x 34&quot; historical map of Eisenbach and its immediate surroundings, including Bergengipfel and Klappebruck. Defend West Germany with Abrams tanks, ITOW anti-tank vehicles, Cobra attack helicopters, squads of American soldiers, leaders, snipers, heroes, M60 machine guns, Dragon guided missiles, A-10 attack aircraft, and much more. All rendered with the precision we have all come to expect from David Julien.<br/><br/>Or, if you chose, attack the capitalists with T-80, T-72, T-64, and T-55 tanks (okay, you won&rsquo;t get far with the T-55s, but we had to include them), Hind helicopters, Soviet infantry, paratroopers, BMPs, and all their accoutrements of war - RPGs, RPKs, RPDs, you are free to do so.<br/><br/>Included are rules for anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), which are easily depleted, advanced armor, advanced sights (thermal and night), fixed wing air support, and much more. Yet, despite the new rules, we believe we have held true to our company&rsquo;s mantra of &quot;more game, less guff.&quot;<br/><br/>Fight nine Mark H. Walker-designed scenarios that recount the first day of the war, from the first probes by Soviet infantry to the ultimate, desperate clash for the Eisenbach Bridge. This is the game for those of you who have wanted to get down on the streets, in the buildings, on the deck of the tanks, and fight the battles of Red Army, Red Storm Rising, Team Yankee, or even World at War: Eisenbach Gap.<br/><br/><br/>     A 34&quot; x 22&quot; mounted game map, depicting the city of Eisenbach, the Eisenbach River, and the nearby towns of Klappebruck and Bergengipfel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Three sheets of counters, including over 100 vehicles...the most vehicles ever crammed into a Lock 'n Load game box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Complete LnL rules, module rules, player aid cards, and nine scenario cards.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Dice...always the dice. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     An awesome box that keeps the inside in.

Through her cunning, and with the help of four magic objects, she attempts to escape her fate.<br/><br/>The Maiden in the Forest is an 18-card solitaire game using only cards. The rules are contained within the 18 cards. The object of the game is to rotate, then turn over, each of the twelve tree cards from their blooming to dormant side. If you can do this before the end of the twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win your freedom.<br/><br/>To begin, shuffle the twelve tree cards and place them in a ring like a clock face. All cards should have their blooming side revealed and the trunks should point towards the center of the ring. Each card also shows one of four objects. Place the maiden card inside the ring at the 12 o'clock position. Set the four object cards to one side. Each day, you perform two actions:<br/><br/>1. Shuffle the four object cards and place them face down in a pile. Draw the top card and view the object shown therein. All tree cards with this object may not be touched by the player during this cycle of day and night.<br/><br/>2. Take the remaining three object cards and use their actions to move, that is, to swap the positions of the tree cards allowed to be touched, keeping their current orientations. You may use these actions in any order and may use none, one, two, or all three of the actions as you choose to.<br/><br/>Each night, you perform two actions:<br/><br/>1. You may now rotate blossoming tree cards with matching colors or matching objects that you are allowed to touch this night. Cards are rotated so that their trunks point outward from the ring. Cards previously rotated can then be turned over so that their dormant side is showing. Cards must be rotated (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) or turned over to their dormant side in accordance with the three patterns on the other side of this card. You may use each of the patterns only once during this night, but you may use them in any order you choose.<br/><br/>2. Move the maiden card one position in the ring clockwise to signal the end of this day and night and the beginning of a new turn.<br/><br/>If you turn each of the twelve tree cards to their dormant side before the end of twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win.<br/><br/>",

Players will be confronted by numerous stormtroopers and Darth Vader himself. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi will come to the rescue.<br/><br/>Звёздные войны: Тайное вторжение, a Star Wars-themed version of Love Letter, is a quick game of luck, determination and deduction. Play character cards, watch out for opponents' actions...and may the Force be with you!<br/><br/>The game is played with only 17 cards. At the beginning of the game, one card is removed at random, then each player draws a card. The game is played in several rounds. Each round represents a stage in the escape plan. At the end of each round, one of the players will get closer to the plan's realization and receive a special token. As soon as someone's got enough tokens, that player will rescue Leia and take her to the Rebel Base.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player draws a card, then plays one of the two cards in hand. Each character card &mdash; Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Han Solo, Stormtrooper and Boba Fett &mdash; has a special ability. In this version of Love Letter, Boba Fett functions the same as a Stormtrooper, with each having the Guard ability of naming a player's role and eliminating them from the round, but with Boba Fett if you miss on the first shot, you can try again. Miss a second time, though, and you're out of the round yourself!<br/><br/>The other difference to regular Love Letter is that the Baron ability is split between the two droids, but with R2-D2, the highest value is out of the round.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima, revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality called &quot;sakura&quot;.<br/><br/>The players in Sakura aim to play cards without taking any hands. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules, which by default require higher number on the Jin side and lower on the Jang side in the same color. (Alternatively, a player can place the same number in any color.) Also, the players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (money). The game ends when everyone has only two cards left in their hand. The player who earns the fewest points wins the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs until next spring.<br/><br/><br/>This edition was later replaced with Sakura Extra Box, which contains previous Kickstarter extras (not exclusive).<br/><br/>",

Purpose of the game is that one is the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, who calls out the three sentences (one by one), notes down his &quot;WALTERS&quot; (his propositions numbered from 1 to 3) and the other players do the same trying to find propositions which do suit the &quot;Sphinx&quot;'s personality. After this round the &quot;Sphinx&quot; takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, the &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;s. Players do get points for every &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;, they noted and the &quot;Sphinx&quot; too gets points every time someone &quot;bets&quot; on his propositions, so the &quot;Sphinx&quot; has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully &quot;faked&quot; the &quot;Sphinx&quot;. So as said before, the players should known each other (despite the possibility to give &quot;strangers&quot;, some points of advance) and you need a lot of pieces of paper.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers is Richard Berg's newest strategic level game, this one focused on one of, if not THE, central events in the Middle Ages - The Crusades. It will allow gamers to replay not only the first three Crusades - the only 3 that focused on what we call The Middle East - but with scenarios that range from a 7-player version of the 1st Crusade to a 3rd Crusade scenario that supposes Frederick Barbarossa didn't drown in Turkey and his immense army reached the Kingdom of Jerusalem pretty much intact.<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers uses numerous innovative mechanics, including: <br/><br/>    an Activation system that allows players to choose which leaders/armies they want to use most in a given turn, but not know when they will be available for such use.<br/>    a Movement system with no Movement Allowances or Costs, but a heavy emphasis on Attrition and the ability of commanders to &quot;keep going&quot;. Shop 'til ya Drop . . . <br/>    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.<br/>    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want<br/>    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.<br/>    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.<br/><br/><br/>COUNTERS: 876 full color counters<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map<br/>CARDS: 110 Cards<br/>OTHER:<br/><br/>     Two six-sided dice<br/>     First Crusade Rule book<br/>     Second and Third Crusade Rule book<br/>     Playbook<br/>     4 Player Aid cards <br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER Richard Berg<br/>DEVELOPER Neil Randall<br/>ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

You will visit auction houses, do business with shady dealers, or search for unlikely artifacts in the shops of Piccadilly. Who will be able to exhibit the most impressive collection of wonders?<br/><br/>In this game, your objective is to set up the best Chamber of Wonders by collecting Wonder Cards by sending your Agents in London's various areas (using money, bids, etc.) and placing them into your Display Cabinet. Each player, with his actions, scores Fame points.<br/><br/>Chamber of Wonders is a special boardgame in the fact that the dynamic setup defines the set of rules that will be used in each game. Completely different game mechanics are added or removed to the game, either by using defined setups or by completely randomizing the game board - your choice. With more than 150 combinations of areas and contacts, each game feels different from the previous.<br/><br/>",

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!<br/><br/>Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In Adventure Games: Im Nebelreich, you represent heroes who have returned from a short trip on behalf of an old seer to find their village deserted. Where did everyone go? Over three chapters, each of which takes about two hours to play, you will meet mysterious people, discover new places, and experience an exciting adventure. During your investigations, you also learn more about the individual heroes of this co-operative parlor game. How will the fantastic story end? That's up to you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1979, and the U.S. government has just deregulated the airline industry, opening it to competition in terms of fares, routes, and the airline companies themselves. You represent a new airline that's trying to set up business in the U.S., but you have an entire country open to you, so where will you set up shop and how can you profit more than the other newcomers to ensure that you survive?<br/><br/>In Blue Skies, the game board presents players with thirty airports in thirty cities. Each airport has four gates, with you using 2-4 gates depending on the number of players. To set up, draw airport demand cards from the deck to seed airports with passengers. Whenever you place passengers on the board, draw from a bag that initially contains 100 red cubes and 25 green cubes; for each airport, continue drawing until you draw a red cube, then redistribute passengers at the open gates of that airport as evenly as possible.<br/><br/>(Note that at most the first five airports drawn will have an open gate, and even those will start with only one open gate run by a local airline. All of the other passengers are just bunched up at the gate waiting for you to serve them!)<br/><br/>Each player starts with three demand cards in hand, and they take turns choosing two gates with a purchase price of at most 6. Players adjust their income from 0, with their income being set to equal the number of passengers now waiting at their gates, then the game begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player in turn buys new gates at airports of their choice, spending at most 6 points and adding any unspent points to their score. You can buy out a local airline, set up gates in new cities, or purchase multiple gates in the same airport to try to dominate that area.<br/><br/>Each player in turn then plays a demand card from their hand, drawing passengers form the bag to place one or more passengers at that location. Then demand cards equal to the number of players are drawn, and more passengers are ahead to those airports. The game board lists the number of cards for each airport, so you somewhat know the odds of where passengers might arrive.<br/><br/>Players adjust their income to account for the opening of new gates, the redistribution of existing passengers, and the arrival of new passengers, then they add their income to their score. If a player now has at least 100 points or has placed their twentieth and final gate, the game ends immediately; otherwise, you add a local airline gate to each airport with passengers but no open gates, pass the first player marker, then start a new round.<br/><br/>At game's end, score the seven regions of the United States based on the player's dominance of those regions. Each airport has a scoring value, e.g., ORD is worth 4, and each gate you have in Chicago is worth 4 for determining dominance in both the Midwest region and the Central region. (ORD is one of four airports in two regions, with the others being JFK, LAX, and DFW.) If you have the most dominance in the Central region, you score 13 points, whereas second place is worth only 6 points. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The presidential election of 1860 was one of the most critical in the history of the United States. With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.<br/><br/>Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!<br/><br/>This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.<br/><br/>",

Everyone wants to reach the top, and no one wants to end up at the bottom &mdash; or even beneath the soil. Amongst these aspiring Pumafiosi, it is wise to keep your head out of the firing line. Stand out too much, and you'll soon find yourself in prison, if not murdered by the rival families.<br/><br/>Pumafiosi is a refreshingly unique blend of simple trick-taking and precarious press-your-luck. Each trick, the person who plays the second-highest card wins the round, and they decide where to place that winning card in the hierarchy. You can even choose to place your measly card at the top of the hierarchy to stake your claim on the big boss points. The catch is that these cards can be knocked down one or more steps on the hierarchy by higher-valued cards, and whoever owns a falling card is penalized!<br/><br/>Pumafiosi differs from the older title Rooster Booster thanks to designer Reiner Knizia:<br/><br/><br/>    Increasing the strategy by narrowing the deck to a range of 1-55<br/>    Crafting a satisfying two-player experience<br/>    Raising the stakes by tweaking the hierarchy values and penalties<br/>    Tailoring a theme that gives context to the rules<br/>    Enhancing the drama by including physical penalty points<br/>    Layering decisions with further depth and tension via one-time-use items<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The heroes we&rsquo;re talking about are close to immortal &ndash; whatever happened they always found a way out, never actually meeting enemies powerful enough to defeat them.

However, bear in mind that your opponents are equally ready to steal, manipulate, or do anything that is necessary to defeat you. If you don&rsquo;t act quickly and decisively, instead of finding the treasure, your expedition will get into real trouble. So, forget about scruples and compromises. Be smarter, quicker, and meaner that your rivals.<br/><br/>Venturesome is the spiritual successor of the legendary Palastgefl&uuml;ster. With the updated game mechanics and victory conditions, you can expect hours of gaming full of negative interaction.

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Crown of Roses is a 3-hour block game set during the turbulent years of the Wars of the Roses in 15th Century England. This 35-year long conflict saw the extinction of a large number of noble houses, and would eventually set the house of Tudor upon the throne.<br/><br/>In Crown of Roses, players take on the roles of the dynastic giants - the House of Lancaster and their Beaufort cousins, and the House of York. The four player game adds in the powerful House of Stafford, and the ever-scheming Richard Neville and his son, Richard of Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'.<br/><br/>Using intuitive mechanics, Crown of Roses offers players a historical feeling with tremendous strategic depth and excellent replayability. Unit starting locations vary with each turn and even with each game, and the use of blocks creates the &quot;fog of war&quot; of limited intelligence on enemy strength and deployment. Random game events throw a touch of the chaos of the era into the mix, and the multiple uses for the player action cards leads to a level of uncertainty where enemy plans are concerned.<br/><br/>During each game turn in Crown of Roses, players will play cards to perform actions such as improving their armies, influencing the locals to support them, collecting supplies or prestige, moving to attack enemy forces, to recruit new houses to your cause, calling another Royal Heir into the fray, or even changing the nature of the conflict through the use of player events.<br/><br/>Unit blocks rotate to show strength, and each army can have a variety of experience levels and combat capabilities. A novel roll to hit-based system is used to determine combat results, with better experienced forces scoring hits more often in battle. Kill all of the enemy heirs, and you can rule England unimpeded!<br/><br/>In Parliament, players can try to gain a favorable posting or take control of the crown itself by gathering enough noble support. Gather enough votes for enough years and the nobles of parliament will welcome you as their sovereign!<br/><br/>And if you can create enough influence with the local gentry, your economic might will sway the common folk to support you as their chosen monarch!<br/><br/>And the four player game of Crown of Roses allows all of this and more without the sacrifice of the unique fog of war aspect that the unit blocks provide. With each player having up to three ways to win, who knows who will be the next King of England!&quot;<br/><br/>TIME SCALE Variable<br/><br/>MAP SCALE Area Movement<br/><br/>UNIT SCALE Noble houses and mercenary factions<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS  Two to Four<br/><br/>DEVELOPERS: Andy Young and Kevin Bernatz<br/>ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGING: Rodger B.

        "description": "Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.<br/><br/>Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.<br/><br/>Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary <br/>    1 hard-backed map <br/>    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers <br/>    170 5/8 inch square counters <br/>    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse <br/>    4 nation force arrival charts <br/>    1 master nation force arrival chart<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "18Mag (Magyarorsz&aacute;g meaning Hungary) is an 18xx game that tells the story of Hungarian railroads and their supporting companies.<br/><br/>Depending on the player number, 13 different railway companies are drafted equally between the players. These railways operate in numerical order, build track on the map, erect stations, run their trains and always pay out their earnings 50:50 &ndash; half to their owners and half into their own treasury.<br/><br/>Beside those operating railroads, seven other companies offering various services for the railroads are included in the game. Examples of these services are building an extra tile, allowance to run freely over small stations, reduce costs when building bridges and tunnels, and most importantly, offer new trains. Whenever a railroad uses the services of one or more of these companies, they pay their fee into their treasury. In stock rounds, players acquire shares of those companies and after operation rounds, they distribute their earnings among the share holders. These companies also have station markers (or in this case: factories) which can be placed on city tiles (instead of railway stations) by the president of the company, thus denying other companies passage through that city.<br/><br/>Contrary to other 18xx games, all trains are available from the beginning. Because of the pricing, they usually come in the accustomed order, but not necessarily! However, trains do not rust  or go obsolete, but they may be scrapped voluntarily to make space for bigger trains. When at least one of each type of train has been sold, one more set of operation rounds is played and then the game ends. As usual in 18xx games, the wealthiest player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You do so by illuminating manuscripts with elaborate religious artwork. But not all is as peaceful as it once was! Possessed with eccentric enthusiasm, one of you has turned from the reverent to the irreverent by scrawling demons instead of angels and by painting fierce dragons instead of noble knights. Who will become the new master of the Scriptorium? Will it be the monk who reverently illuminates the page with monks, dogs, knights and angels; or the irreverent monk who whimsically draws the forces of rabbit, squirrel, dragon and demon? Play Illumination to find out!<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/><br/>Each turn, players create illuminations in three Books by placing one full row or column of tiles of their choice from their Player mat. With careful placement, players collect Coins that  allow  them  to perform special actions or  purchase Scriptorium cards. By placing tiles next to others of matching color, players collect Ritual tokens to score points at the Ritual stations in the Monastery when they are occupied by the Abbot.<br/><br/>As tiles are placed in Books, conflicts are set in motion:  Angels wrestle with Demons, Knights skirmish with Dragons,  Monks contend with Rabbits, and Dogs struggle with Squirrels. These conflicts are resolved only when they are bounded on all sides. Then, the player with more tiles on their side wins the <br/>Bounded Battle, flips the losing side&rsquo;s tiles facedown, and places their Marker on the matching Battle card.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players score points for the Rituals  recorded on the Monastery mat and 1 point for each of their faceup Illumination tiles in each Book. Players also score points for placing more Markers on Battle cards and for defeated factions that match their Crusade card. The player with more points wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The deck contains cards in six suits, each numbered 1-9, and each player starts with a hand of nine cards.<br/><br/>The lead player for the hand lays a single card on the table. The next player either passes (but can play on a future turn) or plays the same number of cards (or one more than that number) with a higher value. When you play two or more cards, the cards must be the same number or color, and the value of these cards is created by placing their digits in order from high to low. For example, if you play a blue 3 and blue 6, their value is 63, not 36. When you play and are not the lead, you must take one of the cards from the previous play into your hand, then discard the rest.<br/><br/>Play continues around the table until either a player is out of cards, which ends the round immediately, or all players have passed in succession. In the latter case, discard the cards last played; whoever played these cards lays a single card to start a new round. Alternatively, if the lead player has cards in hand of a single suit or number, they play all of these cards at once to end the hand. When a hand ends, each player scores 1 point for each card they still hold.<br/><br/>If no player has at least 15 points, shuffle the deck and start a new hand. If someone does have 15 or more points, whoever has the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WAR OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE<br/><br/>In this wargame for 2 players, ages 14 and up, recreate the war that pitted tiny Paraguay against the Brazilian Empire, Argentina, and Uruguay.<br/><br/>When Brazil invaded Uruguay in 1864, no one could have foreseen that this act would spark the largest conflict in the history of South America. Paraguay entered the war in defense of Uruguay while Argentina allied with Brazil. Uruguay itself, once conquered, switched sides and declared war on Paraguay. Thus was born the Triple Alliance. Despite having a small population, little territory, and few resources, the Paraguayans fought with unexpected tenacity.<br/><br/>First, they embarked on daring offensives, then they were forced to fight massive defensive battles, taking an unsustainable number of losses. After seven years of arduous fighting, the Paraguayan army participated in its last battle at Cerro Cor&aacute;, the only town left to be conquered by the Alliance. At the last stage of that desperate battle, Paraguayan President Solano L&oacute;pez committed suicide while cornered by Brazilian soldiers. Material and human losses were astronomical on both sides. It is said that more than 90% of the male population in Paraguay died during that colossal war. Even the victorious countries were brought to the brink of exhaustion &ndash; to such an extent that Brazil is, to this day, still in debt.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this war has never been represented in a game of its own. It is high time to bring this conflict to the forefront of the wargaming scene, not only so that fans of the genre can have the chance to recreate this conflict and explore different strategies, but also so that the general public can become more informed about such an important historical event in a simple way. For this reason, War of the Triple Alliance prides itself on two basic principles: historical depth and simple rules.<br/><br/>The War of the Triple Alliance confronts the players with the dilemmas faced by the generals of the opposing sides. Paraguay starts with a strong army that can advance into Argentine and Brazilian territory, but does not have enough replacements to sustain a war of attrition. The allies (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) must contain the Paraguayan onslaught and gain time by giving as little ground as possible, because as time goes by their armies will be more and more numerous, and they will be able to present battle.<br/><br/>There is a moment when the strategy for both sides change completely: when the allied player accumulates enough troops to outnumber the Paraguayans, he begins a race to conquer Asunci&oacute;n and other important cities before the end of the game, while the Paraguayan player will try to slow down his advance or perhaps even stop it by relying on the fortifications that protect the ascent up the river.<br/><br/>The game incorporates cards to make room for events that, while not strictly military, influenced the course of the war. Players must decide whether to gain immediate benefits in the form of new combat units, or whether to plan their strategy for the long term and prefer to put victory point cards into play or to modify the duration of the game. This increases the variability and excitement of the game, as well as enriching it by adding historical depth. Players have a more detailed explanation of card events in the rulebook.<br/><br/>The winner of the game will be the one who economizes his forces better, uses his cards better and has been able to manage the timing of the game more wisely.<br/><br/>The War of the Triple Alliance is a perfect game to enter the world of wargames. The rules are simple and intuitive, specifically designed to avoid tedious intermissions and the battles are resolved in a patterned way so that in each round the players are clear about their options. However, this apparent simplicity does not prevent players from having to make decisions on the edge, and experienced players will find the game very challenging: will the Paraguayan player launch himself southwards, trying to reach the strategic cities of Brazil or Argentina, or will he prefer to send his armies to Mato Grosso in the north, with the aim of completely eliminating a front and getting a good handful of cards that will shorten the game in his favor? Likewise, the Allied player has many decisions to make: Will he have enough temperance to avoid entering a decisive battle before accumulating enough troops? Will he advance along the most direct path to Asunci&oacute;n, storming the fearsome fortifications on the Paraguay River, or will he prefer to bypass them and begin a long campaign of conquest?<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>&bull;    1 double sided (English/ Spanish) 25.6&rdquo; x 19.6&rdquo; game board (mounted)<br/>&bull;    54 cards<br/>&bull;    2 starting cards<br/>&bull;    73 Paraguayan unit counters (including leaders)<br/>&bull;    89 Allied unit counters (including leaders)<br/>&bull;    4 Capital markers<br/>&bull;    3 fortress markers<br/>&bull;    4 victory point markers<br/>&bull;    54 control markers<br/>&bull;    3 red dice, 2 green dice, 2 blue dice<br/>&bull;    1 Battlefield Display<br/>&bull;    1 Rulebook English<br/>&bull;    1 Rulebook Spanish<br/>&bull;    1 Playbook English<br/>&bull;    1 Playbook Spanish<br/><br/>MAIN CHARACTERISTICS<br/><br/>&bull;    It only takes 2 hours to recreate this massive conflict.<br/>&bull;    Simple rules make the game&rsquo;s concepts easy to grasp for all types of players.<br/>&bull;    The game&rsquo;s card selection system forces each player to make interesting choices.<br/>&bull;    Quick and intense games with special attention paid to the details of the map and illustrations of the armies.<br/>&bull;    Historical accuracy.

Have they focused on resources and mined stone or gold, collected wood, created new vikings, or built up the food supplies? Sometimes they have spent their time preparing actions for you by capturing a wandering Berserker or preparing for a raid (one of their favourite endeavours). Or maybe they have gained a favour from one of the Norse gods or goddesses?<br/><br/>Each turn you may use one action (for example go on a raid or use a favour from a God or Goddess) and buy one item from a central Market. You buy items using resources in your hand, and you can choose between ships for your Navy, buildings for your Clan and valuables for your Loot. Each item gives 1-3 Victory Points, and the first player to have an agreed number of Victory Points in each category wins the game.<br/><br/>There are also four rare Abilities that sometimes turn up in the Market.

The goal is to be the first to &quot;travel&quot; to the country in the center of the table - but first each player must travel through their own country. Each country has three travel-related items required to travel there. Players need to gather these three items, and hold on to their passport, in order to travel - your hand is like your bag, and you've got to pack it right for your destination.<br/><br/>To get the items they need, players can choose to draw from the deck, &quot;recycle&quot; out of the discard pile, trade, or steal from each other.<br/><br/>The game also includes five &quot;extensions&quot; which players can choose to add to the deck to increase the depth and complexity of the game: Events which affect all players immediately, Special Items which allow special actions, Forbidden Items which prevent travel and are tricky to get rid of, Postcards which provide an alternate win scenario, and Characters which give each player a unique ability.<br/><br/>",

But other players can challenge and stop an agent from moving if they have paid more than you &mdash; and for the right price they can even assassinate another agent.<br/><br/>In addition to a slick new look, this restored edition offers two new twists on the original gameplay. First, each agent has a unique ability that lets them move an agent or the briefcase for free. Second, an alternate win condition eliminates stalling and potential stalemates. If no one wins within a certain number of turns, Dr. Solomon can end the game immediately, and whoever has paid off the most to him wins the game. However, if you pay off too much to Dr. Solomon early in the game, that can leave you with little control over the other agents, forcing you to strike a tricky balance between immediate and long-term goals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The fight takes place on an 18-space linear track, and it's all about striking from the right distance and getting to the right range. This edition contains 20 characters, each with their own special abilities, allowing for hundreds of different matchups.<br/><br/>There are seven different modes of play:<br/><br/>     Simple mode, for first time players<br/>     Full mode, using the character abilities<br/>     Custom Clockwork: build your own character!<br/>     2v2 team battle<br/>     Solo play, with 10 achievements to earn<br/>     Raid on Deathstrike Dragon: 2, 3, or 4 players cooperate against a powerful 5th player controlling the Dragon<br/>     Betrayal at Raid on Deathstrike Dragon: A more difficult raid where one player is secretly on the Dragon's side!<br/><br/><br/>Changes to the Revised Second Edition:<br/><br/>--All game modes now use a 40 card deck, rather than different modes using 25, 40, and 50, and the game will come with 40 numbered cards rather than 50. In all modes other than the Dragon Raid, you start each round by shuffling the deck and setting aside 5 cards without looking at them. In 2v2, you reshuffle the discard pile twice when it runs out before reaching timout. In the Dragon Raid, you reshuffle it 1, 2, and 3 times for 2, 3, and 4 mortals, respectively. Overall, rounds last longer in all modes.<br/><br/>--Last-hits is no longer a mechanic in the game. At timeout, you just check who advanced farthest. This is simpler and turns out to have better dynamics by forcing action to take place during the actual gameplay part of the game.<br/><br/>--Whenever a round ends in a tie, now both sides get a win token.<br/><br/>--A new rulebook makes the game less mathy and more about improv and bluffing. Players don't know the exact contents of the deck anymore, so they can't compute things so completely. Also, players now draw more cards each round, so they have more chance to win before timeout.<br/><br/>Part of the Fantasy Strike universe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a very novel take on the old parlor game, Parcheesi or Sorry or even Trouble, that many people remember. Players are trying to get their pawns from their starting position around the board into the safe zone. If a pawn is either landed on or passed over by another player's pawn, the jumped pawn is returned to its starting location. However, players don't simply roll the dice and move in Zap Zerapp. Instead, two dice are rolled and results are announced to the table. Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New version of Skyjo which adds Action Cards and Joker Cards.<br/><br/>In Skyjo, each player 12 cards in a 3x4 pattern, two of them face up, all others hidden. On your turn you can take the top card from the discard or draw pile. You can exchange one card (hidden or open) from your display with it or discard the drawn card to turn one card face up. The round ends when one player has only open cards. All cards will be revealed, and the points added for each player (Cards are ranked from -2 to 12). The game ends when one player reaches 100 points or more. Whoever has the lowest score wins.<br/>The trick is: Whenever one column of 3 cards all have the same value, the whole column is dicarded, so if you are feeling lucky, you can try to collect sets of high cards (which everyone else will likely discard, so you can take them from the discard pile).<br/><br/>Skyjo Action adds (as the name suggests) Action Cards, which allow for special moves: Exchange cards in your tableu, Exchange cards between players, Steal an action card, Take two turns in a row etc. You get an action card whenever you put or reveal a Joker in your tableau, or you can take an Action Card instead of a normal move. Jokers allow for easier set collection and make very valuable sets in themselves (-10 or -15 points). <br/>As a new rule, rows of identical cards are now also discarded.<br/><br/>",

As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required. Knowledge of traditional Christmas topics is helpful, but that information is also provided in the app if you need it.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>",

The detectives &ndash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert &ndash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X and capture him. The tricky part is that while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is known only intermittently throughout the game.<br/><br/>Scotland Yard Master includes six additional game elements, four of which are part of a free app for iOS and Android that offers detectives limited tools to locate Mr. X. For example, the detectives can use radio towers to get a rough sense of where Mr. X is located, with the color of the radio waves hinting at whether he's close to each tower. The two-dimensional game board can also be converted to a 3D view, and the detectives can ask witnesses on the buildings whether they've recently seen Mr. X. The app also allows for pass-and-play, with Mr. X having a self-generated PIN so that the detectives can't accidentally discover his location.<br/><br/>Scotland Yard Master also has new action options for Mr. X: &quot;Helicopter&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot;.<br/><br/>",

A set of condition and effect cards is laid out for each round which determines who will win extra beads, depending on their offers. Players select the number of beads to offer in a series of three exchanges, after each of which the condition and effect cards are evaluated, distributing additional beads depending on who offered the most or the fewest of each color. At the end of the round shrunken head tokens are awarded depending on whose set of remaining beads best matches the current arrangement of goal cards.<br/><br/>After each round the goal cards, condition cards and effect cards are replaced. To win players must think ahead to understand whether an offer will likely give them more beads or less, depending on the cards in effect for the round. If players tie for a particular condition, the tied players are cancelled out, leaving the next player to follow the specified effect. This gives the game a rock-scissors-paper like feel where winning the round often depends on guessing how many beads the other players will offer.<br/><br/>High quality components consist of pleasing plastic beads, iconic card art, and shrunken head tokens that are both charming and macabre. Players must use tactical logic and guesswork to get an edge in this puzzling auction style game.<br/><br/>",

And if you're too careful you might only get what's left over. And as mentioned above, no one wants to have black sheep because they equal minus points.<br/><br/>",

Clever use of paper clips on abaci keep the timekeeping elements fluid and simple.<br/><br/>While there's science underlying the rules, it's carefully segregated into sidebars, so that only those people who care about it have to look at it.

Everything in the game centers on Medinaat al-Salaam, the Jewel of the Desert, a sprawling city where different factions vie for control. As of the Awakening set there are 12 factions in the game. A very short description of them:<br/><br/>Assassins &ndash; You guessed it, assassins. ;)<br/>Moto &ndash; Mongols, likes to raid<br/>Senpet &ndash; Ancient Egyptians<br/>Ashalan &ndash; Immortal alien star gazers<br/>Qabal &ndash; Rebellious Jinn summoners<br/>Ebonites &ndash; Crusaders<br/>Jackal &ndash; Evil cultists<br/>Celstial Alliance &ndash; Djinns and more djinns<br/>Dahab &ndash; Merchants faction<br/>Ivory Kingdom &ndash; Evil Indian Cult<br/>Ra&rsquo;Shari &ndash; Romani<br/>Yodatai &ndash; Latin Romans<br/><br/>The city and the river that runs through it is the only source of water in the desert and thus the one who controls the city and the water controls the desert. The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she&rsquo;s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets.<br/><br/>There are four sets all in all and each set had a &quot;bug&quot; on them to make it easy to identify what set a certain card came from. The &quot;bug&quot; is a small symbol in the lower right corner of the card just in front of the Illustrator name. Faction included in that set listed as well:<br/><br/>Shadow of the Tyrant (156 cards) &ndash; No marking being the first set. (Assassins, Moto, Senpet)<br/>Secrets and Lies (104 cards) &ndash; A small Maltese cross. (Ashalan, Qabal)<br/>Black Hand, Black Heart (104 cards) &ndash; Four small rectangles. (Ebonites, Jackal)<br/>The Awakening (464 cards) &ndash; A new moon. (Celestial Alliance, Dahab, Ivory Kingdoms, Ra&rsquo;Shari, Yodatai)<br/><br/>These markings are hard to spot on some cards. To confuse things, several cards were printed in all or at least several sets even though they are only listed under the first set they were included in.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "My First Bohnanza serves as both an introduction to Bohnanza and as a children's game in its own right, with the goal of the game being the same as its parent: Have the most Talers at the end of play.<br/><br/>As in the original Bohnanza, the game includes multiple types of beans, with each bean having a number on it to indicate how many copies are in the game as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; at the bottom of the card to show you how many cards of this type you need to harvest in order to collect Talers. My First Bohnanza has simplified beanometers, with four types of beans having only a single exchange value &mdash; e.g., five Gemeine (common) beans get you one Taler &mdash; and six types of beans having two exchange values. Games with the youngest players (or newcomers to the Bohnanza universe) should use the single beanometer cards with the other cards forming a Taler stack.<br/><br/>To play, each player gets five cards, which they lay in a face-up row, and a beanfield tile that shows spots for two types of beans. On a turn, a player must plant the first (leftmost) card in one of her fields and she can choose to plant a second. Players try to group cards of the same type in the same field, but they can cover beans of different types, if needed. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and either keeps them or trades them (and cards from her hand, if desired) for cards held by other players; all traded cards must be planted. To end her turn, the player draws three cards and adds them to her row.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has the proper number of bean cards in order in one of her fields, she harvests them, placing these cards in the discard pile and collecting a Taler from the stack. If those cards covered beans of another type, she can then start building on those beans again. After going through the deck 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and whoever has the most Talers wins.<br/><br/>Once players have played My First Bohnanza a few times, you can swap the single beanometer cards for the double beanometer cards, which now gives players a choice of when to harvest. Subsequently, you can combine the two decks, which introduces the rule about using one of the bean cards to serve as the Taler (which adjusts the quantity of that type of bean in the deck). With additional plays, you can add in the remaining rules of Bohnanza, such as needing to harvest for no Talers when planting, paying for a third beanfield, keeping your cards in hand, and not being able to harvest a field with only one card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Key Enigma: Hack Forward - There has been a worldwide cyberattack. Massive data filtration has affected from Nuclear power plants to ordinary citizens. Anyone with a smart device can be a target. You will put yourself in the shoes of an investigator whose predecessor has disappeared under strange circumstances. You must continue with the investigation and find those responsible for the massive leaks that threaten the security of the world. But soon you&rsquo;ll discover that those leaks are a smokescreen for something much more dangerous. Who is behind all this? What could be so important? We can&rsquo;t tell you any more without spoilers, but if you like conspiracy theories, science fiction and plot twists you will love this one.<br/><br/>Key Enigma is an escape box that mixes puzzles, narrative, and technology to immerse you in a challenging experience so carefully designed that it may be impossible for you to distinguish reality from fiction.<br/><br/>A box full of mysteries and enigmas will reach your hands. With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case. With this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to: create complex, different and surprising puzzles, a more sophisticated story and we can make the game reach all over the world. The box is the heart of the project where you will find the material that serves as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.<br/><br/>You'll get a mix of: Traditional puzzles, Immersive / Digital puzzles, Codes, Advanced Puzzles<br/><br/>",

The ghost curses every player it meets during its wandering in the ancient room.

The board shows a number of dig sites, with paths of different lengths connecting the sites. To start the game, you place a number of discovery tiles on each site equal to the number of paths leading to it. The tiles show one of five types of artifacts, with 1-5 artifacts on a tile. Each player has his own deck of cards, and the card you draw each turn determines how many archaeologists (1-3) you place on one empty space on any path. When a path fills, the player with the most archaeologists on the path collects one tile from one of the adjacent dig sites &ndash; but in each site he may choose only the tile with the fewest artifacts; the player with the second most artifacts takes the tile that the first player didn&rsquo;t. As the dig sites empty, the more valuable tiles can be claimed.<br/><br/>The game ends after all five tiles with five artifacts on them have been claimed. Each player was dealt a secret card at the start of the game representing one of the types of artifacts, and players must now discard the tile of that type that contains the most artifacts. The player who ends up with the most complete sets wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Read on, professor...<br/><br/>You have three chances to beat the Box of Rocks at trivia. Three hundred multiple choice questions are peppered across one hundred cards. The answer to all of the questions is either 0, 1, or 2. Also included are a wooden human pawn and three synthetic yet astoundingly astute rocks. (It's rumored that they teach night classes at the University.)<br/><br/>Anyway, have someone read any one of the questions aloud to you (preferably in front of a group of friends and loved ones who relish public humiliation). Speak your answer. Now shake the box containing two of the numbered rocks. Hold your breath and open the box. Is the answer you gave correct, or have the rocks guessed the right number? Advance either the human pawn or the rock one space on the scorecard. It's a best-of-three challenge, and the chance at beating these clever little pebbles isn't as easy as you've hoped. Pass the challenge to the next victim and take some time to yourself. One round of gameplay takes all of five minutes; the shame lasts decidedly longer.<br/><br/>",

Both sides were poised for a battle which would be the largest of the war.<br/><br/>Although the battle clearly was a Prussian success the victory fell short because Prague succesfully withstood the enemy siege until June 16 when Marshal Daun's Austrian relief force dealt Frederick his first defeat on the rolling hills near Kolin.<br/><br/>The map and time scale: 100 yards per hex and 20 minute game turns. Units represent battalions, regiments, squadrons, companies and batteries or sections of artillery (1 strength point equals 100 men, 50 horsemen or 2 cannon). <br/>The counters represent the various arms, individual leaders and game markers needed to play the game.<br/><br/>Prague allows players to explore all aspects of this critical and bloody battle with one and two-map scenarios or replay the entire action using all three maps.<br/><br/>As a bonus this game includes the Lobositz Expansion map.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>       3rd Edition Standard Series Rules booklet;<br/>       Exclusive Rules booklet containing Special Rules, Scenarios and Historical Commentary;<br/>       Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color, period-style maps;<br/>       420 1/2&quot; Counters, both full color and black &amp; white;<br/>       Cardstock charts &amp; tables;<br/>       Two 10-sided dice.<br/><br/><br/>",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!<br/><br/>Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game: Jaws 100 is a standalone game that includes the characters Quint and the shark. This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1873 Harzbahn is an 18xx variant set in the Harz mountain range in northern Germany. It simulates not only the (narrow-gauge) railroads in that area, but also mines and other plants. Mining in the Harz mountains suffered a major crisis in the end of the 19th century and the theme of the game is to end this crisis by connecting the mines and other plants to the railroad network - and of course by proper management of the 7 public railroad companies, 15 private mining companies, and up to 5 public mining companies.<br/><br/>1873 has a bunch of fundamental differences from the usual 18xx game, which makes it one of the more distant members of the family (most prominent are the totally different systems of train operations, route determination, and revenue calculation).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The game presents an interesting dynamic. Mines are static and need rails to move product.<br/><br/>The game starts with 15 independent mines struggling with horse drawn delivery. Rails are just beginning to extend track through the difficult terrain with weak and puny engines hardly better than horse drawn wagons.  What do you invest in? The rails or the mines?<br/><br/>Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in. But not very efficiently for the mines as they are too fragmented and cannot get good prices for their product. The mines then join forces into mining companies. The mining companies pay better then the independent companies but have limited capital. Do you continue to reap Okay revenues or take it public. Public mining companies move quickly to acquire additional mines from their owners who reap huge profits.<br/><br/>New rail companies are also forming but have to struggle with purchasing routes and difficult terrain. But the mines need the track so once connected to the mines, they start turning a profit. But how do they protect their market or extend and try to expand to new markets?<br/><br/>Some may fail, overextended by mismanagement and greedy owners. Others with prudent management and extended routes can reap huge profits for the shareholders.<br/><br/>",

Players can take command of the Red Army - try to defeat Poland and bring communism to Europe, or play as Polish generals, stop the Red Army, and establish Polish-Soviet border.<br/><br/>Game mechanics is card driven - each card can be played in four manners:<br/>.as Historical Event<br/>.as an Order count<br/>.as Replacement Points<br/>.as Battle modifier (played only during battles)<br/><br/>Orders are at the heart of the game mechanics. Issued orders are hidden at first, then revealed according to their characteristics and player&rsquo;s current Initiative. Besides the Orders, there are also free &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; Orders - this makes deducting opponent&rsquo;s plans difficult, and is used to hide our real objectives.<br/><br/>Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, with simple, quick combat system (there&rsquo;s also a randomization factor).<br/><br/>Few know about this war and its great importance to Europe. Had the Poles failed in 1920, communism would have surely spread over the Western Europe, which was heavily exhausted after the 1st World War.<br/><br/>Box contents: <br/>- Rulebook including 5 scenarios<br/>- Board<br/>- 110 cards (55 Soviet and 55 Polish)<br/>- 105 wooden blocks <br/>- 1 Sheet of tokens<br/><br/>",

One team must use submarines to sneak troops into enemy ports and destroy vital strategic targets, while the other team deploys a surface fleet to hunt down the subs and protect their crucial supply lines.<br/><br/>Designed by retired Royal Navy Officer and submarine commander Andrew Benford, and developed deep beneath the waves, They Come Unseen is an asymmetrical strategy game of bluffing and deception that uses two boards: one for action on the surface, seen by both players, and one for movement underwater, seen only by the submarine commanders. The game also comes with specially designed control panels to aid each player in tracking vital information such as fuel, ammunition and current cruising depth.<br/><br/>",

A mix of environments, storylines, characters, locations, items, and enemies have been engineered to tell a story unique to every copy of the game thanks to an algorithm that ensures no two copies are alike.

        "description": "In the trick-taking card game Pala, players are art students who are learning to mix their pigments on the palette to get the right color for their canvases. The cards are the paint colors, and the palette is the table. By playing cards together (that is, mixing colors), you can effectively change the color of your cards as well as the trick itself.<br/><br/>The published version of Pala includes two ways to play. Both variants use the same mechanisms for playing tricks, but have different bidding and score rules. Thus, once you wrap your head around the basics of the game, you can play two wildly different games with those core rules.<br/><br/><br/>    In Impressionism, players collectively determine the value of different colors (suits) by discarding cards from their hands before the round begins. Points are bad, analogous to Hearts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    In Pointillism, players bid with colored chips to indicate the colors they expect to win, but over-bidding risks losing all your points for the round. Points are good, analogous to Spades.<br/><br/><br/>",

Rather, the next card a player plays will be set on top of the previously played cards.

Islands are placed face-up in the middle of the table, and other cards can be tucked underneath to represent boats, temples, goods, and populace (under the left, top, right, bottom edges).<br/><br/>Boats let you transport goods. Population lets you have plurality at islands, which is required to take goods and use islands' effects. Temples (if with goods) allow you to draw more cards when you refresh your hand.

Players cannot see the face of their cards --- only the suit on the back --- and need to deduce which cards they have as quickly as possible in the round. They are helped by the fact that their neighbor sorts the cards sequentially by rank at the start of the hand.<br/><br/>Players must follow suit if they can. Hearts are trump. The winner of the trick leads the next trick.<br/><br/>Each player will, at some point during the trick, place one card go &quot;up their sleeve,&quot; and the face value of it becomes the number of tricks (and suits) players are betting they will take.<br/><br/>Players score points for hitting their bid, which is the face value of the card up their sleeve. They also earn additional points if they capture a number of suits equal to their bid (and they do not get this bonus if they miss their trick bid). They lose points for missing their bid.<br/><br/>Play hands equal to the number of players. High score wins at the end of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qwixx Longo is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Gameplay is nearly identical to 2012's Qwixx, but with eight-sided dice allowing for higher numbers to be rolled and lucky numbers that give additional chances to mark off spaces.<br/><br/>Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-16 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 16-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls six eight-sided dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows; additionally, if the sum of the white dice matches one of the two lucky numbers printed on your scoresheet, you immediately mark off the next number in the row in which you have the fewest marks.<br/><br/>Then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you have at least six numbers marked in a row, then you can mark off either of the final two spaces in a colored row (15/16 in red/yellow and 3/2 in green/blue) &mdash; assuming the dice allow you to do so, of course. If you do this, you also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.<br/><br/>When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mermaid Rain is a Japanese game from the makers of Train Raider.<br/><br/>Over five rounds, players try to collect five different types of goods by moving around the sea. The game uses two phases: first is the &quot;surf predicting&quot; phase where players play melds of cards in a Taj Mahal-type mechanic. The melds determine player order, selection of &quot;wave tile&quot;, and give other benefits. In the second phase, &quot;surf riding&quot;, players place their wave tiles on the board and then use cards to move through the sea on the waves to collect goods.<br/><br/>The game is playable with English rules as the components are either language-independent or easily decipherable.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Setup: specific locations for subset of tiles, some face down; rest are to side, also face down. Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).<br/><br/>Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round. The resulting poker-style combinations give bonuses (VP, or special powers); the ranking gives you player order for the round.<br/><br/>In order, select a face up sea tile (4 shapes, 2-3 hexes each, with one of 3 suits or wild). Then, in order, place the tile on the board and use some/all cards left in hand to move your mermaid around the board (playing card allows you to move mermaid to matching tile/space). Whenever on an island with token(s), look at face down tokens then add one of the tokens to your collection.<br/><br/>At end of round, sea tiles with the darker color are removed from the board. Any mermaids on them are displaced to one of the unoccupied starting locations (player's choice). Then, deal 7 cards per player (max hand size 9) and repeat.<br/><br/>Game ends after 5 rounds. Each player must discard 5 tokens (1 per symbol), or lose 5 VP per missing symbol. Then rank players' collections of sets of each type, awarding VP accordingly (rarer tiles, larger sets earn more VP). Most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

Take your time to come up with the perfect sound to represent your card: you will have to imitate that sound to suggest your concept to the Guesser. If you are the Guesser, instead, your job will be to listen to the sounds performed by the Soundmakers.<br/><br/>At the start of the timer, all Soundmakers start to perform their sounds...simultaneously!

Well, something like this may definitely happen to you!<br/><br/>When the timer runs out, the Guesser tries to find as many Sound cards as possible, one at a time! There are more cards on the board than sounds made by the Soundmakers, will you be able to find them all? Each correct guess gets you 1 point, but if you make a mistake, the round ends immediately.<br/><br/>A different player will be the Guesser each round. If over subsequent rounds you gain enough points to reach the end of the Soundtrack, all players win. But beware, each Sound card that is left unguessed at the end of each round will make you lose life depending on the numbered token it is associated to, and if your Heart marker reaches the bottom of its track, all players lose!<br/><br/>",

Its objective was to eliminate the Izium bridgehead over Seversky Donets or the &quot;Barvenkovo bulge&quot; which was one of the Soviet offensive's staging areas. After a winter counter-offensive that drove German troops away from Moscow but depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.<br/><br/>On 12 May 1942, both the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May. Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket was exterminated from all sides by German armored, artillery and machine gun firepower as well as 7,700 tonnes of air-dropped bombs. After six days of encirclement, Soviet resistance ended as their troops were killed or taken prisoner.<br/><br/>The battle was an overwhelming German victory, with 280,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies. The German Army Group South pressed its advantage, encircling the Soviet 28th Army on 13 June in Operation Wilhelm and pushing back the 38th and 9th Armies on 22 June in Operation Fridericus II as preliminary operations to Case Blue, which was launched on 28 June as the main German offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942.<br/><br/>Kharkov uses the Panzergruppe Guderian system.

Your walls and barbed wire won&rsquo;t hold the dead for long, however, and they&rsquo;re getting hungry.<br/><br/>Characters receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner. Victory points also act as experience points for leveling up a character.<br/><br/>The game combines combat, tactics, resource collecting, character development, team play, and strategy towards the goal of surviving in the Zpocalypse!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.<br/><br/>Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?<br/><br/>Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!<br/><br/>When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.<br/><br/>The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleon Against Russia - From Smolensk to Moscow and beyond August 16-October 24, 1812 contains five battles from the critical phase of the Campaign, when the Russian Army finally gave Napoleon the decisive battles he so greatly desired. His first maneuver starts out well&mdash;with the French poised to slip into Smolensk behind the Russians. However, the opportunity to bring an end to the campaign will remain unfulfilled. After that, Moscow became the default destination of the Grande Arm&eacute;e. As Napoleon stated, &ldquo;The wine has been poured and must now be drunk.&quot;<br/><br/>Napoleon against Russia is one of the games from OSG's THE LIBRARY OF NAPOLEONIC BATTLES series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.<br/><br/>BATTLES SIMULATED:<br/><br/>     Smolensk, A Battle Postponed, 16-17 August<br/><br/><br/>When he recognized that the enemy had withdrawn into the city, the Emperor&rsquo;s plan was stymied. He either had to seize Smolensk on the 16th, without waiting for the arrival of the entire army, or cross the Dneiper River east of Smolensk. Instead he waited for the Russians to make a mistake, and gave them time to pull out along the Moscow road.<br/><br/><br/>     Valutino, Rearguard Action, 18 August<br/><br/><br/>When the Russians did give him an opportunity to catch the First Army disunited after a confused night march, Napoleon had already returned to Smolensk, expecting nothing more than a rearguard action. Hence he was not on the scene to coordinate the actions of his Marshals, who, left to themselves, were unable to crystallize a victory out of the opportunity.<br/><br/><br/>     Shevardino, Fight for the Redoubt, 5-6 September <br/><br/><br/>The preliminary battle opened with the arrival of the French cavalry who immediate attacked Konovnytsyn. On the 6th, more French forces arrived including the IV Corps and the Polish Corps. The French captured the Shevardino redoubt at a cost of 4,000&ndash;5,000 French and 6,000 Russian casualties.<br/><br/><br/>     Borodino, The Russian Army is Saved, 7-8 September <br/><br/><br/>In the climactic battle, Napoleon has been criticized for making a simple frontal assault. With our large map the French player will have plenty of maneuver room to try and outflank the Russian army to the south, or even to the north. He will also have the option of attacking the north flank as Kutusov expected.<br/><br/><br/>     Maloyaroslavets, The Retreat Goes Awry, 23-24 October<br/><br/><br/>Trying to secure a bridge over the Luzha River, the Italians of Eugene's IV Corps lost about 5,000 and the Russians about 6,000 men as the town changed hands eight times. Except for Davout, all the French marshals advocated a return to the main highway to Smolensk, through the depleted zone, a detour that doomed the Army.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: <br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/>Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.<br/><br/>(Text from the OSG pages)<br/><br/>",

The zone portals have just opened, and as we speak the first heroes are braving the Dungeon in search of fame, glory, and level-ups. Besieged monsters lurk on the outskirts of town looking for opportunities to gear themselves up against their new foes.<br/><br/>For you, this means only one thing: PROFIT! You see, heroes come back with packs full of loot, needing beds and mead and provisions and furry hats. (It&rsquo;s always furry hats. What is up with that?) And monsters will pay top doubloon for anything that might stop the heroes from coming into their dungeon and smiting them straight to the Nameless Realms. (G&rsquo;luck with that, fellas!) For the enterprising merchant who can work both ends of the situation, there are stacks of Vorpal to be made. But you won&rsquo;t be alone. Other merchants are here, moving in on your territory, trying to make the same quick piece of shiny that you are. Competition is the heart of commerce. Or something.<br/><br/>When the boss monster finally goes down, whoever has the most Vorpal Pieces wins! (I saw that carved in a table at the Merchants&rsquo; Guild, so it must be true.)<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, and each round is separated into two phases:<br/><br/>1. Town Phase - Players will take turns running Shops, working in the Guildhalls, and crafting artifacts. When the round ends after one player calls for it, the Heroes leave town for their next Dungeon Crawl.<br/><br/>2. Dungeon Crawl Phase - The Heroes enter the Dungeon to defeat enemies and level up, receive Loot, and while this is happening you and your cohorts are preparing the town for their &quot;triumphant&quot; return. The Heroes finish by arriving at the Town Gate with backpacks full of Loot and gold, ripe for the picking. This starts the next and round with a new Town Phase.<br/><br/>The player with the most VPs at the end of the game (after the Boss encounter) wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pizza Theory, designed for exactly three players, has no randomness and simple turn actions, but the outcome each round is unpredictable since each cook has his own idea for the best way to create the pie.<br/><br/>To set up the game, each player takes his pizza cutter (a wooden stick) and the die and topping counters that match. Each player places two toppings on the game board in the spaces designated with an X.<br/><br/>In each round, the three players take turns placing one topping on the game board; that topping cannot be placed adjacent to any of that player's other toppings. Each player then secretly chooses a number (1-6) on his die; players reveal the numbers and lay their pizza cutters on the board in the space matching their number. The cutters divide the pizza into one of 216 possible outcomes, creating a number of slices. In each slice if a player has more toppings than each opponent, he replaces those opponent's toppings with his own; if two players tie for the most toppings, the toppings of the third player are removed but not replaced; in a three-way tie, nothing changes. (NB: If a player has at most one topping in each slice, then his toppings cannot be removed or replaced this round.)<br/><br/>Whoever first places his 16 toppings on the game board wins.<br/><br/>With only two players, the cutter and toppings of the third color are still used, with players taking turns placing those toppings on the board. If all 16 toppings of the third color are on the board before either player gets his toppings on the board, then both players lose.<br/><br/>",

But be aware, this is not the Prussian army of the Seven Years War!<br/><br/>At Mollwitz (April 10, 1741), King Frederick II has been outmaneuvered by FM Neipperg.  The plodding Prussians must advance over snowy fields to assault the waiting Austrian infantry and escape the entrapment.  The Austrian player, with superior cavalry, must use that cavalry to slow down or distract the Prussian infantry before they devastate their Austrian counterparts.  Each side has their strengths and (weaknesses) and must seek to maximise them to their benefit before time runs out.  And, there is always the possibility that Frederick will flee the battle ...<br/><br/>At Chotusitz (May 17, 1742), the Austrian army under Prince Charles has again outmaneuvered Frederick and hopes to annihilate the isolated part of his army.  The pressure is on as the Austrians must attack quickly before the bulk of the Prussian army arrives as reinforcements.  This is a finely matched battle with the Austrians as the attackers!<br/><br/>Both battles are only one map in size with less than the usual number of counters.  Chotusitz is roughly the size of the BAR game of Lobositz whereas Mollwitz has only 2/3 of the counters of Chotusitz.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pixel Tactics is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.<br/><br/>Mega Man Pixel Tactics: Bass Orange Edition is a box containing two copies of all the unlocked stretch goals from the Mega Man Pixel tactics Kickstarter campaign, including all the social goals, bringing a total of 28 different new characters to the table!  This is also playable on its own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player in Korrigans has two korrigans (a.k.a. fairies or spirits) and must use them to move about the landscape, claim animal tokens in order to access other parts of the land, and eventually find the pot of gold that will become visible once the rainbow's location is revealed.<br/><br/>In more detail, players take their first two turns to place their korrigans on the game board; with each korrigan you place, you look at the tokens in that location and keep one of them. These tokens show either gold (which possibly gives you points at the end of the game) or an animal (which allows you to pass through gates that bear that animal to reach a different landscape). From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. Each round the player holding the bag draws a rainbow token and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won't appear in this row or column in the final part of the game.<br/><br/>Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans. If a player reaches the pot with one korrigan, he scores 10 points and if both of his korrigans reach the pot he scores 15 points. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Escape from Dulce is the first in a trilogy  of collaborative, sci-fi adventure games for 1 to 5 players. Choose from one of 8 hilariously bizarre characters, who have been imprisoned on the bottom level of the Dulce Base and have just awoken after a Cryo-Pod malfunction. The players must blast their way through a base full of self strategizing human and non-human enemies, as they attempt to traverse the seven nefarious levels of Dulce and escape to freedom.<br/><br/>Along the way you&rsquo;ll collect zany items, incredible weapons and level up your characters, while constantly working to keep the alarm from reaching critical levels and releasing the dreaded Man in Black.<br/><br/>The game is more than just blasting enemies though, as a tale slowly unfolds in the form of story themed Encounter Cards, randomly drawn every time the players enter a new room. The story portion of the card describes the room and what happens to the players while in that room, while the business portion of the card dictates what traps or puzzles and enemies the players must overcome. The Encounter Cards create the feeling of a lived in world and allow for maximum replayability and role-play fun.<br/><br/>Will you play as Snippy Von Bell, a two-headed mutant cow that can strap machine guns on its back, or Amelia Earhart, a pilot who disappeared in 1937 over the Pacific? Maybe you&rsquo;ll meet a helpful sasquatch or have to decide if you should release an Atlantean fishman from his aquarium cell. Tentacle monsters, robot ninjas, a game of lizard man chess and even a mini black hole await you! Good luck escaping. You&rsquo;re going to need it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.<br/><br/>On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:<br/><br/>a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. <br/>b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile<br/>c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.<br/><br/>Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.<br/><br/>(precis from the review by gschloesser)<br/><br/>",
