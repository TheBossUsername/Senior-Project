        "description": "Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are <br/>different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.<br/><br/>There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.<br/><br/>Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.c-g-s.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.c-g-s.com</a>) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.<br/><br/>Part of the Component Game System.<br/><br/>",

Additionally, players will need a pawn and a common supply of about 30 markers in each of four different colors. The cards form a timeline, allowing players to move back and forth through history to find cheap commodities and then sell for profit.  Of course, all this time travel will shift the timeline, and thus the market for each of the four commodities.<br/><br/>The cards have four pathways from the left to right sides, which cross over each other. They also have a waypoint representing one of the commodities (sheep, neckties, Picassos ... just suggestions from the designer, as they are all pretty abstract!) that can be picked up cheaply at that point in time.<br/><br/>The object is to score 21 points by picking up commodities and selling them at points in the timeline where they are worth obscene amounts of money. However, picking up a commodity changes the timeline in subtle ways: in the game, it means moving a card up or down by a slight amount, which disconnects its current pathways and connects them to new pathways.<br/><br/>",

From left to right, the pieces are one through five stars (first rank), moons (second rank) and suns (third rank).<br/><br/>The pieces move one square diagonally in any direction to a vacant square, or must leap over one opposing piece (only opposing pieces, but without capture - there are no captures in Salta) if the square immediately beyond is vacant. Only one jump is made (no chain jumping), and missed opportunities to jump may be forced by the opponent, although a player is free to choose among several available jumps. Blockading all of the opposing pieces is not allowed, although some may be temporarily blocked as long as the opponent still has a legal move.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first player to move all of his pieces seven rows ahead - i.e. into the starting places of the opposing piece. However, the order from left to right and front to back should be kept. Thus, reading from left to right, the goal position is one through five suns (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five stars (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.<br/><br/>If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Batman: Arkham City Escape is a two-player game that pits Batman against all of his greatest foes &ndash; from The Joker and Harley Quinn to Poison Ivy and The Riddler &ndash; as they try to escape Arkham City!<br/><br/>In this game, one player represents Batman, and the other player has command of twenty members of Batman's rogues gallery, with each villain having abilities exclusive to that character. When Batman and a villain occupy the same space on the board, epic battles ensue as Batman utilizes his Utility Belt and Combat cards and risks retaliation from each villain. The player controlling the Arkham inmates earns victory points by helping the villains escape Arkham, while the Batman player gains points by apprehending his rivals before they make it out of the city, as well as by saving iconic allies by utilizing special gadgets from his utility belt. The first player to earn ten victory points wins!<br/><br/>The challenge of this game is winning as Batman. You must use cunning, strategy, and excellent timing to win. If you are having trouble winning as Batman, we suggest you use a house rule that allows Batman to draw 2 Combat Cards at the end of his turn, instead of just 1. Thanks, Matt Hyra--Designer: Arkham City Escape<br/><br/>",

Although it may look like a simple children's game with all those flowers and cute meadow animals, it offers a tense and thinky experience for two to four players of all ages.<br/><br/>The board represents a meadow full of flowers. The flowers have a hole in the center in order to thread the lace through them. Players alternate between threading with their lace and trying to collect flowers with as many leaves as possible. They can collect any unoccupied flower on the board but the farther it is, the more lace it requires and they play only as long as the length of the lace allows them.<br/><br/>The rules can be explained within a minute, but the game offers quite a lot of strategic depth and thanks to more than thirty animal cards also a huge replayability. At the start of the game, players agree on the amount of animals they want to use, setting up the complexity of the game. Each animal gets its favorite color and adds a special rule to all flowers of that color.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Moving the blocks like Knights in the game of Chess, precise positioning is of the utmost importance in order for the sphere to capture the win.<br/><br/>In this fast-paced game, suggestive of basketball meets Chess, two players try to move their marble to the opposite side of the board, using 5 wooden &quot;blocks&quot; as passing instruments. A player may either pass the ball or move a block like a Knight in a game of Chess. The ball may be passed in any direction, but the block with a ball may not be moved.

You are a girl born in such a kingdom. Your only dream is to become a full-fledged maid.<br/><br/>However, due to the importance of the maid occupation (it being essential to national security), only the most elite are allowed to graduate to professional status. Fortunately, you passed the entrance exams for the prestigious school &quot;Royal Faltisia Academy&quot;. You have three years to polish yourself, so how will you spend your school life?<br/><br/>下町メイド物語: The Story of Faltisia is an ambitious multimedia project by LAUGH SKETCH Inc, consisting of part web-novel, and part board game. (&quot;下町メイド物語&quot; translates to &quot;Country Maid Story&quot;.) The board game is played out over three years during which players study at the esteemed Royal Academy of Faltisia. Here they improve their strength, wisdom, beauty, and purity, and hopefully graduate as a Professional Maid. At the conclusion of the game, the player with the highest VP wins.<br/><br/>Players must choose what they will do each year by drafting action cards, then must choose between attending class to improve their abilities, or skipping class to instead choose from a number of extra-curricular activities.<br/><br/>One of the core elements of the game is to apply for a Provisional Maid License, which is issued to the Academy from the Royal Maid Association. Without such a licence, you cannot typically work as a professional maid. In addition, each character has a unique ability that can be activated after receiving this provisional license; it is recommended you play the first game with the intention of acquiring this license.<br/><br/>It's also important to take advantage of the items available in the school store. Let's become an excellent maid in three years!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

They practice handling goods and money, learn to compare prices and take important steps towards their independence.<br/><br/>Children must be able to count to four and compare numbers.<br/><br/>Each player receives a shopping list showing 4 different goods and a purse with maximal 8 coins. In turns, players throw a dice yielding a number between 2 and 4, and move on ways between a common home, the bank and the four shops. The home is the starting place, the shops allow purchases and the bank allows to refill the purse. The first player to return home with all 4 goods on his shopping list purchased wins. Very simple.<br/><br/>There are 9 different shopping goods: 3 meat products, 3 bakery products and 3 fruit/vegetable products. There are four copies of each product in the game. The butcher/bakery/greengrocery hold three copies of each meat/bakery/veggie product respectively and one copy of each product is found at the delicatessen shop.<br/><br/>Out of its stock of 9 goods per shop, only three are on display and up for sale at a time. Goods cost between 1 and 3 coins each, depending on its display slot, clearly marked by a price tag showing coins above each good. Upon purchase, all remaining goods a shifted to the left (the cheap places) and new goods from the stock fill up the empty expensive places on the right.<br/><br/>This may sound more complicated than it is: a three year old easily understands it and can execute the simple mechanic, thanks to arrows and price tags showing coins and not numbers. What a three year old that is yet unfamiliar with boardgames might not immediately appreciate, is the neat balancing behind the mechanic: unsold products decrease in price, whereas sought-after products increase in price; that buying bread at the delicatessen is more expensive than at the bakery, both in terms of money and distance to travel, but that the delicatessen may save travel between different shops, etc. However, learning this by playing is the hidden educational goal of the game.<br/><br/>",

Spicing things up is a dynamic narrative that sees the players struggling to stay on the good side of the different factions running the city, forcing them to swiftly adapt to newly revealed threats and rapidly shifting alliances.<br/><br/>",

It's the last day of the journey, and the award-winning lobsters are waiting in their aquarium for their performance.<br/><br/>But all of a sudden, the alarm bell rings! The heavy sea tosses the ship about and mixes up all the kitchenettes. Even worse, the lobsters are able to flee from their aquarium! Catch them by getting the chaos under control, but avoid the slippery fishbones as they can quickly hold you back.<br/><br/>Cucina Curiosa is a fast-paced tile-laying game. Every player has the same set of twenty tiles, showing kitchenettes and paths. Some of the tiles also show lobsters and fishbones.<br/><br/>The game is played over sixteen turns. On every turn, the oldest player flips over one of his tiles, then the other players search for the same tile in their set, then everyone places the tile in his personal kitchen. Once sixteen tiles have been played, the game ends and players count their points. Every lobster that is connected to the entrance by paths is worth 1 point, but fishbones count negative for you, so you want to avoid them. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

A small arms combat system for use with miniatures.<br/><br/>While primarily thought of as a combat system for Leading Edge's Rhand Morningstar Missions RPG, the original Phoenix Command rules were also intended to be used for wargaming, either on the tabletop or a hex map. The game system concentrates on &quot;ultra realistic&quot; (in the form of ultra-detailed) firearms combat: &quot;Phoenix Command combines accurate simulation of gunshot wounds with detailed aiming and firing rules, and authentic modern weapon data to create a simple, fast-paced game with an incredibly realistic feel.&quot;<br/><br/>Two sample hex map scenarios were included: The Bridge at Oppenheim (for 6-9 players, a NATO squad holds a bridge against a Soviet advance) and The Defense of the Apollo Ray (for 5 players, SAS versus terrorists hijacking a luxury liner).<br/><br/>A number of supplements supplied the statistics for firearms of different eras. These initially included supplements for Modern Military Small Arms (1946-1960), Civilian &amp; Police Weapons (1946-1990), Military Weapons of WWII (1919-1945), and Military Weapons of WWI (1890-1918).<br/><br/>More detail description of all book published can be found on RPG Geek.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Retail and individual orders available at PlayChinookGames@gmail.com<br/>Game includes English, German, French and Dutch components.<br/><br/>Thematic Overview:<br/><br/>The Realm of Kanta is reopening borders after a mysterious calamity struck the land. Clans now compete to rebuild their wealth by claiming the lands they lost.<br/><br/>The new economy revolves around small chains of allied states. Each clan sends its own envoys to claim states, opening borders in the process. Once a ring of six states share open borders, wealth comes to participating clans. Neighboring allies also help one another to suppress uprisings started by competing clans.<br/><br/>How to Play (2-6 Player Version):<br/>Each player selects one of eight role cards that identifies their clan and its unique strengths. Your goal is to finish the game as the wealthiest in this new era. The game is played on a board showing a bird's eye view of the realm of Kanta, overlaid by a hexagonal grid representing the realm's states.<br/><br/>Every player gets the same number of hexagon tiles to start (anywhere from 8-20 depending on the number of players and the desired game length). Each of these &quot;council tiles&quot; identifies your clan and represents a group of six of its members. As leader, you send these councils out to reclaim states by placing one tile per turn.<br/><br/>A council tile must be placed next to Kanta City (start location) or another claimed state. That's because councils are dispatched from Kanta City, and can only travel across open borders. When you place a tile, you are opening any borders that the state shares with occupied adjacent states.<br/><br/>How exactly are those borders opened? Your council members are assigned one to each edge of the tile. They each speak one of three languages of the realm, which is indicated by one of three colors on each tile edge. Your council must speak a common language at every shared border where you place the tile.<br/><br/>Players earn wealth by positioning themselves to be part of rings of claimed states. Each ring of six claimed states earns gold for the involved clans, proportionate to the amount of representation a clan has in each ring. Each additional state that one clan has in a given ring earns less than the previous state.<br/><br/>Players also gain wealth and abilities through action cards. Earn cards by claiming several states that produce the same type of resource (e.g. 3 wood-producing states). The action cards are highly integrated thematically, yet are not so complicated as to slow game play. Your progress earning action cards is recorded using a track at the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>Perils and opportunities abound, including states still dealing with the plague, and mysterious island states.<br/><br/>The game ends when everyone has placed all of their tiles. The player with the most wealth (consisting of coins and coin value of action cards in hand) wins.<br/><br/>How to Play (1 Player Version):<br/>The solo play option is an exciting 20-minute game that flips the game mechanics on their head! It also serves as a thematic prequel to what happens in 2-6 player games. Play as either the Mountain Clan or Water Clan as you escort your allies, the threatened Valley Clan, to the safety of Kanta City. New challenges and thrills await, using the same base components of the regular game.<br/><br/>Use the 3 resource tracker tokens from the regular game to represent you and your family, scattered in the realm. Use your 20 council tiles from the regular game as movement tokens, spending them to pass through deserts, forests, plains and more at your peril to locate the Valley Clan leader and her family. Then bring your family and hers to the safety of Kanta City. Be prepared with action cards as you encounter the Desert and Forest Clans, plagued states and more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Kharkov 1943&quot;, published in 1999 in &quot;Vae Victis&quot; issue 25, is a wargame which covers the operations &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Gallop&quot; around Kharkov in February-March 1943.  This wargame uses a variation of the system used in Vae Victis issue 13 for &quot;Arnhem&quot;.  The focus of the game system is on initiative and command, with alternating formation activations (i.e., the German player activates one General's command, then the Soviet player activates one General's command, and repeat until all the units are activated).  This is one of Vae Victis's larger games in terms of counters and markers, but still fits on the standard Vae Victis map (which is far smaller than the typical ca. 2' x 3' American wargame map).<br/><br/>This issue also includes counters for a scenario for &quot;Caesar: Conquest of Gaul,&quot; the Batte of Sos.<br/><br/>As with all Vae Victis wargames, the counters need to be cut out and mounted.  The rules are entirely in French, although translations in English are available online.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast paced 2-player dice game with cocks, bulls and monkeys on the faces of the dice. Players try to place six 2-sided chips on a wooden game board that has an antique feel. When you roll pairs of monkeys, cocks or bulls, you place down or flip over a chip in the appropriate spot on the board. Strategy comes in when you roll a cock &amp; bull, you can either score one point on the pegboard, or remove one of your opponents chips. Bonus points are scored on the pegboard after you capture an area on the board with chips. When you roll 1 monkey your turn is over. There are two ways to win, either get all six chips on the game board, or move your wooden peg from start to finish.<br/><br/>The original edition of this game was hand made and self-published by F. M. Smith beginning in 2009. The heavy wooden game boards are all signed and numbered personally by the creator. The game pieces fit inside a small cloth game bag included with the boards.<br/><br/>The 2014 edition, published by Blue Panther, has a two-piece game board with wooden cubes to mark the scores, replacing the wooden pegboard of the original 2009 First Edition. This edition is easily identified by its smaller sized tan colored box with black lettering.<br/><br/>The 2018 classic edition, also published by Blue Panther, has a one-piece game board with peg holes like the original. The box also includes a piece of felt in the bottom converting it into a dice tray. This edition comes in a 9 x 12 black box with white lettering.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes one tile at random to start the game. Then as quickly as possible, everyone picks up fruit tiles one by one and adds them to the stack already in their hand &mdash; but to add a tile, you must match the fruit half showing on the top (or bottom) of your stack with an identical fruit half on the tile being added. Thus, you're combining the fruit halves to create a whole fruit.<br/><br/>Players can flip over tile on the table to see the reverse side. Once all the tiles have been claimed or no one wants any more, players compare their tile stacks and the players with the taller pile wins &mdash; but only if all the fruits have been combined correctly!

Their objective is to build a network of Huts and Camps and collect &amp; forage enough resources to build the Ark before the flood. Each player has a unique Mighty Beast - the hero miniature that can forage strategic resources.<br/><br/>The Flood has 2 modes, co-op scenarios and solo gameplay.<br/><br/>In the Main mode: Each turn players will choose a tile to activate and collect resources from their structures on the hexagons. Commodities include: Gopher wood, Tar, Wool, Vegetables, Limestone.<br/><br/>In the Classic mode: Luck is paramount! Each turn players will roll the tool and two commodity dice to collect resources from their structures bordering hexagons. Commodities include: Gopher wood, Tar, Wool, Vegetables, Limestone.<br/><br/>The board includes 27 hexagons and a board edge what includes a trade track, faith points and a market. Tool tokens are placed on each hexagon. When the correct commodity or Tool is rolled or tile is activated the players will receive resources. During their turns players will build, forage, deploy mines, control their Mighty Beast, collect resource cards, obtain event cards. Story cards control the weather and yeild multiple other bonuses.<br/><br/>Trading is a strategic part of the game. Players are able to trade resource cards with each other and the supply. After the First player that finishes the Ark and the animal token the game stops and faith points are counted. The player with the most faith points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steffen Benndorf, designer of the 2009 release W&uuml;rfel Express, is back with another dicey design, this time from Schmidt Spiele as part of its new line of dice games<br/><br/>Each round in Fiese 15, a new target card is revealed showing six differently colored dice that sum to 15. On a turn, a player rolls all six dice, then sets aside any dice that have a value equal to or less than the similarly-colored die on the target card. For example, if the card has a blue die showing a 4, then any value from 1 to 4 on the blue die would be valid and set aside. The player can stop and score points equal to the sum of his valid dice or roll the invalid dice. If he rolls at least one valid die, he sets that aside and can choose to stop or roll again; if he rolls no valid dice, then he scores points equal to all the dice on the target card for which no die was set aside. Set aside five dice, and you score an extra five points; set aside all six, and your score for the round is doubled. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Fiese 15 includes 15 target cards, with only ten being used each game. The target cards are double-sided, with only five dice showing on the opposite side, allowing players to choose a variant that handicaps the leaders with tougher targets.<br/><br/>",

What if YOU could determine the outcome of the war? Built for War puts you in charge of designing the main battle tank for one of the 4 major combatants in the war. Will you design a behemoth to top the vaunted King Tiger at the expense of agility and speed? Or, will you pursue faster, more nimble tanks to take down your enemies&rsquo; support troops knowing they are vulnerable to the big guns your enemies may be developing in secret?<br/><br/>These are the hard choices that you will have to make. You decide. You design. But, whatever you choose, do it well.  Your country is counting on you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SF3D began as a feature in the May 1982 issue of Hobby Japan under the name, &ldquo;Wonderful Junk Kit.&rdquo; Included in that early feature was a scratch-built kit built by Kow Yokoyama of a powersuit pieced together from a Microman action figure, ping pong balls, and salvaged model kit parts.<br/><br/>The response to Yokoyama&rsquo;s design was huge &mdash; the era of &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; mecha was just taking off, after all &mdash; and so a regular feature in Hobby Japan was born. This new series, dubbed SF3D Original, featured story and background details by Hiroshi Ichimura alongside kits created by Yokoyama. Yokoyama&rsquo;s kits would later be joined by those of other scratch builders, like Makoto Kobayashi, as the workload increased under the demands of a regular column. SF3D ran regularly in Hobby Japan through 1985.<br/><br/>SF3D takes place in the distant future, following a cataclysmic World War IV that all but wiped-out life on Earth. Human settlers return to Earth, specifically Australia, and soon find themselves unhappy with their overlords in the Galactic Federation. Crime runs amok and the settlers are unable to restore order themselves, so the Galactic Federation tasks the Strahl Democratic Republic (SDR) with straightening things out down under. The SDR&rsquo;s methods are heavy-handed and the settlers soon find themselves thrown under the boot of vaguely Germanic totalitarianism. In turn, the unhappy settlers hire mercenary forces to get rid of the SDR and war breaks out in post-apocalyptic Australia.<br/><br/>(from the Box:)<br/><br/>The storm which is World War IV engulfs the continent of Australia. War sparks ingenuity. Ingenuity birth technology. Technology is escalation. The puppet regime which is called Shuttoral World Government is the enemy. The Australian-led resistance grows in strength with the advent of the HAFS &lsquo;Jerry&rsquo;, a tow-legged tank with a ground speed of 54 km/hr. War continues&hellip;<br/><br/>January 11, 2885: New Canberra City falls to Australian forces. The Germans retreat south skirting the desert.<br/>February 3, 2885: Shuttoral forces, isolated, make an abortive drive on the township of Gibson. A beachhead rescue saves most ot the force.<br/>April 25, 2885: Shuttoral scientists make a secret presentation to Command of the prototype Krachen vogel, armed drone recon. This weapon will be particularly nasty to the Allies because of its similarity to the un-armed Neuspotter.<br/>April 26, 2885: Plans begin for a new Shuttoral offensive towards New Canberra City. The directive is &ldquo;Take, or destroy&rdquo;.<br/><br/>SF3D is a Fast-Moving, Realistic 2-player Game of War, Inspired by the award-winning series of plastic model kits, by Nitto of Japan. This game has been thoroughly playtested in the U.S.<br/>Limited, Numbered Edition of 2,040<br/><br/>480 Superb, die-cut doubled-sided oversized counters<br/>4 folding, full-color, semi-geomorphic map boards<br/>20-page Japanese rulebook, numbered<br/>10 Scenario Cards, plus variants<br/>1 Combat Chart Card, 2 Air Commitment Cards<br/>2 six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>With all of the science fiction wargames that were published in Japan, almost all were based off anime shows, and none used original designs (even the US Battletech just used robots from JPN anime shows without permission to begin).

        "description": "The Necronomicon is undoubtedly the most emblematic book in the mythology of H.P. Lovecraft. In this game you will assume the role of Abdul Alhazred with the aim of completing all sections of the aberrant book. It is a game for 2 to 4 players with game modes for 20 or 60 minutes. Necronomicon is presented in a limited edition that continues The Writer, and comes with the amazing art of Fran&ccedil;ois Launet (Goominet), with exclusive Cthulhu pawns for the sanity count (collector&rsquo;s edition) and an impressive Necronomicon book case made by hand, in wood, in antique book format (Deluxe edition).<br/><br/>How to play: The objective of the game is to complete the Necronomicon. Each player is dealt five cards at the beginning of the game. Each card represents part of a section of the book. Each section of the book is completed by collecting at least 5 cards from that specific section, identified by a symbol. The game is divided into several rounds, each of which ends when a player manages to complete a certain number of sections of the book (each round will be more complicated than the previous one). The complete sections of the book are marked with tokens until the Necronomicon is completed and the game is won.<br/><br/>During a turn there are only two moves: draw card (to choose from the deck or the discard pile) and perform an action by placing a card on the table, which will serve to bring new cards into the hand or to get rid of others mainly. You'll have to decide whether to sacrifice an important card to take advantage of the card's action or to play more conservatively. The card that is played on the table is available for the next player, who in turn will decide whether to draw it or take a new one from the deck.<br/><br/>Once a round is finished (managing to complete the sections of the book and discarding the remaining cards) the tokens are placed on the completed sections of the book and the players who have been left with cards in hand will lose sanity points.<br/><br/>The rounds follow each other until all the sections of the Necronomicon are completed and the game is won.<br/><br/>",

It comes with 4 sets of standard chess pieces and nine 8x8 chessboards with various terrain features on them.<br/><br/>Terrain consists of plain squares, forests, rivers, lakes, ruins, and bridges.  On plain squares, the king, queen, rook, and bishop move just as they do in normal chess.  The knight gains the ability to move three squares diagonally.  Pawns can move one, two, or three squares forward or diagonally forward.<br/><br/>Pieces may have their movement restricted by various types of terrain.  For example, the rook may not move into forests, and may only move one square per turn in ruins.<br/><br/>As in chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's king.  If playing with more than two players, the king must actually be captured.  The player whose king was captured is eliminated from the game, and the capturing player takes control of all of his remaining pieces.<br/><br/>",

Named after famous explorer Amerigo Vespucci.<br/><br/>Winner of GAMES Magazine &quot;Best New Family Card Game&quot; award 2010.<br/><br/>Description from BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>&quot;It's time to hit the waves once again for a round of nautical exploration. The title comes from Amerigo Vespucci, and like that famed explorer, you must travel the world to search for goods. (Unlike him, you won't have a couple of continents named after you.) The farther you explore, the more likely you are to find goods of better value, but you have to make it back to market if you plan to sell anything, so don't wander off too far.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Cards have a picture of a boat, 1-3 captain's wheels, and 1 of 5 goods types (in differing rarities in the deck). Start with a hand of ... 4? On your turn, either sail (start a voyage if you're not on one, or continue the current voyage) or market (if you're not on a voyage).To sail further, play a card with the ship moving to the right -- #wheels adds to distance of voyage. May play out of your hand, or from your score pile (play face down; counts as 3 wheels). OR, explore: rotate last card clockwise, draw cards from deck (2 x distance sailed, hand limit 12). After exploring, must sail home; cards played count 2xwheels -- home when you've played at least the distance of the voyage. Upon arriving home, draw bonus cards (hand limit still applies):<br/>- if voyage was longest distance of all current voyages, 1 card.<br/>- if voyage was 7 wheels, 1 card; 8 wheels, 2; 9+ wheels, 3.<br/><br/>If Marketing, add cards from hand to display; max 12 cards on display. Sort by type of goods. OR, sell cards already on display: sell all possible. Rarest good (looking at all markets on table) worth 1 coin per card. Most popular worth 1 coin/2 cards. All others are common, and worth 1 coin/3 cards. If tied for rarest/popular, goods become common. Sold goods are flipped over to represent coins (added to your score pile) or discarded.<br/><br/>Game ends immediately if, after the first time through the draw deck, all players are at home at the same time; or the 2nd time through the draw deck. Make final sales, with all cards left in hand and on display worth 1 coin/4 cards.<br/><br/>Most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marvel Strike Teams puts players in the role of some of their favorite Marvel Universe heroes and villains. Two to five players face off in a classic battle of good versus evil. Everyone gets a character with a HeroClix combat dial to track their level and build points. One player is the villainous mastermind and is able to guide the direction of each encounter; the rest are the heroes who each control a single hero for the mission and must work together by combining their vast array of powers and abilities to complete various objectives, such as infiltrating an enemy warehouse or saving hostages.<br/><br/>Each hero is unique with individual play styles, giving players multiple options to play the way that best suits them. The environment also lends to the game play, putting obstacles in the way of players and granting them objects they can use as weapons. A wooden crate may block Captain America's path, but he can pick it up and hurl it at enemy Hydra soldiers. Players will quickly pick the role that best suits their team and lead the heroes to victory &mdash; or at least they hope so!<br/><br/>Aside from standalone missions, Marvel Strike Teams includes a campaign-based game in which the players can improve their heroes over the course of several missions. With randomly generated scenarios, multiple map tiles, and thousands of possible encounters, each mission will feel like a fresh experience!<br/><br/>Playable characters: Captain America, Iron Man, Quake, Agent May, Winter Soldier, Baron Strucker, Radioactive man, &quot;3 Hydra Soldiers&quot;<br/><br/>",

The different roles make the resources have different values, so Scheherazade prefers silks to weapons, but Sinbad values weapons more.<br/><br/>",

If you're not careful, not only will you get the weakest monsters, but you&rsquo;ll also get one of the nasty humans lurking around the tavern.<br/><br/>In Monster Inn, creature cards of varying value with monsters and humans are revealed in each round. Players want to hire the most powerful monsters and send the nasty little humans to their competitors. Each round players will bid on the cards with gold coins or gems. But the humans are always auctioned off first, and those who can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to bid any longer take the current pool of treasures and the card that is currently being bid on. Who will be the cleverest and fill their own dungeon with powerful monsters that will defeat the humanoid intruders?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Horse racing game released by Hasbro and NBC (Yes, the US Television company) in a format nearly identical to the 3M plastic &quot;wrap-around&quot; boards.<br/><br/>The Home Stretch is a horse racing game. The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an &quot;Ownership Card&quot; which shows the horse's name, stable and &quot;Speed&quot;. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an &quot;Advantage&quot; during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.<br/><br/>Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the &quot;Readout Machine&quot;. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray &quot;Odds Cards&quot; are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.<br/><br/>Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a &quot;Betting Slip&quot; and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.<br/><br/>To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the &quot;Diagonal Allowance&quot; for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.<br/><br/>Sometimes the spinner will indicate &quot;Advantage&quot;. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.<br/><br/>The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.<br/><br/>Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.<br/><br/>A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.<br/><br/>This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy). A very interesting game.<br/><br/>",

Most sections have been rewritten with the purpose of clarity.<br/><br/>The fourth edition was published in 2002 and as such was not a true fourth version of the rules more of a combining of the three separate editions. The fifth edition brings the publication up to today&rsquo;s high standards.<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s different or new, what have we done? Well the main thing we have done is to combined the last few years of work on the forum with the existing edition and to expand the scope of the concept which is Arcana.<br/><br/>The fifth edition will not come alone it now comes complete with a new Armies of Acrana website.<br/> The Book<br/><br/>First it&rsquo;s now all colour with a new foreword and introduction in which we expanded the background of Arcana to give it some extra meaning. Then the book is divided into sections, the first is the basics principles with a new learn to play section for those who are new to wargaming.<br/><br/>The second section contains all the turn sequences reworked to follow the actual turn sequence. Again some sections have been updated to follow what has been developed for the forum, especially the flying section.<br/><br/>The next section is &lsquo;To Battle&rsquo; - this has had a major reworking. We have added terrain generators, a new scenario - Attrition, tournament rules. In the army building section we have revamped the vehicle, war machine and creature creation parts all now carry example of how to make them and are much easier to read and use.<br/><br/>The spells have had little done to them other than some realigning by Thane.<br/><br/>The last section contains the army lists and templates. There are now 23 official army lists plus the monsters list.<br/><br/>",

Now they take turns distributing their finds to the four treasure spaces, but the growing stacks make the dwarves more and more nervous. Should they secure their share now and make a run for it? Some dwarves are greedy and hang back, and by doing so they might miss the right moment to leave, with another player stealing their favorite treasure from right under their nose. And if the worse comes to the worst, the cave orc will catch them!<br/><br/>Before leaving the cave in Mein Schatz (&quot;My Treasure&quot;), you need to decide on a treasure stack and a treasure type, so it's important to remember where the right treasures are. It's hard to keep track, but that stack in the top right corner contains quite a lot of pearl necklaces, right? And then you try to pick a good moment to leave. Usually it pays to wait as the treasure cache will only grow in the course of the game. But keep an eye on your fellow dwarves, and watch out for that cave orc!<br/><br/>",

The Necrohamster is quick to pick up with simple rules, but 15 unique summon creatures and varying award cards allow for depth and replayability.<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/>Deal each player 5 random cards from a communal deck of creature cards. Next reveal 3 random Title Cards from the 7 available title cards. These Title Cards provide bonus points and are claimed by the first person that meets their requirements. Randomise one player to receive the stating player card. You are now ready to start a game of The Necrohamster!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Each game turn (except the first turn) starts with the Draw Phase. During this phase every player draws 2 cards from a communal deck of cards to replenish their hand. Next is the Summon Phase. During this phase each player simultaneously selects one card from their hand to summon. Once every player has chosen, all cards are revealed. To pay for the cost of the card each player must discard cards from their hand equal to that card's summon cost. The summoned card then goes into that player's personal summon area. Once all players have summoned their creature cards, starting from the first player, each player resolves any card effects going in a clockwise player order.Once card effects have been resolved, players begin the next round, starting again with the Draw Phase.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>The game ends on the round in which any player has summoned their 8th creature card. Complete this round then add up all the points each player has accumulated. The player with the highest total is declared as the greatest Necrohamster in all the lands!<br/><br/>",

Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Robin Hood and his Merry Men are all part of a young man's rite of passage from childhood flights of fancy. Long the stuff of screen legend, Robin Hood now lives again in a game format for the entire family.<br/><br/>So come with us back to the greenwood in twelfth century England as our heroes Robin, Little john, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Allan A&rsquo; Dale scour the countryside with quarter staff and long bow rob the rich and save the poor from the oppressions of nobles and clergy. Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.<br/><br/>Play is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules. Yet, strategy is important. You can opt to stick to the relative safety of the woods and dine on the King's deer or don a disguise to sneak into Nottingham Castle to cudgel the Sheriff himself.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!<br/><br/>UNDO: Blood in the Gutter is one of three initial cases of the innovative new game series UNDO.

        "description": "Bomb Squad, a.k.a. ボムスカッド, is a co-operative mission-based game about bomb disposal. Working with limited information, players must pool their wits and resources to dismantle live bombs. Dismantling is carried out by finding pairs of code tiles with the same number. Aim to clear the missions without blowing yourselves up. All players share the victory or suffer defeat together. Work as a team towards victory!<br/><br/>In more detail, the game consists of numbered cards, with four copies each of 1-12 and with stars and bombs having decimal numbers, e.g., 3.1 and 6.5. You receive a hand of cards and place them on a rack facing yourself in numerical order. Standing cards are &quot;armed&quot;, and as cards are disarmed, you lay them sideways and reveal them to others. Some information is revealed initially, and on your turn, you can attempt a pair disarm, a self disarm, or a bomb dismantling.<br/><br/>For a pair disarm, point to a tile on another player's rack and declare what number or star it is. If you're correct and you have the matching item, both of them are disarmed. For a self disarm, you can reveal pairs of matching cards on your own rack if you know no other player has any. If all numbers and stars have been removed from your rack, you can then dismantle one bomb on your rack.)<br/><br/>What's more, you and your fellow professional bomb disposal specialists can work through a sequence of fifty missions, which are listed in a separate scenario book. If you wish, you can also just pick and play specific missions that you like. You won't be able to complete everything in one sitting, so gather your friends and meet up over multiple play sessions. The missions start off easy, but steadily grow harder.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player in New York Kings plays the role of a wiseguy who will participate in the most memorable night in the history of the mafia. The New York King's throne is vacant. Rather than collapsing into fights between families, each family will send his or her best wiseguy into the city and its suburbs to find out who has more moxie, and in turn which family will rise. Money talks in this world, so the only goal in this game is to prove your wiseguy's worth by making the most money you can in one night. In simpler game terms, the player with the most money at the end of the game will be the new King of New York.<br/><br/>The game board represents the connected districts of the city of Manhattan. During the game, missions will be available to different players. These mission smartphone cards show how many characters are necessary for its implementation, the location where the mission may be accepted and where it must be completed, whether or not it is a dangerous mission (NYPD watch!), and of course the amount of money you can make.<br/><br/>During your turn you will begin a phase of corruption. Each player secretly tries to buy the first position player AND the right to control the police. Then players pick &quot;resources&quot; cards, which will be used to generate events or increase movements. Next, each player moves his characters &mdash; his wiseguy and his henchmen &mdash; then plays the actions he choose. Players can accept a mission, complete a mission, provoke opposing characters, or try to recruit new henchmen.<br/><br/>Provocation is a kind of &quot;Texas Hold'em&quot; poker duel with die. You first bet, then throw three dice (the &quot;flop&quot;). Either one folds and loses his bet down or the provocation goes on until the shootout (fifth dice). Just like in poker, the weaker hand loses the pot and one of his characters.<br/><br/>When a character or characters are stopped by the police during a dangerous mission, these situations are also managed through die rolls.<br/><br/>",

Charles XII, King of Sweden, personally led an invasion deep into Tsar Peter the Great&rsquo;s realm. The Russians engaged in a successful defensive campaign which culminated in the epic battle of Poltava. As a result, Sweden&rsquo;s mastery of the north was forever smashed, and Russia emerged as a great European power.<br/><br/>In ON TO MOSCOW, one player controls the Swedish side; the other controls the Russian side. The objective is to gain control of as many Fortress cities as possible and destroy the enemy&rsquo;s military power. Each side has a number of military units and leaders with which to attack enemy forces and gain control of Fortresses. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation.<br/><br/>Players who want to learn the game quickly should just read the GENERAL RULE beneath each major rules section, and then follow the specific procedures within each section as the need arises during the course of play.<br/><br/>",

Shedding the more traditional horror elements, we've designed a game that is fun, culturally informative, and enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>Taiwan Monsters Brawl is a light strategy board game for 2-4 players. Players control different monsters and challenge each other's monsters to combat. The outcome of the combat is decided by rolling dice and exploiting the monster's Ultimate Power according to the runes available on the monster board, in combination with the spell cards.<br/><br/>Each round, the player can challenge another player's monster to a duel. The winner is determined by rolling challenge dice, with the winner receiving victory points (VPs). Spell cards can be used to enhance the power of the monsters to receive an advantage during the duels. The monster with the most VPs will be the most monstrous of them all.<br/><br/>",

The game is based on the books, not on the movies, so many things are different to what Vampire-fans are used to (Dracula CAN move during the day for example, although it tires him). The game takes two forms: a two player game and a simplified roleplaying game.  A game master is helpful, but optional.<br/><br/>",

At your turn you can tip one of your cubes to the next square of the board. This way your cubes change facing as they move on the board.<br/><br/>When your cube ends its movement on a square beside an enemy cube there is a confrontation. Water quenches fire, fire burns wood and wood floats on water.<br/><br/>If your cube is victorious you take a victory tile. The first player with 6 tiles wins the game. If your cube is on the same side as an adjacent cube you get to play again.<br/><br/>The difficulty of the game is  to keep track of the always changing cubes on the board.<br/><br/>Solo play and 2 vs 2 play are also available in the base game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Originally named Tangion (a contraction for Tangent+Tension), the game involves two perpendicular winning conditions that can tie players&acute; brains in knots.

Player 'Black' takes all the black rings.<br/><br/>Starting with 'White' players alternate turns 'claiming' a counter by placing a ring of their colour on it. The pie rule is enabled.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player either forms a row of at least 4 consecutive rings of his colour (orthogonal or diagonal) or has claimed 4 counters of the same colour. That player wins the game.<br/><br/>Advanced version:<br/><br/>Arrange 49 counters in 7 colours (7 each) according to the figure:<br/><br/>1234567<br/>6712345<br/>4567123<br/>2345671<br/>7123456<br/>5671234<br/>3456712<br/><br/>Same rules apply, but a player wins by making a line of 5 or claiming 5 counters of the same colour.

Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included. Will you reach the pole and return ahead of Peary, or end up icebound and abandoned like Franklin?<br/><br/>It's also possible to lose your ship and be forced to try riding home on an iceberg!<br/><br/>",

It can best be described as a combination of Scrabble and Scattergories, but unlike Scrabble, you don&rsquo;t need a crazy vocabulary to win, unlike Scattergories there&rsquo;s no ambiguity, and unlike most word games, the &ldquo;smartest&rdquo; player doesn&rsquo;t always win.<br/><br/>A &quot;snippet&quot; is a short sequence of letters that can be found as a whole within one or more words. For example, the snippet IPP can be found in the words SNIPPETS, QUIPPED, and HIPPIE but not in SHIPSHAPE, PIPE, or HOPPING.<br/><br/>Players have 60 seconds to write down as many words as they can think of that contain each round's snippet. Anything goes! Dictionary words, people names, place names, brand names, fictional things, technical terms, slang, acronyms, abbreviations, contractions, hyphenations, non-english words, the snippet itself, and even plurals and alternate verb tenses are all allowed!<br/><br/>When time's up, players compare answers, earning points for unique words and fun bonuses. The player with the most points wins the round and the first to 3 rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>With its unique &quot;anything goes&quot; rule, Snippets isn't like most word games, requiring more of a creative mind than a large vocabulary. And with only 60 seconds to think, everyone&rsquo;s answers will be equally hilarious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Primate Fear is set in the same world as Gigantoskop's Spank the Monkey and is compatible with that game and its expansions, but this time when you start monkeying around in a junkyard, you'll find it a much darker experience as this junkyard was built on an old haunted cemetery.<br/><br/>As in Spank the Monkey, players scrounge around trying to find junk to build towers and locate parts for reinforcements to make the towers stronger, but they're not trying to reach the monkey and spank it this time. Oh, no. On the contrary, they are trying to get as far away from it as possible because this monkey is not a mischievous nuisance but rather a reanimated zombie monstrosity of an ape. Once the players have stumbled over all the monkey parts and the monkey awakes, it will climb after the players, eating the brains of the ones it catches until only one player remains &ndash; the winner.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player draws 1-2 cards, then plays at most one Junk card to start or continue building his tower and at most one Reinforcement card to strengthen his highest Junk card. He can also play one or more Attack cards on opponents to try to demolish their towers, lowering them within reach of Frankenmonkey. Players can use Defense cards to try to ward off attacks, with the active player rolling a die to see whether an attack succeeds. If it does, that player's tower might further crumble as the junk collapses on top of other junk.<br/><br/>Each time a player uses a card with a monkey claw on it, a new part is added to Frankenmonkey on the assembly board; if the monkey is complete, then the claw raises the monkey up one level on the height board. At the end of each player's turn, the monkey (if still complete) rises one level, eliminating players at that same height.<br/><br/>Players can use Primate Fear cards with Spank the Monkey rules and vice versa, or they can combine the games, with the goal being to spank the monkey before anyone else while still having your brain intact.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/><br/>    Spank the Monkey<br/><br/><br/>",

The German players has six different sets of victory goals, depending on the orders from the HQ: the Allied does not know which one is in use and has to plan the invasion accordingly. German reinforcements are also affected by the battle plan used.<br/><br/>Rules are quite standard for SPI wargames, with units able to 'break down' into their component formations. The game goes on smoothly and ends in a reasonable time.<br/><br/>At least four editions exist: the original 'Test Series' edition, with the most primitive components and rules; the 'Simulation Games' edition, with die-cut counters, heavier cardstock for the map, and cleaned up rules; the SPUK edition, printed in the UK under licence with different colours; and a later more colourful edition.<br/><br/>",

If one or more players guess correctly, they score points; if no one was correct, then the players who are only one off score; if no one was one off, then the players who were two off score; and so on. The first player to score ten points wins.<br/><br/>As with Privacy: Scharf wie Chili, released in 2010 by AMIGO Spiel, Privacy No Limit features claims aimed an older audience, such as &quot;I've farted while making love&quot;, &quot;I've lied to my boss to get a co-worker in trouble&quot; and &quot;To survive, I would be willing to eat human flesh&quot;.<br/><br/>Privacy No Limit includes 420 questions and 12 envelopes that are placed into the voting box secretly so that no one will learn of your lying, farting cannibalistic tendencies.<br/><br/>",

Dictionary Dabble is played exactly like Balderdash (players make up definitions to words and try to guess the real one).  The scoring is a little different.  In addition to scoring a point for guessing the correct definition and a point for each person who votes for your contrived definition, you also can score a bonus point if your pawn is on a space that matches the symbol on the word card that is drawn (provided you guess the correct definition).<br/><br/>One thing it has going for it over Balderdash: the movers are little miniature &quot;Thinker&quot; sculptures!<br/><br/>",

The card deck consists of 72 cards with each card having a number (1-6), a letter (one of six, which spell out &quot;fusion&quot;), and a color on that letter (one of six). Three rule cards are placed face-up, with one card from the deck placed next to each rule to start a pile.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are dealt evenly among the players, and each player draws the top three cards in hand. Then they simultaneously play cards from their hands onto the three piles, following the rules for play and refilling their hands to three cards whenever they desire. The rules for playing:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;=&quot; &ndash; The card being played must match the color or letter of the card being covered.<br/>     &quot;+1/-1&quot; &ndash; The number on the card being played must be one higher or one lower than the card being covered.<br/>     &quot;&ne;&quot; &ndash; The card being played cannot match the number, color or letter of the card being covered.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to run out of cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In under three hours, players will carefully balance their faction's military and economy as they compete to be the first to reach the top of the victory point ladder.<br/><br/>Rome is the &quot;governor&quot; of the Ancient World, with an empire that lasted over 700 years from its development under the republic through the decline of the empire. Carthage, the jewel of North Africa in the 3rd century BCE, faced the might of Rome under Hannibal until defeated during the Second Punic War of 218BCE to 202BCE. Greece is the intellectual centre of invention in the Ancient World, and became a great empire under Alexander the Great. The Barbarian Tribes comprised over fifty tribes ranging from the Lusitanians of Spain in the West, through the Averni of Gaul, to the Brigantes of Britannia, to the Belgae, to the Alamanii Germanic tribes, and on to the horse-based Sarmatians in the East.<br/><br/>",

They could train dragons, search for treasures, sail on the Nile, all this for a library fee of a few cents.<br/><br/>One day an inventor came to make experiments with the books: Mr. Mean did awful destruction with his projector blade. In the damaged books the continuity of the story was broken and the adventurers had trapped by them and couldn&rsquo;t return to reality.<br/><br/>Your mission is to collect all parts of the destroyed books to set the adventurers free. You also have to disarm those projector blades that Mr. Mean activates one by one in the library to save the building from collapsing by the devastating magical power. The mission can be successful only if you all return to your headquarters without any harm. Every member of your team has a special talent which can help you during the game and if you use these talents skillfully, and in coordination, with each other, your mission will be successful!<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game deck contains 6 monsters of each species with values from 1 to 6. The game deck is shuffled and each player begins the game with a hand of monsters (of his/her assigned species or not!). In each turn a player must place a monster card in an empty space adjacent to a card already on the table. The monster that has come into play is known as the Protagonist Monster. The Protagonist Monster ALWAYS interacts with orthogonally adjacent monsters (not diagonally) with values of EXACTLY 1 POINT LESS. The Protagonist Monster interacts in the following way:<br/><br/>with a monster of a DIFFERENT SPECIES, the Protagonist Monster moves in front of it (place card on top), stealing the close-up shot.<br/><br/>with a monster of the SAME SPECIES, the monster is eclipsed by the impeccable performance of the Protagonist Monster and moves behind it (place card/s under it) dragging with it any cards it may have under.<br/><br/>To win the game your monsters must receive the most close-up shots in the scenes of MONSTArgh!, so keep your monsters in the foreground and eclipse your rivals'.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OTLO Stones is an intense brain teaser where up to four players compete to reproduce patterns using two layers of tiles. OTLO Stones challenges your logical skills with multiple levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>Each player is equipped with a set of six two-sided tiles with gemstones. Each of these tiles also features one or two holes, providing interesting options when attempting to recreate a pattern of gemstones on a challenge card. The tiles are arranged in two layers, allowing symbols on the bottom-layer tiles to be visible through the holes in the top-layer tiles.<br/><br/>The game includes 60 challenge cards that are divided into three levels of difficulty. Each card awards points based on its level, with level three cards granting three points. At the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled, and piles of four random face-up cards are placed in the center of the table&mdash;one pile for each player. All players can solve any of the topmost cards in each pile simultaneously.<br/><br/>The game progresses as players strive to solve the available challenge cards and accumulate points. To win, players must attain a higher score than their opponents.<br/><br/>OTLO Stones also offers solutions for all the challenge cards, ensuring that players can refer to them if needed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is primarily a solitaire game. In actuality, only one side had the initiative at a given time. The Japanese struck first and occupied much of the area, but after the Solomons, were unable to continue the offensive. Then the Allies, after the disastrous start, launched their offensive of reconquest and the capitulation of Japan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "8 Bit Attack is a game of manic co-operative battle, inspired by the old side-scrolling console games we all loved. Each player controls a gallant 8-bit hero who, with his friends, has to take out a series of minibosses. You must power-up your heroes until they&rsquo;re tough enough to take on the final boss &ndash; none other than Cthulhu himself! Every game is focused directly on tactical boss fights and hero advancement! <br/> Both heroes and enemies are drawn from multiple universes &ndash; the realms of Myth, Demons, Cultists, and Aliens. Fight foes ranging from shoggoths to cacodemons to gnomes to cosmic clouds.  Wield potions, magical runes, lasers, and super-powers. You&rsquo;ll need to apply both tactics and strategy as you work with your friends to defeat these fearsome foes.<br/>Every game is a completely different contest, with a huge range of heroes to choose from &ndash; some are tough tank-like bricks. Others are healers, archers, sneaky spies, or magicians. Find heroes that fit your personality, or mix it up.  Watch for expansion packs, which add scores more heroes, minions, and enemy bosses to the mix.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game uses 2 22x34 inch maps with 200 yards to the hex along with 940 counters representing individual regiments and artillery batteries along with all the leaders down to the divisional level.  The map covers quite a bit of the area around Gettysburg giving players plenty of room to maneuver.  While the game is at nearly the same level as SPI&rsquo;s Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game, it does move more quickly due to somewhat more streamlined rules as well as an initiative system that randomizes who&rsquo;s going to move next and how long a turn will last.  There is even a random events chart that occasional allows a player to move and enemy unit or launch a free counter-attack.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&ldquo;The sequence of play is move-and-shoot, but initiative rules and a variable number of turns per day keep both players guessing.  The initiative rules help him who helps himself; once you gain an advantage, it&rsquo;s in your best interest to keep the pressure on.  Combat stresses unit morale, but can turn bloody if both units stand and fight.  All-out charges can clear ground fast, but at the cost of much higher casualties.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>",

For the Government player, his PI is also a measure of the stability of the political regime. PIs are measured in Political Points (PP) and recorded on the Record Track. PIs change constantly during the course of the game depending on events and who controls various territory. The highest level is 99, and the lowest is 0.

Your job as urban planners is to strike a balance between serving diverse public interests, and managing ten-story tall monsters who are committed to leaving their marks on Monster City.<br/><br/>Monster City Planners is a deeply strategic game with drafting, dual use cards, and hidden goal selection. Players start each round by choosing their hand of cards through a draft. Each card has two uses: 1) a monster action that changes the city plan, and 2) a unique scoring criteria for earning points. But you can only use each card for one of its two purposes. After the draft, players take turns constructing and demolishing buildings until both players yield. They then score points based on the unused cards that remain in their hand, and how well those cards' scoring criteria are reflected in the final city plan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The French town of Loos (Lōs) was the British contribution to a massive Allied offensive on the Western Front in the Fall of 1915. Masterminded by the French General-in-Chief Joffre, the offensive was intended both to draw German strength away from the reeling Russians and to pinch out the German salient (&ldquo;the Noyon Bulge&rdquo;) aimed at Paris. Launched with limited artillery support and using several raw New Army divisions, the ostensible aim of the British attack was to seize the German rail lines behind the front, but in reality was a diversion for the main French offensive in Champagne. The British player, with a massive numerical superiority and heavy artillery support, must progress quickly. Powerful German reserves are nearby,and the battle becomes a race between the British advance and the German reaction.<br/><br/>Loos uses a modification of the popular Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. At Loos, no one moved faster than a man on foot, and fire support was clumsy, unreliable, and inflexible. Thus the strength of that support is variable and serves as a precursor to combat rather than an enhancement of it. Exploitation is made only by units set aside for the purpose; they must be deployed behind (under) fighting units, and their subsequent movement is randomized.<br/><br/>The fighting is attritional. The only way to avoid a stalemate is to mass troops and hammer away at an enemy sector until it breaks. Neither side has the forces to attack all along the line, so the location and direction of the attacks must be selected carefully. The player who makes the better choices will emerge the victor.<br/><br/>",

The Hypnos set is designed by Pablo C&eacute;spedes and Victor Hugo Cisternas, authors of Tesoros del Rey Pirata, and illustrated by Celeste Carvajal.<br/><br/>Just before bedtime, as you are on the border of dreamland, a light surprises you from the corner of your bedroom.  Colorful clouds form on the ceiling and slowly form shapes before your eyes.  Not understanding how or why, you&rsquo;ve found yourself in the dreamlike world of Hypnos.  Find your way out!  To do so, sharpen your wits, patience and powers of observation.<br/><br/>The Mazescape saga introduces a completely unique concept that fans of logic and puzzles will love.  In this original game from Devir, you will place a map on the table and look for the compass rose as the starting point of the maze.  Using the wooden styles that comes with the game, you&rsquo;ll trace the white pathways, maintaining contact with the maze at all times, and you&rsquo;ll open and close sections of the map while looking for the exit point of the Impossible Triangle.  Pass under bridges, climb staircases, and keep your head from spinning until the exit point takes you to the next scenario.<br/><br/>Each Mazescape box contains seven different challenges to face.  The first maze is a relatively accessible challenge, and little by little the mazes become increasingly difficult until the final elegant explosion of pathways, which can only be untangled by the sharpest minds.<br/><br/>Moreover, each map includes a series of secondary challenges that allow you to travel through a second time, giving each set of maps a high degree of re-playability.  Look for all of the hidden treasures in the seven maps.  And the portable format is easy to play anywhere; all you need is a place to set the map and the stylus to start your journey.

The one with the highest strenght, wins and puts all the cards in his treasure.<br/>If a player cannot play the same color, he has to play another color and will always lose unless the color played is the moira, the dominant color choosen at the beginning of the game by one of the players.<br/><br/>In the version &ldquo;Triumph of Heroes&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll use heroes as Hector, Aeneas, Jason and Perseus to conquer more golden apples than your opponents. Cards are placed in front of the players in ten 3-card stacks. Only the first card of each stack is visible. When it's played, the card below can be revealed.<br/><br/>In the version &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Challenge&rdquo;  deities from the Olympus will join the fight, such as titans, muses and orrible monsters with particular skills. In this version, indeed, each player can activate abilities of 30 special cards by eliminating from the treasure a number of golden apples. These abilities can change the game, since their effects are very strong.<br/>Moreover, each player has some divinity cards in his hand.

You can mess with your opponents' lines to give yourself the best advantage. At the end of the round, the player with the most points wins.

The game lasts five workdays (i.e., five rounds), and whoever has the lowest score once the weekend arrives wins.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 86 cards, with two cards each numbered 1-10 in four suits, along with three 11s, two 12s, and one 13. Each player starts with a hand of thirteen cards. The leader of the round plays a combination of 1-5 cards, then each subsequent player can play the same number of cards but of a higher value or pass. Once all but one person has passed, the cards are cleared from the table, then the last player to play leads something else.<br/><br/>Once per round, when you pass, you can rage, placing your rage card on a card that's currently on the table. When these cards are cleared, you can place the claimed card in your hand.<br/><br/>Note that a &quot;Rainbow Bomb&quot; &mdash; four consecutive cards with each suit represented &mdash; can be played on your turn no matter what's currently being played, and this can be beaten only by a higher Rainbow Bomb.<br/><br/>When one played voids their hand, the round ends. Everyone with cards in hand then scores 1-3 points per card based on how many they have, then you shuffle for a new round unless the weekend is here.<br/><br/>",

The surprise attack was executed as planning by two Panzer groups, commanded by Colonel Generals Hoth and Guderian. The Soviet commander of the Western Front forces, General Pavlov, was taken completely by surprise, and, by order of the Soviet Supreme Command, dispatched his mobile forces directly into the German pincers. Most of the Soviet forces, including the mobile reserves, were thrown into disarray by the German first strike and were eliminated piecemeal.<br/><br/>On June 28 the Germans closed their first major pocket of the war in the east. It extended from Belostok (Bialystok) to Minsk. 287,000 Soviet troops surrendered in this pocket, and in addition 2585 tanks and 1449 guns were captured. By July 3 the German forces had swept Belorussia of Soviet resistance with the single exception of the garrison at the fortress at Brest. From there they drove on to their next objectives of Smolensk and the Dnieper River, and from there towards Moscow.<br/><br/>Army Group Center is a two player game in which one player controls the German forces, the other the Soviet.<br/><br/>The game is presented in three separate scenarios, the first historical, the second and third hypothetical. The historical scenario is largely a one-sided affair and should be played by those wishing to glean the historical lessons of the German blitzkrieg campaign. For those wishing more balanced play, the second and third scenarios are recommended in which a hypothetical situation is postulated where the Soviets were aware of the German invasion plans and had prepared accordingly.<br/><br/>Army Group Center was published by 3W in 1993. The Japanese edition is published by Masahiro Yamazaki with improved components; both of counters and game-map.

There are 5-Scenarios plus the Campaign game. These are: Campaign Game~begins-Nov. 1940 to Dec.1943; 1.Battleaxe-June 1941; 2.Crusader-Nov.1941; 3.Gazala-May 1942; 4.El Alamein-Oct.1942 with Operation TORCH also taking place; &amp; 5.Italian East African Expansion which can be combined with the entire Campaign. The I.E.A. map uses a slightly smaller map scale but is still fully compatible. Any of the Scenarios can begin and then be played until Dec.1943, if players prefer.<br/><br/>NOTE: the Campaign game can take anywhere from 1-7 Hours to complete, while this can even be combined with the previously released E.o.t.A. series. Complexity is considered to be 'Low' while Solotaire play is rated as 'High' in suitabiltiy.<br/><br/>",

Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, red/blue, square/circle, one/two items, and with/without cross.  Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!<br/><br/>",

To do it, players have to stick one hand on a card with the biggest number preferably.<br/><br/>But do not play too fast and take time to look at the card which you want to stick because you will have to answer a question about it. Do you remember how many tentacles there was on your card? Do you remember the color of every Qwark? Yes&nbsp;? You won your card, congratulations. No&nbsp;? Next time, try to be more attentive. ;-)<br/><br/>There is 48 different Qwarks: with several eyes, with or without tentacles, which are sad or joyful and of 6 different colors.<br/><br/>Quickly play but not too much. Use your memory and remain concentrated until  is in your turn to answer the question.<br/><br/>",

Each player finds themselves abusing their power, and their friends, as they try to take a dominant position, and win the game.<br/><br/>Addictive Alchemy is a deck destruction, or deck shaping game, where players drink potions a little too quickly, and have to manage their potions, and the side effects that come with them.<br/><br/>Players start the game with the same deck of cards (potions), and on their turn they will each drink 2 potions. However, those potions mix in their stomach or &quot;system&quot;, and as a result at the start of their next turn they will have a side effect! To make matters trickier their foes can alter their side effects turning something that was intended to be helpful into something harmful, and unexpected.<br/><br/>",

Using fluid and dynamic systems for integrating the fierce combat and rapid movements of the companies and battalions contesting the beaches, cliffs, swamps and bocage bordering the rough North Sea coast, players will find the easy rules to offer rich puzzles and surprising opportunities on the cross-map march to victory.<br/><br/>Bernard Law Montgomery led the Allied landings on the beaches closest to Germany, with the ambitious goal of moving inland and reaching the vital city of Caen within a day or two (dubbed &quot;Operation Neptune&quot;). But the German 716th Division, support by elements of the 21st Panzer Division, slowed the British advance down during these critical first few days and ultimately kept &lsquo;Monty&rsquo; out of Caen until, after Allied offensives in June, July, and August, they cleared the area once and for all.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>- Two complete games!<br/>- One 4-page, color  Standard Rules booklet<br/>- 80 color, 2-sided die-cut 1/2&quot; mounted pieces<br/>- 28 round 5/8&quot; counters<br/>- Two 11&quot; x 17&quot; color game maps with tables<br/>- Illustrated Examples of Play, Exclusive and Optional Game Rules<br/>- Part of a 5 game series!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 company to regiment; each hex is 1 kilometer, and each turn is about 4.5 hours.<br/><br/>",

BE KING...or BREAK OUT!<br/><br/>Take on rivals Solo or in 2 player Co-op Teams in this SANDBOX PRISON BRAWLER for 2 to 8 players. Take turns playing unique feral Convicts from their 1st day behind bars. Commit crimes to raise your Reputation to KINGPIN status or plan the perfect ESCAPE to win!<br/><br/>2 WAYS TO WIN:<br/><br/>1- With REPUTATION points earned by committing crimes: raise your reputation to Kingpin rank <br/>   before your rivals do or be the one with the most points after the Riot (the last Event card!) <br/>   OR...<br/>2- Be the first to ESCAPE.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Convicts start with unique Cunning and Strength levels, 2 specific skills to unlock, a weapon of choice to acquire, 3 Carry Item slots and the capability to go Primal to rage-boost stats. Strength is for attacks, Cunning for theft and corruption, both for escaping and recruiting Gangsters. Commit crimes and succeed at the above to raise your Reputation and gain ranks and perks. But fail, then lose REP!<br/><br/>Each day in prison has 5 rounds. A Convict has 5 Actions to spend per round. Rounds are dynamic: Guards change position after a dice-roll, altering options, Contraband is distributed in cells and Events come into play. Then, lockdown for the night. All in cell! Gain REP from recruited Gangsters still alive, lose REP or not fighting rivals that taunted you with Bitch coins. Then choose how to upgrade your convict with a read and/or workout. A new day begins!<br/><br/>On your turn, pick from your Cell Stash what Contraband your Convict pockets as hidden Carry Items. Then, move him from his cell passed Gangster filled cellblocks, prowling rivals and guarded rooms, while managing spent Actions. Choose to spend more Actions by upgrading your Convict&rsquo;s Strength or Cunning with a workout in the Courtyard, game of chess and more. Corrupt Guards, recruit Gangsters etc.<br/><br/>Trade Contraband on the Black Market for improvised Weapons, Escape tools, Armor, Upgrades, nasty Traps and more! Keep traded items hidden and your rivals guessing. Is it a toothbrush shank, an Escape tool...Need to attack or steal to find out! Planning a breakout? Get the Tools matching your Escape Card then secure them. Added to your Strength and Cunning, they improve your odds.<br/><br/>Preyed upon? End your turn next to a Guard for protection, and pray he won&rsquo;t move. Or better! Corrupt a Guard aided by Contraband bribes like booze, pills and porn. Owning Guards grants you access to restricted areas and no-cost Actions while leaving rivals unprotected. Take control of the board!<br/><br/>The more the bloodier! In advanced mode, hire skill-specific Gangsters to do your dirty work, break bones in riots, steal or gang up on rivals. These Thieves, Brawlers, Pushers and Hookers will pimp up your Reputation too. So use them to complete Crime Assignments such as Fight Clubs, Cartels, Bordellos etc. It will boost your rank in the race to be crowned KING.<br/>  <br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

If there is an even number of balls in the black cup, the effect of the black cup is cancelled.

Unlike Code 777 there are no colors involved just the 6 letters A, B,C,D,E &amp; G. (Note: there even exists a version with number cards: What's That on My Head?) <br/>On your turn you ask a question aloud and then answer it.  The questions involve the letters you can see on your opponent's heads, like sums, odds vs. evens, etc.  The questions on each card are ranked in difficulty so you can vary the difficulty depending on the participants.<br/><br/>Using the answers to the question you race to deduce your letter.  If you get it wrong you keep the three letters, but lose 4 points.  If you get it right you get 10 points and 3 new letters on your head.

However, there are bloodthirsty pirates waiting to plunder the ships. The Governor has decided to send the ships out in small groups hoping they can make it past the pirates undetected. However, the pirates have lookouts keeping a vigilant watch on the harbor.<br/><br/>The game components consists of: one (1) lookout card, one (1) governor card, thirty (30) treasure fleet ship cards (valued from 6-22), two (2) cursed ships, sixty (60) cannon cards (12 for each player) valued from one to four, five (5) storm cards (1 for each player), five (5) boarding party cards and five (5) pirate captain cards.<br/><br/>The standard game is played in four rounds, called sailings. Each sailing consists of three volleys. Before each sailing four ships are drawn from the &quot;Treasure Fleet&quot; stack, and placed face up on the table. (In a five player game the game lasts for five rounds and five ships are drawn.) Each player chooses three cards from their hand to commit to fire on any of the four ships. The player(s) not directly to the right or the left of the lookout get to commit four cards but can only play three of the four during that sailing. Special cards such as the Boarding Party (a kind of trump) and the Storm (a kind of &quot;negation&quot; play) can selected as well as cannon fire cards.<br/><br/>After each volley the lookout passes clockwise to the next player. After three volleys the pirate captain with the most cannon fire on a ship wins that ship and its treasure points. Ships with tied cannon fire escape during the volley as well as ships not fired upon.<br/><br/>After the final such sailing the governor is captured and ransomed, by the player with the highest valued card left in their hand. The winner is the pirate captain with the highest total treasure points.<br/><br/>Microbadge<br/><br/> Buy It<br/><br/>",

Chief Sitting Bull gathered a force, by the Little Big Horn river, just north of the Montana-Wyoming border, ready to strike. Three columns of US Cavalry were dispatched to subdue the Indians.<br/><br/>Now you can re-live this historic battle, and you can plan your own strategy. Can you find a way to get Custer, or at least his flag, clear of the battlefield?<br/><br/>This game is based on the well known battle of Little Big Horn, where some united Native Americans won against General Custer's 7th cavalry. A simple game combining luck and strategy with different mechanics for different units.<br/><br/>Movements and terrain effects are similar to wargames. Horses move faster than foot units and wearing a gun enables some ranged attacks.<br/><br/>Winning conditions are different for the 2 opponents: Custer's men can either eliminate all Native American riders or cross the Little Big Horn River and try to reach one of 2 winning spaces on the board, the Native Americans must eliminate general Custer and his 2 officers.<br/><br/>It was published by Rojas y Malaret in Spain, as the 3rd game in the GBM series at the end of 1952. The game was licenced and published by Hausser (Germany) in 1963. Later, the Waddingtons (UK) version in 1964 and the Capi&eacute;pa (France) version in 1965 could be non-authorized versions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new collectible card game brought to us from BANDAI JAP. English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliott, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.<br/><br/>There are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.<br/><br/>The game is based around a &quot;core&quot; concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 &quot;core&quot; in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through &quot;crushing&quot; your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.<br/><br/>As players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.<br/><br/>The game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a &quot;poker&quot; feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away &quot;tells&quot; and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)<br/><br/>Although the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your &quot;core&quot; production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.<br/><br/>Battle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.<br/><br/>BANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>For more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for &quot;Bandai CG&quot;.<br/><br/>On behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! <br/>-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Big Push covers the gigantic battle of the Somme in summer-fall of 1916. Rivaling Verdun in ferocity, scale and casualties, Somme was Britain's first real chance to open up the Western Front in World War I. French and British allies, wanting to take initiative away from Germany at Verdun, launched a large joint offensive at the Somme, where their fronts met. British generals called it the &quot;Big Push,&quot; to break the trenches and carry them to victory. Here was a campaign that brought little save the cultural annihilation of the participants. Europe never looked at war quite the same way after the Somme.<br/><br/>The British player controls the Allied forces (British and French), while the other player commands the defending German Army. It is also possible to have three players--French, British, and German. Each Game Turn represents one week. Map scale measures approximately 1142 yards per square (squares rather than hexes are used to prevent the easy outflanking of enemy units - something very hard to do in WW1). Ground units range in size from regiments to divisions. Each infantry strength point varies between 700 and 1500 men, depending on nationality and fighting effectiveness. Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force. Play begins with artillery fire, where the other player may throw in his counter battery fire to offset the barrages.

The detectives &mdash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert &mdash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.<br/><br/>Scotland Yard: Tokyo features the same gameplay as Scotland Yard, but with the detectives and Mr. X running around Tokyo instead of London. When only 1-3 detectives are on the board, an extra &quot;police&quot; figure is placed on the board that does not require tickets for movement.<br/><br/>Scotland Yard: Tokyo appears to have been produced in conjunction with the Japanese game retailer Sugorokuya.<br/><br/>",

Players draw cards and play them to rows, with hungry fish eating everything in front of it until it meets a like fish. A fish doesn't eat its like, and instead goes to the table as a fat fish. When a player has drawn 3 cards of a kind, it can take a fat fish from the table. When the round ends, players score for the most fish in their catch.<br/><br/>Reportedly a good, quick filler, with English and French rules in the box (only in the Abacus Edition, the SimplyFun Edition has only English rules).<br/><br/>",

The 300 counters and markers represent the historical units and incidents involved along with chits that determine initiative and order choice. These company sized units move using 180 meter hexes. The game is unique in that it captures the tension and high rate of casualties without ever casting a single die, relying more on planning and issuing orders as the active or reactive player. Each side will have a 30 card deck that is faction specific. The Devil Dogs of Belleau Wood has involved a great deal of research and play-testing, the result is an intense and satisfying game that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this play-doh modeling game, children and adults alike are invited to create little creatures. While creating, one attribute is more important than the rest, one that is seldom ascribed to adult monsters: beauty. This is definitely a matter of taste - and that's why the typical ideals of beauty don't count in this modeling competition - instead, they're ones that young players love. But before the children's creations can parade before the jury down the runway on the living room table, the fantastical creations must first be created over several game rounds. The requirements are set out on cards that define certain features. Little creators who do a particularly good job can collect extra points and increase the chances that their monster will be crowned &quot;Miss Monster&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Some say it&rsquo;s the best club in the world &mdash; but to get inside one must first get past the notoriously picky doorman. And this mein freund, is where you come into the picture! As one of the club&rsquo;s legendary bouncers, it&rsquo;s your job to foster the right mix. Choose between two game modes depending on if you like it quick and dirty or if an all-nighter is more your thing.<br/><br/>Bergnein is a fast and fun game that mixes strategy and luck, that both non-gamers and game night veterans can enjoy. With mechanics inspired by Guillotine but with a more culturally relevant theme, the game takes place in the line of the world&rsquo;s perhaps most notorious night club.<br/><br/>Players take turns as the bouncer, letting the right people in and sabotaging their opponents. Guest cards form a line in front of the Bouncer card, and they score between &ndash;2 and +5. Players are given Action Cards which manipulate the line order right before letting guests in, which is what makes the game interesting, dynamic &ndash; and fun! The player with the best guests (most points) when the line is empty, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

(A simple 2-player version also exists as Keezbord Duo.)<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to be the first pair to get all their pawns in their homes, just like Ludo and Pachisi. Instead of dice you play with playingcards.<br/>The first round everyone gets 5 playing cards. The second and third rounds everyone gets 4 cards. At the end of the third round all the cards are shuffled and then the second three rounds begin, until one pair has won the game.<br/><br/>If you don&rsquo;t have a King or Ace in your hand, the very first round, you must put your 5 cards aside and take 5 new ones. Repeat this until you have at least one of those cards.<br/><br/>When it&rsquo;s your turn you play a card in the middle and do what you have to do.<br/>To set a pawn on the starting position (the colored point in the color of your pawns) you have to put down a King or Ace.<br/>If you can play a card you have to do so, even if it&rsquo;s bad for you or your partner.<br/>If you can&rsquo;t play a card anymore you put down all your remaining cards in the middle. Your turns are over in this round.<br/><br/>If everyone has put down all of their cards, this round is over and another round can begin.<br/><br/>These are the actions:<br/><br/>Ace: put a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) on your starting space or a pawn 1 place ahead.<br/>King: put a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) on your (or your partner&rsquo;s) starting space.<br/>Queen: move a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) 12 spaces forward.<br/>Jack: swap a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) with one of the other players&rsquo; pawn.<br/>Seven: move 1 or 2 pawns (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) a total of seven spaces forward.<br/>Four: a pawn has to move 4 spaces backwards.<br/><br/>When a pawn is standing on its own colored space, this pawn may not be beaten, nor swapped with a Jack, nor be overtaken.<br/><br/>With any other card you have to go forward spaces as shown on the card. During the whole game you can beat other pawns if you land on them. The beaten pawn has to go back to its place at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>With 4 players you play with 1 deck of cards. With 6 players you play with 1.5 decks of cards.<br/><br/>_<br/>Shares many similarities with DOG and Partners.<br/><br/>",

The motorized division SS Das Reich and the 10th Panzer Division were ordered to detach themselves from the outer encirclement line around the forces of the Soviet Western Reserve Fronts and head for Dorochova.  That would halfway to Moscow. Resistance was not expected to be significant.  But already rushing in to block them were all the forces that Stavka could scrape together.  Several tank brigades rolled out of Moscow to slow the German advance.  Cadet schools marched off to throw themselves in the way of the oncoming panzers while from far across Siberia, trains rushed at full steam, all other traffic shunted out of their way, bearing Stavka's ace card, the veteran 32nd Rifle Division from Vladivostok.  Despite subsequent German claims that only mud preserved Moscow from their iron clutches, an examination of the fight for the one all-weather road from Warsaw to Moscow shows a much clearer picture of what really happened.  Here is a clash of titans, two crack German divisions facing one of the best rifle divisions in the Soviet Army.  If your experience from other wargames would lead you to believe tat the panzers will romp, you, like the Germans at Borodino, are in for a big eye-opening experience.<br/><br/>Based on the award winning Black Sea Black Death game system, Borodino '41 uses a map scale of 800 meters (one half mile) per hex, three or four impulses per daily turn, with infantry battalions and tanks and anti-tank guns by company (battery).<br/><br/>The units are played mostly face down, with dummies, to recreate the Fog of War. Combat involves fire, and assault, which are influenced by troop morale, terrain effects, armor support, engineers, and various other specialized units.<br/><br/>Included are some of the best troops of both sides, as well as Soviet reserve infantry, and tanks ranging from Pzkpfw IIIs and IVs, BT-7s, T-26s, T-34s, a few KV-1s, amphibious T-38s-even a T-28 Co without engines!<br/><br/>The game uses an updated version of the Black Sea Black Death system, with relatively little chrome and a high level of excitement. The impulse based game system keeps both players actively involved. Localized swings in initiative are common, and the situation presents many counterattack options for the Soviet player, even though he is on the operational defensive.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day<br/>Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 22-page Borodino '41 rules booklet<br/>Five Player Aid cards<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 hours<br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>",

Each animal you save is worth a number of protection points that you score at the end of the game. By collecting pairs of animals, your conservation efforts are rewarded with bonus points. The wildlife conservation specialist who has collected the most points wins.<br/><br/>Each round, a number of endangered animal cards are placed face up in the center of the table, within clear view of all players. After giving all players a moment to study the animals, the current Conservation Leader calls out: Ready, set, go! All players now start rolling their dice, rolling and rerolling as quickly as you want. If some of your just-rolled dice match the dice requirements of the endangered animal you are trying to rescue, you may set these aside while continuing to roll and reroll any remaining dice. At any point, if you have managed to collect all dice necessary to meet the dice requirements of one of the endangered animals, loudly call out &quot;Rescuing!&quot; After collecting the animal, the other players resume attempting to rescue one of the remaining endangered animals.<br/><br/>Each round, new cards will be drawn, presenting the players with new challenges and more animals to rescue. Most cards depict a dice requirement consisting of one black die and two or more white dice. However, a few endangered animals have special requirements that must be met.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Towers of the Sun is an abstract strategy game in which two to four players take on the role of mystical clans each coming from their own unique and beautiful regions. They&rsquo;ve lived in peace and harmony until a dangerous and mysterious mist begins to gradually cover their world, blocking out the sunlight. The clans must now compete to collect the remaining sunlight, and build majestic towers to escape the mist and reach towards the sun.<br/><br/>During the game players will build and navigate a changing, three-dimensional landscape. The playing field is limited and players will compete for the best positions, occasionally battling it out with their hand cards in a simple, yet mind-boggling duel of simultaneous reveal. As they navigate the board, players will collect sun crystals that other players have dropped. At the end of each round the sun shines upon a different tower presenting the players with additional sun crystals. Before a new round begins, players will score points based on which tower they stand upon and the crystals they&rsquo;ve collected so far.<br/><br/>The main mechanisms used in the game are its modular board (mutated by the players via tile placement), area control, hand management and deductive logic (for the card battles). Beyond the strategy of building and managing their tower tiles, players must also think ahead and not be too greedy because after the scoring phase of each round the leading player will have to exercise their generosity and care by providing charity to the lowest scoring player. This adds both rubber-banding and interactivity that makes every game tense until the last sun crystal has been claimed.<br/><br/>The game comes to end when all of the sunlight is gone. This happens naturally, with sun crystals being collected each round, but players can also force this to happen early by standing atop a tower of 8 tiles or more and essentially &ldquo;reaching the sun&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But this is not as easy as you thought, as well as the other apprentices and one or the other of the masters want to have this energy, too.<br/><br/>Magia Cum Laude is about a magical test. Each player takes the role of a magician that can interfere with the test event in the tower. He is doing this by playing movement cards with which he can move both, each apprentice, as well as the Master. Each magician would also like that the apprentices also fulfill a secret spell for them and, of course, every magician also has two favorite students, whom he'd like to complete their examination successfully.<br/><br/>The game ends either a magician succeeded in making his two students pass their test or the time has expired.

        "description": "The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.<br/><br/>The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).<br/><br/>The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:<br/><br/>1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.<br/><br/>Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #255<br/><br/>First Battle of Britain (1BoB) is a two-player wargame of intermediate complexity covering the 1917-18 German bomber offensive against England. The objective is to score more morale points than your opponent. Historically the bombing inflicted little real damage on British cities in general or industry in particular. The attacks' psychological impact, however, was enormous: the campaign demonstrated Britain was vulnerable to outside invaders for the first time in a millennium. Victory is therefore determined based on the German player's ability to panic the British populace.<br/><br/>Each air unit represents a flight or squadron of aircraft. Each hexagon represents five miles from side to opposite side. Each &quot;operational turn&quot; represents one month. Each &quot;flying turn&quot; represents 20 minutes of flying time.<br/><br/>1BoB has three scenarios. Scenario 1 covers the situation in 1917, with both sides racing to build up their airpower. Scenario 2 covers 1918, with both sides at full strength. Scenario 3 covers the entire campaign from 1917 through 1918. Players who want to get right into a head-to-head contest of strength in the skies over England are advised to begin with Scenario 2. Experienced players will need about four hours to finish one of the yearly scenarios, while the campaign game will take about eight hours to finish.<br/><br/>Units include bombers and fighters, both carrier and land based, as well as Zeppelins, Royal Navy seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers, anti-aircraft artillery, aerodromes, civil defense and early warning. German formations and aircraft types included in the large-size iconic counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Larry Hoffman, include the following: Albatross D-I, Fokker D-VII and Pfalz D-III fighters; the elite &quot;England&quot; and &quot;Kagohl 3&quot; bomber squadrons; along with plenty of Gotha and Riesen bombers. On the British side there are: Avro 504, Be-2, Be-12, Fe-2, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Pup and Se5A fighters; along with DH-4, Handley Page and Strutter bombers. All planes are rated for air-to-air combat, pursuit, bombardment and speed.<br/><br/>",

If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Chemical Overload, the current Master Alchemist is set to retire, but has been preparing for this by training his apprentices for years. Sure, the Academy of Alchemy has been pretty brutal so far, but the end of the road is near. The final exam is going to be rough, but it&rsquo;ll be worth it, if you manage to rise above your fellow students and win the title of Master Alchemist!<br/>At the end of the final exam, you&rsquo;ll be judged on the quality of your potions, which can be measured by how many Alchemy Points you&rsquo;ve managed to accrue. Do this before the lab fills up with too many toxic fumes and the exam is called to a halt.<br/><br/>You and your fellow students will start with the same basic chemicals and flasks. You&rsquo;ll be combining your chemicals with the flasks of the correct size to brew magical potions.<br/><br/>Each potion has its own effects and Alchemy Point values, and you&rsquo;ll be able to use those potion&rsquo;s effects throughout the game to help you gain more gold, alchemy points, more powerful chemicals, or even more powerful potions!<br/><br/>But some potions will also add to the amount of toxic fumes in the lab! There are several thresholds, that once passed, you&rsquo;ll have to draw a toxin card and deal with those effects. So you&rsquo;ll want to keep an eye on that track, because once the tracker hits the end of the meter, the test is over!<br/><br/>At the end of the final exam, the alchemist with the most Alchemy Points wins and is crowned the Master Alchemist!<br/><br/>Chemical Overload is a Deck Building game that has elements of tableau building as well. On your turn, you&rsquo;ll have a hand of cards. Any flask cards in your hand can be played to the table and remain there until used to brew a potion. There are also potions that can be played to the table for ongoing effects.<br/><br/>As a bit of a twist on a classic deck building game, when a player gains new cards, such as new chemicals or a newly brewed deck potion, those cards go right on top of their draw pile. Any flasks or table potions gained can be placed immediately in the players tableau area. Players will be able to decide what unused cards in their hand they want to keep at the end of the round and which they want to discard, all with an eye on the cards they know they&rsquo;ll be drawing next turn.<br/><br/>Chemical Overload is for 1-4 players and takes about 45-60 minutes to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Dawn of Empire: The Spanish American Naval War in the Atlantic, 1898&quot; is an uncomplicated wargame centered on the naval aspects of the Spanish-American War of 1898 in the Atlantic Ocean. The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.<br/><br/>It all really started in February of 1895 when Spain unilaterally suspended constitutional guarantees to Cuba and its population. This lead to open revolt on the island and serious retaliatory measures by the Spanish administration of Captain General Weyler, including concentration camps for non-combatants. This was too much for the American press, and as a result, the American public, and eventually U.S. pressure led to Weyler&rsquo;s removal, but not to a decrease in tensions between the US and Spain. And then, the Maine happened. On 15 February, 1898, well into the darkness of the night, the USS Maine, anchored in Havana Harbour to visible enforcement of U.S. interests on the island, blew up. 268 U,S. naval personnel were killed, about 2/3rd of the crew of the vessel. The American press exploded also. Headlines shouted &ldquo;Spanish Treachery&rdquo; and William Randolph Hearts newspapers stirred the pot of American anger vigorously. By late March a Naval Court Of Inquiry set down a judgment that the Maine was destroyed by an external explosion, pointing the finger by implication at the Spanish. Before the end of the following month, the United States would declare war on Spain.<br/><br/>The object of the game for the United States player is to control the sea areas around the US Atlantic coast and Caribbean Sea to prevent Spanish combatants from supporting their island holdings and to destroy the naval forces of Spain. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to disrupt United States sea control, retain sea control around the Spanish coastline for as long as possible, and destroy United States naval forces. Both players must deploy their naval resources into the sea areas on the map to earn victory points at the end of each turn for areas under their control, blockaded, and for opposing units destroyed.<br/><br/>Product information<br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 11 days per turn<br/>Map Scale: variable (area movement maps)<br/>Unit Scale: individual warships<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Finally, they move the shared surveyor piece along the built networks (paying other players for their share of the network they use), replacing the old power plant they end on with a new one. Each type of plant they replace gives a special ability or one-time benefit. The old plants are placed randomly on the board each game for a different puzzle every time.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player is rewarded with additional points based on the number of their plants in their largest network of connected cities.

        "description": "Like a typical Role Playing Game you have a character sheet, roll for saving throws, fight monsters and find treasure BUT when your character dies in the game you have to chug your drink in real life! It adds a real level of tension and excitement to the battles. Everything matters.<br/><br/>The battles are a series of one-on-one fights to the death. You either kill the monster earning coins and XP or your character dies and you must chug your drink! The cards act as the GM (So everyone can drink) and the heroes go through four themed quests in each game - each getting progressively difficult and more likely to drink. However as this is a light RPG and a light Drinking Game there is a one chug per quest maximum which prevents Drinking Quest from being a &quot;Pass out in 10 minutes&quot; kind of drinking game. Over the course of 2 or 3 hours, a typical game averages 2 or 3 chugs.<br/><br/>Whoever gets the most XP wins! Whoever loses had to chug the most so it's sort of like everybody wins.<br/><br/>",

The middle nine squares comprise a large box with four entrances.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pawns into the middle box (home).  In front of each entrance are fences that are set into the slots.<br/><br/>On your turn you may remove one of your fences and place it in any slot on the board.  You then roll two dice and move one of your pawns the total or two of your pawns, each the amount of one of the dice.  Once a pawn starts moving it may not change direction unless it hits a wall or fence.  Upon hitting either the pawn moves at a 90 degree angle from the obstacle.  If you land on an opposing piece by exact count you send it back to any of the start boxes.  If you roll doubles you may take one piece and jump an adjoining fence instead of a move.  To move a piece to home you need it to enter at one of the entrances by exact count.<br/><br/>",

It uses a DVD (required) to generate random events.<br/><br/>New additions include:<br/><br/>Players have Jobs that give individual advantages.<br/><br/>In addition to beach houses (houses) and resorts (hotels), properties can be developed with Casinos, Parks, Restaurants, and Piers.  The rent for the Casino is pure luck, but sometimes the owner has to pay out to the visitor.  Parks don't garner much rent, and what rent they gather is based on the weather, which can change with every Chance or Community Chest event (the Park's main benefit is its worth in Fortune Tokens at game end:  A Park on Gentle Sands is the equivalent of four million dollars cash at the end of the game).  Piers' rent depends not only on the weather, but also the presence or absence of a cruise ship, which is also affected by the card events.  Finally, Restaurants' rent is dependent upon the neighboring property improvements.  There are very few of these developments, though, so the competition for them can be fierce!<br/><br/>Although the basic board layout is the same as a standard Monopoly board, there are no Chance and Community Chest cards; when a player lands on one of those two spots, the DVD determines what happens.<br/><br/>One of the dice has a TV symbol in place of the 1-pip; when the TV is rolled, a News Broadcast is played on the DVD, which triggers a random event (much like Chance or Community Chest).<br/><br/>Players collect Fortune Tokens (and earn them at the end of the game through their cash and property holdings).  Play ends when one player goes bankrupt (or, alternately, whenever the players decide to stop).  The player with the most Fortune Tokens at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

This task is complicated by limited air supply, hazards, and fierce competition from other divers.<br/><br/>In the course of a turn, players balance using different air tanks to dive the ocean for treasure and return to the boat. The treasures are distributed in three depths, and their values are hidden underneath like the swimmers in the Survive! family of games. If a player fails to strike the correct balance to make it back to the boat, they will have to drop their treasure. Players can also use dolphins to either aid themselves or hinder other divers. A player must ask themselves if they will go for the deep chests and get left by the boat or if they will dive shallow and leave their buddies behind.<br/><br/>Secrets of the Deep is a mix of light strategy and calculation, yet there is some random chance and the cards add a bit of suspense. Although the game is a bit luck based, the moving ship keeps the game short and adds a &ldquo;press-your-luck&rdquo; appeal, and there are opportunities for some good tactical moves in the midst of all the chaos.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game board shows price charts/tables for 6 commodities 2 each of 3 different price levels.  Every player id dealt 10 commodity cards which change the price up or down of one or more of the commodities.  Every player starts with $10,000 and the winner is the player who has the most money after everyone has played all ten of their cards.<br/><br/>On a players turn they can: 1 - enter or close out a contract (going either long - betting the price will go up; or short - betting the price will go down; 2-  play a price movement card; 3 - roll the dice (usually either resulting in a commodity price movement or an action card draw (random event)).<br/><br/>The nature of the futures market is that you take positions based on whether you believe a commodity price will go up or down.  If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.<br/><br/>The game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).  There is still quite a bit of luck in the game,  with wild swings possible in some commodity prices, but you start with all the cards you will have and therefore have a good bit of information about some price swing possibilities - all you need is some help and a bit of help from the random events.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ENTER A WORLD OF VICTORIAN HORROR!<br/><br/>In 19th-century Rome, ancient crypts have been discovered beneath the Capuchin tombs. Take on the role of a dauntless explorer and plunder these catacombs of their secrets and spoils. Build your catacomb as you go, seeking finds and surviving horrors. End your story before the evils of the catacomb devour you all!<br/><br/>IN TENEBRIS LUX is a game for 1-4 players ages 13 and up, and can be played in about 45 minutes to an hour. <br/>Players rush to explore and resolve personal quests, called narratives, before their opponents can resolve their own, or the dark catacombs close in on them, ending the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, each broken into 3 Steps, with several Phases.<br/><br/>STEP 1: BREATHE The first Step adds Rooms to the Catacombs, by drawing them from a random pile. This builds up the game board out of playing card sized map pieces, or Rooms. This step also has a phase allowing Explorers to change their gear, referred to as Equipment or Finds&hellip; this is critical as these important items strengthen an Explorer so that they may deal with the dangers to come. Following phases allow an Explorer to adjust their card hand and play any non-room cards, if so desired.<br/><br/>STEP 2: SEEK The second step allows Explorers to actually explore and navigate through the Catacombs, or growing game board.  This dangerous course allows Explorers to search for new Finds and gear. More phases allow for adding extra Rooms, or cards, onto the board, moving around from card to card, and interacting with Room Cards in order to complete Naratives, or the game&rsquo;s objectives. This is the Phase where Explorers are most at risk of stumbling upon Horrors, as they are actively exploring the Catacombs.<br/><br/>STEP 3: SURVIVE In Step 3 Horrors, the game&rsquo;s many monsters in the dark, may attack your Explorer! Canny and brave Explorers may also strike out and attack each other in hopes of thwarting each other&rsquo;s progress in pursuit of personal Narratives. This phase resolves each combat one by one, and adjusts health and loot bodies.<br/><br/>Basic combat is simple. As the attacker, role one of the game&rsquo;s 14 included dice, and add it to your chosen Trait (Grit, Wit or Daring).  The Defender rolls one die and adds it to their same Trait, as they defend along the same lines as the incoming attack. Whichever result is highest wins.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combat Reference Card&rdquo; will take players through any extra steps, notably the way in which rooms impact the outcomes with rolls in combat. Each Horror and Explorer features an affinity with different Room types, this gives an edge or disadvantage in combat. Be careful of the Room you land on, it will have dire consequences!<br/><br/>After each Step is resolved a player finishes their turn and, moving clockwise, the next player goes, and so on. The game is ended when one player completes their randomly drawn Narrative objective, all Explorers are killed, or the Doom Counter (the Game&rsquo;s timer) has run its course, sending the catacombs crashing in on the hapless Explorers.<br/><br/>In Tenebris Lux comes with 13 Jumbo Explorer cards, 4 jumbo Combat and Turn Cycle reference cards, a full color rule book, 24 Horror cards, 18 Equipment cards, 21 Find cards, 12 Narrative cards, 32 Room cards, 3 Great Room Jumbo cards, one Jumbo Doom Counter card, 14 Dice, 13 Double Sided Explorer counters with 4 stands, and a counter for each Horror as well as many counters to help record progress for Narratives.<br/><br/>",

Will you take the risk?<br/><br/>Poisons is a bluff-based card game in which players have to carefully weight their risks to earn points. Each turn, players secretly add a card from their hand to each opponent's drink: an innocuous liquid or a deadly poison. When everyone has their cup filled, each player decides whether they will drink the contents of their cup.<br/><br/>Those who don't dare to sip the mixture gain only a minimal amount of points. Those who drink their cup score the number of points revealed at the beginning of their turn, but beware if there's a single dose of poison in the glass, they get nothing!<br/><br/>After four rounds of libations, the player with the most points win.

An invisible murderer is walking through the Town &mdash; merciless, weightless, and listless. No one knows how to protect themselves against it or who is to become its next victim. Seems like the Town is doomed &mdash; yet, those of its inhabitants who are privy to the mystery of its internal structure are still trying to fight back. Their efforts and hopes are guided by the knowledge and the will of three outstanding persons.<br/><br/>Tabletop Pathologic is an asymmetrical stealth action game intended for 2&ndash;4 players. Three of them become doctors trying to save the Town, while the fourth takes on the role of the Sand Plague. In order to complete missions the doctors have to risk themselves and their Entwined companions, but it&rsquo;s their only chance to win. The Plague remains unseen until it decides to strike&mdash;and then it strikes mercilessly.<br/><br/>Tabletop Pathologic is designed after Pathologic the videogame and strives to keep what made its predecessor special: the atmosphere a town in agony, the feeling of doom and the desperate hope of those who have nothing else left. It&rsquo;s precisely this hope that makes the three doctors pursuing the same goal become rivals. There&rsquo;s only one winner in the game, so contesting other players is unavoidable.<br/><br/>The board game is available as a reward for backing the remake of Pathologic the video game on Kickstarter. After its release, Tabletop Pathologic will be sold separately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the climax of the American Civil War the armies of the Confederacy were pressed back into their heartland as the rebellion tried desperately to sustain itself against Union forces. One of the most important campaigns occurred in southeastern Tennessee and Georgia, as Federal armies pressed toward the Confederacy&rsquo;s vital city of Atlanta, home to much of its remaining industry and gateway to the southern and western lands the Confederates still held. The campaign for and siege of this vital city broke the power of the Army of Tennessee, the key rebel command outside northern Virginia.<br/><br/>The theater of these operations is roughly bounded by the Tennessee River to the north, the Chattanooga area to the west, Atlanta to the south, and the Appalachian Mountains to the east. It was here where the formidable Union command team of Sherman and Thomas plied their trade, dooming the Confederacy's last chance to survive the Yankee onslaught. Here too the soldiers of the rebel Army of Tennessee fought stubbornly to defend their homes.<br/><br/>Look Away! The Fall of Atlanta is a strategic-operational simulation of the Army of Tennessee's campaigns in the Georgia theater of the Civil War. The game covers the fighting between Union and Confederate forces in Tennessee and northern Georgia during the spring and summer of 1864. Each hexagon represents an area roughly 2.6 miles in diameter (4 km). Each turn in the game represents about five days of real time. There are four scenarios dealing with the major engagements of the war plus a campaign game covering the entire period.<br/><br/>Look Away is the third game in John Prados' series on the American Civil War, following The Campaigns of Robert E. Lee and The Army of the Heartland: The Army of Tennessee's Campaigns, 1861-1863.<br/><br/>Look Away! Game scale:  about 2.6 miles (4 km) per hex; about 5 days/turn; according to ATO website and the Turn Track from the map artwork on the ATO website: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.atomagazine.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=55&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.atomagazine.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=55&amp</a>;category=6 .<br/><br/>Biafra! was included as a bonus in this issue.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not to be Confused With: Chainmail<br/><br/>The game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Axemen, Knights Charge, Chivalry Charge, and Strategic Movement, among others. Players may play each card for only one of the possible three purposes.<br/><br/>CHAINMAIL is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.<br/><br/>The game thus becomes a tense battle. When do you play your cards? How many do you play? What do you do with them? Will you be caught short and be subject to a sudden attack by your opponent?<br/>CHAINMAIL includes four of the major battles of the Medieval period: Legnano (1176), Bouvines (1214), Lewes (1264), and Bannockburn (1314).<br/><br/>LEGNANO<br/>The Battle of Legnano, May 29, 1176, was a major defeat of the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa by members of the Lombard League. It was a major setback to his plans for imperial domination of Italy and showed for the first time of infantry against feudal cavalry.<br/><br/>BOUVINES<br/>The Battle of Bouvines, July 27, 1214, was a conclusive medieval battle ending the twelve year old War of Bouvines that was important to the early development of both the French state by confirming the French crown&rsquo;s sovereignty over the Norman lands of Brittany and Normandy.<br/><br/>LEWES<br/>The Battle of Lewes, May 12, 1264, was a one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War. It was the high point of the career of Simon De Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and made him the &quot;uncrowned King of England&quot;.<br/><br/>BANNOCKBURN<br/>The Battle of Bannockburn, 24 June 1314, was a significant Scottish victory in the Wars of Scottish Independence. It was the decisive battle in the First War of Scottish Independence.<br/><br/>",

As the game goes on each player secretly chooses whether they want to go for a coop victory or a single-player win.<br/><br/>Set in ancient northern Europe, Dawn blends strategy with unique player dynamics.  As the town is being built there are threats that players need to decide if they want to fight.  In the midst of this players have to also deduce who is helping and who isn't.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of six rounds.  Each round consists of three phases.  First, players draw cards until they have nine in their hands, then they select one to put in their storehouse.  During the second phase, each player plays their cards to either: perform and action (such as heal another player, or spy on a threat), try to build a building by playing a resource card face down in front of it, or try to thwart a threat by putting a card face down by those.  Finally, there is the resolution phase where the cards played face down are shuffled and revealed to see if a building has been built or a threat has been thwarted.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, it is revealed who is a coop player and who was going for a single-player victory based on the amount of treasure each player has stored in their storehouse.  There needs to be thirty prosperity-points worth of buildings built for each coop player or the coop players fail.  If they fail, then the player with the most treasure stored in their personal storehouse wins the game.<br/><br/>Dawn is the next game in the Darkness four-part saga.  Where Darkness represented players competing for limited resources, as they would during &quot;dark times&quot;, Dawn represents what happens when people choose to work together.  The next game, &quot;Daylight&quot; will be a pure coop game, and finally &quot;Dusk&quot; will be a legacy game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Belay your bickering and gives us our treasure!<br/><br/>Scallywags, originally available as a print-and-play game titled Doubloons!, is a light-hearted game in which players are swashbuckling pirates divvying up their booty.<br/><br/>To start the game, a selection of coins are dumped in the center of the table to form the loot pile. These coins are marked on only one side and are left face-up or face-down as they fall. On a player's turn, he can either take a face-down coin from the pile and add it to his stash or play one card (from three in his hand) to take face-up coins, steal from others, give coins to opponents, and more.<br/><br/>Why would you want to give coins to others? Because once a player has ten coins, he can't receive any more &ndash; which means you want to stuff them with all the pennies while making a play for the gold yourself. Once all players have collected ten coins, the game ends and the player with the most valuable stash wins!<br/><br/>",

You win by having the most &ldquo;Power&rdquo; at the end of the game. But you need to watch out; everyone else has their own agenda too. You each have an identity; Media Mogul, Tech Entrepreneur, Politician, Criminal Mastermind, Corrupt Copper or Celebrity. Just like in real life you will all be colluding and stabbing each other in the back. Similarly, you will all have &quot;Skeletons&quot; in your closet, representing your scandalous and misspent past.<br/><br/>Starting with a &ldquo;chicken feed&rdquo; salary of &pound;100k, a few &ldquo;Favours&rdquo; in your pocket and ideas for new &ldquo;Business Ventures&rdquo; you build up a shady empire; from newspapers to apps and record labels to gambling rackets. As well as earning you more cash, each Venture gives you more Power while you control it. As a bonus, Ventures that are related and colour coded to your identity give you extra Power. For example, the Media Mogul will seek to own the Daily Hate Newspaper.<br/><br/>As well as setting up Ventures, players take turns to make deals, extort enemies and use &ldquo;Favours&rdquo; to attack rivals or give themselves a boost. The game also allows for bluffing with Favours, which is one way to manipulate the situation to your advantage.<br/><br/>They say the road to Power is paved with good intentions and some Favours offer a shadier path. If a Favour is illegal, like arms dealing or expenses fraud, playing this card will cause you to receive a &quot;Skeleton&quot; in your closet. These must be closely guarded as if uncovered, can cause you to lose Power.<br/><br/>Build an empire and amass Power by manipulating your rivals...<br/><br/>",

The risk: catastrophes like droughts, floods or pandemics. The chance: welfare and a stable global climate.

        "description": "The Battle of Gazala, in May 1942, was arguably Rommel's most daring feat of generalship: British 8th Army had reached the limit of its supply line, but had heavily fortified the front from the Libyan coastal village of Gazala to the desolate outpost of Bir Hacheim, nearly 50 windswept miles to the south. The ever-resourceful Rommel, however, simply led the Afrikakorps still deeper into the desert, going around Bir Hacheim. Once behind the Allied defenses, the panzers became a threat to the overall Allied position. British tank units were immediately ordered to counterattack Rommel's panzers, resulting in one of the largest tank engagements of the desert war on a barren tract of desert that became known as the &quot;cauldron.&quot;<br/><br/>Cauldron utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From mortars to howitzers, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by heavy mortars &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending an outpost. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the outpost, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Cauldron, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting around the cauldron. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>(from the Decision Games' website)<br/><br/>",

After a grueling hour of gaming, you discover that you've tied for first place with your arch nemesis, Toady Johansen. Again. You grab for the rulebook, but Toady is faster than you, and begins reading, &quot;In case of a tie, all players rejoice in their shared victory.&quot; You're outraged. Even Toady, who would be languishing in second-to-last place if it weren't for the kingmaking efforts of your other arch nemesis, Art Smithers, is visibly shaken. What is this, the World Cup? Unbelievable.<br/><br/>But now, however, there's a solution to this problem (the tied player one, not that Cheeto issue..that'll have to wait until there are significant technological advances): TieBreaker. TieBreaker is the definitive method for determining who wins a tied game. And even though it's the follow-up from the designer of the award-winning Start Player, TieBreaker isn't at all random; it challenges each tied player to show, once and for all, that he is indeed deserving of victory by having the tied players compete in a simple challenge.<br/><br/>With more than 50 cards and a giant orange TieBreaker meeple, you can always be confident that tied games will be resolved satisfactorily. There will be a winner, and most likely that winner will be you.<br/><br/>Because, regardless of what your so-called politically-correct friends say, it really isn't about how you play the game. It's about crushing Toady Johansen until he cries for his momma.<br/><br/>TieBreaker will debut October 2011 at Spiel.<br/><br/>TieBreaker has already been awarded the Board 2 Pieces Game of the Year for 2011!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Batavia, capital of Dutch East Indies, 1922. 'Vrije man' or 'free men' roamed the corners of the city. Their appearance often troubled the Dutch colonial government as they were master of Silat (local martial art) and refuse to bow down to the government. They were called heroes by the local citizens at the time.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Mat Goceng, a local Vrije man, that vowed to always save the weak and drive the Dutch away from his land. He then met Nyi Kencleng, a rich merchant from the land of Pasundan (west Java), and helped her build a Padepokan Silat. A place where everybody can learn Silat for free. Some people then tried to stop Mat Goceng made his dream into realization.<br/><br/>Mat Goceng is a card game that can be played by 3-6 players. The game mechanism consists of deduction (guessing who is the ally or enemy), bluffing (avoid being attacked), card management (to produce the longest hit combo), and persuasion (persuade other people to ask help from you). The active player chooses which person he/she will attack. Then both of them alternately will try to build their own combo to defend and attack. They can ask for help from the inactive players; the cost of helping is negotiable. The longest combo win the battle. Then, the player on the left (of the active player) then proceed as the new active player.<br/><br/>The objective of the game depends on which character the player will have in the beginning of the game. As example, if you have Mat Goceng&rsquo;s card then the winning condition is to make sure both you and Nyi Kencleng survives until the end of the game. Meanwhile Nyi Kencleng&rsquo;s objective is to survive the game and collect more money than the other players. There are total of six characters with different objectives.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #232.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>CATHERINE THE GREAT is a purposed-designed solitaire wargame of the expansion of the Russian Empire under Empress Catherine II (1762-96). The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.<br/><br/>Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.<br/><br/>While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.  Each region represents a distinct geographic area or province within a power. Each unit represents an entire army or fleet. Each turn represents five years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series. Lay square labyrinth cards showing fantasy symbols like a griffin, dragon, scroll, key, gems, etc.  When a symbol on the card you just laid is directly connected to one or more identical symbols on other cards, you can take those cards (but not the one you just laid), as long as the labyrinth does not become disjointed.  You only hold 2 cards and draw after laying. The game ends when the draw pile is finished, most cards collected wins.  A children's game that is fun enough as a filler for adults.<br/><br/>",

Can you and your friends stop the pouring rain together?<br/><br/>In the co-operative and challenging card game Wolkenbruch, your goal is to protect four burning flames from falling rain. The players win the game when all four flames are protected (with an umbrella, of course).<br/><br/>The game is controlled by a special deck of cards &mdash; the Wolkenbruch-Deck &mdash; and comes with ten different levels of difficulty. During the game, players take actions to move within the circle of flames, drive away rain, or use event cards. Players may also swap cards with one another.<br/><br/>Each player also has a special ability &mdash; a so-called profile &mdash; that gives the player additional special abilities. At the end of each turn, the active player must play a card from their hand. Afterwards, the Wolkenbruch-Deck brings more cards into play.<br/><br/>When the clouds break, all cards from the discard pile are put back on top of the Wolkenbruch-Deck and the rainfall increases. Time is running out. Be fast, communicate with each other, and pass cards to protect the flames!<br/><br/>",

The card on top of your draw pile will be the first one you play, and the first Meal you serve at your food truck!<br/>- SERVICE: Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player turns over the top Meal card of their deck and then one of two things takes place: <br/><br/>    If no one else has served this Meal<br/><br/><br/>The player places their Meal card in front of them, face-up.<br/>If they have played this Meal card before, place it on top of the previous one, forming a pile.<br/>Important: Dessert cards are wildcards, so they can always be<br/>played face-up. <br/><br/>    If another player has already served this Meal<br/><br/><br/>The player cannot play their Meal card, and is eliminated from the round. As compensation, that player chooses one Meal card from the general supply to add to their deck. The first player to be eliminated each round also takes the first-player marker.<br/>- END OF SERVICE: Continue until one player remains, with the others having been eliminated. That player wins the round. They gain a victory point and take the last Meal card from the general supply.<br/>Discard your face-up Truck card if you haven&rsquo;t used it.<br/>When players have used all their Truck cards, they can reshuffle their discard pile to form a new decks.<br/>Draw as many Meal cards as there are players from the central deck and place them face up in the center of the table, as in Setup .<br/>At the end of service, if a player has 3 victory points (or 2, for 5 players), they win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Every class of battleship that fought in the English and German fleets is represented, such as Queen Elizabeth, Lutzow, Konig and Lion. Cruisers and destroyers are represented as screening units.<br/><br/>Play is by scenario with nine historical and hypothetical scenarios presented including Falkland Islands, Dogger Bank, the Battlecruiser and Fleet action of Jutland and Second Heligoland Bight. Hypothetical scenarios explore such things as what if the British and German fleets had clashed on December 16, 1914, one of the most remarkable days of the war in which both fleets narrowly escaped disaster.<br/><br/>All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and fleet formations. Also included are special rules depicting ammunition quality, mines and the environmental aspects of naval combat, such as the position of the sun, wind and stack smoke. The map is big enough to fight large encounters like the fleet action at Jutland. Each hex equals 2000 yards and each game turn represents 10 minutes of real time.<br/><br/>",

In the manner of Carry On Doctor, the hapless victim patient is wheeled in before the arrayed quacks. Every patient is different, but your aim is to cure him (by having the largest combined total of cards in your color) without killing him (ditto, but exceeding the patient's specified limit). Your typical private patient is pretty weedy, so expires on a total higher than 14. You might play your own 8 card hoping to get close to the total, but your rivals will be only too pleased to play a 5 and a 3 to kill him off. The body goes into your mortuary (minus points) hopefully to be offset by cured patients (positive points). And that is it.<br/><br/>",

Each player will draft cards into a deck, use those cards to send Trade Caravans across Asia, and build opportunities in trade, military and the court. Players must work together to trade goods while competing to build cards and gain victory points.<br/><br/>Win: Players gain Victory Points (VP) by sending trade caravans across the Silk Road Trade Map and buying/building cards on their side of the Map. The game ends when one player builds 10 cards. At that point the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>Needed to Play: <br/>&bull; The deck of 54 cards (53 game cards and 1 Player Aid card).<br/>&bull; The game board showing the Silk Road map.<br/>&bull; 18 eurocubes in each of 6 colors (blue, red, yellow, green, white, purple) to represent the Trade Goods, plus 1 additional red and yellow eurocube for the Victory Point track.<br/>&bull; 15 gray/black eurocubes to represent Artisans.<br/>&bull; 3 pawns in red and yellow to represent the Trade Caravans.<br/><br/>Setup: Decide who will be the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire and place the Silk Road Trade Map between both players. This map allows players to track their Trade Caravans across the Silk Road through Asia. It also designates areas for players to build fields of cards in the game to gain Victory Points.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Each round of the game consists of 4 phases. Each player will complete all phases in turn. Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2.<br/>(Note: Card abilities in a Player&rsquo;s Empire may be used at any time during <br/>phases 1-3, and all card abilities are cumulative.)<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 1: Production                                                                           <br/>During Phase 1, the active player has 8 Production Points (PP) to spend. Production points are used to produce trade goods and hire artisans, which are in turn, used to buy cards, build cards and send Trade Caravans across the Silk Road for VP.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 2: Buy/Build/Defend                                                                              <br/>The active player may now do any of the following 3 actions. Actions must, however, be in the following order:<br/><br/>A. Buy: Buy one or more cards from the Crossroads by discarding the correct number and type of trade goods listed on the card, from a player&rsquo;s supply. After buying a card, the player places this card on their discard pile next to their Player Empire (unless a card ability in a Player&rsquo;s Empire states otherwise), and replaces the card just purchased with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. If there are no more cards in the Crossroads draw pile, cards cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>B. Build: Build one or more cards from your player empire by discarding the correct number of artisans equal to the build cost as listed on the card. Place this card in one of the 4 fields located to the left or right of the Silk Road Trade Map as designated by the player&rsquo;s color (Note: a player may only build cards to their side of the Trade Map). Built cards gain victory points for the player. Add these victory points to the player&rsquo;s total on the Victory Point Track. Built cards no longer have their card abilities available to the player; they are now worth only victory points and, in some cases, defensive strength.<br/><br/>Players may not switch cards in any field once built.<br/><br/>Players may not build a card more than 3 cards in distance out from the Silk Road Trade Map<br/><br/>Cards in fields do not have to match in name, type or color.<br/><br/>Cards must be adjacent for additional stacked victory points.<br/><br/>C. Defend: Defeat one Enemy card from the Crossroads if the total defensive strength in your player field is equal to or greater than the Enemy card&rsquo;s strength. Remove the Enemy card from the game and replace the empty space with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. Gain any victory points and awards as listed on the Enemy card.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 3: Trade                                                                                <br/>The active player may now do only one of the following:<br/><br/>a. Begin a new Trade Caravan: <br/>A player may ship up to 4 trade goods at any one time in a single Trade Caravan. They may ship fewer if they choose to. The Warehouse and Trading Post cards can add extra trade goods to a Trade Caravan.<br/><br/>A player may move all of their Trade Caravan pawns one space towards the opposing player. (Note: Each Trader card in your Player Empire allows Trade Caravans to move one additional space during this phase). <br/>Any Enemy abilities are now applied for any Enemy cards in the Crossroads. These may result in the loss of Trade Goods or entire Trade Caravans. Trade Goods have the following values when determining which to lose: Gold and Silk (3), Wine and <br/>Porcelain (2), Glassware and Spices (1).<br/>If a player must lose an entire Trade Caravan, they may choose which to remove.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 4: Discard                                                                           <br/>The active player must now discard all cards from their Player Empire to their discard pile and deal out 4 new cards from their draw pile to their Player Empire. If there are not enough cards left to draw from, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile. If there are still not enough cards to deal out 4 new cards the player will not have 4 cards in their Player Empire in the next round.<br/><br/>Any Crossroads cards that have been discarded (not those that have been defeated during Phase 2) should be shuffled back into the Crossroads draw deck.<br/><br/>End Game: Once a player has built 10 cards to their respective field the game ends immediately. The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players have to try to get the proposals that are most advantageous to them approved, whilst securing the maximum number of influence points that they can in each round. The game is played over three rounds, which simulates the increased membership of the European Union over time. The player with the highest number of influence-points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During the game, each player uses their influence points to secure voting powers by bidding for Member States in the Council of the European Union (the Council) and Members of the European Parliament (MEP) (the Parliament), if playing the advanced version. The party with the highest bid also becomes the President of that institution, i.e., when bidding for the Member States in the Council, the highest bidder becomes the President of the Council. The President is a powerful figure with the ability to set the agenda for each round, chair discussions, and call votes.<br/><br/>Players can lobby other parties (players) to lend their support or help block proposals, taking into consideration their preferred policies and special abilities. Alliances can also be formed to further a player's objectives. Players can make deals using influence points or verbal commitments at any time during the game. However, the President Card, Party Cards, Member State Cards, and MEP Cards may not be transferred or traded.<br/><br/>",

During play, you gobble up the most valuable stones across the board, and in the end the fattest goblin wins. It's CRUNCH time!!!<br/><br/>In more detail, players set up the game board by laying nine game boards in a 3x3 square; each game board features 25 spaces on it in a 5x5 array, and each space has both a color (one of five) and a number (one of six). Thus, you'll have a game board that measures 15 spaces on each side.<br/><br/>Players start with several 1x1 tiles, with each tile being one of the five colors. On a turn, you take exactly five actions, first playing 0-5 tiles, then drawing 5-0 tiles, e.g., playing three tiles, then drawing two. You play tiles onto the game board akin to playing words in Scrabble, with you covering the appropriate colors with your tiles as a single word and scoring the numbers that you cover. One tile-laying restriction: You can't place tiles so that a 2x2 area of the game board is covered.<br/><br/>",

Heroes need a quest, and so you set out on an adventure for fortune, fame, and glory.<br/><br/>Fortune Fame &amp; Glory is a &quot;low ink&quot; free print and play fantasy card and dice game of adventure, combat, and treasure.<br/>Start by removing the three &quot;end game&quot; cards. Then shuffle the deck and lay the cards face down in ten columns. Set your health, attack bonus, gold, food units, and fate on the character card. Gameplay begins by turning over the first far left card. Read the card's scenario and follow its instructions, before moving to the next card. Cards contain encounters such as monster combat, weapon and health upgrades, penalties, and more. After making your way to the far right,  reshuffle the cards and lay them out again. Start again at the far left card and make your way to the right. Repeat this sequence three times before facing one of the end game boss cards. Defeating one of the three boss cards gives you either fortune, fame or glory.<br/><br/>The final goal of the game is to survive 3-9 rounds. After each successful third round of cards, you face one of the end game bosses in hopes of acquiring fortune, fame, and glory.<br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These cards have two halves, each with icons representing the influence in one or two of the groups. Every round each player selects one card secretly, touching the side of the card they want to be valid, then all players reveal/place their card simultaneously. The players add their played card to their display, overlapping the cards, so that only the half that they touched when revealing the card is seen. The other half is taken out of play for this game.<br/><br/>Some cards show icons that allow you to collect victory points immediately. When doing so, you compare your total of power of the specific group with each of the other players, scoring some points for each player you beat and less in case of a tie.<br/><br/>In game end scoring, you compare all symbols with all of your competitors and gain additional points when having more symbols of a kind, and fewer points in case of a tie. Finally, you score more points for each face-to-face victory when comparing the symbols on cards you have taken out during the game as part of the city wall.<br/><br/>Scoring during the game weakens your display because the scoring symbol is only on card halves with a single icon of influence, while other card halves show up to three icons.<br/><br/>Tallinn is the second game in the cycle of little tiny card games of Medieval Theme in the Baltic Sea by OSTIA-Spiele, following VISBY.<br/><br/>",

You assume the role of a small shipwrecked crew trying to reach the Indies after a failed expedition deep in the South Pacific. This game uses a worker placement system to assign to jobs such as steer your boat, fish, encounter natives, gather resources, and watch for weather. A handful of dice are allocated in a press-your-luck fashion. For those that enjoy role-playing, there is also an optional Journaling phase where you try to tell a story about what happened on your turn. Can you reach the Indies before you lose all of your crew members or get blown off course completely?<br/><br/>THEME<br/>You and three of your fellow shipwrecked sailors have spent three weeks on this small South Pacific island after a storm smashed your ship into some shoals. You have cannibalized what you can of your wrecked caravel and created a tiny sloop to get you to the Indies. However, you are in uncharted waters and have heard rumors of cannibal tribes on islands dotting this vast ocean.<br/><br/>",

Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.<br/><br/>Red Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.<br/><br/>Iron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!<br/><br/>Lincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Automania, The Game Of The Motor Giants, was Ian Livingstone's second self-produced game, after Boomtown, in a limited edition of 1000. The board is a simple scoring track and large flags for each country. Players have nice wooden car shaped pieces in six colors and a larger car to score with. There is a numbered deck of 56 Market Cards in English and German which affect the game each round. Players use a Record Sheet and the rules are in English and German.<br/><br/>Players represent national car manufacturers trying to export cars to six other countries. Combining the placing some export cars in the markets on the board and secretly noting the remaining export cars on your Record Sheet, players also assign advertising budgets to the markets. Each market has a export limit that it can accept and the cars go for a fixed price in each market, so whoever spends more money on advertising gets to sell their cars first. But before revealing the spending, players play one of their Market Cards, which affect the Market in various ways (e.g. 36 - Car of the Year, Sweden will sell all its cars in the USA). After the market is reorganized, players then determine what cars are actually sold and how much Sales Revenue they have earned. Then subtract costs from sales to give profit. For each $10,000 profit you earn, you move your scoring marker one space on the scoring track. First round the track wins.<br/><br/>Reportedly a fun game, it drew some criticism in Sumo for the imbalance caused by the Market Cards. The designer replied and suggested which cards might stand removing (7 to 17, 26, 27 and 35). Ian's reply is on the Game Cabinet and makes interesting reading today.<br/><br/>",

In the most common scoring system, a player wins two betting units when two of their hands are stronger than another player's corresponding hands, and four betting units when all three of their hands are stronger. So for example, if Player A's back hand was a full house, his middle hand was two pair, and his front hand a pair of jacks, while Player B's corresponding hands were a flush, three-of-a-kind, and a pair of nines, Player B would owe Player A two betting units.<br/><br/>Other scoring options include bonuses for especially strong hands (e.g., you win four extra bets if your back or middle hand is a straight flush), and &quot;surrender,&quot; which allows you to throw away a particularly bad set of cards and just pay a fixed penalty fee to each opponent.<br/><br/>In another variant, if you have all fours, you instantly win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Vault is an abstract game in which each player tries to reach the opponent&rsquo;s back rank. Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.<br/><br/>MATERIAL<br/><br/>- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.<br/>- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).<br/> HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.<br/><br/>Walk<br/><br/>Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.<br/><br/>Jump<br/><br/>In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.<br/><br/>The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.<br/><br/>Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.<br/><br/>If the above condition is not reached and you can&rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.<br/><br/>NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER<br/><br/>This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).<br/><br/>As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.<br/><br/>(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A member of the Checkers Family very popular in Brasil.<br/><br/>Brazilian Checkers or Draughts is played under the same basic rules that apply to International Checkers except that it is played on a smaller 8 x 8, or 64-square board with each player playing 12 pieces.<br/><br/>This variant is started by the player who either wins a random toss of a coin or the player who plays the light colored pieces. Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board<br/><br/>The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.<br/><br/>The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.<br/><br/>Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.<br/><br/>Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.<br/><br/>Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.<br/><br/>The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.<br/><br/>Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.<br/><br/>Information from checkershistory.com<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.<br/><br/>The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.<br/>        <br/>The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.<br/><br/>The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.<br/><br/>Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.<br/><br/>Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.<br/><br/>",

Miller).<br/><br/>&quot;Verdun: A Dagger at the Heart of France&quot; is an Operational level board-wargame simulation of the 1916 German offensive that was supposed to &quot;bleed the French white&quot; in a single great battle of attrition, but instead turned into a bloody debacle of 10 months of slaughter.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are mostly conventional for hex and counter wargames. Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.<br/><br/>Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.<br/><br/>Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.<br/><br/>Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.<br/><br/>The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks. There are also rules for the Germans reducing the fortresses that surround Verdun.<br/><br/>While control of the city of Verdun is a primary victory condition for the game, the real key to victory is the amount of attrition each side does to the other.<br/><br/>",

However, beneath every hero lies an average human being, who has a job to perform, daily expenses to pay and crime fighting gadgets to buy. Little did they know that their credit card bills are feeding the ultimate monster of mass destruction: Debtzilla.<br/><br/>Debtzilla is a 2 to 4 player, cooperative board game in which heroes work together to protect ordinary citizens from being scammed by Villains, and take down the final boss: Debtzilla. Sharing the same universe as Wongamania: Banana Economy, Debtzilla focuses on the issue of how debt affects the lives of ordinary people in Banana Republic. Using a combination of deck building and dice mechanics, players have to race against time to bring down the bad guys before the law of compounding debt interest destroys their chances of winning the game.

And the game is full of surprises.<br/><br/>The 1st adventure takes the players to Victorian London. The author of the Sherlock Holmes novels has disappeared and the players must find him again.<br/>The 2nd adventure is set in ancient Egypt. The players try to gain Cleopatra's trust and bring the secret scrolls to safety.<br/>In the 3rd adventure, players follow in the footsteps of the greatest universal genius of all time: Leonardo da Vinci.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for beginners and offers a quick start. Everyone can start puzzling right away in just a few steps.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>The players play together through 3 different adventures. In the process, they have to answer quiz questions and solve puzzles. Additional clues and secret messages are hidden in the box.

        "description": "DOCTOR KEY-BIT is proof that even the best magic is nothing compared to good intuition. Doctor Key-Bit, the famous doctor of alchemy, comes home from his meeting of magical doctors and finds out that he has locked the doors to his enchanted castle by magic spell. But now he has forgotten the magic spell to reopen them.<br/><br/>Players try to move Doctor Key-Bit on the game board from one room to another. They&rsquo;ll need good intuition, because they search through their bags &ndash; which are filled with different keys &ndash; for a key that fits. Each player moves Doctor Key-Bit to one of four different elixir bottles that are located in the rooms on the game board. Since each player looks for different elixirs, you&rsquo;ll need a perfect sense of touch to be successful.<br/><br/>The first to move Doctor Key-Bit to four elixirs wins the game and helps the magician to prepare his potion for opening the doors.<br/><br/>DOCTOR KEY-BIT trains the intuition, helps you become quick on the uptake, and teaches you to recognize extraordinary shapes.<br/><br/>",

The ball is on a column, and you can place it as high or as low as you want, with more height equalling a greater challenge. Each of the 2-4 players starts building at a certain mark away from the column, although you could handicap some players by starting them further back. You need to stack the wooden blocks to create a floating one-ended bridge, a bridge that reaches out toward the ball and ideally doesn't collapse under its own weight or unbalanced nature.<br/><br/>You can play a real-time game in which whoever touches the ball first wins, a pauper's game in which whoever uses the fewest pieces wins, or a turn-based game in which players place blocks one by one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saipan was a critical objective in the US Navy's &quot;island hopping&quot; campaign in the Pacific; its two airfields were suitable for heavy bombers. Hence three US divisions were scheduled to invade Saipan on 15 June 1944, supported by nearly two-dozen battleships that had begun a bombardment two days before. More than 30,000 fanatic Japanese were entrenched on the island, dug into caves and other formidable defensive positions. The battle for Saipan proved to be one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific War, and the deadliest up to that time for both sides.<br/><br/>Saipan utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From naval bombardment to bazookas, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single engineer battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by flamethrowers &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a plateau. As its attack gets underway, however, the engineer battalion may suddenly come under fire from enemy mortars. More support will be needed to take the plateau, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Saipan the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of the battles in the Pacific. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting on Saipan. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 2 days<br/>    Hex: 1/3 mile (580 yards) / 538 meters<br/>    Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (80 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One Saipan rulebook<br/>    One Fire &amp; Movement Folio Standard rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High (4 out of 5)<br/>Complexity Level: Low (2 out of 5)<br/>Players: 2<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 hours<br/><br/>(from the Decision Games' website and back of folio)<br/><br/>",

These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.<br/><br/>All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.<br/><br/>This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.). The game components are on par with any game in the system.<br/><br/>Nominee for the 1988 Charles S. Roberts awards for Best Pre-World War II Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "William the Conqueror - 1066 is a two or three player tactical wargame which recreates the Battles of Stamford Bridge and Senlac Hill (more commonly known as the Battle of Hastings), the most decisive battles ever fought on English soil. The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.<br/><br/>1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.<br/><br/>",

The middle column on the board is an impassible river, leaving each player with a 4x7 section of the board on which to control their pieces.<br/><br/>Six (6) different types of pieces are used in the game: a single King per player (must be protected), Wizards (gives the player more moves to use each turn), Builders (add/remove Walls from the board), Cannons (shoot cannonballs at opponent's pieces), Walls (intercept cannonballs -- used to give protection to other pieces), and Fire (placed on the board wherever a cannonball lands).<br/><br/>If a player's &quot;portal&quot; square (the middle square in their outside column) is open at the start of the turn, the player can add a new piece on that square.<br/><br/>The first player to hit their opponent's King with a cannonball is the winner.<br/><br/>The game was first published as a 2-player computer game, which can be played against an opponent over the Internet.<br/><br/>Now there is also a tabletop version of the game available, which includes rules for a hidden-information variant.<br/><br/>",

The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.<br/><br/>A variant is given in which all pieces which cross the board are summed to determine the winner, although a player exiting their 'X' still wins immediately.<br/><br/>The original magazine publication also suggests playing on a 6x6 board with additional '10' and '11' pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First there was UNO. Well, first there was Crazy Eights, but never mind.<br/><br/>Then came Zar which added even more viciousness. The &quot;draw two&quot; card in Zar is a colored Wasp. The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.<br/><br/>It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.<br/><br/>Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards. This increases player interaction, excitement, and much more chaos.<br/><br/>If even Zar becomes too tame for you check out The Totally Insane Card Game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In mid-1944, despite their rapidly deteriorating position, the Japanese launched a massive offensive in China. They had three objectives:<br/><br/><br/>     Open a land and rail route across China to their southern conquests in Indochina and the Dutch East Indies (and bypass the US submarine blockade along the Chinese seacoast), and;<br/>     Eliminate all the US bomber bases in China from which B-29s were targeting the home islands, and;<br/>     At a minimum, severely degrade Nationalist Chinese capabilities and best case, maybe even knock the Nationalists out of the war.<br/><br/><br/>Operation Ichi-Go (&ldquo;Number One&rdquo;) was the largest ground offensive in Japanese history, with 500,000 troops, 800 tanks and massive logistics and artillery support. They used their tanks in armored divisions &ndash; the only time in the war they deployed such concentrations.<br/><br/>Ironically, Japanese armies reached the goals that they set, but US airpower prevented them from using their land route to any great extent, and US victories in the Pacific gave the US plenty of other airbases to attack the Japanese mainland.<br/><br/>However, the offensive made a huge difference to postwar Asia. The Nationalists lost important territory, including scarce industrial capacity and rice-growing areas vital to their economy. They also lost military prestige and an enormous number of troops, perhaps as many as 750,000 casualties, weakening their ability to fight the Communists. And fatally, in order to do the offensive, the Japanese emptied Manchuria, leaving defenses against the Soviets there very weak, and from areas in China where they had been containing Communist guerrillas, creating a vacuum that the Communists quickly filled.<br/><br/>This two-player game has one side commanding the Japanese, and the other the Nationalist Chinese. A &ldquo;what if&rdquo; option allows for the exploration of the potentials of a massive US invasion on the Chinese coast (Operation &quot;Causeway&quot;), one of the many approaches the US considered before finally deciding to invade the Philippines instead.<br/><br/>There is also a set of full solitaire game rules inside (by Steven Cunliffe) where the active player (as Japan) competes against the Nationalist Chinese side run by the game system.<br/><br/>The game features nine monthly turns; units of maneuver are IJA (and US) divisions, with individual Chinese units varying in organizational size from divisions up to army groups. Most Chinese units are &quot;untried&quot; and only reveal their true value at the moment of combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer Ty Bomba<br/><br/>Also includes a complete solo game using the same components designed by Steven Cunliffe, with the player commanding the Japanese attack against an automata Chinese defender.<br/><br/>",

Players then arrange and rearrange the sticks to place similarly colored rectangles adjacent to one another and form large blocks of a single color.<br/><br/>Once time runs out, players score points for each color block of at least two rectangles, with each block worth as many points as the number of rectangles in it. Players then pass their sticks clockwise and play another round. After as many rounds as the number of players in the game, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Third Crusade Opens<br/><br/>It was the destruction of the Crusader army by Saladin at Hattin in 1187 that had led to the collapse of the Crusader kingdoms in the Levant, including the loss of Jerusalem. Guy of Lusignan, the erstwhile ruler of the city, appealed to the Europeans for aid, which soon arrived. But without waiting for the three main Crusader armies &mdash; led by King Philip of France, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Richard I of England &shy;&mdash; Guy set out to capture Acre on the Levantine coast. His first assault was repulsed and Guy settled in for a siege. Meanwhile, Saladin gathered a portion of his army and rode in to lift the siege. After preliminary skirmishing, the opposing armies met east of the city on 4 October.<br/><br/>Acre uses the new Battles of the Medieval World system, a variation on the venerable Battles of the Ancient World system. The battle is dominated by masses of heavy cavalry and disciplined lines of heavily-armed and armored men-at-arms. Swirling around these forces are masses of foot- and horse-archers, whose purpose is to disrupt the heavy formations and make them easy prey for their counterparts. Using the classic Combat Results Table, the fighting is close and bloody until the morale of one side weakens. Once a line breaks, the victor must pursue ruthlessly to prevent a rally. Leaders enhance combat power and restore broken formations.<br/><br/>At Acre, the Crusaders have more combat power, but must maintain a long line to protect their siege works. The Arabs are quick but light, and must find a way to isolate portions of the Crusader army and defeat it in detail. Victory will go to the player who deploys his army to best utilize his strengths and take advantage of enemy weaknesses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1066: End of the Dark Ages is a wargame of intermediate complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating the historic struggle to gain control of Britain during that crucial year of the 11th century.<br/><br/>That struggle saw the Anglo-Saxons, under King Harold, defeat the Vikings, only to in turn be defeated by the Normans from France led by Duke William. His victory eventually led to the establishment of the modern British nation. 1066: End of the Dark Ages can be played by two, three or four, each representing a different side: Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Vikings and Britons (the latter representing an amalgamation of the various peoples then indigenous to the island).<br/><br/>Each of the 12 game turns represent a calendar month. Each fully iconic, large-size, unit represents roughly 1,000 to 5,000 fighting men or key individual leaders along with their elite 'household' troops. Each square on the 34x22&quot; map represents 40 miles across, with all of England, Wales and southern Scotland, as well as the north coast of France, depicted on it.<br/><br/>Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Britain. Every tactic and stratagem available historically to the would-be kings of England &ndash; from diplomacy through treachery, the laws of fealty and homage, vassalage, appeals to the Pope, assassination, pillage, shield walls, fortification, heavenly omens, gold, spies, rebellion, navies and, of course, savage warfare &ndash; are again in play here.<br/><br/>The game contains one scenario, with adaptive rules that allow it to be played by two, three or four opponents. The rules contain approximately 14,000 words, which will allow experienced players to get through a complete game in about four to six hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Decision: Iraq is a game that emphasizes the fight against the insurgency in Iraq, which began in 2003 following the US-led invasion of that country. Historically, the quick US-Coalition victory over Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s military forces in March of that year quickly degenerated into an insurgency that swept the country. The situation was eventually turned around, but only after a steep learning curve for the United States and its partners. The game shows some of the major factors involved. <br/> There are two players in the game: The Insurgents (who want to seize control of Iraq. These represent various Iraqi Rebels and Foreign Fighters, the latter including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others), and the Counterinsurgents (who want to restore stability to a democratic Iraq, as well as defeat any Al Qaeda elements which may be operating in the country.) These represent Multinational (MNF) forces (US and allies) and Iraqi Government Forces (which also include friendly Iraqi tribal militias).<br/> Both players have a set of pieces that represent conventional and unconventional forces. During their respective turns, players move their pieces amongst the spaces on the map, and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces. The objective for each player is to establish control over Iraq.<br/> One unique feature of the game is that units&rsquo;, as they engage in combat, effectiveness may increase or decrease as they gain experience in fighting, or become demoralized.<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 228 counters.<br/><br/>",

Crazy monsters have hidden themselves away under all the junk. And wow, do they look hungry! Will you be brave enough to feed them? It's best to feed only the hungriest of the monsters because after they've had something to eat, they burp so loudly that you get scared and run toward the exit. And grandma's guard dog, Pit, is sitting there...<br/><br/>In Bitte nicht f&uuml;ttern!, only players who keep track of where the hungriest monsters are hidden and can distract the guard dog with a bone can continue to feed the monsters undisturbed! On a turn, slide one, two, three or four junk tiles in a row, either horizontally or vertically, then feed the monster under the junk (by using your colored pencil to draw a little snack in the monster's open mouth). If someone has already fed this monster; you move your game figure along the edge of the box bottom in a clockwise direction by as many fields as there are snacks in the monster's mouth.<br/><br/>",

Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE (Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN- (Rough), Light GRAY- (Broken), &amp; Dark BROWN- (Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is from the coast around 'Halfaya Pass' south to Ft.Madellena over to far South of Bir Hacheim upto West of Tobruk past Monument. <br/> The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British, &amp; assorted Allied Units. Game scale is given as  1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.<br/><br/>There are 3-Scenarios included on the 1-page 'Exclusive' Rules Sheet: the full Campaign game~20 Turns; Sidi Rezegh~6-Turns (1~6); &amp; The Dash to the Wire~5-1/2-Turns (7~12, the British player skip their 1st Turn). The Exclusive Rules set out Supply Sources, detail the Tobruk Defenses, explain a British 'Diversion' attempt starting on Turn 6, and Victory Conditions for each Scenario. The Standard Rules has the Combat Results Table on the last 'inside' page. There are some 'interesting' location placenames such as 'Beer Bottle Hill', 'Hellfire Pass', 'Trafalgar Square', 'Libyan Omar', 'the Wire', and others of unique 'flavor'.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Crusader: Battle for Tobruk<br/><br/><br/>",

If you are Evil, you must try to find the baby, capture her, and take her to Nockmaar Castle.  One of the Good characters starts with Elora Danan, but the Evil players do not know who.  Thus the Evil players move around the board, searching for the Good characters and fighting them in an attempt to capture the baby.<br/><br/>The Good characters begin weak, but become more powerful as the game progresses.  They move about the board, searching for Places of Power and gaining Treasures which make them more powerful or enable them to free people who will protect Elora Danan, which is one way for them to win the game.

While playing the ZnajZnak game, players learn to recognise symbolic characters, dates, figures, places and objects of the Polish history.<br/><br/>The game is composed of 132 cards. Each of them presents 12 different symbols concerning the contemporary history of Poland. If you take a closer look at any two cards, you'll find out that they contain a common character. 132 cards, 133 symbols and always only one common character. The aim of a player is to notice the character on two other cards on the table and to tell its name as fast as possible. If the player succeeds to do that, he/she passes his/her card to another player. If he/she does not know the name of the character, he/she turns the card, reads the definition of the symbol, puts a new card on the table, and the game goes on. The winner is the person who first gets rid of all the cards in hand.<br/><br/>",

Twenty &quot;all-new, all-true&quot; mysteries of the 20th century include:<br/><br/>     The JFK assassination in &quot;The Camelot Conspiracy, Pt. I and II&quot;<br/>     Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in &quot;The Vanishing Teamster&quot;<br/>     Elvis's death in &quot;The King's Early Exit&quot;<br/><br/><br/>221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.<br/><br/>The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.<br/><br/>Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.<br/><br/>There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard version uses regular movers, while the Deluxe version includes six &quot;collectible&quot; pewter playing pieces: Deerstalker Cap, Time Machine, Dark Lantern, Magnifying Glass, Violin, Pipe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The port-town of Tobruk was the key to Libya. The Axis had been besieging it since April 1941, threatening to push the Allies back into Egypt. The Afrikakorps, commanded by Irwin Rommel, had already defeated the Allies' previous attempt to relieve Tobruk, Operation Battleaxe, but a new, surprise Allied offensive in November 1941, Operation Crusader, would evolve into one of the most chaotic and near-run battles of the entire North African campaign.<br/><br/>Crusader utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From mortars to tanks, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air cover &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a key hilltop. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the hill, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Crusader, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting around Tobruk. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Crusader: Battle for Tobruk, November 1941<br/><br/><br/>",

It took him six days to complete his work, assisted by a host of heavenly angels doing his divine bidding. On the seventh day God rested and examined the result. Seeing that it was good, he praised the angel who had contributed the most.<br/><br/>Genesis - In the Beginning gives you the chance to become that angel. By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game! But the way to victory is wrought with hard decisions. You must gather essence when it's most advantageous, move at the right time and do your days&rsquo; work where they count the most. And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.<br/><br/>Now - let there be light!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tContents1 game board<br/>1 God<br/>1 dark angel<br/>6 player angels<br/>42 day work markers<br/>1 starting player marker<br/>72 essence cubes<br/>1 rules booklet<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplayBefore the creation, the players&rsquo; angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words &quot;let there be light&quot;, the angels start their monumental task. There&rsquo;s a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in God&rsquo;s path to another day.<br/><br/>When players move from day to day, they&rsquo;re positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If they&rsquo;re not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players&rsquo; long-term strategy.<br/><br/>As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players&rsquo; angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players aren&rsquo;t careful, or if they&rsquo;re too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in God&rsquo;s wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end it&rsquo;s always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.<br/><br/>",

However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.<br/><br/>Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.<br/><br/>Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.<br/><br/>",

The players identify themselves with the Commanders of the armies; with two players, one leads the Duke of Wellington in opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte. To complete the main scenario there will be, eventually, a third player representing the field marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl&uuml;cher, leader of the Prussian army.<br/><br/>The Game uses an overall mechanic of pushing counters over the board without them being placed on specific places in an organized grid.<br/><br/>",

Baroness of Walloon-Brabant is expected with her entourage, as well as Sir Adam Stoneworth and Count Bobby of Wexford. Even the famous opera singer Barbette Brunette and former boxing champion Arnold Wendestein have announced their attendance. We are looking forward to this special occasion, which will of course take place at 5 p.m. sharp - at tea time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there has also been an increase in burglaries and thefts in this noble area lately. For this reason, Lord Waldemar has hired a renowned detective who, of course, appears with his assistant. During the celebrations they should keep an eye on the property and the luxurious belongings of his guests. If that succeeds, Lord Waldemar will acknowledge it very much.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Roll the dice up to 3 times. Choose dice with the same number and flip (or remove) a tile from your board that matches the result of the dice.<br/>Try to find valuable rooms or thieves and arrange your detectives correctly, so you can score them.<br/><br/>End: If a player places his 5th detective-tile correctly, everyone count all their points.

The Polish Army must face the Bolshevik armies attacking Warsaw. The Red Army player's goal is to invade the capital. The Polish Army player's goal is to block them and destroy the attacker's armies. Will Polish soldiers succeed? Can they defend Warsaw? If they fail, Bolshevik armies will continue west over &quot;the corpse of white Poland&quot;, and communism will spread across Europe&hellip;<br/><br/>While playing this game, you will see the difficulty faced by the Polish army. Players test their command skills by moving armies on the board and planning successive attacks on the enemy. Combat is resolved using a special deck of cards.<br/><br/>The game also requires skillful bluffing. Players don't know how strong the enemy armies are, or which attack will be the decisive strike. An attack might only be a distraction, tying up valuable enemy divisions that could be better used elsewhere.<br/><br/>The publication is enriched with an illustrated historical article. The game contains scoring rules for playing a match of two games, suitable for tournaments.<br/><br/>Box contents:<br/>Game board, 12 unit tokens, 60 cards, 24 wooden command markers, 6 cardboard attack markers, 1 wooden time marker, Polish and English booklets with game rules and a historical article.<br/><br/>",

The game starts in 6x6 grid of pieces, but pieces can jump outside the 6x6 area using the whole 12x12 board if desired.<br/><br/>Sniggle is a racing game for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Line Up is an alignment two-player game played on a 4x4 grid with each player having two squares, two triangles and one cyclinder of his color.<br/><br/>Empire is an abstract two-four player wargame of sorts.<br/><br/>Blockade (two players) is a distant relative of Hnefatafl; each player tries to have his king escape whilst blocking the other's with his guards.<br/><br/>Gateway, finally, is a 2-4 player game where each tries to enter all his pieces by forming alignments with opposing pieces.<br/><br/>",

Each player also has a set of four short blocks called &quot;biddis&quot;, with each biddi being one of four colors.<br/><br/>In the first round, one player rolls four ten-sided dice the same colors as the biddis, rerolling as necessary until at least three different numbers show. Players then race to create a single stack of blocks that includes a biddi at the height shown on the matching colored die. If the red die shows a 3, for example, then the red biddi needs to be placed on third level. What's more, you must create a continuous black line up the face of these blocks, rotating and flipping the blocks as needed to keep the line continuous.<br/><br/>When someone has created a stack six blocks high, they end the round. Then everyone scores 1 point for each block in their stack, starting from the table up to the highest legally placed block. The player who ended the round scores 2 bonus points for each biddi that shows the smiling face on it right-side-up in their stack.<br/><br/>Players then complete six more rounds, stacking their blocks one higher level each round so that in the seventh round, they're placing all eight blocks and all four biddis in a stack twelve levels high. After scoring in this seventh round, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game begins with tiles placed face down to build the territory.  Players explore the territory while fighting enemy troops with knights, soldiers, a Pegasus, and captured dragons.  War is only one strategy to play -- players can also try to take the princess to the enemy castle and force her marriage to the local prince.<br/><br/>For Draco Mundis<br/>The players have the responsibility of a team of various adventurers trying to gain victory points by exploring the jungle. All players start with exactly the same team.<br/><br/>First they must lay down their pawns (characters, terrains) and then, in turn, realize two actions, like move, fight, or explore.<br/><br/>In order to gain victory points, they can kill their opponents or manage to place some of their characters in strategic points on the map.<br/><br/>Each pawn has its own constraints, e.g. all cannot move in every direction, or have the same movement points and fight points. Some have special abilities.<br/><br/>",

No more than 2 pieces can be stacked on the same space. A stack consists of one or two pieces.<br/>b. Two pieces of identical shape and colour cannot be stacked.<br/><br/>Movement Phase<br/><br/>When the Placement Phase finishes, players take turns moving one of their pieces on the board, following the rules below:<br/>A) Move it to an adjacent space along a &ldquo;line&rdquo; (See the section &quot;LINES&quot;), following The Stacking Rules.<br/>B) When two pieces are stacked, only the upper piece can be moved.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must move one of your topmost pieces from a stack along a line to an adjacent space, respecting the Stacking Rule.<br/><br/>LINES<br/><br/>The &ldquo;lines&rdquo; are defined as the 7 lines that connect thefollowing 3-space sets on the board:<br/>{1,2,4}, {5,2,3}, {3,4,6}, {6,1,5}, {2,7,6}, {4,7,5}, {1,7,3}<br/><br/>Game End<br/><br/>You lose if either of the following is true:<br/>a) 3 pieces of the same colour or same shape are in a &ldquo;line&rdquo; (remember, the circle is a &ldquo;line&rdquo;) when finishing your turn.

How this works is that the clue givers have a device that shows a list of clues. Each turn, one clue giver chooses one of the listed clues, presents it to the opposing guesser, and hopes that he presented it with the wrong intonation so that the guesser won't guess the secret code word. As the crummy clues are used up, the clues will get better and better, so your challenge as the clue giver is to quickly figure out what might give a hint to your partner without giving the thing away entirely &ndash; which again is pretty much like Password!<br/><br/>",

The roles &quot;Mastermind&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; then determine a trump suit and a round rule for the current round. With eight cards in hand, players then start to play. Each role has a special task, the fulfillment of which earns an award at the end of the round. For example, &quot;Captain&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; must win more tricks together than &quot;Mastermind&quot;, whereas &quot;Mastermind&quot; wants to win at least as many tricks as &quot;Captain&quot; and &quot;Team Player&quot; combined. (&quot;Rebel&quot; has nothing to do with any of that and pursues their own goals.)<br/><br/>The Captain leads to the first trick, and other players must follow suit, if possible; otherwise they can play any card, including trump. The winner leads to the next trick, and once all tricks have been played, players receive an award if they have met their role's goal.

While a round progresses or after multiple rounds the suspense builds up at the table. Is the other team on to your cards? Did they discover your signal? Or are you quick enough to lead your team to victory?!<br/><br/>Sign is ideally played in social settings such as small get-togethers and caf&eacute;s because a match is very short. The goal of Sign is to collect five cards with the same symbol. If a player has collected all five cards (s)he tries to stealthy signal his/her teammate(s) who, if they notice, will call out his/her name and score a point. Players of other teams can also spot your signal or payed attention to your cards and can also call you out at any time! If they are right, it will earn them the points! As you play multiple rounds, tension gradually rises and the pace of the game quickens.<br/><br/>Sign can be described as a mix of Poker and Set because of the card design and social interaction.<br/><br/>Sign is the new name of the game Tamps, which was the original name when kickstarted.<br/><br/>Sign is a further development of the public domain game: Kemps/Camps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War for America: The American Revolution, 1775-1782 is a strategic game based on the events during the American Revolution. It is a 2 player game that shows how the conflict, which began as a &lsquo;civil war&rsquo; turned into a World conflict with a Great Britain that was greatly isolated. It features a new &lsquo;Action Pulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;Initiative System&rsquo; that keeps every turn of variable length and new. Game design by Gilbert Collins.<br/><br/>The Colonial player must build a &lsquo;Continental Army&rsquo; to battle with the British in order to prevent any sister colony from being overrun. This is going to take time and he must &lsquo;hold on&rsquo; and try to defeat a major British force, to impress the old enemies of Great Britain.<br/><br/>The game is played at the Grand Strategic level and each strength point equals 1,000 men or less. Players will assemble forces to seize control of colonies and regions. When French recognition is achieved, during 1778, an entire new dimension is added to the conflict. France, Spain and the Netherlands will bring fleets into the waters of North America and the Caribbean, challenging Britain&rsquo;s mastery of the seas.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the popular &lsquo;point to point&rsquo; movement system but more carefully modelling the geography of North America. This is done by enhancing the movement of armies along the important water shed basins. Armies are not destroyed in single combat as many past games have shown, but will demonstrate realistic casualty figures with prevalent retreat and disruption results.<br/><br/>War for America attempts to show the conflict from the British perspective and how a &lsquo;rebellion&rsquo; turned into a World War. Great Britain is alone, without allies, but the Colonies don&rsquo;t have it easy either. Despite their inexperience and individual identities, they must come together to create and maintain a Continental army. This is a &lsquo;large game&rsquo; but also contains a shorter scenario starting in 1778, taking about half the time to play.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>        Complexity: Medium<br/>        Time Scale: Seasonal turns (6 turns per year)<br/>        Map Scale: Area point-to-point map<br/>        Unit Scale: 1,000 men per strength point, individual capital ships, and leaders<br/>        Players: 2<br/>        Solitaire: Medium/High<br/>        Playing Time: 8 hours (15+ hours for Campaign Game)<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Components:<br/><br/>        2 Map sheets<br/>        2.5 Countersheets of 9/16&quot; and 5/8&quot; unit-counters (432 counters total)<br/>        6 Player Aid Cards<br/>        1 Sequence of Play Card<br/>        2 Army Organization Displays<br/>        1 Setup Card<br/>        51 Action Cards<br/>        1 Rulebook<br/>        1 Playbook<br/><br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Or would you rather visit one of each type of destination? Or are you the one to complete your tour plans? Now you can enjoy the beauty of Goa in this roll-and-write game.<br/><br/>In Go Goa, you have twelve days to tour the state, collecting souvenirs from different tourist destinations. On each day, you select three dice to decide the direction, distance, and deviation in the route that you will travel, then trace a route to your new destination.<br/><br/>In more detail, during each round the starting player rolls three dice, then reserves one die for the direction that only they can use. All other players use the dice to determine the direction to travel in, the number of steps, and the deviations they are allowed to take. Players then draw the route that they are taking for the day on their player sheet, which represents the map of Goa. The map contains tourist destinations, and if you end your movement on such a spot, you score points.<br/><br/>You also score bonus points for completing sets of five different destination types or three of one particular destination. In addition, you can score points for completing the tour plans that you chose.<br/><br/>After all players take their turn, a new round starts, with the starting player role moving clockwise.<br/><br/>The game ends after twelve rounds are completed. Players tally their scores for the tourist destinations visited and any bonus points that they may have collected along their trip. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Wayne Schmittberger adapted the rules for streamlined play.<br/><br/>From GAMES Magazine:<br/><br/>&quot;The oldest known form of chess, Chaturanga is a lively game in which moves are determined, as in backgammon, by a combination of dice rolls and player judgment.&quot;<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Ludoteka (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>The above article is incorrect, properly speaking. The game depicted with dice is &quot;Chaturaji,&quot; a gambling game often using dice. &quot;Chaturanga&quot; is the earliest known form of Chess, originating in India, and bares only superficial resemblance to Chaturaji, in that both games use a selection of similar pieces. Chaturanga is played on an 8X8 grid with two players, and differs from modern Chess in some fairly significant ways: there is no castling, there are no En Passant captures, and pawns do not gain an initial two space move; the Elephant or &quot;Gaji&quot; (which inspired the Bishop) jumps only two spaces diagonally; the Queen equivalent, the Mantri, or &quot;Advisor/Minister&quot; moves only one space diagonally in any direction, and games can be won by Bare King and -lost- by Stalemating an opponent (which is precisely the opposite of the Persian descendant of Chaturanga, Shatranj.)<br/><br/>Some moves and pieces are debated, as this is a very ancient game, and of course it evolved over time, but further research rewards a great deal of interesting discussion on the subject.<br/><br/>",

The Crusaders' goal was to free Palestine and the Near East from Muslim dominance, and restore Christianity's birthplace to Christian rule.<br/><br/>Based on the popular Royalists &amp; Roundheads system, the game features an innovative, easy to use command system that recreates the problems of command in an elegant and simple way.  Leaders are rated for command, initiative, and combat.  Special rules reflect the abilities and weaknesses of the Crusaders' heavy cavalry.  Each of the four games is complete in itself, and can be played in 1 1/2 to 3 hours, with the ever-present possibility of one side or the other triggering an automatic victory.<br/><br/>Contains the battles of Antioch, Ascalon, Acre, and Arsouf.<br/><br/>",

On these lazy breezy days, you may see cats lying on the roof, inside the bushes, under the cars, or any other funny places they see fit. During your visit today, take a walk around the blocks to see how many cats you can find in Cat Town.<br/><br/>Cat Town combines memory, hand-management and deck-manipulation, with players scoring points in three ways: finding cats, collecting items, and playing Travel notes cards. To set up, shuffle the deck of Cat, Item, and Action cards, deal two cards to each player, then create four or six &quot;blocks&quot; of cards, based on the number of players. On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then add the top card on that block to their hand.<br/>    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then reveal the top card on that block, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.<br/>    Playing an Item or Action card for the effect described in the text, then taking the action shown on the bonus icon.<br/>    Revealing a card at random from their hand, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.<br/><br/><br/>Each Cat in front of you as well as each pair of Items with the same name is worth 1 point. A Travel note played with three additional cards from the hand is also worth 1 points. The first player to score 6 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The first detective to collect 15 clues catches the serial killer and solves the case.<br/><br/>The first player will reveal a witness card and roll a D10. Add the value of the D10 with the number on the witness card to get the witness value. This represents the stress the witness will be able to endure before cracking. Each player's goal is to get as close to the witness value without going over.<br/><br/>Each player in turn order chooses to roll 1-5 of their D6. If their roll turns out lower than desired, the player may pay a clue to roll an additional die to add to the value. If a player exceeds the witness value, the witness cracks under pressure and gives bad information, causing the offending player to lose two clues. After all players have rolled, the player who is closest to the witness value without cracking the witness gains clues equal to the number of dice they rolled.<br/><br/>The game ends once any player gets 15 or more clues at the end of a round.<br/><br/>",

If you throw all your dice too hard and land in the &quot;water&quot; around the ice floe or you fail to roll higher or farther than a previously-placed die, then you place one die as a penalty on an ice block to the side of the board.<br/><br/>Once all players have rolled in a round, whether with three dice or four, players score. Whoever has a die on the ice floe scores points equal to the sum of the pips showing on their die AND all the pips showing on dice that didn't go as far on the ice floe AND all the pips showing on dice out of play on ice blocks. Score bonus points if you're on a fish net and lose points if you're on an ice hole. (If you have a die on an ice block, you do not score this round.) Thus, the farther you roll on the ice floe, the greater your scoring potential &mdash; not to mention the potential of landing in the water.<br/><br/>After scoring, start a new round beginning with whoever was first to place a die on an ice block, with all players once again rolling either three or four dice. The game ends the round that a player reaches or exceeds a certain point threshold, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Norway, 1940 is an operational level wargame of the German campaign to conquer Norway in 1940. The operation was a combined naval-air-land campaign in which all elements of military power were utilized. The historical campaign saw a German victory, but at the cost of much of the Kreigsmarine. Norway, 1940&rsquo;s game system is based on S&amp;T's award winning &quot;Red Dragon Rising&quot; system. It has been crafted to present the campaign as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The Action can alternately telescope or expand, representing periods of rapid activity alternating with the slower process of building up forces.<br/> Most ground units represent either brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent Luftwaffe &ldquo;Gruppen&ldquo;, or groups of three Allied Squadrons (i.e., 36-60 aircraft). Ship units mostly represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two battleships, or four cruisers, squadrons/flotillas of about six-twelve destroyers, or various numbers of other ships types. <br/>Each game turn represents one half-week of operations.<br/><br/>",

But make sure you only send artists to the ring who will be able to outperform the previous one. Because if you don't, the previous artist will take all the glory!<br/><br/>Animal Circus is a family card game where every player has the same deck of 22 animal cards. Each animal has a value and a unique special ability.<br/><br/>On your turn you draw a new card from your personal draw pile and afterwards you pick a card you want to add to the ring. You have to try to play a card with a higher value as the previously played card or the previous player will win all the cards that are present in the ring. When you played the card you must execute the ability on the card. This ability could have an immediate effect (for example transferring cards from your draw pile to your pile with won cards), a conditional effect (for example you win the cards in the ring if the card on top of you Win pile is 16 or higher) or a rule change (for example, the next player must play the card he draws in the beginning of his turn).<br/><br/>As soon as one of the players wins the cards in the ring and there is a player with an empty draw pile the game is over and the player who collected the most points wins (each card is worth 1 point with the exception of a few cards that are worth 3 and -3 points.<br/><br/>",

In a tie, players split the banana pot.<br/><br/>The next lot is for an amount of bananas equal to whoever has the most bananas.

The heroes might encounter helpful characters, find powerful weapons and items, but they might stumble into traps and other nasty obstacles as well.<br/><br/>Additional information: Monster Maker is a quite popular franchise in Japan, which became a considerably extensive fantasy universe over the years.

This time track introduces a novel system, consisting of two types of fields, which creates interesting and important decisions for the players: Either you move on the placement fields (for placing trolls on the board) or on movement fields (for moving trolls on the board).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Among Thieves is a fast-paced card game of thievery, cunning and dishonorable deeds.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a thief, trying to prove his superiority over the others by amassing a greater fortune. Everyone starts with the same set of action cards and each turn selects two, placing them face-down in front of him. Then, starting with the Acting Master Thief (first player), all players take turns in revealing one of their cards and completing its effect. This is repeated for the second card. At the end of the round, if there is no winner, all players discard one action card and play continues in the same fashion.<br/><br/>Every action differs from the others - some allow you to gain gold by robbing innocent citizens, some let you sabotage the plans of other players, and - of course - one of the actions enables you to steal directly from the fortunes of other players.<br/><br/>Among Thieves is a game of constant interaction between players, offers a unique mixture of strategy and intuition, and gives you the chance to prove once and for all to your friends who the real Master Thief is.<br/><br/>",

When in battle, each player will use it&rsquo;s army to fight and defeat the Moors and hence contribute to the victory of the Portuguese.<br/><br/>The players recruit the armies when D. Afonso Henriques meeple is in a circle over a small village in the Portugal&rsquo;s map. Respecting order of play, each player chooses the village he wants to go, in the villages area in the board, and places his cylinder in the available symbol.<br/><br/>Players can enter a battle when D. Afonso Henriques meeple is in the circles marked as battle. In it&rsquo;s turn, the player chooses one or more Portuguese cards from his hand to enter the fight. He places his chosen card(s) face up in the battle field, in one of the 4 spots available, in front of the Moors card that he wants to fight with. Each Portuguese card indicates in it&rsquo;s lower side the number of dice that the player is allowed to roll. If a Player uses 2 cards, he can roll the total dices resulting from the 2 cards. Each Moors card has in it&rsquo;s upper right corner a die with a value. If the highest result of any dice rolled by a player matches or is superior to this value, the player wins the fight and the Moors card is defeated.<br/><br/>The game ends after the battle of Ourique (the 5th battle). The player with more Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In this game you must get the most valuable characters to settle around your castle. You will have to develop your strategy by taking into account the advantage of your castle and the standards.<br/><br/>Be wary of the other castles, as they will all want to steal your best characters. Will you be able to make your kingdom the most prosperous and proclaim yourself victorious?<br/><br/>Each player receives a castle card at random and places it in front of them. Each castle has a particular advantage that must be used wisely.<br/><br/>Randomly put the number of standard on the table that is equal to the number of players plus one (3 banners for 2 players, 4 for 3 and so on). The standards are displayed for everyone to see and will be scored at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Next, shuffle the character cards and place them face down to form a deck. Next, turn over the first 4 and line them up next to the deck. These are the inhabitants available for populating your kingdom.<br/><br/>Shuffle the resource cards and deal 4 cards to each player. The rest are left face down on the table in a deck, on the other side of the character line-up. The first card is turned over and used to start the discard pile. The player with the most regal bearing starts.<br/><br/>How the game works<br/><br/>The person whose turn it is must perform these two actions in the following order:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw resource cards. You can choose to draw two resource cards from the top of the deck (unseen) or take the top card from the discard pile.<br/>     Add a character to your realm. To do this, select one of the available characters and pay for it by discarding cards from your hand that show the resources indicated. If you can do this, take the character from the line and place it in front of you. This makes them an inhabitant of your realm. If you cannot, or do not want to add a character to your realm, you must discard a resource card from your hand. You can buy as many characters as your resources allow.<br/><br/><br/>Each character has a resource cost and an effect on the game that is shown on the card. This effect must be implemented immediately after acquiring that character. Caution: some characters affect other cards.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn you must always replace any characters that have been bought from the line-up on the table by taking more cards from the character deck. This way, there will always be four characters available for the next player. &emsp;<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no cards left in one of the two decks (either resources or characters). When the last card is drawn, a final round is played.<br/><br/>Once the round is over, each bonus score standard is assigned to the player who best fulfils its condition. If there is a tie, no one wins that standard (unless you have Montreaux Castle). Each standard won adds 3 points to the final score.<br/><br/>To find out who the winner is, the players must add up the points earned by the characters in their realm plus the points awarded by any standards they have won.<br/><br/>If the final score is tied, the player with the most inhabitants in their kingdom wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hoping to bring a decisive conclusion along the Western Front despite the mud-and misery-filled trench deadlock, German General von Falkenhayn launched an attack from which the French could not retreat, and would prove costly for them to defend. The goal of the German offensive was the historic and symbolic city of Verdun.<br/><br/>The German attack used new weapons such as poison gas, fighter airplanes to clear the skies of enemy observation planes, and a massive collection of artillery to devastate the defenders and obliterate the extensive French fortifications. The offensive was meant to inflict staggering casualties upon the defenders that would compel the Allies to negotiate. In the end, the Germans also suffered casualties that ran to the hundreds of thousands, making Verdun a symbol of war's inhumanity as well as tragic sacrifice.<br/><br/>Designed by Roger Nord, Verdun: A Generation Lost is based on the same design as his other WWI game which appeared in Against the Odds magazine #11, The Big Push: The Battle for the Somme. Verdun: A Generation Lost features a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map that, like The Big Push, uses squares to regulate the game's functions, 264 large counters, and approximately 20 pages of rules and charts. Rules cover artillery, defensive fire, and close assault attacks, various types of weaponry, and there are six smaller scenarios covering pivotal aspects of the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Cherkassy Pocket: Encirclement at Korsun&quot;, In the depths of the winter of 1944, the Soviet Red Army executes a pincer operation against a salient in the German lines near the town of Cherkassy. Prevented from retreat by orders of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town called Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mount increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?<br/><br/>Cherkassy Pocket was designed by John Desch, and features a system similar to his wargames Wave of Terror and Berlin 45. Units are battalions and brigades, and the ground scale is 1.25 miles per hex. Each game turn represents 24 hours, and each player gets to move and perform combat twice in a turn. When it's time to activate friendly units, a player may choose to move first and then fight or vice versa. There are special rules to reflect the failure of Soviet tank maintenance, the use of the Korsun airfield as a supply source, Soviet difficulties in coordinating multi-formation attacks, and the ability for tank units to infiltrate enemy lines. Four scenarios allow you to play different portions of the battle, or to play the whole 23 turn campaign.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 1.25 miles / 2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (540 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Cherkassy Pocket rulebook<br/>Three single-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Astoria is two games in one : the board introduces a game named 'Combination Version' on one side, and another game named 'Epic Version' on its other side. Each version game puts the players in the role of powerful mages and alchemists, who are trying to find a cure to the strange and sudden illness that stroke the king of Astoria. The material included (four glass flasks, 60 shining gems in six colors, 66 cards) is used differently, depending on the game played.<br/><br/>The Combination Version is team-played. By placing gems, players put in place the components that will make them able to produce one of many different magic components. Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.<br/><br/>The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.<br/><br/>The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.<br/><br/>Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.<br/><br/>The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.<br/><br/>The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).<br/><br/>Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.<br/><br/>",

Deal five Character Cards and five Trait Cards to each player, and keep the remaining decks of cards in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The person wearing the ugliest shirt is Player One for the first round. If everyone is wearing the exact same shirt or if everyone is shirtless, the shortest person is Player One for the first round.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The round begins when Player One draws an Adventure Card and reads it out loud. Each adventure needs a character, and it&rsquo;s the job of the other players to provide the best one.<br/><br/>The other players choose a Character Card from their hand that&rsquo;s best equipped for that particular adventure, and place it face down on the table in front of them.<br/><br/>Then players get to attack one of their opponents. The same players choose a Trait Card from their hand to sabotage their opponent&rsquo;s character, and pass it face down to the player on their right. Players should not look at the trait that&rsquo;s passed to them.<br/><br/>At this point, each player (except Player One) should have the character that they chose along with the trait that their opponent gave to them.<br/><br/>Player One gathers all of the character and trait combinations and reads them out loud. Then, Player One decides which character is the best and worst choice for that particular adventure.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Players are rewarded for making poor choices &mdash; not good ones. The player who played the trait of the worst choice earns a point and becomes Player One for the next round.<br/><br/>The player who played the trait of the best choice must draw a Humiliation Card and do whatever it says to do. If the losing player has one or more points, he or she also has the option to avoid the humiliation at the cost of one point.<br/><br/>Finally, each player (except Player One) draws a new Character Card and a new Trait Card so they have five of each for the next round. The next round begins when the winner draws a new Adventure Card.<br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>The first player to earn five points wins. If you run out of cards, you can reshuffle them and continue playing. If you run out of time, the player who accumulates the most points wins.<br/><br/>If there&rsquo;s a tie after all of this, it&rsquo;s obvious that this group can&rsquo;t even make poor choices the right way &mdash; so nobody deserves to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This defunct CCG is primarily based on characters from Marvel comics, with DC and Image comics represented in later expansions.<br/><br/>Each player has a team of 4 characters, each rated in 3 or 4 skill types. At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can &quot;win&quot; the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage<br/><br/>A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions. (There is also a basic game option without the use of missions or conceding, in which the sole victory condition is knocking out the opposing team.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bibliogamo is a solitaire game of book production and libraries. In this game you will play the role of a publisher in the city of Bibliogamo. Using cards to hire artisans, you will put them to work in six city tower workshops, each devoted to a different kind of book. The Chief Librarian of the City will, in turn, tour the city buying books at what he considers their proper value. Prestige Collection cards generate victory points depending on how well you can fulfill the requirements of the Chief Librarian&rsquo;s collection.<br/><br/>Needed to play: the game board showing the city of Bibliogamo, the 47 Artisan cards, the 7 Prestige Collection cards, 26 black eurocubes representing your Artisans, and 16 red eurocubes to act as track markers in the game. Additionally you&rsquo;ll need one pawn to represent the Librarian.<br/><br/>Win: The game is over when the Time Track eurocube reaches [40] and you complete your turn. For each book you produce, you gain 1VP. For each 5 Florins you have, you gain 1 VP. Prestige VP is awarded as indicated on the Prestige Collection card chosen at the start of the game. Your total VP is your score for the game.<br/><br/>The Five Turn Phases:<br/>1. Move the time track eurocube forward one day closer to [40].<br/><br/>2. Move the Librarian Pawn clockwise 3 spaces, then turn over the top Artisan card from the draw pile on to the discard pile and move the Librarian accordingly as indicated by the Librarian icon on the left-hand side of the card.<br/><br/>3. Look at the small Artisan icon below the Librarian icon on this same card. You may not play any card with that Artisan symbol on it this turn unless you discard a card from your hand with a matching small Artisan icon.<br/><br/>4. You may now do any of the following, but in order:<br/>a. Pay 1 Florin to move the Librarian forward or backward one space. You may pay 1 Florin for each space you wish to move the Librarian.<br/>b. Sell a book, if completed, in the Tower the Librarian is currently standing on. Turn over the next 2 Artisan cards from the draw deck. Place the second card to the right of the first and look at the florin value on the second card as indicated by the Florin icon at on the first card. This is the amount the Librarian is willing to pay for this book. You may pay extra 1 day of time to turn over another card replacing the current Florin amount. You may continue to do this, paying 1 day of time per card turned over, until you are satisfied with the price.     <br/>Mark this amount on your Florin Track and return all Artisan eurocubes from the completed book to your pool. Then mark the production of a book on your Book track, moving the red eurocube forward one space, and if the book is one of those needed for a Prestige Collection, mark that book on the Prestige Collection card as well with a red eurocube. Note: you may pay extra days of time only if they remain on the Time Track. Lastly, place all drawn cards used to calculate the Florin value on the discard pile.<br/>c. Discard one Artisan card from your hand to the discard pile and place that number of black eurocubes on the Artisans indicated by the card, on any one Tower. Then discard one more card from your hand to pay for those Artisans. You may do this action twice if you wish. You do not receive any surplus Artisans from the discarded card. Nor do you receive any surplus Artisans if your tower already has the number required for that Artisan type. The second time you do this action you may add Artisans to the same tower or a different one.<br/><br/>5. Draw back to a hand of 5 cards. If the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard cards for a new draw deck.<br/><br/>",

When playing a card, players must play kales face up and everything else face down. After all players have played a card, reveal all cards and resolve from the highest number to the lowest. The player who played the fox can score an owl or rabbit. If the owl survives, it can score a rabbit, and so forth. There can be more than one player scoring a card per trick.<br/><br/>When a player has five scorecards, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>In a six-player game, players are in a team of two. Team is optional in a four-player game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "C.S.A. is a simulation game of the American Civil war. The USA player controls the Union side and the CSA player controls the Confederate side. The Game contains the rulebook, 288 counters, one color map and 10 sheets of charts and tables.<br/><br/>The game uses Ben Madison and Wes Erni's &quot;Charles S. Roberts Award&quot; winning Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 system to simulate the American Civil War. Units represent Generals (their component brigades are represented off-map), elite units (Iron Brigade, Cobb's Legion), cavalry (Stuart, Stoneman), guerillas (Quantrill, Kirk), and Indians (Choctaws, Delawares, Stand Watie). Like Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 random events and &quot;Special Event Coins&quot; are crucial, and there are about 400 (yes, 400) of them.<br/><br/>Forming stacks into 'Grand Armies' (e.g. Army of the Potomac, Army of Northern Virginia) enables the various commanders in the stack to coordinate their fighting powers. Cavalry have special abilities but also a habit of running away when you need them. Guerillas ravage the countryside (Quantrill, Price, Morgan -- and the less widely known Union barbarian, George Kirk). Generals do not always follow orders to move, and sometimes must be prodded by expending irreplaceable command chits. Special rules cover foreign intervention, the border states, as well as McClellan, Lee, Jackson and a few other characters. Naval warfare (Confederate commerce raiding) is handled by an extremely simple, elegant abstract model complete with a world map.<br/><br/>The game is won by either capturing the government marker of either player or destroying his economy. Capturing cities and winning naval battles increases the enemy's inflation rate, which affects a lot of elements like national elections (there are three over the course of the game--one in the Confederacy!) and reinforcement rates.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game (the theme of which is viewed as controversial by some) combines elements of wargames, dexterity games and resource gathering games. While set somewhere Nazi-occupied in Europe at the end of World War II, the theme is not actually historical. Players take the role of factions associated with Allied Powers, each of which controls a team of commandos which have associated special powers in the game. Each player starts from a different starting position and then they race to reach concentration camps where they use a dreidel to knock over and kill Nazi guards and so free prisoners.<br/><br/>The dreidel is also used in lieu of a d4 to allot movement points at the start of the turn; the amount of points allotted by a given spin corresponds to the traditional value of a spin in the game Dreidel. Different types of terrain on the movement board (covered by a grid of hexagons) require different amount of movement points. Some spaces also involve either aid and resources to be gathered or German patrols to be avoided. When a player lands on a concentration camp, his commandos raid the camp and kill guards.<br/><br/>The box lid serves as a second board where figures representing guards are placed. A player who is raiding a concentration camp then uses the dreidel to knock over and kill guards. This leads to freeing prisoners from the camp.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have freed the most prisoners when all concentration camps have been raided.<br/><br/>",

Does a hedgehog have a tail? Does a platypus have teeth? You'll find out if you play this game!<br/><br/>Tiles depicting certain characteristics (e.g. &quot;has teeth&quot;, &quot;is active during the night&quot;) are placed on the table. Tiles depicting animals are put face-down into six stacks. Each round, one animal tile is turned over and players simultaneously select characteristics that apply to this animal by putting a token on the tile. Each player may use four tokens per round, and there can only be one token per tile. When all players have finished placing tokens, players look up the correct characteristics in the solutions booklet. For each correctly assigned characteristic, they earn one pig chip, for each incorrect characteristic, they lose one. After five rounds, the player with the most pig chips wins.<br/><br/>Main differences to the big Können Schweine fliegen?:<br/>- 38 animal tiles instead of 60<br/>- 17 characteristcs tiles instead of 24<br/>- 55 pig chips instead of a scoring track with pig tokens<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you play a word to the table, with as many cards as you like face down. You announce the word, and everyone gets a chance to doubt you. You then show all the cards - if no one doubted you, you get the points for what you played (which could be QXZV, for a huge number of points). If someone did, you score if you were honest, with a bonus for each doubter. If you lied, the doubters get a bonus.

        "description": "Trike is a combinatorial abstract strategy game for two players. The game revolves around setting traps, dismantling opponent traps, and maneuvering a shared piece into your own trap to win.<br/><br/>Trike has high clarity due to the simple movement protocol, singular win condition, low branching factor, and easy-to-read board state. However, Trike is dramatic because it offers players many chances to make fatal errors.<br/><br/>Rules: Play on an equilateral triangular hexagon-tessellated grid. Use a neutral pawn and black/white checkers. Players take turns moving a neutral pawn around on the board (passing is not allowed). The neutral pawn can move any number of empty points, in any direction in a straight line, but cannot move onto, or jump over occupied points. When a player moves the pawn, first they place a checker of their own color, onto the destination point. Then they move the pawn on top of it. When the pawn is trapped, the game is over. At the end of the game, each player gets a point for each checker of their own color adjacent to, or underneath, the pawn. The person with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Implement pie rule. This means, at the beginning of the game, the first player chooses a color and puts a checker on any point of the board, with the pawn on top of it. At this time only, the second player has a one-time chance to swap sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>Trike is partisan, draw-less, finite, cycle-free, always decisive, scalable with board size, and balanced with the pie rule.<br/><br/>One note on gameplay: the score will always include one point for the last move, and one point for the second-to-last move.

It&acute;s goal is to form the most famous and rich group of Adventurers in the 4 Reigns. Characters can be of any 4 classes (warrior=Earth, Thief=Air, Cleric=Water and Mage=Fire), based on the 4 elements of Alchemy, or combinations of that classes. The game is a sandbox, so there are many types of actions that can be played at every turn: They can search for missions, rumours, adventures, slay wandering monsters, quest for artifacts, craft magical itens, upgrade their characters, travel through the Reigns, explore dungeons and other actions.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the group will meet friends, acquire new artifacts, meet some of the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot and become more powerful, so they can face their Ultimate Nemesis.<br/><br/>The game is based on Victory Points, so it can vary from 30 minutes to a whole afternoon or even more, if you choose the Campaing Mode.<br/><br/>",

The combination will differ each time you play!<br/><br/>Exacto contains 15 large, thick cards, each having a pair of holes in it, along with eight colored circles on the front side.<br/><br/>To play, shuffle the deck, then lay out two cards, one face up with the colored circles visible and the other face down with only the holes visible. The first player looks at the cards &mdash; without touching them or using any tool other than their eyes &mdash; then names the two colored circles they think are the same distance from one another as the holes on the face-down card. They then take the face-down card and overlay it on the face-up card to see whether they're correct. The match will be perfect, and if they're correct, they keep the face-down card as a point and return the face-up card to the bottom of the deck; if they're wrong, the next player names two colors, etc.<br/><br/>The next round starts with the player to the left of whoever most recently won a point. When only one card remains in the deck, the game ends, and whoever collected the most cards wins. Alternatively, play until someone scores their third point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Note: that this game is NOT to be confused with the Elfengold expansion set of the same name (also designed by Alan Moon).<br/><br/>Once upon a time in the Land of the White Winds...<br/>...there was an old and good-natured troll who owned a prosperous mine. The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.<br/>Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.<br/><br/>This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from. The question is - to dig or not to dig??<br/><br/>The winner is the first to 50 gold, or the highest gold when someone with 50 gold gets out of the mine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game DOVER PATROL by Harry Gibson is a wonderful Naval themed and early version of a type of hidden tactics game of skill. It was sold alongside the similar L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence and a more complicated game called Tri-Tactics designed as an incorporation of all three, by Gibsons and marketed together at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons).<br/><br/>Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, the U.K. distribution rights for which were acquired in 1925 by Gibsons. Dover Patrol was launched in 1911, whereas the original H. P. Gibson & Sons company was registered in 1919. Prior to that, The International Card Company operated between 1903 and 1919, when Harry Percy Gibson purchased ICC to form his company. Whether Harry Gibson designed the game is therefore open to some doubt.<br/><br/>The game play of Dover Patrol is very much like L'Attaque, which forms the basis of the near-identical game Stratego by Jumbo, published in 1946 after World War II when the patent would have expired. Gibsons themselves had to effectively &lsquo;start again&rsquo; around that time having had their premises destroyed in the Blitz.<br/><br/>The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.<br/><br/>Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.<br/><br/>To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.<br/><br/>In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.<br/><br/>It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    L'Attaque<br/>    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence<br/>    Tri-Tactics<br/>    Stratego<br/><br/><br/>",

Players place two each of six kinds of animals into two separate bags; someone shuffles the duel cards (after first removing any colors not in play), then places the four round cards in numerical order. Shuffle the three stacks of route cards, then reveal one card from each deck; each route card depicts an animal on the sign next to a taxi stop and some cards also show the animal on the card.<br/><br/>In each round, you'll draw the duel cards one by one, and for each duel card the two players shown on the card each take a bag, then race to find one of the animals depicted on a face-up route card in their bag &mdash; without looking inside the bag, mind you. If a player finds the wrong animal, then the opponent can still find one; if the player finds the right animal, he takes the matching route card from the display and tries to add it to his start card on either the left or right side. The number of paths on adjacent cards must match! If they don't match, the player returns the card, gaining nothing, and the next duel card is drawn. In addition, if the route card actually depicts the animal in question, the player keeps the animal token instead of returning it to the bag.<br/><br/>Once all the duel cards have been used, shuffle them and reveal the next round card. After four complete rounds or after one stack of route cards is empty, the game ends. Each player scores one point for each route card in her path and each animal in her collection; whoever has the high score wins!<br/><br/>",

The action cards are Freight Lost (-50 cards), Barrier (triangle with -1), Free Ride (triangle with +1), Really Free Ride (triangle with +2). They lay, face down, one card in front of them for their distance traveled (run), and one in the center for the kilometer counter. Players must have their runs in increasing order, with at most one rest card in between.<br/><br/>When the kilometer counter (center cards) reaches a certain limit (depending on the number of players) the stage is over. Players add up their runs. Five stages are played in a game and winner is player with highest run totals over the five stages<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SiegeStones is the second game published by Live Oak Games. In this one, players are trying to capture four towers.  The wooden board starts empty, and has a very simple design of 37 circles on it.  Players take turn placing either a &quot;stone&quot; or a &quot;tower&quot; on the board.  Stones threaten towers - whichever color presents the greatest threat to a tower controls it.  Towers weaken stones.  The board is scored after each player's turn. Once placed on the board, a tower changes ownership back and forth as players try to gain control of it.  The beginning of the game is very open, the midgame very strategic and challenging, the endgame is often a &quot;grab&quot; for the final tower.<br/><br/>More games can be played with the components of this game.

Who will help Hanna to make enough honey to fill the whole honey pot?<br/><br/>In this game you have 10 disks each with a colored flower on one side and a drop of honey on the other side. When you insert a disk flower side up into the top slot of the beehive it comes out of the bottom slot with the honey side up. It also comes with a honeypot board with 6 spaces on it to put the drops of honey when they come out of the beehive. There is also a die with the flower colors for faces. You roll the die and pick out that colored flower disk, insert it into the beehive then place it honey side up onto the honey pot board, if the flower symbol comes up on the die discard a disk. If you run out of disks before the honeypot is filled you lose, fill up the honey pot and you win.<br/><br/>",

Each knockout earns you a star, and grabbing an achievement card earns you extra stars. The first player to reach nine stars wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn players can use any of the button cards in front of them to gain extra movement, draw more cards, perform extra attacks, and block damage from opponents. Every time you press a button, you put a thumb token on that button card to show it's been used. You can press as many buttons as you like, but you can remove tokens from at most four cards at the end of your turn. Every other card with a thumb token still on it is then discarded, so pick your buttons wisely!<br/><br/>Aside from mashing buttons, you can play cards from your hand by paying the button cost of the card. Fighter cards are powerful and unique to your fighter. You can play multiple fighter cards on your turn as long as you have the buttons to pay for them, and if the last button on a fighter card matches the first button on the next card you play, you need to put a thumb token on that button only once! Pick the best cards to string together for a super-powered hit!<br/><br/>Super Punch Fighter includes a 1-2 co-operative mode called &quot;Minion Rush&quot; in which waves of minions try to overwhelm the board. Total your stars at the end to determine your rank, from lowly amateur to grand champion.<br/><br/>",

The team winning initiative rolls one die per squad.  The result tells how many soldiers in that squad may be moved that turn.  Each soldier may be moved any number of spaces in a single direction, stopping if they land on a jungle, river, or enemy square.  Up to two soldiers may enter the same enemy square.  Combat is resolved by dice rolls.  Ganging up with two soldiers allows an extra die roll (choose the higher number) and two chances to win the battle (only one of your soldiers may be captured at a time).  There are also rules for freeing captured allies and raiding the enemy supply depot.  The first team to successfully infiltrate the enemy headquarters wins.<br/><br/>",

On the board are placed, in a pre-movement round, tiles with three arrows which point to three of the eight surrounding spaces. Each player plays these tiles alternatively until they have all been played. Movement is made by following the arrows, and avoiding the neutral zone in the middle. The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.<br/><br/>The key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices. This adds an element of bluff and second-guessing to the game.<br/><br/>The rules also include some variations to the two-player game that make the game easier or harder to finish.<br/><br/>",

The first person to win three rounds wins the game (best 3 out of 5).<br/><br/>There's also the option to play the game using teams when you have more than two players, either through single combat teams or in tag-team combats. To accommodate an unlimited number of players at an anime/gaming/fandom convention, local game store/cafe, or any large gathering of family and friends, additional tournament rules are provided.<br/><br/>Everything needed to begin your dice battles is included in one box:<br/>&bull; 24 character cards, each featuring a hero or villain from the Sailor Moon Crystal series<br/>&bull; 24 polyhedral dice - four coloured sets of six different dice types<br/>&bull; 55 cardboard die-cut tokens representing special abilities, coins, and victory tokens<br/>&bull; 2 plastic card holders and 2 custom lanyards for social portable play that are ideal for playing at conventions or in other large groups<br/>&bull; 6 challenge cards to advertise that you are ready for a combat challenge, each featuring a super-deformed Sailor Moon Crystal character<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - M&uuml;nzen&quot; contains historical events related to coins and money, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The ruins of the old Orphan Asylum have mouldered on the hill outside town for as long as anyone can remember. But tales of the foul deeds once performed there live on. It is whispered that some foul spirit lingers, tied to a curse and unable to depart. Maybe one day somebody will have the pluck and luck to find the cursed relic and remove it from the asylum, releasing the ghost to rest in peace. Maybe that day is today. And maybe that somebody is you...<br/><br/>The Asylum is a small dice-based solitaire game. Each time a room is entered for the first time, a relic is found and dice are assigned for future moves. The player must complete three tasks to gain the clues that will identify the cursed relic. Then they must get that relic and escape from the asylum, all using the limited dice rolls available. Extra rolls are available by locking the room, but this shuts down the possibilities for future movement. And once the ghost is alerted to your presence it comes after you. If you get caught or trapped then you lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There might not have been a &ldquo;sun of Austerlitz.&rdquo; It was a bit after four that afternoon. The Russians had moved a column behind Gazan into Durenstein. His men, though victorious up to this point, were exhausted and nearly out of ammunition, with no relief in sight. Brigadier Jean Graindorge begged Marshal Mortier to escape the encirclement by boat to avoid capture or death. Mortier's answer was clear: &quot;No! We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; For most people, even veteran Napoleonic Grognards, the &ldquo;War of the Third Coalition&rdquo; has three distinct parts:<br/><br/>    Turning away from the aborted invasion of England, Napoleon takes his army on an astonishing force march, surprises Mack and much of the Austrian army at Ulm, and forces their surrender. <br/>    French capture Vienna, using sneaky tactics. <br/>    Big, decisive battle at Austerlitz. <br/><br/><br/>Game over.<br/><br/>Austerlitz may have been Napoleon&rsquo;s classic battle, in his own estimation. It was certainly one &lsquo;title&rsquo; he refused to award to anyone else, though several of his marshals coveted being named &ldquo;Duke of Austerlitz&rdquo; or something. No, it was his masterpiece. But it was not the only battle of the war. And another one might have changed everything. While most of the French army is heading for strudel in Vienna, a newly slapped together corps - the VIII - is chasing the Austrians out of Bavaria, looking to snap up stragglers, loot, and also block anticipated Russian reinforcements from making it to the decisive battle for Vienna that Napoleon expected to fight. Newly created corps often have ragged organization, and such was the case here. While Marshal Edouard Mortier had an entire division of cavalry under his command, he allowed most of it to separate on its own mission and then allowed the tiny remnant to go adventuring also. In tactical terms, he was &ldquo;blind&rdquo; when he reached the town of Durenstein, perhaps most famous as having the castle where King Richard I had been held for ransom.<br/><br/>Commanding a Russian army much closer than Mortier realized was the wily Marshal Kutuzov, who was neither blind nor overconfident. He saw the overextended enemy advance as a chance to strike a blow and suckered the lead division into a valley between two heavy Russian columns. Not only had Mortier lost touch with his cavalry, but he allowed his three infantry divisions to become widely separated as well. He was marching with his lead Division, under T.M. Gazan, into a situation that might have been known as the &ldquo;Valley of Death&rdquo; fifty years before a spot in the Crimea earned that title. Kutuzov did not have everything his own way, however, as the columns he wished to attack with were exhausted, starving, and freezing&hellip;hardly in condition to be launching an assault. But they did, in a battle that lasted for hours and on into the night. &quot;We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; Gazan (and Mortier) would certainly have &ldquo;perished together&rdquo; had not the nearest support, Dupont&rsquo;s division, covered a day&rsquo;s march in half the time. The battle sputtered on into a freezing cold night before the Russians finally withdrew, even more miserable than they had been at the start.<br/><br/>Both sides claimed victory, but, with 60% casualties, Gazan wasn&rsquo;t very thrilled at the outcome, though he may have felt better about it when awarded the highest Legion of Honor. Mortier&rsquo;s reward was simply to be reassigned&hellip; although he would later have a distinguished career, both under Napoleon and the rulers who followed him, dying under bizarre circumstances that merit a story all their own.<br/><br/>Now this hardly-known battle - fought three weeks after Ulm and three weeks before Austerlitz - can be yours to explore. Step into Mortier&rsquo;s shoes, in a truly &ldquo;Against the Odds&rdquo; situation. When the battle starts, you are outnumbered 4-1 in infantry, 20-1 in guns, and &ldquo;lots&rsquo; to &ldquo;almost none&rdquo; in cavalry. But Kutuzov has challenges too. His men are exhausted and hard to get into motion. These Brave Fellows' game mechanics cover the difficulties of coordinating attacks (and fighting in the snow), and variable arrival times of the Russian columns and supporting French. Optional rules allow players to explore the &ldquo;what might have been&rdquo; situations that were so close to happening - both sides had additional troops who could have been involved (or could have gotten there a lot sooner than they did). Can you, as Marshal Kutuzov, thoroughly smash the arrogant French and increase the shaky confidence of the Third Coalition? Can you, as Marshal Mortier, do better than &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; with the last few survivors and lower the battered Russian army &lsquo;s morale even further?<br/><br/><br/>    Map - One full-color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 216 full-color 9/16&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 10 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Low<br/>    Solitaire suitability - Average<br/>    Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>Before October 1944, no large German city had been directly assaulted by any Allied army. German soldiers were continuing to fight stubbornly throughout Europe, even after Germany's defeat became a certainty; so US commanders had every reason to worry resistance on German soil would be tenacious. In the city of Aachen itself, the street fighting was expected to be severe, just as it had been in other hard-fought cities. The situation along the border itself was even worse; the infamous West Wall loomed in front of Aachen, enclosing the city with miles of concrete bunkers, casemates and &quot;dragon's teeth.&quot; The sense of foreboding among the GIs assigned to the attack, as well as their commanding generals, was evident and warranted.<br/><br/>Aachen utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to fighter-bombers, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by anti-tank guns &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy regiment of engineers defending a road junction. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the road junction, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Aachen, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting in Aachen. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>",

The value of the colors start at 6 million and rise and fall according to the total chips played. So if 2+ Blue chips are bid, Blue rises by 2 million. But if only one Blue chip was bid, Blue falls by 1 million and if no Blue chips were bid, Blue falls by 2 million. If a color reaches 11 or 12, there is a pay-out for each Ace of that color you own, 5 or 6 million, and it is reset to 6 million.<br/><br/>Then the bid chips are taken back one by one, starting with the player to the left of the auction winner. So if you didn't bid at all, you'll be taking chips from high bidders.<br/><br/>Finally, then the starting player can sell a Card Fatale to the bank at its value or values (not one that has just increased). The player clockwise to the starting player is now the starting player. When the deck of 16 cards runs out, cards held are cashed out, chips still held are worth 1 million each (variant suggests they are worth nil) and the most cash wins.<br/><br/>It isn't clear if players should hide the cards they own, or if it should be an open knowledge game, which would greatly affect the dynamic. An amusing mechanism that draws you to brinkmanship.<br/><br/>Simple and smart, you'd reckon this was a Knizia game, but it's not!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.<br/><br/>",

The game is for two players, one directing the military forces acting to defend China against the Japanese, and the other commanding the forces of imperial Japan. The game can also be played with a third player taking the Chinese Communist forces.<br/><br/>The area map is drawn at approximately 75 miles to the inch. Units of maneuver are brigades, divisions, corps and armies. Specialist units (air, armor and artillery) are represented by abstract markers representing concentrations of those formations. There are 280 small-size iconic units. The 18 game turns are seasonal. The system is an evolution of the one found in Arriba Espana, which will have appeared in World at War number nine. Two experienced players can complete a game in about four to five hours.<br/><br/>Rules cover: KMT factionalism, anti-guerrilla operations, Japanese puppet forces, truces, foreign support and intervention, peasant revolts, atrocities, desertions and defections, famine, disease, off-map border clashes with the Soviets, united fronts, the Burma Road, the Indo-China railway, US lend-lease, the broader war in the Pacific, floods, amphibious assaults, fortification, cadres, shifting initiative, and more.<br/><br/>S&amp;T issue 259<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 21st century America--a place where money talks and politicians listen. In this game, you are a member of the uber-wealthy class and you use your fortune to bribe and influence law makers.<br/><br/>The game is a 2-player revision of Slush Fund.  While it has similar mechanics and ideas, there are important rule changes that make it quite a different game.  In the game, players use money cards to bribe 5 different politicians in an effort to score Victory Points for having the highest bribes on politicians at game end. The politicians start with a base value of VPs, but these may change during the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws 3 cards from the deck, chooses 2 of them to play, and places 1 in the Slush Fund (a face-up pile of presently unused cards).  If there are at least 3 cards in the Slush Fund, the player may choose to take 3 cards from the Slush Fund instead of drawing from the deck. In this case, however, the player can use all 3 cards. In addition to money cards, there are special cards, such as the Investigator, Journalist, Larcenist, and Accountant. Each of these provides a unique special power.<br/><br/>The game contains 54 cards and is packaged in a tuck box for ease of portability.<br/><br/>",

Fire When Ready explores this neglected era, allowing players to assemble fleets of battle wagons, cruisers, destroyers and torpedo boats.<br/><br/>From back of the box:<br/><br/>You Command in an Age of Valor...<br/><br/>Naval battles have always been a bloodbath.

From Manila to Tsushima you command in a playable, fast-paced recreation.<br/><br/>Fire When Ready has two player, solitaire, and multi-palyer scenarios with basic and advanced rules.

These 3 numbers are used to determine resource values during the action on the top card.<br/><br/>Read the text on the top card and complete the action.

The Gold track, located at the top of the Colony Map, will allow you to bank up to 299 gold. <br/>The bottom Tradegoods track will allow you to store a maximum of 20 tradegoods unless you build one or two of the Warehouses (each costs 10 gold), then you can store up to 10 additional tradegoods in each warehouse for a game maximum of 40 tradegoods. The righthand track lists various Trading Company Employee bonus upgrades.

The game represents the tactics and possible results of many of the battles of this period. These battles are shown as scenarios giving a mix of units which are played out on sections of the homogeneous mapsheet to represent the actual terrain (as much as is known) of the original battlefield. There are seven different types of infantry units, two of cavalry and several other units available in the game; these units are provided in different quantities for each of the Player's (sic) of a scenario to recreate the historical armies. The game Armageddon has 14 scenarios, each of them representing two armies of the period, and assigning them positions on the map on which the players recreate the historic battles.&quot;<br/><br/>Game components: 255 die-cut counters, heavy paper hex map with terrain features and the scenarios printed to one side of the mapboard, and a rulebook. One six-sided die is also needed.<br/><br/>Mechanics: Alternating movement turns consisting of fire phase, movement phase, and combat phase for one player, then second player does the same. No zones of control. Units have facing, and can only move into the three hexes to their &quot;front&quot; or change facing at a movement point cost. Stacking is limited to three units per hex, but applies only at end of movement. Units have &quot;front&quot; and &quot;flank&quot; melee combat strengths, and use the latter when attacked from any of the three rear hexes. Combat results are no effect, disruption, retreat, 1/2 elimination, or elimination, and only affect the defender.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have the highest scoring movie when the &quot;Roll the Credits&quot; card is played or when the draw deck is emptied.<br/><br/>",

Geography will determine areas of maneuver. Once battle is joined, commanders will have to decide whether to fight, reinforce, or withdraw. Winning or losing one battle may trigger military action on the part of other nations that can help or hurt your cause.<br/><br/>Command, supply, and technology will all play their respective roles in these wars. Each scenario has specific rules that focus the game system on the military advances and limitations of each of the 5 conflicts. Extensive historical commentary illuminates the importance of the military actions within the politics of 19th Century Europe.<br/><br/>The armies of 21 nations, large and small, took part in these struggles for continental domination - from France, Prussia, and Austria to Saxe-Meinigen and the Papal States. Every signficant field force is represented in this intensive study of strategy and operational interaction. Scale is 35 mies per hex and 3 days per turn.<br/><br/>BLOOD &amp; IRON contains Second Edition rules incorporating all known errata and frequently asked questions from the First Edition. The Second Edition rules may be distinguished by looking at the upper right hand corner of the back cover where the changes from the First Edition rules are noted.<br/><br/>There are three games called Blood &amp; Iron, the other two are more tactical.<br/><br/>",

Players start by building a battlefield, recruiting knights to their army, then deploying them. Players act in turn to maneuver their knights on the battlefield, and the combat potential for each type of troop differs, with heavy armored units moving more slowly and fighting better than lighter units. Pikemen can stop cavalry, while archers and longbowmen want to keep enemy units below them and light cavalry are ideal for chasing archers on horseback. The unique system of combat results has no randomness.<br/><br/>Players look for advantages and opportunities, attacking the enemy when it's too tired to run, for example, or claiming good terrain position. By using the power and mobility of his forces, a player tries to control more strategic points than his opponent and thereby win the game.<br/><br/>",

Some characters want to fall in hopelessly in love but others are more pragmatic - or just plain mercenary!<br/><br/>You'll discover your characters&rsquo; motives with the roll of a dice. Each character has a preference which makes them more likely to prefer a particular &lsquo;trait&rsquo; - Charm, Virtue, Rank or Fortune.<br/><br/>Making a suitable match &ndash; for example marrying one of your gold-diggers to a rich suitor &ndash; will earn you more prestige. The player who earns the most prestige wins the game. <br/>You can gain even more prestige by earning the approval of patrons. Mrs Norris only approves of people with a good fortune whereas Lady Bertram is more impressed by charm.<br/><br/>In addition to making matches, you can invite characters to prestigious residences to boost your prestige still further. Make sure you invite the right sort of guest, they don't approve of riffraff at Mansfield Park!<br/><br/>The original Matchmaker card game was intended for social play (3 or more players) but I received many requests for a 2-player variant. Jane Austen's Matchmaker: Chapter 2 was designed with this in mind.<br/><br/>Whether you play head to head or with up to three other players, you must assess each proposal and your chances of coming out on top, before you accept or decline.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What if Hitler decided to try again for Moscow during the summer of 1942 rather than plunging the Wehrmacht deep into the Caucasus and Stalingrad as he did historically?<br/><br/>&quot;Operation Kremlin&quot; uses the corps-army level units that were historically available for this campaign. The German player is on the offensive, seeking to win by controlling Moscow and other key cities. The Soviet player, though mostly defending, must watch for opportunities to deliver counterattacks against the Germans in order to inflict a decisive defeat upon them or upset the Axis alliance. <br/> Operation Kremlin's orders of battle are extrapolated from both sides' historic organizational charts of mid to late 1942. The Germans have the units which composed Army Group Center on 28 June 1942, along with all the panzer corps that were deployed elsewhere on the Russian Front. Manstein's 11th Army enters as reinforcement once Sevastopol falls. The Germans also have the Axis satellite armies, on the assumption that their own governments would have wanted to be able to claim participation in this &quot;final and decisive&quot; campaign in Russia.<br/><br/>The Soviet order of battle is based on their front line deployment of 28 June, along with all their Operational and Strategic reserves, plus just about everything they generated in the way of replacements and reinforcements during the time period of the historic Stalingrad campaign.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to side. Airpower is represented abstractly, representing the effects of one side or the other having local air superiority. Each full game turn represents one week.<br/><br/>Operation Kremlin gives wargamers the opportunity to discover what would have happened had the Germans struck for Moscow in 1942. Was this the last great chance for the Third Reich to win in the East? Or would it have led to an even greater &quot;Stalingrad?&quot;<br/><br/>",

The main event of the party is a scavenger hunt and you and your group of fellow scavenger hunters are one item away from completing the hunt. The only problem is, you've been locked in a dark warehouse and one of your team mates is a celebrity known as The Whitechapel Murderer, Jack the Ripper.<br/><br/>Strategies<br/><br/>Players have used many strategies to get ahead in Jack the Ripper. Some have found ingenious card combinations that help them race to victory. Many have sat back quietly and watched while others are picked off one by one. A few have gotten deeply involved in questioning the other players, trying to sleuth out which one is Jack. Some industrious players have learned all of the character names and are quick to claim to be one of the other scavenger hunters, hiding the fact that they are really the Ripper himself.<br/>Jack the Ripper is mechanically easy to play and it doesn't take long to get through a game but it is dynamic enough to allow for many potential strategies in both the cards you play and the style in which you play them. So you choose, take a pot shot at one of your opponents or talk it out and then decide who to attack!<br/><br/>The World of Jack<br/><br/>So you are trapped in a dark warehouse and you know that one of your group members is the notorious Jack the Ripper, you just don't know which one. The closest thing you can grab to protect yourself is from the bag of scavenger hunt items that your group has collected. Using these items, the partygoers try to find out who is Jack and destroy him before he destroys all of them.<br/>If Jack can murder all of the partygoers before they murder him, Jack the Ripper wins the hunt and prowls on in infamy. If Jack falls first, then the remaining partygoers share in the victory and become the heroes of Whitechapel. But would be heroes beware, Jack has some tricks up his sleeve to help take you out.<br/><br/>",

On arriving at the castle, you find some other kaleidoscope designers, and the Shogun gives you all an order: &quot;I want to see a magnificent kaleidoscope. You have to cooperate to create it! Gold will be rewarded to whoever's creation is the most outstanding!&quot; Let's see whether you can catch the Shogun's attention by creating a masterpiece!<br/><br/>In Kaleido, the players take turns placing their colored tiles (along with two white tiles) in the game boards. Before or after a turn, a player can add one of her two additional game boards to the playing area. When a hexagonal game board is filled, a scoring takes place, with the player who has the most tiles in this board earning 8 points and the player with the secondmost tiles 4 points; after scoring, the active player can rotate this game board as she wishes.<br/><br/>Once all the tiles have been placed, players then score for the filled hexes created by three adjacent hexagonal game boards, with scoring being the same as for those hexes filled during the game. Whoever has secured the best positions on each game board and rotated her tile to serve double-duty will win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nemo Rising: Robur the Conqueror is a co-operative board game that follows the new adventures of Captain Nemo and the crew of the Nautilus, as reintroduced by C. Courtney Joyner in his novel, Nemo Rising. The game allows 1-4 players to assume the roles of the protagonists of the series &mdash; Captain Nemo, Sara Duncan, Adam Fulmer, or Ulysses S. Grant &mdash; as they explore new worlds, overcome dangerous obstacles, and complete challenging missions.<br/><br/>As you and your fellow players work together, you can choose to explore one of two scenarios. The first scenario is the Undersea Grotto, in which you must venture outside the Nautilus to gather supplies while avoiding sea hydras, deep sea scavengers, and the mechanical Kraken. The second scenario is the majestic City in the Sky, in which you must thwart Robur the Conqueror and his army of foot soldiers, war dogs, and steam-powered creations. Special action cards and customized dice allow you to attempt dangerous tasks and overcome powerful enemies in order to save the world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is the first entry in the Riding Series, all published by Winsome Games.<br/><br/>In West Riding there are two types of shares, Basic and Grouping. The primary strategy of the game revolves around these, as Basic Shares can be traded in for Grouping ones at a 2:1 rate, and the grouping shares slowly gain in value as the game progresses. The mechanics of portraying the theme do result in some extra bookkeeping as the game's eight railroads' values need to be reassessed with each turn.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.  If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>The set, for the Italian market, Penne e Pennelli contains historical events which are related to writing, printing, and art. Like all Anno Domini the Penne e Pennelli edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Anno Domini the Penne e Pennelli is a functional merger of two previous set themes,  Kunst and Wort Schrift Buch.<br/><br/>",

Each player holds two animal cards stating the type and amount of terrain needed, five multi-terrain tiles, and wild cards. On a turn, they may lay up to three tiles, place one or both of their animals in free-form contiguous blocks of appropriate terrain, and use all or some of their wild cards. The starter tile has two blocks of each of the four terrain types: forest, grassland, desert and water. The number of blocks of terrain needed by an animal is equivalent to the number of points you can score by placing it. When the tile supply is exhausted, each player takes a final turn, then loses points for any unplaced animals still in hand. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Komodo can be played competitively in both basic or strategic mode. In the former, wild cards are obtained randomly; in the latter, players can choose their wild cards. Actions permitted by a wild card include: releasing animals to free up their terrain; bartering or stealing terrain tiles; remodeling tiles already placed; and forcing an exchange of animals.<br/><br/>In the cooperative version of Komodo, all 32 animals must be housed and each player must place at least one animal during their turn. The game is played open-handed, and the wild cards hinder the players.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s a game about making decisions, picking the best DISC, applying SKILL, avoiding TROUBLE, hoping for LUCK, and making the PUTT.<br/><br/>Just like Disc Golf, the aim in Final Nine is to complete your chosen set of HOLES in the lowest number of THROWS possible. It's for 1-4 players, ages 10+, has 108 cards, and takes 30+ minutes to play (full 18). It comes with 2 sets of rules: Standard and Battle, 3 Levels of Play: REC, AM, and PRO. You can also play an easier game using half the pack, or full which is harder. The card swapping and play system allows for a rapid turnover and randomness of cards, allowing for massive replayability.<br/><br/>To play, lay out the HOLE cards as a board sized grid course (9 or 18 cards), or stack the HOLES in order/shuffled. Each player receives 9 cards for their HAND, made up of DISC and ACTION cards. Swap two cards out at the beginning of a new HOLE. Play a DISC card to match the HOLE GRIDS and find a safe landing spot. Add SKILL if you, can then draw the next ACTION card to see if your THROW was a success, or you end up with a DEVIATION or CALL. If TROUBLE has effected your THROW, add LUCK to nullify it. Once you are within 2-3 GRIDS of the BASKET, use a PUTTER to complete the HOLE.<br/><br/>Final Nine is like a little fun Disc Golf course in your pocket. It's for those times you can't get to the course because of weather or injury, for those who already play, and those who would like to learn more about the sport. Play your game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player&rsquo;s forces are represented by military units and Stratagem markers. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning strategy to maintain and increase their power.<br/><br/>The Belisarius rules are based on the Charlemagne (S&amp;T #189) and Xenophon (S&amp;T #203) games.

Once you have a contract, you'll need to keep producing that product every few turns, or else you lose the contract and someone else can claim it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The sub-title for Troke is &quot;Castle Checkers&quot;.<br/><br/>Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards.  In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete &quot;castles&quot; (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.<br/><br/>",

Players race to get rid of the cards in their hands by creating sets and runs in the middle of the table. Don't have the right cards? No problem -- grab from a set or run already on the table, or play your cards on any existing set or run.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of Out of the Box's Fun to Go series, the tin contains 72 cards: 1-12 in five colors, 9 wild cards, and three draw-3 cards. The entire deck is dealt out, then each player takes a hand of 8 cards from their draw pile.  There are no turns &mdash; players may do any of the following six actions, at any time and in any order: play a set or run, play a wild card, draw a card, add to or draw from a set or run, or play a draw-3 card. A set is 3 cards of one number; a run is 3 consecutive same-colored numbers. They are set down so that each player can see and reach them. When a player has got rid of all the cards in their hand, the round ends immediately. Each other player must then add points to their score for cards remaining in their hands: 5 points per number card and 10 points for each wild or draw-3 card. After four rounds the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

Your task force must defeat the Earth Federation ships in the area and seize the primary surface base.<br/><br/>The opposition forces are controlled by the game system using a deck of cards whereby a card is drawn after the player moves a task force, which may result in a new opposing force being placed where the task force just moved and forcing combat to occur. Some locations are more likely to have larger opposition forces to appear than others and although initial opposition forces will be relatively small, resistance will increase as their alert level increases.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with a number of assembly points with which they can use to custom-build their fleet, including adding special weapon pods to ships to provide benefits such as drone defenses and cyber warfare abilities to keep enemy alert levels lower. If your fleet includes an assembly ship, you can even repair and alter your fleet even after your attack on Ceres begins.<br/><br/>Four increasingly difficult missions must be completed to win the campaign game. Along the way, additional ships arrive and pods are constructed to increase strength and technological capabilities. A unique card system counts down the time remaining and provides challenges and opportunities at every orbit.<br/><br/>In this game the player takes command of a Rebel task force attempting to complete missions critical to securing the Ceres water base. Your success will ensure Mars and other colonies have a major source of water for survival and the Earth Federation will be forced to haul water up the deep and costly gravity well from Earth.<br/><br/>This game is set in the Free Mars universe and is a prequel to the Free Mars boxed game.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>&bull; 11 x 17&rdquo; map<br/>&bull; 40 die-cut counters<br/>&bull; 18 mini cards<br/>&bull; Scenario Instructions<br/>&bull; Four page rule booklet<br/><br/>",

Though 'history' will be similar to actual events, the subtle (and not so subtle!) introduction of advanced technology and super science will make the outcome quite different.

Individual games are strung together into a 6-game campaign where the enemies gradually get stronger, and you must upgrade your squad to keep up.<br/><br/>The second edition greatly expands the contest version of the game, with more possible card combinations, 2 additional mechs and 2 additional maps, the addition of pilots, and status tokens instead of dice.<br/><br/>Bury Me in the Rift is completely inspired by the excellent video game, Into the Breach, by Subset Games.<br/><br/>",

But these figures appear in slightly different situations than usual. In addition there are many monsters in Bizzaria, which are actually the main focus of the game. How bizarre these monsters will be depends on the players...<br/><br/>The monsters in Bizzaria are created together by players. During the game the monsters are increasingly shaped in their looks and foremost in what they say. The players use parts of cardboard faces and assemble them on a paper. Then they draw the monster around them and these papers represent the &quot;game board&quot;. Thus the &quot;game board&quot; is different and unique in each game. The cards in the game are used for the TV announcements and questions. All these clues lead the player to perceive the monsters in a certain way. In each round a special question is asked - in the form of &quot;Which of them is like this and this?&quot;. The players then look at the monsters and try to find three of them that (according to their opinion) best answer the question.<br/><br/>After each player secretly writes down his three choices they are all revealed and scored. The game also includes expansions and specialties.<br/><br/>The players have two essential goals. The first is to build up the character of the monsters where in each round the monsters comment on the actual course of events in a Bizzarian TV. The comments are entirely up to the players and they can range from a single interjection (Meow) to highly sophisticated expressions (If he were not a nihilist, I would not be such a therapist). The second goal is to understand the character of the monsters in light of the other players' thoughts.<br/><br/>",

For this, he will receive a reward:<br/>- If the building is not yet completed, he scores one point for each cube that is still needed to complete it.<br/>- If the building is completed, the tile is flipped, and the player gains the reward shown on the tile.<br/>In addition, if the building is completed, any other nearby architects will receive an Intrigue card that will give them some benefit.<br/><br/>Certain combinations on the dice (rolling seven or rolling doubles) allow the player to take a Corruption token (worth -5 to 0 points) to gain a specific benefit, such as a reroll or a double building action.<br/><br/>When there is no more building to be done, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Languages : English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.<br/><br/>",

Here, the medieval fantasy races &mdash; elves, dwarves and humans &mdash; usually associated with heroics, part of an extremist fundamentalist sect called the Order of Light The Order of Light, lead an inquisition against intelligent creatures of evil or chaotic nature, commonly. Monster races &mdash; the Greenskins, Immortals and Draconians &mdash; and virtually wiped out of the face of the planet.<br/><br/>The few monsters who survived the purge of the Order of Light have gathered in the rubble of the Last Black Fortress. They have to put their differences aside and use their instincts to find a way to, together, prevent their races from becoming extinct. But every leader of every race, in and out of Fortaleza, has a personal goal that can cause it to dominate other races once and for all and write your name in the history books, not as a monster, but as a hero.<br/><br/>Find new challenges and adventures in our new game H&eacute;rois &amp; Monstros, plus you get special and exclusive cards that will help you defend your fortress.

On 22 June, more than 2,000,000 Soviet soldiers stormed the heavily fortified lines of the badly outnumbered German Army Group Centre. The German defences quickly crumbled under several sledgehammer blows. German armoured reserves rushed forward, desperately counterattacking to stem the on-rushing Red tide in the climactic Battle of Minsk.<br/><br/>Firestorm Campaign<br/>In Firestorm&mdash;Bagration, you command the Soviet or German forces fighting for Byelorussia in the critical months of June and July 1944. <br/>Put yourself in command on the Eastern Front using your Flames Of War historical miniatures on the table&shy;top. Each battle recreates a major engagement. The outcomes of your battles determine the fate of the campaign.<br/><br/>The General&rsquo;s Wargame<br/>The General&rsquo;s Wargame is a fast-paced two-player Board game based on Firestorm&mdash;Bagration that uses all the contents of the box and takes 60 to 90 minutes to play.

Instead of a mere company, you can field your entire collection with thousands of points of Flames Of War troops arrayed across a large battlefield.<br/><br/>Partisans &amp; Polizei<br/>While the generals plan their campaigns, more personal battles are being fought. Vasiliy Kravchenko, a partisan leader, and his Polizei nemesis Dieter von Gaudron wage their own war in the fields and forests of Byelorussia. This presents a small-scale skirmish game for use with your FOW figures.<br/><br/>River Crossings &amp; No Retreat<br/>Also included are new rules for crossing rivers, common yet formidable obstacles in Byelorussia. Use these rules to succeed in the new River Crossing Mission and the Crossing the Drut scenario, both found within.

        "description": "This is a reincarnation of TCG &quot;Duel Masters&quot; with some minor changes in rules.<br/>Each player has a deck full of creatures and spells. The goal of the game is to finish an opponent with one of your creature's attacks. However, each player is protected by 5 shields, represented by face-down cards from a player's own deck. When your creature attacks an opponent (and is not blocked by another creature) it breaks one of his shields, and the shield card goes to the owner's hand.  When your creature attacks a defenseless opponent, you win the game.<br/><br/>The game has some similarities with the grandfather of collectible card games - Magic: the Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. However, it has two major differences:<br/>1. There is no distinct card class for producing mana. The same cards, representing creatures and spells, can produce mana if placed in the Mana Zone instead of the Battle Zone. This removes what many see as a major flaw of Magic: the Gathering - &quot;mana flood&quot; and &quot;mana screw&quot;.<br/>2. There are no instant spells or activated abilities. Therefore, there are far fewer surprises for players from their opponents and also fewer tactical decisions during play. On the other hand, it plays quicker and can be easier for children to learn and understand. Even so, it has strong strategic aspects and fun deck building.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eisw&uuml;rfeln (or 'Ice Cream Dice') is a fast-paced dice game for ice cream lovers of all ages. With a dash of luck and a big scoop of risk-taking fun, you&rsquo;ll spend each round rolling dice to get the right types of ice cream so you can assemble a tasty sundae and earn points. You can grab extra points if you create a sundae which matches the target exactly. But be careful: if you get too<br/>greedy and don&rsquo;t roll enough money to pay for the ice cream at the end, you&rsquo;ll finish the round empty-handed. You should also avoid rolling too many suns, or your ice cream will melt along<br/>with your points. Whoever reaches 25 points or more after several rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Use your hand of item and modifier cards to construct a diabolical weapon (such as &quot;1000 electrified hamsters&quot;) with which to attack a fellow player. Then you must tell a story about how you will use this implausible but fearsome weapon to destroy your opponent. The other player gets to build a defensive item in the same way (maybe a &quot;radioactive garden gnome&quot;) and describe how it prevents or deflects the attack. The rest of the group then decides who is the winner of the battle.<br/><br/>In 2006, an expansion was released called Stupiduel Fantasy Expansion.<br/><br/>Expanded by<br/><br/>    Stupiduel Fantasy Expansion<br/>    Stupiduel: Modifiers & Tricks Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rolling World, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the world that's divided into regions, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild gray die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the gray die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-gray die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)<br/><br/>After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After a number of rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on their map wins.<br/><br/>",

You and your fellow players vie for control over the major cities of Britannia by spreading your mobs, collecting payouts, and using secret intelligence to advance your influence.<br/><br/>Gangs of Britannia is a game that has been known to test even the strongest bonds between players. The game relies on a unique face down 'Prisoner's Dilemma' mechanism that determines between a deal or deception of your fellow players. If all players choose to 'deal', then they are all rewarded moderately and equally. If exactly 1 player deceives, the deceiver destroy enemy mobs and strengthens their own gang. But if more than one player deceives, then all deceivers lose out and those who chose to deal stay out of the fray. This prisoners dilemna mechanism is combined with secret information, where players have intel on bonuses and penalties in cities which they can use to their own advantage and also to mislead their opponents.<br/><br/>In a game where luck decides little, carefully pick who you're forging deals and alliances with as betrayals can lurk behind the next card. One thing is certain amongst the Gangs of Britannia - trust is slowly built but quickly broken...<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to complete the treacherous journey while keeping as much money as possible to start your new life.<br/><br/>In The Oregon Trail Game: Journey to Willamette Valley, based on The Oregon Trail video game, players place tiles to discover the trails, rivers, forts, and towns in order to move to this new land. This scenic journey would almost be perfect if it weren't for the disease, starvation, drowning, rattlesnakes and other hazards that will plague you along the way.<br/><br/>The biggest reward would be arriving with your family, but there's also limited space for supplies in your wagon. Soon, you'll find yourself debating on the pros and cons of traveling in a wagon with so many people as the winters grow harsher, supplies dwindle, and the food grows scarce. As you throw your dead out of the wagon, you realize you'll miss them&hellip;but it's better this way.<br/><br/>In this competitive racing game, every wagon is for themselves. To start, you will serve as a pioneer and gather your wagon, family members, food, and a pistol. You must hunt for food along the way to help your family avoid starvation. Otherwise, their funeral expenses will deduct from your total fortune.<br/><br/>To undergo the wilderness and face the calamities, you must prepare wisely. During gameplay, you can take up to three of the following actions: move, hunt, buy, pick up hitchhikers, and sell. There are also free actions that do not count against your turn, such as crossing the river and using medicine. Therefore, you must be strategic in your decision-making.<br/><br/>Players continue to take turns until a wagon reaches Willamette Valley or the last trail tile is placed on the board, signaling the end of the game. Your fortune is calculated and the pioneer with the most money will prove victorious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New from the father of VPG's Napoleonic 20 series, renowned game designer Joseph Miranda, the von Clausewitz series brings you the great campaigns of what historians call &quot;The Long 19th Century&quot; -- that period between the French Revolution and World War 1. The series seeks to faithfully demonstrate how war was thought about and waged during this epoch. It features quick, streamlined gameplay, simple but not simplistic mechanics, card play, and the fog of war.<br/><br/>Unique to the series, and following the theories of Clausewitz himself, players must be aware that many of their actions will build Friction Points -- which a wily opponent can then use against them to sabotage their best laid plans. Careful management of reserves and reinforcements, clever card play, and knowing when to throw caution to the wind to strike at an opponent will win the day.<br/><br/>The first game in the von Clausewitz series is Franco-Prussian War 40. Two continental heavyweights duel for supremacy in the conflict that smashed the French Second Empire, triggered the Paris Commune, and birthed the German Reich, with fateful consequences for Europe and the world. The German player must strike fast while holding the advantage in numbers, careful not to overextend his forces and put his tenuous supply lines at risk. The French player must seek to hold off the initial German invasion and defend Paris until he can unleash the Republican forces of the Third Republic. Will the war end in the streets of Paris, or Berlin? The fate of Europe hangs in the the balance!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 5.5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit represents an army, or corps (approximately 20,000-60,000 men and their equipment). Each space on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Each turn represents a half month of operations.<br/><br/>",

In the trick-taking card game Djinn, every captured trick shows the way to treasure, but the djinn can unexpectedly intervene in the action. Who can enter the famous treasure cave first?<br/><br/>A game of Djinn lasts multiple rounds, with each round being eight tricks. Standard trick-taking rules are used, with players needing to follow suit of the card led, and throwing off whatever card they want if they can't follow suit. The deck contains four suits, with cards numbered 1-15 in each suit. Each player starts with a hand of eight cards and one djinn card that contains a special power a player can use on their turn. The top card of the deck is flipped to reveal the trump suit. Whenever a player wins a trick, they keep one card from this trick face up in front of them, discard the remaining cards, then lead to the next trick.<br/><br/>After the round ends, players see whether they can discard captured cards to advance into the treasure cave, which is made up of three lines of challenge cards, with each challenge requiring three, four, or five cards depending on the row where it's located. Sample challenges might be to discard three cards that sum to more than 30, three cards of the same color, or three cards in numerical order. If a player completes one of the three challenges requiring three cards, they discard these three cards, then place their player token on the &quot;three challenge&quot; row. At the end of the next round, they can ideally complete one of the three four-card challenges. Players who are in the back of the pack receive a bonus djinn card before the next round begins.<br/><br/>The first player to complete one of the five-card challenges wins! If multiple players reach this row at the same time, ties are broken by the number of captured cards those players still hold.<br/><br/>",

Join a mob of monsters competing in a tournament for the Crystal Idol.<br/>Experience epic battles between various monsters - all with unique abilities - and adapt your strategies to achieve victory in this Capture-the-flag style boardgame!<br/>The goal of the game is to outmaneuver the other mobs with the help of your chosen monsters and to bring the Crystal Idol from the altar to your camp. Every Monster has different abilities to achieve that. The player who gets the Crystal Idol into his camp wins immediately, everyone else loses.<br/><br/>The battle for the Crystal Idol takes place once a year. Different monsters from various mobs participate. The goal of the battle is to be chosen for the academy and to become a follower of the great QUARZ, the almighty extraterrestrial being which changed the world forever. For this to happen the players have to show that their mob is unique and worthy to be the new disciples of the crystal.<br/><br/>After choosing the monstermob, every player takes control of 3 unique monsters, each with its own deck of action cards. On your turn, you perform two actions, selected from the basic abilities every monster can perform or the 4 unique abilities every monster has in their decks.<br/><br/>The longer the game lasts, the stronger all monsters can become since they may munch an ability to gain a permanent bonus.<br/><br/>To win, the players have to retrieve the crystal idol from the altar in the middle of the map and bring it to their camp, overcoming obstacles and enemy monsters. Whoever achieves this wins immediately.<br/><br/>However, since every player has the same goal, the task might be harder than it seems.<br/><br/>Especially with the powerful shrine abilities, which can, if activated by a monster, change the whole map drastically. In QUARZ, every player has to constantly be aware of the state of the board, to maximize his or her own chance of winning while preventing the enemies&lsquo; win.<br/><br/>QUARZ has a high replayability, since not only the combination of monsters in play can vary, but also is played on a modular board, which will change for each setup.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 1940-December 1943, Mediterranean Sea<br/><br/>Standing alone, the British Empire must replenish its strategic bases in Malta and Alexandria by convoys coming for the most part from Gibraltar. Each journey is long and dangerous facing Italian SM-84 torpedo planes and German U-boats. On the other side, Italy and Germany are sending more and more troops to North Africa under constant threat from aircraft in Malta and facing the imminent entry of the United States into the war.<br/><br/>In this original card game, the cards represent units that took part in naval engagements or fought near convoys in the Mediterranean during the Second World War. For each trick called engagement, a player takes an Operation card (Battle or Convoy) and declares the type of attack to be used (air, surface, underwater or combined). He follows that up by playing a Force card which has the specific values representing a historical Allied or Axis unit. The other players subsequently play either a Force card or pass. When all the players have made their selections, and any possible dice rolls have been made, totals of both sides are compared to determine whether the Axis or the Allies won. The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side. After twenty-two convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!<br/><br/>Med Sirocco is a strategy card game for 2-6 players. The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular (and out of print) 1997 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm and Pacific Typhoon published in 2008 by GMT Games.<br/><br/>",

If a player cannot move the required number of spaces on his turn, he picks up his token and places it on any space he wishes.)<br/><br/>Whenever a newly placed tile shows a bandit on it, the bandit figure moves one space closer to the cave entrance. A player can move to the cave entrance and exit the cave, keeping all treasures that he's collected &ndash; but if the bandit figure reaches the entrance while a player is still in the cave, he loses all his treasures (and undoubtedly his head).

        "description": "A 2 player abstract game using a board made from separate square tiles, with channels at right angles to control movement, on both sides of each tile. Players must get 4 of their 5 pieces across the board and can rotate a tile 90 degrees each turn. The trick in the game is that you can move on the paths over the tiles, then move on the paths underneath the tiles, then move again on the surface.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of tile. One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look. The board is set up randomly in a 5x7 grid.<br/><br/>When travelling underneath, you must travelling under at least one stone on the surface, of either player. If you do go under an opponent's stone, you are allowed a further tile rotation at the end of your move (a key bonus that gives you an edge). You are not allowed to move a tile that your opponent just turned, but otherwise you can rotate any tile at all.<br/><br/>The new edition by Abacus is in card, with little wood posts to help lift and turn the tiles. The first edition is a nice wooden edition, part of a range of games by the firm Clemens Gerhards.<br/><br/>Moguli seems like a brain-burner at first, but quickly the possibilities become obvious, and as only a few tiles move, you can read the paths on both sides very easily. You move from trying to figure the board, to trying to figure your opponent's options and how to exploit them. Moguli is a very interesting abstract that seems gimmicky at first, but soon becomes a clever challenge and very entertaining.<br/><br/>",

Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/> Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>",

Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>Second Edition Updated Rules<br/><br/>Stackable Traits are no more! <br/>To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled. Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.<br/><br/>Trait-or-Fire!<br/>Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.<br/><br/>Spicing Up Events!<br/>The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.<br/><br/>Faction-Only Cards!<br/>Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).<br/><br/>Module Overhaul!<br/>There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).<br/><br/>Say Goodbye to Characters!<br/>Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.<br/><br/>First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!<br/>We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.<br/><br/>New Combat Mechanics!<br/><br/>Initiative in Engagements<br/>Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.<br/><br/>Attacker and Defender<br/>Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot. So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.<br/><br/>New Skirmish Phase<br/>The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish. Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only. No more extra turns for defenders!<br/><br/>Boarding Actions<br/>Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order. You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Encounters: Bravest Warriors is a quick push-your-luck dice game set in the world of the Pendleton Ward cartoon. Players roll dice, assigning them to encounters to defeat those encounters and earn Heroic Points. After beating an encounter, the dice used are spent, and another encounter can be revealed, but the player must use only the remaining dice. Players can stop rolling any time they want, but if a player manages to use every single one of their dice, they can take all their dice back and keep going, with each encounter being worth double points! You can spend these points on later turns to buy item cards that can help you manipulate the dice.<br/><br/>If you fail, other players can leap at the opportunity to &quot;assist&quot; you (using their items to help you win in exchange for half the points, and you can't refuse!) or just let you fail and ride on your coat-tails, picking up where you left off.<br/><br/>",

You have to get a special order of symbols to get the ultimate move to defeat your enemies. But beware! All other gladiators are trying to get that same combination and they will do their best to make you fail!<br/><br/>The objective of the game is completing a certain order of symbols set by a &quot;combo card&quot; each dice has 6 different symbols and they have to both match the symbols and their order shown in the &quot;combi card&quot; to win the game.<br/>You begin the game by rolling your 5 dice and leaving them in the order you rolled them, then you draw 4 cards from the deck. Each turn, you play one card from your hand and draw another, cards affect your dice or your enemies'. Move them around, change them, or re-roll them to get the winning combination! You must be fast and finish before someone else completes it or changes the required combination seconds before you win the game!<br/><br/>Bloody sands Dice es un juego basado en el universo de Cruentis que es el mismo de bloody sands arena, a diferencia de arena aqu&iacute; encontraremos dados, estos est&aacute;n personalizados con un s&iacute;mbolo en cada una de sus caras.

In the board game the players will cast spells with effects that will simulate the effects seen on the screens in the parks.<br/><br/>Cards are interchangeable between the home game and playing the game in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World.  Cards are acquired either through the home-game booster packs or in packs of 5 at the Magic Kingdom.  A registered player can get one pack per day at the theme parks.<br/><br/>The home-game booster packs currently sell for $11.95 and are only available at the Emporium in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, but as supply increases they will be available at other locations at WDW as well as on-line through the Disney Parks Store.<br/><br/>",

In the end, whoever has implemented the most political goals, will win.<br/><br/>Every round there is a parliamentary election campaign where players can spend their food tokens on different animal species to win their votes for the next parliamentary election.

Will you honor your pledge to this order, and take arms to face this world&rsquo;s countless dangers?<br/><br/>Embark for a mysterious and breathtaking journey, full of thrilling adventures and stunning revelations... Join the Soul Raiders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Soul Raiders is a story-driven cooperative game, created by best-selling author Marc André (Splendor) and a team of talented artists, such as Guillaume Tavernier (De Architectura) or Magali Villeneuve (Magic The Gathering).&nbsp;<br/><br/>In this fast-paced narrative game, the players become powerful heroes.

Each chapter depicts a specific setting in which players will complete quests, collect information and increase their power to progress through the overarching story.&nbsp;<br/>    Soul Raiders&nbsp;will spread on several chapters, woving an epic tale around the players and their characters from one book to the next.&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tA fast-paced and cinematic game system<br/>    The game system features a fast-paced and streamlined gameplay', entirely geared towards the experience of a story-driven, cinematic and cooperative adventure.<br/>    The players act simultaneously to explore their surroundings. Without turn order, they can progress together or split the party as they see fit to hop from one scene to the next.<br/>    Each setting is composed of a set of tiles, places where the heroes can interact with their environment. Taking a variety of actions while battling the forces pitted against them, they jump from one tile to another as the story unfolds, sometimes spread out on different scenes, always focusing on the heart of the action.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBuilding cooperative tension<br/>    The heroes live and die as one. Their health points is a common pool, tracked on the side of the board: each time a player takes damage, the marker progresses. If it goes too far, the whole party fail at completing the chapter.<br/>    Even if they manage to stay safe, time runs out fast... The Threat track is another timer that brings the heroes to their demise. It progresses as they encounter new creatures and events, leading to their capture if they stay idle for too long.&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNarrative story with a strong replay value<br/>    If they cooperate efficiently, any path can lead to the completion of the current chapter, as the players do not have to follow a specific set of events, but try to achieve independent and interwoven quests.&nbsp;<br/>    If the party fails, it can still move onto the next chapter, triggering a unique setback.

In Embryo Machine, up to six players engage in action-packed free-for-all or team-based showdowns making use of the game's grid battlefield and the cards they draft. Players start each game by first choosing which mecha&mdash;called Embryo Machines, or &quot;EMs&quot; for short&mdash;they'd like to pilot, according to their playstyle, and then utilize a deck of cards unique to their EM that comprises all of their unit's movement, equipment, and attacks.<br/><br/>Once players have their EMs set up, they then build the battlefield using the modular board that comes with the game. On the board are wide open fields, bottlenecks, stat-altering terrain, and various other obstacles to contend with. Players then position their EMs on the field using the two-sided custom standees, which feature each Embryos' art, and prepare to maneuver around the battlegrounds.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Once a player has a group in front of her, she can play tiles on other groups already on the table as long as she doesn't create a set or sequence of only two tiles. A player can rearrange tiles and combine groups as long as no tiles remain on their own; if she combines groups, she can then start a new group.<br/><br/>As soon as one player is out of tiles, the game ends and she wins. Alternatively, players can play multiple rounds, with those who still have tiles in hand scoring penalty points for what they still hold.<br/><br/>",

On most turns, you will form a boarding party by taking a stack of pirates in front of you (with a stack consisting of one or more tokens with you on top), moving them on top of a stack in front of another player, then moving the new stack back in front of you.<br/><br/>On a future turn, you may use this stack to capture one of the four cards in the display as long as the size of the party meets the minimum requirements. The pirate on top of stack is the captain, and they receive a treasure for leading the raid. (The second pirate in the stack, the mate, might also receive a treasure.) They collect the gold listed on the card, then must pay the value listed on each pirate in their crew, making up any gold they lack from their own coffers. If they do this, they keep the card and increase their scoring.<br/><br/>You can mutiny by placing a stack on another stack, then going after one of the four cards immediately, but you must then pay the mate and the rest of the crew double their pay.<br/><br/>After all cards have been captured and the game ends, players receive additional gold based on the relative number of treasures they have captured. Whoever ends up with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>",

After the battle of the Iron Gates against the Dark Mages, peace existed in our lands. But then Agrimor, a fire breathing dragon entered Lirennor and killed our king. The king's brother, an evil mage, tried to take power but he failed. He now seeks the Medallion Pieces from the heroes to seize the throne. But the heroes each require what Saladar, the kings brother has. Only one can be crowned the new ruler of Lirennor.<br/><br/>1-7 players with competitive, solo and Co-Op modes to play. Three ways of winning as well as the ability to simply roam around killing creatures, completing side quests and interacting with the game in the open world setting.<br/><br/>Select your base character and build them up as you go along by collecting, buying and winning weapons, items, equipment and so on. Equip these items and become more powerful.<br/><br/>Use magical scrolls to manipulate the map itself. Twist the large hexagonal tiles around. Teleport across the land, conjure weapons, summon creatures, mitigate your opponents' attacks, enchant your items and so on. There are 150 scrolls in the game, so there's always something to do.<br/><br/>The Box itself has been designed with fluidity in mind. Everything is organized as soon as you open the box. There are 500+ cards in the game all within their own tuck boxes. When playing players will use the awesome card trays designed to manage your inventory as you progress through the game and containing your cards to an easy to visualize battle board. And by far the most unique of all the features is the mechanical market located within the lid itself. Future expansion packs are already in mind and the box has already taken care of that. We have included extra room to store whatever is needed now and in the future.<br/><br/>Dead Throne is a game that is never the same. With 10 large double-sided tiles, multiple paths to victory, loads of options and decisions with every turn, and an in-depth world to discover, you'll never say it's predictable.<br/><br/>",

Players will draw four cards each turn, keeping one, discarding another, and giving the other two cards to the players to their sides. In order to play the cards, they will have to discard some from their hands as a cost.<br/><br/>The players will have to follow a personal special pattern while trying to make lines with same-coloured cards. They can also try to guess the other players' paterns to copy them and get even more points. There will also be 2 more secret scoring bonus cards, which can be looked at by advancing your scheme in your board.<br/><br/>When a player finishes their 3x3 board grid, the game ends for everyone. The player with the most victory points (given by lines, patterns, secret objectives and the used cards), will be the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&gt; MISSION<br/><br/>Gridopolis Games was founded to break the mold of traditional flat &lsquo;bored&rsquo; games and challenge you to think creatively in 3D. This original way of thinking makes Gridopolis not just a fun strategy game, but also a compelling tool for STEM &amp; learning.<br/><br/>&gt; INTRO<br/><br/>Gridopolis is a three-dimensional strategy game. If you have ever played checkers or chess, you get the idea. Only now, we are playing in 3D. This means you can move and jump and play in any direction! You can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally &ndash; plus across multiple levels. Using an innovative (yet amazingly simple) structural system, game play happens in a three-dimensional space called a grid-set. And, unlike other games, the grid-set is dynamic and changes during play.<br/><br/>The Gridopolis game &mdash; and system &mdash; is also flexible, modular and expandable. Grid-sets can be re-configured at any time to expand the game, change the rules, or even invent your own brand new game from scratch. The only limit is your imagination!<br/><br/>&gt; GOAL / OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>The goal of Gridopolis is to capture your opponents until you are the last one left or time runs out. You capture others by jumping over them. <br/>Any marker that gets jumped is captured and comes out of the game. Use a multi-jump to capture more than one opponent on a single turn!<br/><br/>&gt; GAME PLAY<br/><br/>MOVING<br/>Starting markers are called pawns. These can only move one pad at a time and never go backwards.<br/>A pawn becomes a king when it reaches the opponent's home-row, marked by a kingerizer. Flip your pawn and you are now a king. A king gets to move two pads at a time AND can move in any direction. Wow.<br/><br/>JUMPING in 3D<br/>Any jump-capture move must follow the &lsquo;straight-line&rsquo; rule. Think of three points (or pads) in a row: your starting point, the opponent you are jumping over, and your landing point.<br/><br/>OTHER MOVES<br/><br/>     Hyper-pad : these pads are like teleporters. Land on one to get &lsquo;beamed&rsquo; to any other hyper-pad on the grid-set. The ride is all part of the same move.<br/>     Kamikaze : play outside the grid-set! If you have nowhere to land when jumping, you can still capture an opponent with this sacrifice move. Both markers must be on the same level and both are removed.<br/><br/><br/>BUILD (or SHRINK!) the GRID-SET<br/>At the beginning of a game, each player gets ten extra grid-set parts. At any time, you can change the grid-set in the following two ways. (NOTE : This counts as your turn.)<br/><br/>     Add-a-pad : grow the grid-set at any time! Connect one of your extra pads to expand the grid-set horizontally or vertically.<br/>     Blocker-box : shrink the grid-set! Use this part to block a pad, taking it out of order for the rest of the game. <br/><br/><br/>SO MUCH MORE!<br/>This is just the first game in the Gridopolis Game System. You can also change the layout of the grid-set, tweak the rules, add new parts, and even create your own original game from scratch. Double wow.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Now you can take control of your military and industrial might, and truly determine the fate of the world from the very beginning of World War II!<br/><br/>Global War 1939 is a variant of Axis &amp; Allies Global 1940 (Europe 1940 and Pacific 1940 combined), but it uses it's own map that has been completely redesigned showing the world in 1939. While the basic rules are the same, nearly every facet of the game now has added depth making it entirely unique including:<br/><br/>- A D12 combat system<br/>- All new playable powers Canada, UK Far East Command, Communist China, Poland, Dutch, Romania, Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Vichy France, and Thailand.<br/>- Country specific combat values<br/>- New unit types<br/>- New political rules<br/>- New technology system and national objectives<br/>- Optional air combat rules<br/><br/>Global War 1939 recreates World War II in it's entirety. The game board is a map of the world divided into controllable areas that have unique values. Players are divided between Axis and Allied powers to fight for global supremacy using a variety of combat units familiar to Axis &amp; Allies players. Victory goes to the player/players that take control of a number of enemy Victory Cities.<br/><br/>",

In her quest to dominate the airwaves, Kim cheats on her husband, neglects her daughter, and mistreats her staff.

At the gates of Heaven, she is informed that she has collected too much bad karma in her life, and has a long road of atonement ahead.

Each of you have chosen a completely unique method of dealing with a particularly nasty bit of chaos that has been summoned and vow to prove your methods are the best.<br/><br/>The player employing the mystic arts must manipulate a set of special double-faced tarot cards in hopes of arranging them correctly. Their goal is to arrange their cards in numeric (1/2/3/4/5) or alphabetical (A/B/C/D/E) order, from left to right. The very cards that they are arranging will also allow them to rotate, swap, and otherwise manipulate the order to their advantage. They win if they can properly align all of their cards before the Science player wins or their deck runs out.<br/><br/>The player committed to the scientific method must be meticulous in establishing order from chaos. They pull dice from a bag, roll them, and place them on engine cards, with specific dice needed for each. They win if they can complete all 5 of their engine cards before the Seance player wins or their dice are depleted.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not always a genteel competition, however, as both players have options that allow them to slow down each other&rsquo;s progress in this race to prove whose methodology is the most effective.<br/><br/>",

There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.<br/><br/>Broad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.<br/><br/>The game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.<br/><br/>Matches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.<br/><br/>The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by: <br/><br/>    Räuber<br/><br/><br/>",

Four cards are dealt face up to form Society Row.<br/><br/>The player chooses 3 of these cards to place below in their Royal Court as starting cards. The cards may be placed in any of the 4 spaces in either of the 2 rows forming the Royal Court. If any Daemon Prince cards are drawn, they are set aside and will be shuffled back into the deck after the player chooses the three they want (dealing out replacement cards to Society Row). The player also begins the game with 10 copper pieces (CP). These starting cards will not have their powers activated during the Game Setup.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>A game turn consists of three phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1A. The player may purchase 1 card from Society Row and place in the Royal Court OR they may skip this phase and go to Phase 1B.<br/><br/>If the player purchases a card, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.<br/><br/>Cards will be purchased during the game from this row in an auction format.<br/><br/>Phase 1B. If the player does not wish to purchase any cards, the rightmost, non-Daemon Prince card is discarded and all remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player then receives 1CP and an additional 1CP for each Tax Collector in the Royal Court.<br/><br/>Phase 2. The player may now use the combined strength of their Generals to combat one Daemon Prince. If the player has 3 or more Generals in the Royal Court representing each of the three clan icons, the player adds +2 to the total strength to the Generals. To defeat one Daemon Prince during this phase, the total of all Generals&rsquo; strengths must be equal to or greater than the Daemon Prince&rsquo;s strength (as shown by the black number). The player may additionally pay CP to add 1CP/1 Strength to this total. The defeated Daemon Prince is placed to the left of the draw deck, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player gains VP as listed on the Daemon Prince card.<br/><br/>Phase 3. If Daemon Princes remain in Society Row, the rightmost non-Daemon Prince card is removed from the Society Row and placed in the Court of the Daemon Princes. All remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>The game will end after Phase 3 if either:<br/>4 Daemon Princes are in the Society Row or all 9 Daemon Princes have been drawn.<br/><br/>The player then adds up the total VP gained during the game and additionally gains 1VP for every 3CP they have left. Each card in the Daemon Prince pile subtracts its listed VP from the player&rsquo;s VP score.<br/><br/>",

You will recruit trainers, armourers, medics and even prostitutes. You will train free men, slaves, criminals and war prisoners to become gladiators and you will bring them to fight in the arenas throughout Italy. You will manage not only the duels, but the whole life of your gladiators: lead your champions to glory!<br/>    <br/>Unwinding of a game<br/><br/>In the first round, after a short preparation, the Players take their Gladiators to the arenas for brief introductory Shows: they approach the first challenges of their champions and place their bets on life or death of duelists. After this initial stage, the game takes on its regular sequence. In the first phase, called Forum phase, Players will play aggressive auction for what the market has to offer them: athletes for training and professionals for Gymansium&rsquo;s management. In the second phase, called Munus phase, the Players play the Spectacles, trying to participate with their best Gladiators. Not all spectacles are equal: some have more money gain, others provide more glory. The Players need to make the best choices!<br/><br/>During the Spectacles, you will fight the duels of Gladiators. Just like a lanista of two thousand years ago, you will manage many duels and you will place bets and tampering to obtain money. Duel by duel, your Gladiators will grow and become stronger and more popular. Which Gym will be able to prevail and become the most glorious of the ancient world?<br/><br/>Familia Gladiatoria is the first in a series of games that aim to recreate the whole cruel and multiform world of Imperial Rome spectacles. The MUNERA series will allow you to live not only the training of Gladiators and their challenges, but also the hunts in the arena and the chariots in the Circus Maximus.<br/><br/>",

Come up with one if there&rsquo;s none yet!<br/>What could bring a Picasso painting and a classic portrait together? Let's say, a white headdress! Now all the paintings you play in this row or column must contain a person with the white headpiece.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2. Play your card at the intersection and don&rsquo;t draw a new card. The card you play has to fit both features of a row and a column. Think of one or even both of them!<br/><br/>Your aim is to get rid of cards, but you don't draw a new one only if you manage to place a card that matches both row and column features, so you have to be very attentive, come up with challenging features, and think ahead to play all your cards on the table!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cheesonomics is a cheesy original card game for 2-5 players ages 8 and up that takes about 20-30 minutes to play.  It is a strategic set collecting, memory-based, hand management card game based on controlling and manipulating the supply and demand of various types of cheese from cheese markets throughout North America or Europe.<br/><br/>The European edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia.  The North American edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from Wisconsin, California, New York, Oregon and Canada.<br/><br/>The overall goal of Cheesonomics is to manage your cheese supply, churn the right colors or animal types from your opponents' hands, produce the market's most demanded colors of cheese to milk the most profit, and earn the most curd cash by selling different colors of cheese at high market prices.<br/><br/>Cheesonomics can be played at three different skill levels - mild, sharp and extra sharp - allowing gamers to adjust the game according to their own playing palate.<br/><br/>Each game starts with three market wheels made up of 5 market wedges, and each player receives five cheese wedges and a cheese knife marked with either cheddar, edam, feta, gouda or parmesan.<br/><br/>On each turn, the active player begins by retrieving his cheese knife from the serving tray - if it was placed there on a previous turn - and then chooses one of three different culinary actions: Churn Cheese, Produce Cheese or Sell Cheese.<br/><br/>Churning cheese allows a player to collect cheese wedges from opponents. When churning, the active player asks for one color or animal type. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green or blue, and animals are cow, sheep, goat, yak, and reindeer. If an opponent has that type of cheese card, he must give the active player one card of that type. If he does not have that card type, the opponent must show his hand and give the active player one wedge of the active player's choice.<br/><br/>The active player then protects his product by placing his cheese knife over that color or animal type on the provided serving tray. No other player can churn for that type of cheese until the knife is removed on that player's next turn.<br/><br/>Instead of Churning, a player could Produce cheese.  To do this, the active player simply plays all cheese wedges of one color or animal type from his hand face up onto the table into a cheese wheel. These wedges will be available for sale in future turns. The player then draws cheese wedges until he has five total wedges in his hand.<br/><br/>Instead of Churning or Producing cheese, the active player could Sell Cheese. To sell, a player chooses up to three wedges of one color or animal type from previously-formed cheese and gains curd cash depending on the market, which is the sum of face-up, matching color market wedges.<br/><br/>After selling cheese, the active player now &quot;Mooves&quot; the market, choosing one market wedge representing the color of the cheese sold in the transaction and flipping that wedge to the opposite side.<br/><br/>The game ends when the cheese wedge draw pile is exhausted during a player's turn. The cheesemonger who has the most curd cash is the cheesy champion!<br/><br/>Cheesonomics has even more to offer players who wish to try out the Sharp and Extra Sharp flavors of the game.<br/><br/>In the Sharp game, players can now further manipulate the market. Whenever a Sell Cheese action is taken, that player now also chooses a wedge in the market to completely replace with one from his personal supply of market wedges.<br/><br/>There are also certain cheese wedges with market symbols that may be activated during a Sell Cheese action that can allow a player to discard one of their market wedges and gain another or give a market wedge to one of the other players and take one of theirs.<br/><br/>The Extra Sharp game is for the truly adventurous Cheeseheads!  As an expansion to Cheesonomics, players can add in the Extra Sharp cheese wedge cards that introduce growth hormone, organic and smelly cheese wedges. Each of these new cheese wedge types have special rules that affect a Sell Cheese action, allowing players the choice to boost their production with growth hormones, earn more curds at game end with quality organic cheeses, or use pungent aromas to prevent players from flipping or removing market wedges.<br/><br/>",

In accord with tradition, the leaders of the major bands of thieves have only until dawn to gather the wealth that will prove them worthy to be the new Arch Thief. They must steal from strangers and fellow thieves alike, avoid the watch, keep their gold close, and keep a very close eye on their rivals.<br/><br/>Deck of Thieves is a fast-playing, tactical, cut-throat card game of hand-management for two to four players (up to eight players when using two game sets).<br/><br/>Each player receives an identical deck of cards. In addition to Gold Coin cards, the action cards in the game each have up to three effects: Ability, Activate, and/or Reaction. In turn, each player may play a card to his play area and apply its Ability or Activate a card already in his play area from a previous turn. On another player's turn, players may play a card with a Reaction effect to counter an opponent's card. In addition to these three actions, during their turns, players may move Gold Coin cards around within their play areas (placing a Gold Coin card on top of a Coin Purse card for protection, for example).<br/><br/>Example cards include Dagger, Cutpurse, Pickpocket, Lock Box, Guild Hall, Traveling Merchant, Lock Pick, Thieves' Tools, and the Dirty Thief.<br/><br/>Using these and other cards' Abilities, Activates, and Reactions, players both seek to steal the Gold Coin cards from their opponents--adding them to their play area--and protect their own Gold Coin cards from being stolen. Once a player has 7 Gold Coin cards in his play area, the game ends after one more complete set of turns or when one player is completely out of cards.<br/><br/>Each card in the game has a gold value; the player with the highest gold value wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The game includes a deck of 54 case cards, and each case card identifies elements about the case that you must discover; specifically, each case card indicates the suspect's profession (entertainer, scientist, thug), choice of weapon (revolver, knife, syringe), scene of the crime (theater, street, hotel room), and motive (money, love).<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player takes a card at random and faces it away from themselves in a plastic stand. Three cards are revealed face up. On a turn, you can either take a face-up card or the top card from the deck, or you can attempt to guess your suspect's characteristics. When you take a card, you hold it up next to your case card, then the other players tell you how many characteristics they have in common. You then place this card in front of you, rotating it so that the number on the outer edge of the card shows how many characteristics they share (0-3).<br/><br/>When you guess, if you're correct, you discard the case card and place a new one in the stand; if you're wrong, you continue the game as normal next turn. The first player to correctly solve two cases wins!<br/><br/>",

The ability of a card you've played can be activated on your turn &mdash; or not. It's up to you. Just remember, your action or inaction is for sale! Analyzing who has the most to win or the most to lose from your current ability and leveraging it to your maximum benefit is the name of the game.<br/><br/>You must learn to play the players, more than you learn to play the game.

Over the course of three weeks(rounds) players will seek to load their trucks with good and deliver them to their customers. The earlier you deliver, the more you get paid, so time is of the essence. Will you send truck that are not fully loaded, or will you wait and see if you can fill a truck all the way up? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/><br/>Each turn players will flip over 3 cards from a standard playing deck and use the cards to either load their trucks, or move them. Some trucks take certain goods (suits) and not others, while some trucks care more about the amount of goods (number on the card). Once you have decided a truck is full enough use the value on a card to move it, by marking off spaces on its path. However trucks in transit may not be loaded anymore, so choose wisely.<br/><br/>At the end of each week all trucks that are delivered will score, while trucks in transit count for nothing. This means that trucks scored in the first week score score 3 times total, while trucks in the second week score 2 times, and trucks scored in the last week score once. Plan your moves wisely as waiting too long could mean a lower payout than you were hoping for.<br/><br/>Game ends after 3 weeks each with 5 turns. Players total up money earned from all 3 weeks and the player with the most money wins. In the event of a tie the player with the most delivered trucks wins.<br/><br/>",

The game involves relatively trivial memory and tactical components, as players discover the hidden destinations of each of three movers and try to maneuver them through the building to deliver a load of furniture. The more entertaining part of the game begins when a load is in the correct location to be delivered. The acting player then choses a partner, and together the two players attempt to maneuver miniature doll house furniture into locations specified on a floor plan card using a pair of wooden sticks. (Each player is allowed to hold only one stick...) If the furniture is upended or dropped, it is considered broken and neither player earns a tip. The game ends when all the furniture has been delivered; the player with the most tips wins. Primarily a dexterity game with cool bits and an interesting cooperative element, although the advanced rules add some tactical possibilities.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a hand of three cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw 0-4 cards from the deck depending on which card was played the previous turn. (The first player of the game optionally draws one card.) Then you can play a card face up or face down in the pyramid. Within a row, card values must escalate from left to right; when placing a card on a higher row, that card must be supported by two other cards and the newly placed card's value must be between the values of the two supporting cards. When you place a card face down, you ignore the value restriction.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can discard two cards to the reserve, then draw a card from the reserve that equals the sum or the difference of these two cards. (You can discard other cards in your hand from the game to raise or lower this sum/difference by 1 for each such card.) You then place this card from the reserve in the tower, either in an empty spot or in place of another card (with you adding this replaced card to your hand).<br/><br/>If you manage to create a card tower seven layers tall (i.e., with 28 cards) and all those cards are face up, then you win.<br/><br/>Once you play a few times, you can add the Finish card (#25) to the game. During set-up, you shuffle this card in the bottom half of the deck. Whoever draws it places this card in front of themselves, then draws a replacement card. The Finish card is part of this player's hand, but doesn't count against their three-card hand limit. The Finish card cannot be played face down, and if it's removed from the tower, it must be placed face up in front of the active player. The Finish card must be the final card played at the top of the tower for players to win.<br/><br/>",

The characters in this world are doomed to walk the land of both the living and the dead, hoping to win this game in order to buy themselves a restful sleep - six feet under.<br/><br/>In order to win the hand, you will have to draft one of the many roles available to the players and use the character's special powers to improve your own hand and stop your opponents'. The game is familiar enough for those who know only the basics of poker, but robust enough to keep even the most avid gamer invested from start to finish.<br/><br/>",

The game begins with Rommel's breakout into Cyrenaica in 1941 and continues until either the Allied Torch landings in Nov. 1942 or one side gains a decisive victory.<br/><br/>Movement is handled as in some naval games... by calling out hex numbers of the paths each unit travels.  When an enemy is spotted, a marker is placed to indicate location, but not strength.  A unit is revealed only when it ends its turn adjacent to an enemy unit.<br/><br/>Control of El Aghiela, Tobruk, and Alexandria determine the level of victory.<br/><br/>From the rules, 1.0 Introduction (p. 20):<br/><br/>&quot;... Any simulation game must be a compromise between accuracy of simulation and simplicity of play. This game emphasizes limited intelligence, supply, and maneuver. It is also designed to be fairly simple to play. As a result, historical accuracy in other areas may not seem as great. A complete accurate simulation would be a much larger game.&quot;<br/><br/>Scale: 30 km per hex<br/>Time: 1 month per turn<br/>Counters: Some counters represent more than one (similar) historical unit over time<br/>Zone of Control: Yes<br/>Stacking: Yes (generally 5 brigades)<br/>Supply: Yes (line, source, net; supply units)<br/>Combat: CRT (Combat Results Table)<br/>Intelligence: Yes (ULTRA rules for allies, &quot;Intelligence Reports&quot; scheduled for both sides)<br/>Initiative: die roll (1-4 Axis, 5-6 Allied)<br/>Special Rules: Tripoli off-map box, Rommel leader benefits<br/>Optional Rules: British Armor Coordination, Tobruck Minefields, Alexandria Garrison, Disbanded Formations<br/>Tables &amp; Charts: CRT, Column Shift SUmmary, Die Roll Modifiers; Reinforcement/Supply/Intelligence schedule<br/>Tracking Sheet form: Armor/Infantry replacement points, Intelligence notes or guesses.<br/>Counter Manifest: Yes except enemy unit indicators<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ages ago, before history, before humans walked the earth, ancient beings ruled the darkest corners of the cosmos from beyond. Their earliest followers harnessed fragments of their immeasurable power in earthly objects. Chaos and destruction spread throughout the land leaving no family untouched by darkness. A great war ensued and these once great objects of cosmic power became lost and forgotten in time&hellip;<br/><br/>You lied to the other scientists on the expedition to Am&rsquo;harb, an uninhabited island in the Pacific. Only you, a true servant of the Ancient Ones, is powerful enough to move the deadly dark towers surrounding the island.<br/><br/>Manipulate the towers to strategically scatter your priests and cultists around the island and gain control of the dark altars. Excavate esoteric resources left behind by lost civilizations. Wisely exchange them for the cosmic powers of the Ancient One to advance your position.<br/><br/>Can you solve the Towers of Am&rsquo;harb and unlock the secrets before your rivals? Do this before the other cults to ensure you and you alone lead humanity from the deadly light and into the peace and safety of a new dark age!<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/><br/>In Towers of Am&rsquo;harb, you are a leader of a doom cult, and you are competing with others just like you, all trying to unleash the Ancient One of their worship to conquer the world!<br/><br/>Players will take turns moving their set of 4 different sized discs, manipulating them according to the rules of the mathematical puzzle toy Tower of Hanoi/Brahma. Then you send your followers(disciples) to the 2 columns you just moved a disc into, in order to gain control of scoring altars that provide doom points at the end of the game. Your followers come in different sizes, 3 priests which provides 3 influence, and 6 cultists which provides 1 influence; each follower spreads influence to the 8 surrounding spaces, so it can influence more than one altar.<br/><br/>Since players will sit and play their discs on different orthogonal sides of the map, the result is that the vertical columns you can play into will be the horizontal rows of the next player, and generates to very interesting interactions. When playing your followers on to the board, you will need also to pay a cost depending on how crowded the area you are entering, which can be offset by the height of your towers, so you must plan ahead on where you need to concentrate your efforts.<br/><br/>There are 8 different Lovecraftian Ancient Ones to worship in this game, each with a different Cosmic Power for players to rely on. The map is made from dual-sided modular boards, with different layouts for 2/3/4 player scaling; you can start with symmetric distribution of scoring altars, or flip them around for dynamic asymmetric layouts.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player plays all 9 of their followers to the board, then all other players gets to take one more turn. Then players resolves each altar on the board one by one and give out doom points to the players with highest influence. The player who accumulates the highest doom points awakens the Ancient One of their worship, and releases unfathomable cosmic horror upon the world.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Moaideas Game Design is not liable for the unexpected or premeditated summoning of any Ancient One or Elder God and in no way endorses or condones belief or membership of any doom cult. All hail, Cthulhu. <br/><br/>",

More of a nostalgia trip for 2CV owners than a challenging contest, players compete to get their car through a year of car rallies and MOTs (government vehicle tests).<br/><br/>From the top of the board, your drive your 2CV down a winding track based on die rolls. You can split your roll between movement and storing up repair points, and you try to collect improvements to your car along the way. These are large tiles that sit over your base card, showing your 2CV getting various extras to snazz it up and win points at the seasonal car shows.<br/><br/>The game has a calendar and markers move along to indicate when the next show is happening. Players have to be in certain areas on the track to win points. Lag too far back and you miss the show. Get too many extras and you cannot pass your MOT. You have to detour off the route to pass these mandatory tests, possibly disrupting your schedule.<br/><br/>",

Players must cooperate to gain the favor of the Prince while deducing who among them are secretly the traitorous Sabbat infiltrators.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Players belong to one of 14 vampire Clans, and to one of two sects: the Camarilla, which styles itself as the aristocracy of the night, or the Sabbat, a death cult steeped in fire and blood.<br/><br/>Camarilla players do not know who is in each sect, but the Sabbat infiltrators know which other players are on their side.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to resolve Intrigues by bidding Trait cards which either add together or subtract from the total points needed as listed on the Intrigue card.<br/><br/>The Camarilla wants to have enough points to win the Intrigue, but the Sabbat want the Intrigue to fail.<br/><br/>After each Intrigue is resolved, Prestige Points are awarded to the players. The player with the most Prestige Points gain the Prince's Favor and gets to decide which Intrigue is next.<br/><br/>Play continues until the Camarilla win enough Intrigues to stabilize the city, depending on the number of players, or the Sabbat manage to cause three Intrigues to fail, causing the city power structure to collapse.<br/><br/>",

Somehow, you escaped the Nightmare Forest before it was overrun by the undead.  After that horrifying experience, you steeled your heart and appointed yourself the investigator of the strange, wild, and unexplained in and around The City.<br/><br/>Recently, you saw strange lights hovering outside the City. You gathered a few trusted friends, and headed back to the Nightmare Forest. There you discovered an Alien Expeditionary Force seeking to gather human specimens they can use to conquer the entire planet. You must defeat all the Aliens, without any of your friends being killed and collected, before the Aliens break out of the Forest and wipe out humanity.<br/><br/>Can you can survive another journey into the Nightmare Forest?<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME:<br/>Nightmare Forest: Alien Invasion is a Cooperative game, where players must work together to cleanse the forest of Aliens before it is too late! Based on the number of characters, you will deal out a grid of Forest Cards. Each turn, every player will move their character(s) around the Forest and decide which Forest Cards to flip over to potentially expose Aliens, fiendish Traps, useful Gear, or valuable Allies.<br/><br/>There are four levels of cards, with higher challenges requiring that players choose whether to hope for a lucky roll or to combine their unique Abilities and Gear to improve their chances of defeating powerful foes.<br/><br/>To win, you and your friends must stay alive and clear the entire forest before the last turn. If any player is killed, or if the game ends before the Forest is cleared, then the Aliens overrun the City, and destroy humanity.<br/><br/>",

A full game can be had in as few as 10 minutes!<br/><br/>Most of the cards are different types of ships that are able to attack other ships. Some of the cards are island cards and these cards garner the player a lot of victory points if they can control the seas around these islands. Lastly, there are special cards like Pirates and Fortresses that allow you to perform special actions.<br/><br/>Every time you place a card you to also place a token of your color on that card and on any cards you capture! Scoring is done by simply adding up the victory points indicated on the cards that you occupy. You add to that any island that you control for your total score. The highest score wins!<br/><br/>Each player has their own separate, yet identical, decks. This allows for a nice mix of tactics and strategy!<br/><br/>So get ready to make your claim of the sea in this fast and easy to learn game.<br/><br/>",

It is intended for players who don&rsquo;t mind taking a few hours to play a game but who like a strong dose of the beer and pretzels factor, even if it means their painstakingly enacted strategic schemes are occasionally foiled by a player who manages to win the Mythos 500.<br/><br/>The Strategic Game<br/>This is similar to the Standard Game, but removes some of really weird stuff. It allows more conventional board gamers to concentrate on sane strategies and not get too disturbed by wandering madness.<br/><br/>The Bloodbath Scenario<br/>This is Cults Across America on steroids, and can be played in as little as an hour. The rule set is reduced somewhat so players don&rsquo;t have to get all concerned about resource management and other fiddly details. The victory conditions are simple too: you win by stomping the hell out of anything that&rsquo;s not on your side. Last man (or whatever) standing takes the day.<br/><br/>Cults Across America has a Cthulhu Mythos theme.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Bruno Cathala:<br/><br/>Trolls used to live happily and merrily in the nice troll country. At night, sitting around the fire, they ate troll meals, told old troll legends, and played traditional troll games. Alas ! this golden age is past. Everything has changed for the worse since aliens, jealous of the troll wealth and culture, have settled in. The Trollland is now infested with Men, who ate cooked meat, Elves with dubious habits, Gobs who played barbarian music and hardworking Dwarves who steal the trolls jobs. As a result, Trollland is now in full decadence.<br/><br/>The Troll king has decided to set it straight and put things back in order. As a troll governor, your mission is to arrest and send back home, in carriages or in dragon charters, as many unwanted aliens as possible. The trick of the game is that each charter scores point only for the player who placed the last alien in it. At the end of the game, the winner will be rewarded by the troll king and promoted as minister of national hideousity.<br/><br/>Trollland&rsquo;s theme is in no way tacky, nasty or vulgar. It&rsquo;s the policy the game is rightly mocking which is tacky, nasty and vulgar.<br/><br/>As for the game systems, Trollland (with three ls) is a very good filler card game . It&rsquo;s light, nasty and clever, in the line of many German style card games such as Coloretto, Mow or Take 5.<br/><br/>",

During the game, loyal Captains must rally their forces to defend the Citadel against the emerging threat of a creature from the deep. Think Gandalf rallying the forces of Minas Tirith in Return of the King.<br/><br/>This is not a tower defense game, but blends several mechanisms including dice drafting (there are custom dice and rolls can be mitigated), tableau building (the player boards are extra large to organize the various cards), and worker placement (in terms of the various buildings your Captain will visit).<br/><br/>Your Captain&rsquo;s tableau will include soldiers, wizards, heroes, mounts, and wyverns. Some of these characters are for offensive purposes (attacking the Monster etc) and some for defensive purposes (building your resources including your dice pool). During the game player will also complete quests for the King, buy items from the Town Hall, ride a Mount, fight creatures in the streets of the Citadel, upgrade their Captain at the Armoury, visit the Dwarven Grotto for gold, and find helpful trinkets in the Fountain.<br/><br/>The game supports &quot;true solo&quot; (a solo player need only control one Captain), fully co-op multiplayer against the Monster, one vs one (one player controls the Captain, the other player controls the Monster), or one player (controlling the Monster) vs up to four Captains. All play modes feature long or short variants.<br/><br/>There are five monsters included in the game (Dragon, Enchantress, Behemoth, Vampire Queen, and Orc War Chief) both featuring &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sides for greater challenge and variation. The game engine can be further adjusted with Difficulty Tokens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is divided into six big kingdoms, each carrying its own history, culture, and mysteries. The world has survived a great calamity that struck the land eighty years ago. Ever since things have changed and the continent has seen a sudden spike of creatures old and new that plague the land and are troubling the local populace. Amongst all of that, individuals have appeared who took advantage of this situation and will do anything, including slaying these so-called monsters, if it means they get a bag of coins in return.<br/><br/>In Silver Coin: Age of Monster Hunters, you are playing as one of these monster hunters. You travel the land in search of missions that will, if successfully completed, grant you rewards in the form of coins. But to successfully tackle all the challenges thrown your way, you will need to learn some magic, gather the knowledge about the very things you need to kill and equip yourself with items and skills that will help you on your journey.<br/><br/>Each turn players will draft cards, play cards, and buy special action cards or dice, then they will use their tokens to choose the actions they will take each turn in an attempt to optimize their way through the game.<br/><br/>Be resourceful, be strong, take the long path or the quick, the easy way or the hard, but most of all, make sure that when the game comes to an end, you are the one with the biggest bag of those silver coins...<br/><br/>",

Every player has the same six cards, which provide Strength, Favor, Victory Points, and bonuses. Unfortunately, the path forward is shrouded in fog, forcing players to manage the uncertainty of the times.<br/><br/>Every round, players draft a hand of cards, choosing a mix of their cards, their opponents&rsquo;, and powerful Events. The key is building a viable strategy with your own cards and events, while denying key cards from your opponents. Then, cards are played face down one at a time to the Planets. Limited information about each card is disclosed. Players are forced to make decisions with imperfect information gained during the draft and by reading your opponents. Finally, the cards are revealed and resolved. In most cases, players want to be the Strongest or Favored faction to score Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This near-future what-if wargame, designed by Ty Bomba, is an update and expansion of the classic old-SPI Oil War game from the mid-1970s. It has been released on the magazine Modern War. It examines an Iranian strategic alternative that&rsquo;s becoming increasingly plausible in light of the draw down of US military strength in the Middle East. That is, just as it did in Cold War Europe, the prospect of both sides having nuclear weapons in this &ldquo;zone of confrontation&rdquo; may work to create a deterrent umbrella that, at least for some time, could allow for a potentially decisive conventional war to go on underneath the threat of &ldquo;mutually assured destruction.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Oil War: Iran Strikes (OW) is a low-intermediate complexity design set in a timeframe of the near future &ndash; 2013 through 2017 &ndash; in which the Iranians may indeed have developed some kind of nuclear capability. At that same time, with the &ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo; having likely slithered to an indecisive end by then, and the US therefore likely fallen back into another post-Vietnam-type &ldquo;neo-isolationist&rdquo; phase, the possibility for a blitz-style Iranian conventional military victory &ndash; aimed at establishing and certifying Tehran as the hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore.<br/>           <br/>OW examines the strategic and operational possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The situation is on such a hair trigger in regard to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea is for Iran to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals 18 miles (30 km) from side to opposite side, and its coverage stretches from Turkey in the north to the UAE in the south, and from the Iranian border and Persian Gulf on the east to Baghdad and Riyadh on the west. Each game turn represents three days, with a full match covering the first month of the war.<br/>Units of maneuver are corps, divisions, brigades, and US brigade combat teams (BCT) of various kinds, each containing from about 5,000 to 15,000 men and/or 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles or helicopters. The most up-to-date data available have been used to establish each participant country&rsquo;s detailed order or battle, including the Iranian regular army (Artesh), Basij (martyr force) and Revolutionary Guards, along with the ground forces of Iraq (loyalist and insurgent militias and regulars, Kurds, and the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; Quick Reaction Force). There are also the armies of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Syria, Turkey and, of course, the US.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: sudden death victories and victories on points, variable phase sequences, US naval supremacy, unique Saudi combat5 characteristics, geographic and multi-national movement and combat restrictions, US locking zones of control, US bases, Kuwaiti border defenses, Iraqi unit defections, Al Qods terror attacks, massed Basij suicide attacks, Basra&rsquo;s critical logistical status, Iranian airborne and marine units, artillery, combat engineers, airpower, UN intervention, unique US BCT capabilities, the legend of the 12th Imam, and much more.<br/><br/>",

Deploy multipurpose security cells to gain control of territory.  Use your territories to buy, ship, or sell your product.  Build smuggling pipeline infrastructure so you can move more product more quickly to more locations.  Buy political influence to help protect your shipments from interdiction operations and to utilize law enforcement to disrupt your opponents&rsquo; supply lines.<br/><br/>On your turn, you:<br/>- Choose 1 action (either: buy/build, transport product, or sell product).<br/>- Then deploys 1 cell (i.e. 1 Go stone)<br/><br/>+  at any point during your turn or during an opponent's turn, a player may launch a Task Force Interdiction action to seize an opponent's product.  This is a probability based roll of two six-sided dice, adjusted by how much political influence the player has.<br/><br/>Territory is gained or lost using Go mechanics.  In this regard, the game is an abstract game of strategic skill.  Players who are able to control territory in more zones typically are able to then build a better economic engine to make money faster than their opponents.<br/><br/>The first player to reach $1 billion wins.

        "description": "Xēko (pronounced &quot;zeeko&quot;) is a collectible card game which has four editions (referred to as &quot;Missions&quot;). These are Mission: Madagascar, Mission: Costa Rica, Mission: Indonesia, and Mission: China. Each Mission highlights common and endangered plants and animals from in the region, and cards from all Missions can be mixed together.<br/><br/>In Xēko, each player's objective is to create the strongest, most balanced environment. The game begins with a Hotspot card on to which players can link their &ldquo;Species&rdquo; cards. Players link Species cards with other Species cards and battle other players in &ldquo;Turf Wars&rdquo; in order to collect &ldquo;Eco-points&rdquo; before one of the player&rsquo;s decks runs out of cards. In addition, &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; cards aid the players in Turf Wars, and &quot;Xēko&quot; cards may help or hurt players in acquiring additional Eco-points by permitting changes to the standard game rules. When a player&rsquo;s deck is depleted, each player counts the Eco-points on his or her cards and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Each Mission: Madagascar Starter Set includes 2 endangered Cards, 10 Rare Cards, 2 Hotspot Cards, 36 Common Cards, 1 Extra Large Play Mat, 2 Learn-to-Play Guides, and 1 Rule Book. Xēko cards are made from 100 percent recycled materials and 4 percent of game net sales are donated to Conservation International.<br/><br/>It should be noted that it is not necessary to purchase a starter set  (around $20 to $30) to play the game. Booster packs (around $4) are just fine for building a deck, and contain a greater variety of cards - including Hotspot cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brain Warp is an electronic memory game with voice commands. It is shaped like a sphere with 6 knobs sticking out of it. The knobs all have different colors and are numbered 1-6. There are 6 different games to play. In the first game, the voice calls out a color and the player must quickly rotate the Brain Warp until the color called is facing upward. The next game is the same only it uses the numbers. Other games include: colors and numbers, combinations of colors and numbers, code buster, and a passing game in which players add to an ever growing sequence. The Brain Warp calls out the winner at the end of each game.<br/><br/>The Brain Warp must be held straight for the game sensors to &quot;read&quot; selections correctly. It must be rotated from selection to adjacent selection - not diagonally or through another color. Correct selections receive a Confirmation Tone, incorrect selections (or if you take to long) receive a Razz tone.<br/><br/>There were 3 different revisions of the Brain Warp made. The first one had bad music and sound programming whilst the voice had a lower pitch comparing against the music. The second version fixed all of that but the 2.0 has problems with gameplay after 36 points in Colors, Numbers and Combo. Then in 2002 a black version was made which had a better speaker and a wider pitch differences between game units.<br/><br/>The game also has a hidden test mode. To access it, you need to unscrew the yellow knob, position the game to the purple position and press the power button to access it. Different censors do diferent things. The red censor repeats the number that each knob is, the white button plays all the sound effects, the orange button does all the voices, the green knob plays the music and the purple knob makes a beep. The yellow knob goes back to game mode.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the third movie, of course.  Besides the board, this time you have 7 cardboard character pawns, life chips (each character's &quot;hit points&quot;), cards, special dice and dinosaurs (our old friend T. Rex, three velociraptors, six pteranodons and two spinosaurus).<br/><br/>The 30 cards are sorted into five piles: Jaw to Jaw, Raptor Rumble, Pteranodon Terror, Spino's Revenge and Race To The Rescue.  The dinosaurs (taxonomically, pteranodons aren't dinosaurs; they belong to a different order, the pterosaurs) start in designated places around the board, as do the humans except for little Eric (who appears as a result of a card draw).<br/><br/>The object, for the humans, is to make it across the island to the exit (rescue spot); the dinosaurs try to prevent this, of course.  There will always be one dinosaur player, the other players sharing the humans.  Movement is die-based for both dinosaurs and humans.  One human moves at a time, but there is a die face that moves a group of up to 3 at once.  The dinosaurs are restricted to separate zones of the board and only act whilst humans are on their territory.  Like with the humans, only one dinosaur moves per turn, except that a die face allows *all* dinosaurs to move 1 space.  There are some board spaces usable only by humans and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Combat is dice driven as well.  Pteranodons have a nasty tendency to snatch characters and bring them to their nests, where the character must escape or eventually be eaten.  Humans have the option of burning hit points to get extra turns -- a risky gamble.<br/><br/>The humans win by reaching the far beach and drawing the WIN card from the Race To The Rescue deck.<br/><br/>From the same film series:<br/><br/>    Jurassic Park Game<br/>    The Lost World Jurassic Park Game<br/><br/><br/>",

In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)<br/><br/>In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.<br/><br/>Includes: 480 counters<br/><br/>",

Presuming extreme cruelty, various European leaders called for new crusades, to free fellow Christians from &quot;the Lash of the Turk.&quot;<br/><br/>The game covers the tenuous period in history when all of Christian Europe felt threatened by Suleiman the Magnificent, Turkey's greatest sultan. Would Hungary be the next prize for the Ottoman Turks? Would Vienna follow, and the dam of resistance collapse entirely? You decide.<br/><br/>One side features various forces from Europe, who sometimes seem more divided than united by their &quot;common religion.&quot; The other side includes the might of the Ottomans with new &quot;allies,&quot; vassal states who prefer their new overlords to being part of the Holy Roman Empire.<br/><br/>Designed by Andy Nunez, The Lash of the Turk features 176 large counters and a 22 by 34 inch map covering the area from Graz to Bucharest. Units represent various columns of infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Game rules stress ease of play, but give players lots of options, including river movement and combat, siege rules, forage, and political turncoats. Four different scenarios let you juggle the strengths and weaknesses of the principal leaders for both sides, along with Austrian, Hungarian, Transylvanian, Tartar, Turk, Bavarian, Polish, and Franconian troops and appearances from other nationalities. Can you can hold off the Turks? Can you conquer new lands for Allah? Find out, in ATO #30.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The search for energy crystals continues without respite throughout the universe! The Merchant guild is ready to pay outrageous amounts of money, and all the Seekers roam about to find them. Breaking news! The surface of the &quot;forgotten planet&quot; on the edge of the galaxy is full of them. In a few days, a new gold race will begin, with men replaced by robots that search, explore and fight to control the precious mineral!<br/><br/>The Forgotten Planet is a tile-laying management game in which tiles represent safe areas on a planetary surface on which robots walk and take other actions. These tiles also accumulate energy from the sun, then conduct it to robots, giving them (and the player) more actions if they absorb enough energy &ndash; so building and maintaining ownership of these tiles is fundamental in the game strategy. Players and robots use this energy to build new bases, discover mines, build walls to keep out other robots, push those same walls out of the way, produce more robots and much more.<br/><br/>If your robot falls out of contact with tiles you control, however, then it loses power and falls inactive for the round. Control of tiles is determined by the distance from a particular tile to each player's closest base; whoever is closest to the tile (with walls serving as barriers that players must &quot;walk&quot; around while counting distance) controls it, and the more tiles you control, the more energy you have available to you.<br/><br/>Thus, players need to maintain an energy connection for their robots while trying to extend their area of control on the planet's surface with their bases. They also need to control mines, of course, as that's how a player produces new resources, which are subsequently converted into new bases, sold for victory points (VPs) or converted into new robots.<br/><br/>The game ends when the playing area is filled with tiles or no land tiles remain in the supply. (Players can &quot;consume metal&quot; as one of their actions to speed along the endgame and crimp someone else's efforts to keep building.) Players then score points for the land and mines they control, with bonuses going to the player(s) with the most robots in play, the most common mines and the most bases. The player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each die represents a zombie so you can play with as many as you like. Also, there is no limit to how many players can play. You can even play it as a solitaire game. We do recommend at least four dice per player. During a player's turn, the dice are rolled, the zombies chasing them, and depending on the result, the zombies are either killed, continue to pursue, or are passed to other players or into the Quarantine Zone. The first player to start their turn with no dice to roll escapes and is declared the winner. A four player game typically lasts 5 to 10 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: History of Russia can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>Card represent event related to the culture of Russia.

The important thing, of course, is that your team must be able to figure out what that object is before time runs out. Words come in two degrees of difficulty. Players advance on a score track as they guess words, but as you near the finish line, a die roll determines how you're handicapped: eyes closed, using only string, one hand, limited number of objects, etc. On your second-to-last turn, your opponents choose which three objects you can use to create the word that your team needs to guess in order to win.<br/><br/>",

Only Pit, the brave pilot, decides to take a chance and set off for Habanabi, and island by island, he makes his way to the target. The players are Pit's co-pilots, trying to help him collect coins &mdash; preferably more than any other player does.<br/><br/>In Plucky Pilots, the game board shows a series of islands, with colored arrows connecting them; some islands feature canisters on them, and each island shows 1-13 coins, with the most distant islands being worth the most coins. On a turn, the player starts with the airplane in one corner and rolls the four-sided &quot;dice sticks&quot;; each dice stick has four colored arrows on its sides (red, yellow, green, blue), and after rolling she can move the plane along a colored arrow to an adjacent island as long as she rolled that color on a die. If she lands on an island with a canister, she must place one of her dice on it. She can then end her turn and score the number of coins shown on this island, or she can roll again; if she rolls again and can't move the plane, her turn ends and she scores nothing.<br/><br/>The first player to have collected 25 or more coins wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scotland Rising, which is being released to honor the 700th Year Anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, is a sharp fight that highlights the tactics of medieval battles on a crowded battlefield: Knights are powerful and hard to bring down; pikemen are best in massed formation; archers have ranged fire but must be protected; and ax men are vicious in a close fight. In the game, players take the command roles of Robert the Bruce and King Edward II to lead their armies toward old-fashioned victory &mdash; medieval style &mdash; by inflicting damage on their opponent to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle.<br/><br/>Scotland Rising is the first title in Worthington Publishing's &quot;PT-90&quot; game series, a line of wargames that can be played in 90 minutes. The eight-page rulebook has only four pages of rules and four pages of play examples, designer notes, and historical background.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Modern War #9, Jan-Feb 2014<br/><br/>War by Television: If The US &amp; NATO Had Invaded Serbia is a &quot;what-if&quot; simulation of the fighting that might have occurred across rump-Yugoslavia in the late summer or early autumn of 1999 if the Western alliance had decided on a ground war to settle the Kosovo crisis. WbT is a two-player wargame of low-to-intermediate complexity that posits this might-have-been war lasting about a month, about the maximum time before the invaders' diminishing supplies, and their loss of the political will necessary to continue the fighting, would force a truce if victory had not already been achieved in the field.<br/><br/>Each hexagon equals 7.5 miles (12 km.) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents two days. The units of maneuver are mostly brigades and divisions-size groupings for the Serbians; each with about 2,000 to 5,000 men, and about 25 to 50 armored fighting vehicles in the tracked mechanized units. On the NATO side, units are divisions, corps and armies, each containing about 9,000 to 25,000 men and up to 350 or so armored fighting vehicles. The invaders' air supremacy is built into several aspects of the rules (such as the CRT) and therefore is not represented by separate aircraft unit-counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hartmut Witt always has original game concepts, and he, along with Frank Schaubrenner, has created a fast-paced grab- and collecting-game that will thrill even expert speed-type game players. Rather unusual landscape types need to be crossed in this game: Clay flats, fields, hot sand, green lawns, water and cobblestones, even some rare blue-white or beige tiles. These landscapes are found on 28 large landscape cards, each of which again is made up of 18 landscape spaces, arranged in random fashion.<br/><br/>The landscape cards get mixed up and distributed among the players (7 each with 3p and 4p, 8 with 2p - the rest go back in the box). Now, each player gets to set two particularly difficult cards aside and places the rest on the table to form a race circuit (the narrow sides of the cards are joined together). Thus, a different track with different challenges is created for each player. A goal card marks the goal for each player.<br/><br/>Before the game can begin, 48 small cards are placed in the middle of the table as a face-down, spread out pile. Each card shows one of the landscape types mentioned above.<br/><br/>As soon as the game starts, all players wildly grab through the pile of cards on the table. Cards, once revealed, are left face-up if they're not of immediate use. Cards that a player wants to keep are taken in hand. The order of the cards being collected, though, cannot be altered in any way. The collection phase ends when there's only face-up cards left on the table and a player calls &quot;stop&quot; because he thinks he has enough cards.<br/><br/>Now, the players will see how far they get along their track with the cards they collected. The player who called &quot;stop&quot; starts. He turns the first card he collected over. If it's sand, for example, he puts his marker on a sand space at the start of his course. Thereafter, each subsequent card must show a landscape type that is next to the one his marker is on (either sideways, forwards or diagonally forwards) for him to move forwards. As soon as a card comes up that doesn't allow him to move his marker, his turn is over. Collected cards that are left over are put back into the middle of the table (face-down), and the figure stays where it managed to get to. Each player in turn order then does the same, moving their figure and returning leftover cards. Continue in this manner, round after round, until one player reaches the goal, ending the game. That player is of course the winner.<br/><br/>Description of the game from Kosmos.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Famous Divisions: Grossdeutschland Panzer, is the first in a new evolution in design that brings tactical elements to an otherwise operational simulation. Recreating four battles of the Grossdeutschland Panzer from the eastern front in 1943 and 1944, this first game of the series includes: Lutchessa Valley, Kursk, Akhtyrka and Mischurin Rog (each played on its own detailed and historically accurate map).<br/><br/>The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: play is governed by the drawing of &quot;Event Chits&quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units as effected by terrain; rather, it's modified by random chit draws of over 140 possible &quot;events&quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios and terrain. The number of chits a given side may hold and draw also serves as an easy measure of its elite (or non-elite) status.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy player turns. Rather, each is made up of numerous individual HQ activations. All HQ activation chits are placed in a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.<br/><br/>Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, which are shown as icons along with the numeric representations of the capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. Play is therefore tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked or leg), and rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct and ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft artillery.<br/><br/>While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the chit mechanisms make the series easily adaptable to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or in what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.<br/><br/>Published in World at War magazine #20, Oct-Nov 2011.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 hours<br/>Hex: 550 yards / 503 meters<br/>Units: companies<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Gross Deutschland Panzer rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-20<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this two-player game, players line up four turtles in a row and lay out ten black and ten white balls. The turtles are two-sided and have a different number of holes on each side, although always an odd number. On a turn, a player either takes a ball of any color, places it on an empty hole on a turtle, and moves that turtle one space forward in line (assuming it's not at the front) or moves one of his balls already on a turtle backward to a different turtle, leaving all turtles in the same locations. The game ends when all the holes are filled, and the winner is the player who has the most balls on the turtle at the head of the line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Zelosport Finger Football was created around the age-old concept of flicking a folded piece of paper across a tabletop until any portion of the triangle-shaped football hangs over the table's edge for a touchdown. Six points is awarded for the touchdown and the player then kicks an extra point through his opponent's &quot;finger goal posts.&quot;<br/><br/>Zelosport's version has a high gloss, durable, multi-colored playing surface designed very much like a real football field. It's actual size is 2'x4' and fits easily on most kitchen or dining room tables. The back side of the playing surface is covered in a non-slip material allowing the game to be played on most surfaces without constant movement.<br/><br/>The paper football has been replaced by two very different objects. A one inch plastic &quot;slider&quot; with a small ball bearing inside is flicked down the playing surface for runs, passes, touchdowns and 2 point conversions. For kicking field goals, a three inch foam football is included. Also included with the game are two dice used by the defense to determine the play required by the offensive player, 8 rubber washers and a ball marker to mark the line of scrimmage and the score, down and plays completed, as well as a set of rules.<br/><br/>",

It is not allowed to curse.<br/>If a player disregarded the rules, he has to take a sip from his drink.<br/><br/>There are four cards that give the instruction to fill a sip of your drink into the glass in the middle.

Each tile has one business on it and a colored chip corresponding to the player who placed it.  Once the board is filled, play moves to the next stage.  Each player has a pawn next to the fountain at the center of the board.  The object is to visit each of the businesses that you laid out in the first phase.  Each successive business you visit gives you more movement points, but the real goal of the game is to score the most points.  Points are scored by forgoing remaining movement when you arrive at your businesses.  In addition to a scoring pawn, players are each given a police token which can be used to hamper other players' movements.  Players who have completed their circuit wait at the fountain until all players have finished, but finishing quickly gives you a point bonus for each turn you wait.<br/><br/>",

There is only one round of bidding per card. Bids are valued based on the size of a suit (e.g., three-of-a-kind beats two-of-a-kind, etc.), and if the size matches, you compare suits: Gold, Silver, Crystal, Marble. If size and suit match, compare a secondary bid (3 gold and 2 marble beats 3 gold and a silver).<br/><br/>The highest bidder activates the card's special effect and adds it to their discard pile. (Eventually it returns to their hand and activates again when in a winning bid.) The winner of the bid also gets to add a room to one of their two towers, while the other players draw cards. Play proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>Each player's two towers must match one another. The winner is the player with the tallest lower tower.<br/><br/>Unlike most deck-building games, you do not void your hand after your turn. Players who win bids discard their bids to build their towers, while other players draw cards.<br/><br/>",
