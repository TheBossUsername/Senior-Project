A gear jammer is a trucker/owner that is prepared to take the chance....challenge and risk to become the most successful on the board game of...Gear Jammers!<br/><br/>Objective:  To see who can run the most successful trucking business...based on a combination of companies owned, trucks on the road and cash on hand.  To do this, you will want to buy all the trucks you can buy, invest in companies that are going places, and hope you won't get stuck with too many accidents, losses or heavy costs.  <br/>What makes Gear Jammers really fun are all the chances you  take in hopes of collecting some profits.  You may run into a truck stop that means you miss a couple of turns!  We say &quot;Go for the profits anyway!&quot;.  If you own a fleet of trucks (and the value cards in your favour) you could be the ultimate winner of the game.  But don't count on a thing until the timer goes off.  Just when you think you've got the game in the bag, your old trucking buddy may land on a &quot;Price and Profit!&quot; card - and turn the whole game around.<br/><br/>Start your engines....roll out your trucks and begin driving on the highway to success....if you dare!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board is wooden (made of exotic hardwood), into which there are 21 half-inch diameter holes. Basically the positional shape of the holes is a five times five grid with corners removed:<br/><br/><br/>5 ooo<br/>4ooooo<br/>3ooooo<br/>2ooooo<br/>1 ooo<br/> ABCDE<br/><br/><br/>The dark player has seven dark shafted game pieces to control. The light player has seven light shafted game pieces to control. Each game piece is formed as a stick which will fit nicely into any of the holes. Each piece has coloured caps at the end in six combinations:<br/><br/>1.) yellow / orange<br/>2.) orange / red<br/>3.) red / purple<br/>4.) purple / blue<br/>5.) blue / green<br/>6.) green / yellow<br/><br/>Game rules give the hint that these form a circle of colours. This information might help and can be used to find logical game strategies here.<br/><br/>The seventh piece being special is<br/><br/>7.) white / black<br/><br/>Colour white is used being a 'wild' (joker). It can be used as a legal replacement for any colour mentioned before.<br/>Black is basically a blocker not representing any colour.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns. When a game piece is placed in a hole one of the coloured end caps is obviously not visible anymore. Placing a game piece the non visible colour must be announced loudly and clearly enough to the opponent while setting the piece.<br/><br/>On his first turn a player must place one of his pieces into any free hole. After the first turn a turn consists of one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1.) Play another own offboard piece into another free hole, or<br/>2.) Turn any one of your already played pieces upside down in the same hole (announcing the non visible colour towards the opponent clearly and loudly), or<br/>3.) Move any one of your played pieces to another hole (but not turning it upside down)<br/><br/>The object is to get three of the same colour in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and the first player to do so wins. Since each player's set contains only two caps of each colour (as listed above), at least one of the three-in-a-row might has to be an opponent's piece.<br/><br/>The 'wild' game piece can only be played as soon as all other six pieces are already set before. This way you can build and win creating a three-in-a-row using own and/or opponent's white game piece as well. The black colour can not be used in a three-in-a-row constellation since it is used as a blocking piece only.<br/><br/>In general each player can only move game pieces with a shaft of own colour. But any game piece can be used to form the three-in-a-row to win.<br/><br/>Initially you draw by lot who goes first. In consecutive rounds the previous loser takes the first turn.<br/><br/>You might find similarities in game play like in Quarto (published in 1991, using opponent's pieces as well to form the winning row) and Memory (published in 1959, remembering the hidden colours is definitively helpful).<br/><br/>In contrast to Tau the newer Calypso does not include the aspect of a Memory game any longer. The colour which is not visible in Tau (and has to be announced each time) is still visible in Calypso due to the other construction of the game pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isle of Eldermoor Chess is a large board chess variant.<br/><br/>It is played on a larger 10X10 board to allow more pieces, and then borrowed the idea of the Citadel corner from Omega Chess, an idea quickly expanded to an area of seven additional squares on each corner, leaving the board with a more castle-like appearance.<br/><br/>The game also uses the 'river' idea in the centre from Xiangqi, as well as an inner King's sanctum area,<br/><br/>The first goal of Isle of Eldermoor was to toss out the traditional Western Chess game. There are great variants such as Omega Chess, Opulent Chess, and Grand Chess which take the traditional game and add to it with a few new pieces. It's been done.<br/><br/>So only the King was transfered to Eldermoor.<br/><br/>The rest of the army array reflects more of a fantasy Medieval army, so Paladins, Cavaliers, Yeomen, Soldiers, Archers etc are used.<br/><br/>As an ode to long nights of Dungeons &amp; Dragons over the years a fantasy element with Wizards, Griffins and Dragons are also part of the game<br/><br/>With an all new piece array, I needed different movement patterns, well different from Western Chess at least. There are so many variant pieces almost every conceivable movement pattern has been done before in one variant or another.<br/><br/>The resulting movements draw on Western Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi and related variants.<br/><br/>The game has three win conditions;<br/><br/>The game is won by checkmating the opposition king.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>If a player loses both Wizards the morale of their army is broken and they lose the game.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>You win by occupying both opponent's wizard towers, and holding them for one full turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was manufactured by Novelty Manufacturing Co. out of Richmond, CA in 1955. Arm chair quarterback is a game that consists of a game board, first down/yardage marker, 11 red defensive pawns, 1 tan offensive pawn, and a huddleboard with two metal stands.<br/><br/>The object of the gameplay: The huddleboard is placed in the middle of the board allowing the offensive and defensive teams to call their play.  The offense has 9 spots/plays to place their pawn.  The defense has 11 pawns with 16 spots to try and stop the play of the offense.  When the huddleboard is removed each team can see the result of the play. At each spot on the board a result of the play is posted as whether its a gain, loss, turnover, TD, or incomplete. After each play, you record the information on the yardage/down marker. Like football, the offensive player must make 10 yards in 4 downs to continue or the the board is turned around to switch positions.  The game can be played for 30 or 60 minutes depending on your preference. Note: All plays are based on national averages. There is no advantage to either team. It all depends on how good you are at playing QUARTERBACK!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Descriptions from Kickstarter:<br/><br/>A Las Barricadas is a boardgame about conflict between two opposing social forces, namely that of the state and of anti-authoritarian demonstrators. It is a two-player game with each player representing one of these social forces, the theatre of this conflict being that of the street demonstration. It is being developed and designed by the Black Flag Games collective, committed to the idea that games and interactive media can have an impact in the struggle for a free and cooperative world. We are also committed to the ideals of free culture and aim to deliver professional play experiences that enrich a participatory entertainment culture.<br/><br/>'A Las Barricadas' is a two-player, asymmetric boardgame. This means it is a contest between two players whose ability to affect the game is different. Play takes place on a board which represents a real city or historic location, and small chips are placed on building squares (buildings can be occupied, blockaded or vandalized). The Radical player chooses randomly from a small deck of objective cards and both players choose their tactics for the game. Victory is achieved by the Radical player if they complete their objectives in an allotted number of rounds. The Police player only gets a small piece of flavor text as a hint to the objectives of the radical player, and their objective is to keep the radical player from gaining victory points and completing their goals. Many of the objectives relate to acquiring Strike chips (by causing economic loss through blockades, pickets, occupations etc.) or by gaining Media chips (representing media coverage).<br/><br/>",

The machine would choose its' move by measuring electrical resistance between its' sides of the square and would reportedly win &quot;almost always&quot; when making the first move.<br/><br/>The game was later re-discovered independently by mathematician David Gale, who got it published under the name of Bridg-It.<br/><br/>Bird Cage has since been defined as an abstract game called the Shannon Switching Game, playable on any finite graph.  In the abstract game, two players, Short and Cut, will either attempt to connect two predetermined points on the graph (short) by claiming edges, or remove graph edges (Cut) such that the two points cannot be linked.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barrier is similar to Ludo/Pachisi. It is a roll and move game in which you try to get all your counters round the board before your opponents, however you can also use your counters to form barriers (by stacking multiple counters on top of each other). Forming a barrier blocks your opponents from moving past until they roll an exact number (which reduces your barrier by 1). The downside of this is that your barrier counters can not move, but can be disbanded at any time.<br/><br/>The game is played in teams of 2, and your roll can count for either you or your partner. Partners must be formed form opposite colours (i.e. red &amp; yellow, blue &amp; green, orange &amp; purple). Both partners can contribute to a single barrier or create separate barriers. Landing on an opponents counter sends it back to the start.<br/><br/>The strategy of the game revolves around 6 key points:<br/>1) Where to build barriers for the best effect<br/>2) When to build barriers<br/>3) When to break barriers<br/>4) The order of colours in the barrier<br/>5) When not to 'knock off' your opponents counters<br/>6) How to keep counters moving<br/><br/>The rules also allow for the length of the game to be altered. Each counter each person has equates to 30 minutes game play - meaning a game where each person has 4 counters lasts 2 hours, a 6 counter game will last 3 hours.

Players pick from one of ten different ships, all with their own unique ability, and try and avoid asteroid belts, mine fields, and even police barricades.<br/><br/>Players control their ships speed, manage what is in their various hulls, install upgrades to better their chances of winning, and even play special cards to sabotage others. But they must also be careful to not be too greedy, because hidden in the deck where they find their items and cargo are special events that rarely end up good for anyone. These events can be as simple as one player discarding one piece of cargo, and as complex enough to warp everyone to a new location, have two players swap minds, or even put a ship swallowing black hole into play.<br/><br/>The aforementioned Space Cops are also a hassle, but also what sets the game apart from its peers. Players must manage how much cargo they are carrying and where they store it, because they might end up being accosted by the Space Cops when passing through a Police Barricade or when a rival player blows the whistle on them. If a Space Cop searches the Players ship and finds contraband, they must then deal with the consequences!<br/><br/>",

If you are wrong, the card goes back to the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the player on your left.<br/><br/>The player with the most cards when the deck runs out, wins.<br/><br/>A solitaire game is also suggested. Turn over the cards one at a time. Roll the die and answer the question indicated. If you are right, place the card on your left and call cards won, the Winning pile. If you are wrong, place it on your right and call those the Duffer's pile. Keep going until all 54 cards are exhausted. Collect 28 or more cards in your Winning pile and you have won.

The rules of winning a Championship in this game are the same pointwise, as winning a real Championship. The first player to lay down a complete &quot;dog&quot; wins a hand. The hand is counted by adding up the point value of each of the body parts, or in the case of a complete &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; dog, the point value assigned to that dog.<br/><br/>",

It's not as easy as all that though, because someone could play an event card that will completely throw the rules of that round a curve, making it anyone's game!  This is a quick, and easy to learn and had a little snark to it as well. All you need to know how to do to play B4U is some simple math, and that's it.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/><br/>Gameplay is easy. As a round begins, you place two card facedown on the table. One in front of you, and one to your right. The card in front of you (which can either be a Irony card, or an Event card) will always come into play each round, but the one on the right (always an Irony card) may or may not.<br/><br/>After all necessary cards are placed into play, the card in front of everyone is turned over and exposed. In the simplest version of a round, the card played with the highest Irony value wins that round. If someone has played an Event card in the front position, then the round gets skewed in some fashion (explained on the card). Such things that could happen are the player with the lowest value wins, or you use the Irony value of both cards, etc.<br/><br/>When an event card is played, that is when the card to your right will be turned over. Some event cards also require you to play a third card onto the table.<br/><br/>After a winner for the round is determined, the round is over, and everyone puts any non-displayed cards back into their Six Pack, and draw back up to 6 cards if the Six Pack is not complete.<br/><br/>First player to win 7 rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Being a game of genteel warfare for two players desirous of campaigning in the manner of the 18th century.&quot;<br/><br/>Cockpit of Europe was published as an article in issue No. 49 of Miniature Wargames magazine in May of 1987. Despite its source this is not a set of miniatures rules, but a paper-and-pencil game of conducting campaigns and sieges in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. It allows two players without a referee to re-create the &quot;limited&quot; or &quot;scientfic&quot; wars of the period dominated by methodical sieges and maneuvering armies against the enemy's line of communication instead of pitched battles. While not detailed, it is rich in historical flavor, not in the minutiae of weapons and tactics but the general's big picture of moving armies within the constraints of supply and time.<br/><br/>Games consiste of several campaign seasons of twenty weeks. Armies must return to winter quarters each year, so only fortresses captured will be retained from season to season. Collecting intelligence is key, or you won't know if your siege train can reach the enemy and create a practicable breach before their supplies run out, or winter sends you home.<br/><br/>This is the warfare of Marlborough and Vauban!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Toss 'N' Roll Spooky Dice Math is a small-box game with a double-sided board and three glow-in-the dark orange dice.  The 16-page instruction manual includes directions for six simple math games, including Spider's Web, Big Numbers, Match Points, On the House, Shout Out and Prime Time.<br/><br/>Spider's Web: <br/>The dice are rolled onto a bull's eye board divided into eight pie sections labelled one through eight.  Depending on where the die landed, it is multiplied, added or subtracted from the number of the pie piece in which it landed.  No points are scored for dice which land in the exact center or off the board completely.  The winner is the first to reach a score of 300.<br/><br/>Big Numbers: <br/>Using the same board as Spider's Web, players roll the three dice onto the board, then scramble to be the first to find the largest three-digit number possible, using either the face value of the dice or the number slices into which they landed.  This game teaches place value and the winner is the first to reach 2,000.<br/><br/>Match Points: <br/>Each player rolls one die onto the spider web board, making a fraction with the smaller of the die or number slice value (on which the die landed) being the numerator.  When a player has collected enough fractions to be one or greater, he scores a point and starts over collecting fractions.  The first player to collect five whole numbers wins.<br/><br/>On the House:<br/>Using the game board with six numbered houses, each player rolls one die onto the game board.  If the die matches any digit in the house square on which it landed, the player scores.  Scoring involves adding each of the digits of the three-digit number on the board together, then multiplying by the die value.  The winner is the first player to reach 250 points.<br/><br/>Shout Out:<br/>A designated shooter rolls two dice off the board and one die onto the haunted house board.  Depending on which of the six house squares the die lands, all players race to perform the required math operations on the three dice first.  The first player to be the first ten times wins.<br/><br/>Prime Time:<br/>Each player rolls the three dice onto the haunted house board, then looks for prime numbers amongst the sum of the die and door number, the dice themselves and the door numbers themselves.  Any missed primes may be stolen by other players.  The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The origins of this game came about due to discussions involved with games evolving over time and being robust enough to handle the change.  Other concepts were also added to shape it, such as handling draws and the use of the pie rule to handle uneven game conditions.  The game was built around these concepts.<br/><br/>The name of the game comes from the philosopher Heraclitus who said a person never jumps into the same river twice.  The game involves the changing of game conditions from round to round, and a testing of the player's skill to be able to evaluate and manipulate such game conditions to their advantage.<br/><br/>The base game takes place on half a checkerboard, and each player has 12 pieces each.  In the basic game, if no rules changes are applied, players end up dropping a piece on the board from the reserve, sliding one of their pieces on the board, or swapping one of their pieces with an opponent's piece on the board.  Players capture enemy pieces by jumping.  In the normal game, players win the game by capturing at least 6 enemy pieces.<br/><br/>This is Game #29 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.<br/><br/>",

Fun!<br/>Baa! is very cute triangle-tile-based board game which is originally designed, illustrated, manufactured and published by Joshua Chao on June 15th, 2011.<br/>Players explore the farm and place their fences on it to create folds as the game progresses. The more sheep a player can have, the more score a player can get. But not so easy...<br/><br/>Gameplay in short:<br/>On a player's turn he places a triangular tile (farm) from his hand connected to tiles already on the table first to create a landscape. After that he places a fence  on the connecting side of to farms to hurd sheep optionally. Fences cannot be placed next to trees. Taking a new farm from the stack ends his turn and the next player is on.<br/>If an area is completely surrounded with fences regardsless of colour (a fold) after playing a fence scoring is forced. A fold must contain at least one sheep and a shed and cannot cannot contain empty spaces. Sheep are owned by the player with the most fences alongside the fold (draws are possible). Whites get you 3 points, grays 2 and blacks 1. Sheep next to a fruit bush earn you 1 bonus point.<br/>Game ends when a player has used all his fences or when the stack of farms is depleted. Player with the most point in total wins. Draws are decided by the amount of fences left in a player's hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THAT SPORTS GAME is a newly produced classical board game that uses dice for player movement, a card game within the game to compete for amateur sports. The sports are the sports in the list of sports approved by the Olympics for athletic competition at the quadriennial games.<br/><br/>That being said, there is NO TRIVIA, and no knowledge of sports required. The only requirement is a love of board games, and an understanding of how board games function.<br/><br/>That Sports Game game play involves everyone at the table, whenever a sports event space is encountered by landing on it. The SPORTS EVENT card is drawn, every player must 'pay' to enter the sport, and then using the GET SET deck, that includes 5 cards per person at the outset, each player 'bids' for the event by using their skill, experience, and training against each other competitor. The winner of the Sports event keeps the SPORTS EVENT CARD, as well as takes the honorarium designated on the card, plus the cash of all the other competitors in the event. The aim is to get enough sports event cards to qualify for a coach (if you don't get a coach by other means) and a sponsor, so that you can move up to national and global competition.<br/><br/>When landing on other spaces like HOST CITY, a Host City Card is<br/>drawn, and specs followed.  Drug testing may be required, taxes, fund raising and Bonus spaces also are  part of the mix. Scoring as per the score card, determines the winner in most games if timed.<br/><br/>We enjoy playing 1:23   (that is one hour and twenty three minutes) and then compute the winner. You might be surprised to find yourself an athletic champion!<br/><br/>For lots of information, look to our website:  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.thatsportsgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.thatsportsgame.com</a><br/><br/>",

If a player's Horse and Rider, or Child and Dog, occupy the same space then they form a &quot;block&quot; which opposing pieces may not pass.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game in the little known third series of games from Melins/Scandecor. Like the bigger plastic boxed games (Play Ecology and others) the game box is hard plastic in excellent quality.<br/><br/>The game tries to simulate real tennis as closely as possible, although with directions quantified to three (forward, left diagonal and right diagonal) and with 4x4 spaces on each side as possible places for the ball to land. For every turn, you can move both your pieces (up to two steps), and one of them must land at the ball. You then select a position on the other side, along the lines from the ball, in which you strike the ball.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to win a tennis &quot;game&quot;, following tennis rules, and there are markers for 0-15-30-40-advantage on the side of the board, but no marker for number of games, since you are only expected to play one.<br/><br/>Alas, the game has no random elements whatsoever which makes it fairly easy to see through, and once you understand the tactics, a single ball takes forever. This was most likely one reason why the game was short lived and is pretty unknown today.<br/><br/>",

They are fear of the savage and dangerous side of nature they are beasts that walk like men and use their own tools against them.<br/><br/>Goblinoids are not the most intelligent or tactically minded of creatures, their options mostly being limited to attacking endlessly, relying on their great weight of numbers to succeed where others would fail. Their personal physical prowess and low animal cunning still makes them dangerous though and many a well thought out and clever trap has failed to take into account goblinoid tenacity and savagery.<br/><br/>They are the engines and footsoldiers of chaos and evil, bringing war and strife to every land and every people endlessly. Occasionally a great host will arise, lead by an effective leader and then the lands of the man-like races should tremble and fear what is coming.<br/><br/>",

In our game, we attempt to simulate the feeling of being the commander of a Corps commander in the Civil War, notably it&rsquo;s most well known and well studied battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. The desire to simulate a realistic battle has to be weighed against the constraints of time, attention, and ease of play. As such, we&rsquo;ve streamlined the game a good deal since its initial play testing, and hope that you&rsquo;ll find this version of the game easy to learn and play, taking no more than a  few short minutes to get your first game underway. We have also attempted to order the scenarios not only by chronological order, but by complexity. This was done so that you can learn the finer points of strategy as you go along, without feeling bogged down trying to command half the Army of the Potomac.<br/>    Each chit in the game represents roughly one battalion of soldiers, or a single battery of guns. Although historically many of the battalions came from all over the country, and had a variety of names, to keep the game simple, we have avoided putting unit names on the chits, and simply created names for the OOB for each mission. Commander&rsquo;s names have been kept though, and are generally correct in terms of participation in the events they are represented in.<br/>        Players take the role of either a Confederate or Union officer commanding his soldiers, alternating between players. The game is divided into a variety of scenarios to represent individual portions of the battle, and one large &quot;Campaign&quot; scenario. To win the player must complete the objectives stated on the scenario orders, which generally align to the historical goals of the respective commanders. Players move the chits around the map, having to take into account terrain, roads, and overall tactical situation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Review by John Humphries in Games and Puzzles #30:<br/><br/>Crown Chess is an unfortunate choice of name for this interesting and original game, as it bears no resemblance to chess. Perhaps Crown Prince may be a more apt name.<br/><br/>The game is played on a large, circular, wooden board on which are printed five concentric rings which are radially divided into eight sections, giving forty spaces or panels in total. The outermost ring or band is gold in colour, the remainder being black or white, in a pattern such that each adjacent pair of sections are of a similar colour and each panel is surrounded on three sides by panels of like colour.<br/><br/>Four sets of playing pieces are supplied. Each set consists of a Prince, two Barons (elephants) and two Viscounts (horses). The pieces are well moulded from resin, each set being in a distinguishing pastel colour. In addition there is a Crown, resembling an up-turned vase. The rules are simple and easy to follow.<br/><br/>The Crown is worn by one of the Princes, who is thus elevated to King. The object of the game is to promote your Prince and then manouevre him to the gold (outer) band. All pieces may be moved in or out one panel, the Prince can be moved an unlimited number of panels in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, the Baron only clockwise and the Viscount only anti-clockwise. No diagonal moves are permitted and the only piece allowed to move onto a panel already occupied is the King, and this only to capture. The King is the only piece able to capture other pieces. The Crown is gained by moving a piece onto a panel of the same colour and adjacent to the King, who is then demoted and the new Prince is crowned.<br/><br/>Although not a difficult game to play, Crown Chess does require thought and planning. However, it is rather difficult to formulate strategy because the situation changes so rapidly with four players. The Hints on Play provided advice that the main objective should not be to take the Crown, which should only be done to prevent another player from winning, to prevent possible capture of your pieces or to win the game. As pieces cannot jump over one another, there is a certain amount of aimless movement. and blocks can occur. Princes may not be captured, thus there is no way of forcing them to move. One of the best winning strategies seems to be to move one's Prince onto a panel adjacent to a Gold, keep it protected and wait for other players to blunder, then take the Crown at the opportune moment and make the winning move.<br/><br/>The game does have many unique concepts and apart from the box is extremely well presented. It is also most decorative though probably beyond the means of most games players (this game cost 18 pounds at the time of release).<br/><br/>",

The cards show the offensive plays; Fullback thru line, Halfback Off Tackle, Halfback Around end, Long Pass, Jump pass, Flat Pass etc. The Offensive player selects his play call while the defensive player puts the cards in order depending on which play he thinks the Offensive player will call. The order that the cards are placed in determines how successful the offensive play is. If the defense matches the offense then the defense has guessed the right play and the gain will be minimal. If the offensive play was Halfback around end and the defensive player had that card 4th in order the gain might be 7 yards. If the defense had the card 3rd in order the gain might be reduced to 4 yards. So the closer to the actual play call the defense is, the lower the gain potential. There is also a clock that the players move. Run plays take 30 secs while pass plays take 15 secs.<br/><br/>",

The top is spun in the other bowl and the idea is to grab the cards one at a time and build up words while the top is still spinning. Letters that are unused must be returned before another one is taken. The grabbing must stop immediately the top falls over.<br/><br/>One point is scored for every card used in a word which is the same colour as the spot on the top side of the dice when it falls. If the word starts with a white card the score is doubled.<br/><br/>Each round consists of two spins of the top; then the words are broken up and the cards returned to the bowl for the start of a new round.<br/><br/>The winner is either the first player to score a set number of points or the high&not;est number of points in a set time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Strategic Game of Aerial Dragon Combat<br/>Blood poured from a ragged wound in his neck and his wings were frozen and sluggish from Syrinaxx&rsquo;s icy breath, but Ulmasaur drove himself onward.  The frost dragon&rsquo;s wingbeats thrummed behind him, relentlessly matching each maneuver as they banked around a mountain. But Syrinaxx had grown overconfident and Ulmasaur climbed, twisted and flipped in an unexpected wing over to arrive directly behind the white dragon and a vicious bite delivers a final mortal wound.<br/><br/>A vile smirk splits his maw as the white dragon plummets into the mist below, but victory is short lived, as the full bulk of the gigantic Lavendros collides mid-air with the black scaled Ulmasaur as they lock claws and tumble earthward - wings, gore and fangs in a deadly embrace.  The wind screams as they bite and rend one another, but as the ground rushes at them there is no hope for Ulmasaur, who takes the full brunt of the crash beneath the bulk of Lavendros.  The big dragon sniffs the corpse below him once before bellowing a victorious roar and taking wing, he is battered and broken but the skies are his and his alone.<br/><br/>Overview of Play<br/>In SkyWar Dragon, Each player controls a mighty dragon embroiled in a battle for supremacy in the skies. Players will play Flight Cards to maneuver on the board and gain position over their opponents so that they may then play damaging Attack Cards.  Flight Cards modify your Evasion and Combat, so careful section of the right card at the right time is essential to victory.<br/><br/>",

Created as a graduate project for an intelligence analysis program, Safety Net is designed to simulate various online defenses, threats and responses for an individual in an environment with sensitive information. Each card also includes flavor text describing the relevant threat or defensive option. This offers a great way to quickly introduce someone to the basic ups and downs of online security in a sensitive-information-based environment.<br/><br/>The player begins with 10 Security Points (SP) and attempts to use the Defense Deck to build multi-layered defenses across various electronic fronts (email, social media, and mobile devices), while each turn the 'Hacker' deck generates attempts to penetrate or disrupt the player's security, reducing the SP total. If at any point, the SP value reaches zero, the player loses the game. The player wins by successfully fending off the hacker's attacks and surviving ten rounds of the game with SP remaining.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To start, the players place two of their galleons in their main harbours and one in each of their smaller ports on the opposite side of the board. The admiral sails in one of the ships in the main harbour. The object of the game is to sink the enemy ship carrying the hostile admiral. One very interesting feature is that the ships in the smaller havens cannot be moved until they are released by the other ships in their navy.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player has three options. He may move one galleon one or two spaces in any direction; he may engage in battle with an enemy ship standing on an adjacent space, or he may move his admiral from one of his ships to an adjacent one. You release a ship simply by moving one of your galleons to the space immediately in front of the harbour in which it rests. Once having left port, no ship may return there during the game. This ensures that all ships are kept on active service and there is no running for cover. Battles are resolved by the roll of dice, one die for each friendly ship (up to a maximum of three) adjacent to the victim. Each 5 or 6 thrown results in a hit. A hit on a galleon in full sail means that the tile must be turned to reveal the damaged vessel. A hit on a damaged ship results in the sinking of that ship.<br/><br/>Obviously the main tactic is to release all of your ships as quickly as possible, and try to attack on a 2 &mdash; 1 basis. Due to the choice of options, a player must move his ship next to the enemy on one turn and wait until the next before firing his guns. This means that the enemy can either turn tail, or attack and hope to get in the first blow but at the same time remaining on station to accept an attack on the following turn.<br/><br/>",

One of three things can happen to a play child dropped down the chimney &mdash; it can come out on one side of the boot into the Playground, on the other side into the Swimmjng pool or it can remain inside the boot.<br/><br/>A child who spins Playground or Swimming pool can use his turn to move a play child from one play area to another. The winner is the player to get most play children on to one area.<br/><br/>",

Each round, the active player throws the die, draws a question card and reads the question and possible answers corresponding to the roll of the die. The other players choose one of their betting chips (with values 1-3 on the back) and place it on the answer fields (A, B or C). After the active player has read the correct answer, a player who has put his/her chip on the wrong answer loses that chip. Players who bet on the correct answer move their pawn the number of spaces corresponding the value on the chip they bet. Their chips are returned for further use. Then it is the next players turn to read a question.<br/>If nobody chose the correct answer, the active player gets to move his/her pawn according to the number of players in the game. If a player has lost all their betting chips, he/she gets an emergency chip (value 1). Players can earn back chips if they land on a city space (or they may chose to move 1-3 spaces instead: 1 space if he/she is in the lead, 3 if he/she is currently in last position, 2 spaces in all other cases).<br/>The game ends when a player reaches the final space.<br/><br/>",

You will have a range of high technology equipment and weapons to aid you, but the odds are stacked against easy success&hellip;<br/><br/>The board forms your inventory and view of the Tyrant's palace, allowing you to quietly stalk its halls and corridors as you track down your prey. While the palace is explored via two decks of cards and will be different in every game, you will be making important choices all the time that will affect your chances of success.<br/><br/>First, you will need to choose which school of assassins you will be trained by; the school of Dark Eon prizes stealth and deception above all else, while the school of Torsten Rex focuses on ranged weapons and one shot-one kill. Finally, the school of Magna Kurr practices ancient Jovian martial arts and can deal punishing blows with almost any part of their bodies.<br/><br/>You will also need to choose from a highly advanced but very limited range of equipment, including Stealth Suits, Ionised Rail Rifles, Psionic Shields, and many others. Finally, you must pit your wits against the defences of the Tyrant's palace, including avoiding or nullifying traps, evading guards, and defeating the mighty Warmaster Battle Engine as you close in on the Tyrant himself!<br/><br/>",

Each turn 2 random characters are discarded and then the players secretly choose the Player Character they will play in the current turn.<br/><br/>Each Player Character has 2 unique abilities. The first ability may be used on any turn, however the second ability may only be used in Chapters that the Player Character appears in the book.<br/><br/>Secondly, we have the Story Decks which are composed of: Characters, Quotations, and Objects from the book. There are Story Decks for all 12 chapters of the book. Each card may be played for its cost in the Chapter it appears in. Character and Object cards have a Story Point value that adds to a Player's score. Quotation cards are used to complete a Chapter, which is accomplished by playing 3 cards in the appropriate Chapter, but have no Story Point value. Completed Chapters double the points scored while incomplete Chapters score only the card's combined Story Point value.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I mentioned the cost of playing a card. In Alice: Adventures in Wonderland the currency we use is Tarts. One of the actions a player may take on their turn is taking Tarts. The Tarts are  used to play Story cards. Player's must carefully balance the number of Tarts they have in their possession, because at the end of the game any Tarts they have will count against their final score. They lose 1 Story Point for every Tart they did not return to the tray.<br/><br/>The game board we use in the game is called the Storyboard. Alice travels along a pathway from one chapter to the next, spending only a few turns in most chapters. When Alice moves into a new chapter, cards that players may have in their hands from a previous chapter may no longer be played.<br/><br/>Along the perimeter of the Storyboard is a Story Point Tracker. At the end of each Chapter, players score the cards they played (doubled if they played 3 cards) and all cards from the Chapter (in their hands, played in front of them, or remaining in the chapter's Story Deck) are removed from the game. There is also a Tart Tracker that represents the current number of Tarts each player has in their possession.<br/><br/>In the game, Alice is not a Player Character. She is not even a character in the Story Deck. In the game she is represented by a token that moves along a pathway through each chapter. She is a basically a timer. When the Alice token reaches the final space,  the game is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marbles? merges the exciting aspects of a party game with one-on-one challenges both observed and judged by all other players, the Peanut Gallery. Many of the challenges are reminiscent of familiar games. Others are very unique and designed specifically for the roles of Challenger, Opponent and Peanut Gallery. Marble-like gems are the currency. Players must use their intellectual marbles to win challenges and also strategically pose challenges that are to their greatest advantage. Highly dimensional, there are multiple perspectives of strategy.<br/><br/>Players take turns being the Challenger and can select any player not previously an Opponent in the same round. &quot;Teaser&quot; cards indicate Opponent availability. Opponent cards change the dynamics of the challenge. Peanut Gallery cards permit side wagers, further expanding the dimensions of how the game is played.<br/><br/>All challenges are performed in (2) minutes or less. Challenger cards detail a wide variety of tasks across (7) categories:<br/>1) Consensus - The Peanut Gallery is polled to derive a count that the opponent must accurately predict. Some are factual events like visiting an ATM within the last 24 hours while others are preferences such as: Cat or Dog, Chocolate or Vanilla, Paper or Plastic&hellip;<br/>2) Dice - Challenger cards in this category require a specified outcome from the roll of dice. Luck over skill, the tasks vary as defined for each challenge.<br/>3) Domino &ndash; To win, the Opponent must also hold a Challenger card in this category having a Domino number that matches one of the two numbers presented by the Challenger.<br/>4) Performance &ndash; Opponent must skillfully complete the challenge. Examples include telling a joke that invokes laughter and an impersonation in which the Peanut Gallery must correctly guess.<br/>5) Physical &ndash; Another skill category, the Opponent must successfully complete a task involving an activity like Origami (paper folding) or Roshambo (Rock-Paper-Scissors).  When the results are subjective, the Peanut Gallery judges the task.<br/>6) Playing Cards &ndash; A single hand of a common card game is played, such as Blackjack or Draw Poker. Every Challenger card in this category fully defines the task and specifies the requirements necessary to win.<br/>7) Starter &ndash; Cards in this category quickly establish the winner, simply with who holds the highest number.<br/><br/>The objective is simple. Take turns matching a Challenger card in hand with an opponent anticipated least likely to successfully complete the task. Opponents set the wager, either (1) or (2) marbles, upon the Challenger announcing the category. Should the Opponent fail the task, the Challenger wins the wager. Otherwise, the Opponent collects the wager.  Number of players determines the number of rounds. At game end after the final showdown (in case of a tie, if necessary), the player with the most marbles reigns supreme.<br/><br/>Not at all the game of marbles everyone played as a child, this version is all grown up but still retains the youthful retro spirit.<br/>&quot;Wanna play Marbles?&quot;<br/><br/>180 Marbles? Cards, 4 Color-Coded Types, 7 Challenger Categories<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A Rollicking Game of Skill&quot; proclaims the box. And it must have been very skilful, perhaps too skilful.<br/><br/>The game includes 6 wooden egg cups which are placed in the centre of the table. The players have a catapult device with which they lob the egg shaped pieces into an egg cup. At least, that is what they intend to do but it must have been devilishly difficult. The most successful player wins, but I suspect the only player to get it right wins automatically.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World-renowned genius (and eccentric) inventor Klaus von Essen has completed his latest creation, the &quot;Apparatus&quot;. The world wants to know what it does. His peers want to know how it works. His wife wants to know what it did with him.<br/><br/>In Apparatus, players race to recruit Researcher teams to invent the Contraptions that will help fund the recreation of the Apparatus. Of course building the first Apparatus is important, but not as important as exploiting it for financial gain. As the research teams are recruited, each Contraption is endowed with ever-increasing grants, and a player wins only if he collects the most Electros (the currency in the game)!<br/><br/>In the first part of the game, players use grants that provide income every turn to recruit Researchers of various Professions. Some of these Researchers are in high demand and a bidding war between players can break out. As the player's spend their Electros on Researchers, various Contraptions that comprise The Apparatus will gain value in the second part of the game. Once all the Researchers are acquired by the players, the game moves on to the second phase.<br/><br/>In the second phase of the game, players use recruited Researchers to compete to be the first ones to discover the various Contraptions that will help fund the creation of the Apparatus. Each Contraption requires certain types of teams of Researchers. Players compare values of the various teams to determine the winner and second place teams. The winner has a choice of gaining Electros, which is used to determine who wins, or gaining research notes, which determines who builds the Apparatus first. As the Contraptions are decided, the required teams become more and more difficult to build.<br/><br/>The game ends with the building of the Apparatus, which has a large reward for the first place team. Players then count up their Electros, and the player with the most wins the game!<br/><br/>",

If the Imp is sent face up, they all have unique abilities which will alter the course of the round but if an Imp is sent face down, the only thing that matters is the strength.  The winner of the round smashes the crate which may contain a puppy but on occassion, it could be a bomb or even a Ninja Kitten.  The general strategy is to put as many cards as possible in your score pile.<br/><br/>With the first expansion, Hissy Fits, more advanced Imps were added to the game as well as Imp drafts and even team play.  The second expansion added more Imps as well as Hidden Agendas, new cards you can attach to Imps when playing them face down.<br/><br/>The second expansion, Hidden Agendas, launched with this set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Career Challenge&reg; is a board game specifically designed to help students explore careers that may be good matches for their talents, interests, and work preferences. Players learn important facts about many careers and are encouraged to explore careers about which they previously had no knowledge or interest. The play of the game is a lot like a quiz show. Players answer questions to progress, and they receive checks as rewards. There are four decks of cards that the players use to learn about careers. The game comes with two sets of cards in each color. One set is designed for third and fourth graders, and the more difficult cards are designed for fifth and sixth graders. The four kinds of cards are as follows: 1. The Education and Skills cards help players learn about the importance of formal education and specific skills for various careers. 2. The What&rsquo;s It Like? cards teach players about what it&rsquo;s like to work in various careers. 3. The Good Career cards challenge players to match careers with interests and talents. 4. When a player picks a Guess My Career card, the player tries to get other players to guess the career by verbal descriptions and/or acting out the career.<br/><br/>Players also learn the importance of a college education for entering many careers, as well as beginning to think about job preferences, such as whether they want to work mainly on their own or with others. During the post-game discussion, players begin to focus on major industry groups and even individual careers.<br/><br/>",

You, as a system administrator, must load your program into a detonation node and set off chain reactions, scoring points for how many you get.  The chaining system can lead to massive scores and ultimate victory.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players select which Virxle (color) they are going after and set up an initial board.  Then, on their turn, they can play a card (Special Program or Circuit Card), load a program (placing a token on a detonation node), or run a program (setting off the program and scoring Virxles in your path).  Circuit Cards contain Virxles and detonation points, which players put down, building the board as they play. When running a program, the detonation node has a set distance (in one of the cardinal directions) the explosion travels.  If it can reach another detonation point, a chain begins and can continue for up to 9 detonations points.  Bonus points are scored for longer chains.<br/><br/>More advanced rules variants introduce Virxles the player must avoid as they become negative points.<br/><br/>",

They may also steal a word from a previous player if they can add a card to make a new word.  If they cannot do either of those, they must instead contribute a card from their hand to the table.<br/>Players score points for making words of four syllables or more, for making words using &quot;prize&quot; cards, or for using the last card from the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three years in the making, FUBAR: Assault on Penzar Island is an amalgamation of strategy game fused with contemporary popular cultural myths and a whole lot of chaos thrown into the mix.  Up to six different factions face off to control the last remaining land mass on Earth in the very distant (or not so distant) future.<br/><br/>The scenario and subsequent conflict begins with an alien abduction through the fabric of time and space which is unexpectedly thwarted by a glitch, landing the warring factions on a remote island in the middle of nowhere.  The factions begin in their respective base hub on the outskirts of the island.  Quickly, they must build their ranks and establish their perimeters to begin the conquest of their adversaries. Their goal is to acquire the Mojos of their opponents and secure more territories on the island.  Factions not only have their own set of specific cards to aid them in their conquest, they also have a random faction force that enables them to have a unique edge over their foes.   To complicate matters and add an element familiar to any survivalist, there is a good chance that chaos will enter the fray.  From radiation leaks, mad cow outbreaks, and teleportation malfunctions to volcano eruptions or the periodic tsunami, the unpredictable chaos events (a dreaded favorite) will force players to adjust their strategies as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The victory goes to the first player that successfully absconds with an enemy&rsquo;s Mojo and safely returns it to their own hub&hellip;. but the game could go on as there are chaos events that could shift the game objective at any time.  In addition, there are 4 other game variations with different objectives that players can choose from to make for a variety of gaming experiences with the same set.  There is a planned expansion/variation called Covert Ops being developed as well.<br/><br/>",

Choose from 24 different historic aircraft, each with different performance attributes which suffer as the plane takes damage. You may wind up an ace, or go down in flames!<br/><br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Dogfight is a World War I aerial combat flavored set collection card game in which players strive to collect then play sets of cards to line up a chance to damage their opponents.<br/><br/>The game features set collection, card drafting, and variable player powers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players manage their altitude and speed while trying to collect the cards necessary to attack each other.<br/><br/>Damage is recorded, not as hit points, but as degradation to the plane's unique performance attributes. Such damage could eventually cause the plane to be forced down, start on fire, go into an uncontrolled spin, or break up in midair.

        "description": "An abstract strategy game for 2 players. It is played using a  wooden board, marked into 64 squares, and 12 'ancient' looking coins, 6 silver and 6 gold. Five of each set of coins show a Wheel on one side and a Foot on the other, and the sixth coin has a Flag on both sides. There is also a small metal die.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with his 6 pieces positioned on opposite corners of the board. On the throw of the die a player may move up to 3 pieces corresponding to the number shown. A Flag, a Wheel and a Foot move differently on the board. If a Foot stops on the centre square it is turned over to become a Wheel. Specific movement rules come into play when a confrontation occurs. For example, a Foot piece must be removed from the game if it is confronted by two opposing Foot pieces.<br/><br/>The game may be won in 3 ways:<br/>a) by surrounding your opponent's Flag with any 3 pieces;<br/>b) by removing all of your opponent's pieces from the game; or<br/>c) by capturing your opponent's undefended Flag with your Foot.<br/><br/>The components are good quality - 'ancient' playing pieces, a burgundy and gold wooden board, a velvet draw-string bag for the coins.<br/><br/>Designed and produced in Australia. This is obviously a quality, small production but unfortunately the rules aren't available anywhere on the internet and the publisher's website no longer exists.<br/><br/>",

Give each player a card and place all the filler pieces in the center of the table face down. The object of the game is to complete cards correctly. Players draw from the face down fillers and try to complete a figure. If he/she does so the player draws another filler card and tries to add it properly. He continues to pick fillers until he draws a filler card that does not belong on his card. When that happens he/she returns the filler card face down into the center.

        "description": "This is a Monopoly clone from Late from the Sky, a publisher that specializes in themed Monopoly games. All the deeds, spaces on the board and cards feature snowman humor or helpful hits for building snow creations.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to determine how far they move.  Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property.  When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent.  Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.  The winner is the last player left in the game.<br/><br/>",

In a matter of a few months, over half of the UC&rsquo;s planets were infected. The only known way to defeat them is to glass infected planets, destroying any life support that planet has.

There is a wide variety of guns, just to mention some the classic Crowbar and Chainsaw, to the imperative Shotgun and Sniper Rifle.<br/>Survivors come in 8 classes: Soldier, Policeman (Riot), Fireman, Medic, Athlete, Explorer, Scavenger and Child). The way you use every class' talent and overcome it's weaknesses have real weight on the strategy development and use of items.<br/><br/>STORY AND STRESS<br/>Each match carries an excellent and different story, it is highly recommended for those who get the game to write their stories and send them through the game's website to have them published.

The main game, Kangaroos and Koalas, is a Snakes and Ladders type of roll and move game, where the aim of the game is to reward positive character traits displayed by the kangaroos and to penalise negative character traits displayed by the koalas by moving playing pieces to higher or lower squares. For example, landing on 'Caution' moves a player up to Safety' and landing on 'Selfish' moves a player back to 'Lonely'.<br/><br/>The second game, 'Where's Kolo?' is a search and find game, involving luck as well as colour, number and picture recognition. Players race around the board, trying to find Kolo Koala underneath special gumnut tokens. Finding a &quot;Here's Kolo&quot; token allows a player to collect a piece of a jigsaw puzzle. The first to complete their puzzle is the winner.<br/><br/>Rules for two other games, using the same components, are included in the box.<br/><br/>Components: 1 double-sided game board, 1 die, 6 playing pieces, tokens, 4 jigsaws<br/><br/>",

It was also released on their website in a complete electronic format that can be printed for play. The core game is designed for three to five players, although included are variant rules for two players.<br/><br/><br/>     One player takes on the role of the cat and aims to capture mice by landing on them and then bringing them back to its owner's pillow. Capturing three mice will win the game for the cat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Other players are the mice and win by making two cups of tea. Each cup of tea requires three ingredients (one milk, one tea, one sugar). Ingredients are randomly determined and rewarded at the end of each round, given to whichever mice have claimed certain territories on the board. Mouse players can trade ingredients.<br/><br/><br/>As an optional rules, two spaces on the board offer chance cards to players that land on them. There are separate cat and mouse chance cards that provide competitive advantages of various types.<br/><br/>",

In the case that a player does not obtain the next needed letter he must move forward the number of spaces shown on either end of the arrow. If a piece falls opposite an opposing mouse,  the mouse is returned to the center of the board to be used again. If a player obtains a letter and there are only mice of an opposite color in the center he takes one of them and exchanges it for one of his own color, No two men or mice may occupy the same space.

The humans have placed deadly traps and poison everywhere, and two hungry cats prowl the area. While poison can simply be avoided, to score cheese from traps and escape the cats' clutches will require skillful use of slide cards. Don't forget about rival clans either - they'll resort to thievery if they have to!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pollen8 is a simple abstract strategy game in which two players try to capture the opponent's piece. Both players have 19 pieces, divided into two types: the pollen (4 pieces) and pollinators ( 2 ants, 3 lady bugs, and 10 bees). All pieces are red on one side and black on the other.  The players start by placing first the pollen pieces on the center of the board with their own color face up. After which, the players can choose to place two bees with piece from previous turn in between them or place a lady bug to flip a row or play the ant to push a row. Each piece must link to another piece at all time. At least 4 pieces are needed to capture an opponent's piece. Each captured piece is removed from the board and has a point. A pollen, a bee, a lady and an ant has 1, 2, 3 and 4 points respectively.  The game ends with the first player to get 8 points.<br/><br/>The lady bug and ant are useful for capturing pieces. When played at early stage of the game may result into earning points but at the same time presents difficultly to get additional points at the end part of the game. This also draws your opponent to try to capture your high scoring piece to score big against you. When they are played near the end of the game, it may be also too late to catch up and score ahead. Think ahead and plan you moves, knowing when to use the lady bug and the ant is the key for winning this game.<br/><br/>",

Players use a whimsical spinner to move a token along the pathway made of donuts. A player might gain or lose a donut hole, depending on the type of space where the token lands.<br/><br/>There are a number of options and the players do have decisions to make during a session. A player may move in either direction. Certain spaces give the player a choice between spinning again for a free move or setting a donut hole &quot;trap&quot; on the board for another player.<br/><br/>The player with zero donut holes who crosses the finish line first is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Designed for 2, 3, or 4 children ages 6 through 10 years old.<br/><br/>Includes a colorful board, spinner, 4 cardboard Porky Pig tokens with plastic bases, and 22 donut hole markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How The Game Works<br/>The Heart of Sut is set in a Steampunk Universe. Each player is given a secret objective. The game continues until one or more of the players have achieved their objective. Taking it in turns each player draws the next card on their adventure. If the group fails to meet the challenge laid down in front of them they must retrace the steps and take another route. Along the way they can collect some strange and exotic equipment. Can they find the Airship to help them in their travels or find uptodate victorian clockwork technology? Only the cards will tell.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>Each player is given a Character that must complete an objective. The objectives are not publically known and are as follows.<br/><br/>     Cultist - One of the other players must be killed.<br/>     Greed - Must collect 40 000GP<br/>     Horder - Must get a unique set of items<br/>     Journalist - Must collect five items from different sets.<br/>     Hunter - Must collect a trophy from each different species of creature<br/>     Adventurer - The group must find the artifact (get to the end of the roads) with no other clear winner<br/><br/><br/>Start of Game<br/>Each player is dealt four cards off the equipment deck. They may spend up to 4000GP on the equipment they have drawn and must discard the rest. Each player signifies what they have equipped by placing it on the table in front of them. Equipment usual increases the attack strength of the character. The player with the highest attack strength is given the title of Watchman and goes first.<br/><br/>Taking a turn<br/>The Watchman turns over the first road card. The road cards contain one day event and one night event. Every player is expected to take part in the day event first then the watchman completes the night event alone. When both events have been completed the Watchman announce the player to their right is the new Watchman. All characters are now allowed to reequip, trade between themselves and use items. When this is finished the game continues.<br/><br/>If both road events are completed succesfully the card is placed down in the middle of the table to signify they are on their journey. If they fail the road card is discarded.<br/><br/>Events<br/>Day Event: This can be anything from a Shop to a toll bridge to a raid by Monsters.<br/>Night Event: This can be a travelling sales man, a theif or a night raid by Monsters.<br/><br/>Monsters<br/>There are seven different species of Monster. These are broken down into three different classes. To defeat a monster you must have an attack value greater then the monster's. If you defeat the monster you get his body as a trophy and one random equipment as loot. If you cannot defeat him alone someone else can help you but all loot is discarded. If you are unable to defeat a monster you loose a peice of equipped equipment. If you have no equipment left you die and are out of the game (Causing the Cultist to win). No one can fight more then one monster a turn. There are no limits to the number of trophies a player can carry.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/>Equipment falls in to five types Hat, Coat, Weapon, Gadget and One Shot. An equipment set is made up of a specified Hat, Coat, Weapon and Gadget. Hat, Coats and Weapons increase the characters attack value. Gadgets are usually useable by the whole group once one person has it equipped.  No one can fight more then one monster a round with the exception of One Shots. One Shots can be used once and then must be discarded. One Shots can be played on the monster or the character fighting the monster by anyone. The player can have at most four equipment cards in his hand unless he has a gadget that allows him to have more.<br/><br/>Money<br/>Every Monster Trophy and Equipment card has an amount of GP in the bottom right corner of the card. When the characters are at a shop then can discard either equipment or monster trophies for cards off the equipment draw pile at the apropriate cost. No change is given.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is sort of an odd entry which fits with this odd game. In part this entry is to document that Scarnie was not a predecessor of Scarney. John Scarne used his name in many games in many variations. It makes trying to reconstruct his contributions to board games even more frustrating. Having never seen the game itself, I'll attempt to describe it from the rules. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be quite enough information to entirely reconstruct this game.<br/><br/>To make matters a bit more confusing in his book The odds against me Scarne has a 1929 picture of him playing a game named Scarney with Jimmy Braddock. The picture shows a game which fits this Scarnie game for which the rules are available (see weblinks). Being a good promoter Scarne didn't show him opposing the water boy at the boxing camp, but the champ himself!<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>Scarnie is played on a board with four stations. Each station has the numbers 1 to 7 arranged in a semi-circle arranged in front of the player. There is common &quot;pool&quot; area in the center of the table.<br/><br/>There are 28 men which we will say are black discs. There is a number on one side of the disc, with each disc having one of the numbers between 1 and 28. 20 numbers are say red, and eight are say green. (Sorry but rules don't specify color/number association!!).<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>The men are place numbers down in the pool area, and then each player fills his stations consecutively (thereby selecting seven pawns total for the station) and keeping the numbers hidden from the other players. The dealer calls &quot;play&quot; and the men are turned over to reveal the numbers.<br/><br/>The rules mention  &quot;Double&quot;, &quot;Triple&quot; , and &quot;Draw&quot; positions which I cannot explain. The available rules do describe other aspects of play. The gist is however that the pawns are eliminated from the board, and the last pawn left on the board scores points for that player.<br/><br/>",

Designed to cover large-scale battles, AOR is fast and flexible. Players control many strategic decisions, but some random elements such as turn sequence, movement and morale undercut this control in battle. The careful general will take these risks into account.<br/><br/>Age of Ravens is set in the world of Lowell. Here, after the fall of a great evil known as the Thonak, peoples and cultures struggle to reclaim what was lost. The races and history reflect this setting, but AOR can easily be adapted to a variety of other worlds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game simulates players trying to hit a target at the far end of a playing field using stones or similar projectiles. The target is either suspended in the air or on the ground, which will be agreed upon by the players. A graph paper or grid paper (10x10 or 20x20) represents the playing field. The movement of the projectiles per turn is determined by a standard die roll. Each player has four projectiles to throw. If the projectile hits the target or misses it, it is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>Each move starts with a dice roll. The player moves his projectile according to the dice roll. For each dice roll, the user can choose to move a projectile which is already airborne or introduce a new projectile into the playing field.  For the initial moves the projectile has to travel towards the sky (top of the graph paper) in a diagonal manner (towards top right). After the projectile is airborne, the player can choose whether the projectile has to fall down in this turn. If he chooses so, then the projectile will have to move horizontally for this turn and the next turn onwards the projectile moves towards bottom right(ground) diagonally. The projectile always move to the right and cannot go back. (Should obey laws of gravity and projectile motion). The target is always placed at the second half of the paper, towards the right edge.<br/><br/>If the projectile hits the target the player is awarded 5 points. If the projectile hits another players projectile (lands in the same square) in the second half (right half) of the graph sheet, then 1 point is awarded and the opponent projectile is removed. The player can hit another player's projectile only in the second half of the field.Game continues till all projectiles are removed from the graph paper. The player with most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is made by Tudor, the company who brought you the vibrating Electric Football game. Teamed up with Disney, this much simpler (and as a result, more fun for kids) game uses that same clever technology. Happily, all you have to do to play is put your ship in one of the tracks and let it go. You can adjust the knob on the board to control the speed (amount of vibration), but you don&rsquo;t have to fiddle with anything else to play! Just flip the switch and you&rsquo;re off to search for treasure!<br/><br/>Players choose from one of four 1.5-inch long ships made of tin and plastic, which are piloted by either Mickey, Donald, Goofy, or Pluto. Each character has a differently colored background on their game piece. There are four Ports to choose from as a starting point for each player.<br/><br/>The goal is to sail for the Treasure Chests at the top, worth from $200 to $500! Many sailors will be side tracked along the way into one of the many Coves where lesser treasure of $100 can still be found. But watch out! Captain Hook is on the prowl as his ship starts out from Pirate&rsquo;s Cove from the top of the board and if you are intercepted by his ship, you&rsquo;re sunk!<br/><br/>Some of the lesser treasure coves along the routes include names like Smugger's Cove, Doubloon Cove, Neverland Cove, Skeleton Cove, Shark Cove, and several others. The Treasure Chests at the top include Captain Kidd's Treasure, Captain Morgan's Treasure, Captain Hook's Treasure, and Long John Silver's Treasure.<br/><br/>-- description provided by Jason Monroe (belial1134) via the Unidentified Games page<br/><br/>",

Pawns start from the opposite extreme ranks. White moves first. Movements are as per pawn movement in chess. But opponent's pawns are not captured when they come in diagonally to each other. Instead they are pushed one square backward orthogonally. If there is no space to move orthogonally (square occupied by another pawn or there is no space in the board) then the attacked pawn is captured. One point is awarded per captured pawn and for each pawn which reach the opposite ranks. Game ends when no more pawns can be moved for either side.

        "description": "BLITZ BOLIDE is a racing car game based on Formula 1 race. <br/>THE PURPOSE OF BLITZ BOLIDE IS TO PLAY WITH 1/64 MINIATURE AND HAVE GREAT FUN IN DOING THAT. At this scale, a car has 7,5 cm or 3 inches length.<br/>Blitz Bolide is played on tracks which are made of spaces. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks).<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY : a car has four levels of gear : low, intermediate, high, and extreme.<br/>Each turn, his driver can increase or decrease this gear by 1 level.<br/>After that, he rolls 2 dice : according to the results of the dice, and according to the gear, the car is moved by a certain number of spaces. <br/>Move bonuses (in terms of spaces) are given by tyres, fuel gauge, suspension, etc...<br/>Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.<br/><br/>There are two important difficulties in the game :<br/>a) How to manage the Damage Points (DP) ? <br/>Each car begins the race with 8 DPs. DPs are lost during brutal brakings, during engagement, when the car is going out of track, at extreme gear, etc...<br/>A car is eliminated if it goes under 0 DP.<br/>The higher the speed, the faster you lose DPs. But you cannot win if your speed is too low...Here Pit Stop strategy is very important for purpose of managing DPs.<br/>b) How to take the corners ?<br/>Each corner has an optimal gear. If its gear exceeds the optimal gear while taking a corner, a car can goes out of track (losing speed and possibly DPs). <br/>However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a bend : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the corner more easily, but you become an easy target if engaged by opponents...<br/>Here, tyre strategy, set-up (aero grip, suspension, etc..), are very important things for purpose of taking a corner.<br/><br/>Basic rules cover : hard or soft tyres, fuel gauge, pit stop, optimal gear in bend, fast bend, etc...<br/>Advanced rules cover :advanced set-up (pit stop efficiency, bolide's toughness, etc...) defective gearbox, rain tyres, meteo.<br/>Expert rules cover : aero grip, suspension, oversteering, understeering, engine power, qualification lap, Events card.<br/><br/>For the moment, there are 8 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A party game where players use combinations of cards to create headlines along certain topics as demanded by The Editor. Each round sees a new Editor ask for a headline based on a certain subject which can be decided upon either at random or by flipping one of the included Topic cards. By using Actions, Descriptions and Things cards, players submit a headline to the editor and hope it will catch their interest. The Editor then chooses two headlines and asks the players to summarise the stories behind them. The Editor then chooses their favourite of the two and the headline is added to a Running Order.<br/><br/>The Running Order acts as a scoreboard of sorts. Players will recieve points for each card they use in their headlines but also get bonuses for the positions the stories end up in at the end of the game. Every time a new headline is added to the Running Order, the Editor for that turn decides where it will be placed, bumping all other stories lower than it further down the order. If there are more than ten stories, the lowest ranked one is removed from the game scoring that player no points. At the end of the game, the lead story recieves a bonus 10 points, the second 9, the third 8, etc., all the way down to 1.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A novel target game. The target ,so-to-speak,is a clown holding up 5 hoops. Each hoop is worth points, the amount of points depends on the size of the hoops. The two smallest are worth 50 points each, the middle-sized hoop is worth 25 points and the two largest hoops are worth 10 points each.<br/><br/>To score these points you must launch the paper hat pieces one at a time. You place a hat on one end of a springboard in the shape of a clown. Hold down the end where the hat is and let go. The hat will be sprung forward, hopefully at the target. If it goes through a hoop you score the appropriate points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points when the game has to be finished, wins.<br/><br/>Klee made this game for the export market because they used their Clover logo on the rules (but the traditional Klee logo on the box. Klee is the German word for Clover).<br/><br/>",

The first to dam the river wins!<br/><br/>In this fast paced, family friendly card game, players build their dam by using big log cards to build the base layer of their dam.  Then they can add in some twig filler by playing twig filler cards.  Finally it can be topped off with mud by playing the appropriate mud cards.  When you use these building material cards, you then add cubes to you player mat, which represents your dam.<br/><br/>But watch out!  Other players can attack your dam and damage it by playing stone, weeds, or felled tree cards!  These attack cards cause you to lose cubes from your dam.  But if you're lucky, you'll have some helpful beaver cards in your hand that can save the day.  Using a Busy Beaver card you can add a few cubes to your dam, which gets you that much closer to winning!<br/><br/>This game is full of interaction and confrontation.  Build your dam, damage your opponents.  The first player to build their dam up and put all the necessary cubes on their player mat is the winner!<br/><br/>",

They was a set of core rules (game engine) which every set of miniatures rules needs which deals with elements like the characteristics of your troops, their weapons, their morale and how these affect their performance on the tabletop like how to resolve combat or will they run away.<br/><br/>Fantasy Armies was written by Nick Eyre for Harlequin/Icon Miniatures for their range of metal miniatures; &quot;Fantasy Battles&quot; and Lord of the Rings Miniatures ranges (probably written to replace thier earlier rules; Raven).<br/><br/>The rules was to be published in a series of articles in Harlequin/Icon Miniatures own house magazine; The One Ring.  The core rules was to be published in three parts and the Army Lists would follow. The magazine only lasted 6 issues before the company change hands and the magazine was cancelled, so only the first two parts of the rules was published in issues 5 &amp; 6.<br/><br/>",

When the matching fairy tale (Humpty Dumpty, Jack Sprat, Old Mother Hubbard, etc.) is read by a character the kid holding that card tosses it away.<br/><br/>The children gain and lose cards during a session because the spinner is twirled when the stories appear on the tape. The player holding the Mother Goose card at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>There are no decisions to be made and there is no strategy.

        "description": "The title of this wargame for kids, published in Italy in 1940, means &quot;Air-Naval War&quot;.<br/><br/>The game board has identical red and blue territories on each end.  The players follow a numbered line across the ocean to attack the other player based on a roll of the dice. Units can end up in the space which leads to combat. Each turn, each player must move one of their planes, submarines and ships (they have two of each in their starting armies), alternating until one of each unit type has moved. Players try to destroy each others units and bombard the enemy territory. This occurs when a unit ends its movement in an enemy occupied space. An airplane can bombard the wooden representations of the Fuel Dump, Ammo Dump, Rail Station, Bridge, Office, etc. and remove them as &quot;booty&quot;.  The units must always move in one direction (toward the enemy) until they reach the end of the path, at that point each unit is treated differently (planes fly backward to the first square and ships are immediately returned to the 1st square and start moving toward the enemy again).<br/><br/>The Mas (torpedo boat) is an exception, it can move in both directions and sink any ship or plane that enters its space (it is only available to a player after that player has lost 3 units).<br/>  <br/>The island in the middle can be captured and fortified.  Victory occurs with one player destroys both enemy planes and half their ships.  There are no land based units except for an anti-air cannon which is placed in any empty, friendly land space at the beginning of the game.  It automatically destroys an airplane that ends it move in the same space.  Strategy comes from the choice of units to move each turn and becomes more involved with the activation of the Mas units.   It was released on June 10th, 1940, the day Italy enters World War 2.<br/><br/>",

This is to balance the fact that the 'Peasant' pieces start the game spread completely around the board, while the 'Royal' pieces are grouped together in the center.<br/><br/>",

Cross Over is a proper game, even adults will like it, but the rules for the Bridge Building game are completely indecipherable. So, I will only describe the Cross Over game.<br/><br/>Each player starts at opposite corners on the board. The object is to get one piece on to the opponents back corner (marked with an X on the board).<br/><br/>A die dictates distance of movement and you can only move a piece either horizontally or vertically. It would appear that you cannot change direction within the move. If you land on an opponent's piece, that piece is removed from the board. If a person has lost pieces and rolls a 6, he can bring on one of the lost pieces but only within his start field.<br/><br/>The game is magnetic with the two boards forming the top and bottom of a case and the pieces can be stored within that case.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the 4x4 version of the game Connex'Oh which uses a grid of 6x6 tiles and was also released by EdiGames.<br/><br/>2 players face each other across a large plastic board that contains a grid of 4x4 square plastic tiles. All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that color. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 4 stones of their respective colors that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same color and hence no &quot;connections&quot; exist on the board at the start of play.<br/><br/>By twisting tiles, players can create &quot;connections&quot; of identically colored halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that color can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their color from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighboring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's color was created to the neighboring tile(s) by the newly placed one. An elegant rule that prevents stalemates and adds another tactic to employ.<br/><br/>",

Presumably only the game sheet was sold and the player would have to supply the other components.<br/><br/>The 122 spaces on the game board are marked out along a snake. The start is &quot;through&quot; the snakes mouth which requires a 2 to pass. Space 122 is at the tail.<br/><br/>The game board directs forwards and backwards movements as in Chutes and ladders. However there are many differences to the standard Chutes and ladders game. The winner must get past 122 to win. Landing on some squares entitles the player to two throws, or causes him to lose a turn. A player unlucky enough to land on space 119 loses the whole game!<br/><br/>",

The 'match' kicks off by the first player to have an Ansto&szlig; (Kick-Off) card. If no-one has such a card, each player in turn draws another card from the stack. This goes on until an Ansto&szlig; is drawn and played. Next player must play a card that is the logical action after the kick-off. A check list is provided so you can see which action card is acceptable. The game continues like this until one player runs out of cards.

        "description": "The Earth is a dead husk. Having mined all of its resources, facing a population many times that which could be possibly sustained and slowly mutating it into a massive, cloying, choking city, we had no choice but to set our greedy eyes on the planets around us and conquer new lands.<br/><br/>After the Information War of the 21st century, the Corporations dissolved national borders and began a new war of their own: the Resource War. Like their European ancestors, who conquered and fought over new land, the corporations started to clash for control of the stars around Earth, as if they had claims to them from the moment of their conception.<br/><br/>Thus began the new arms race, but this time the lessons learned from past wars would be embraced and used to leverage as much advantage as possible. Research into more advanced abilities to control not only the battles, but the hearts and minds of the people who fight them would become key to victory.<br/><br/>Steel Stars is a game of intergalactic warfare amongst rival corporations in Earth's dark future with a near endless number of system configurations and multiple paths to victory &ndash; through the council, through research of technologies and advanced abilities, via the creation of popular utopian worlds, or by the might of your powerful fleets.<br/><br/>Each player steps into the powerful and all encompassing shoes of the head of one of the five corporations fighting for the control of the universe. You will need to use cunning, guile, diplomacy, deception, and tactical thinking to make the decisions that will hopefully bring victory, control, renown, and respect to your corporation.<br/><br/>In each round of the game, players select four actions to perform. Players in turn perform one of these. Whenever an action is performed, all other players may also perform that action. The available actions are: Fleet (move ships), Research (develop tech), Council (Create votes on new rules), Planetary (develop your civilization), Energy (generate resources) and Logistics (build new ships). Players score points for colonising worlds, developing tech, building colonies, passing votes and developing their civilisation. The game ends when one player has accumulated 15 points, but that player does not necesarily win, as there are bonus points scored for being the best player in each of several categories.<br/><br/>",

It is a race to get rid of all cards by playing onto a center stack. Teams or individuals play provides hours of exciting family &amp; party fun. 3 decks of 168 cards numbered 1-12 in 3 colors. Game can be played in teams or individually. All 3 decks are shuffled individually then passed, 5 cards dealt up and 12 cards dealt down. Then panic begins. As each card face up is played, it is replaced by one of the 12 down card. This continues until all 17 cards are played and the first player out of cards yells panic. But remember it takes a #1 card to start a stack. Then the cards are separated by team color and scored as per the instructions. The first team to reach 200 is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first player to get rid of all the cards in his hand, or if the pack becomes exhausted and no one can 'go' the player with the least cards wins.<br/><br/>The cards have realistic artwork depicting the birds in a style similar to a bird reference book.<br/><br/>There is also another game variant included in the rules, called 'Bridges' which is for two players, and involves players creating columns of matching pairs of the same species or families of the same species, and bridges between the two players columns. Points are awarded for creating 12 card columns, and for creating bridges between columns. Games continue until one player has scored 30 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DungeonRaid is a new fantasy deck-building game designed to capture the charm and atmosphere of the console RPGs of days long gone.<br/><br/>The game begins with a small card draft to determine starting equipment. Then, in a classic Deck-building fashion, players purchase weapons, armor, and spells in turn and use them to fight monsters and bosses; all of which come into the supply randomly. Used equipment cycles back through the deck as it needs to be repaired and the player's goal is to collect the most wealth from the Dungeon while at the same time trying not to be the first to get killed.<br/><br/>&quot;Staged&quot; levels of difficulty increase the challenge at regular intervals and also introduce improved Treasure to the supply. This aspect also makes the game highly expandable, and gives it immense replay value.<br/><br/>(Tentatively) Recommended for 2-5 players, but solitaire play will be an option.<br/><br/>[This game is still in development, and development is currently on hold. Release date is yet unknown.]<br/><br/>",

There are two card decks from which a player may get a move card on his turn. However the player must flip a supplied &quot;coin&quot;  to see if he gets a card from the Johnny stack or the pony stack. having each player flip a coin would thus make &quot;individual&quot; luck come into play as opposed to both players just playing against a randomized deck.<br/><br/>The game had 4 riders and horses.

        "description": "From the game page on The Game Crafter<br/><br/>For too long the Meeples have lived under the boot of the mighty Regime. You have been pushed around and mistreated while the Regime grows rich off your toil. No longer! The day has come to rise up and take control of your fate. The day has come for Uprising!<br/><br/>Uprising is a semi-cooperative game for 2-4 players who take the role of rebel groups rising up against the vicious Regime. Will you be able to work together to overthrow your oppressors, or will you turn on the others to try to become number one?<br/><br/>Summary of Game Play<br/><br/>The board is a grid, where each cell (&quot;sector&quot;) can be controlled by a player, by the regime, or by nobody. Each turn, players draw tiles indicating where they can take actions, such as attacking or reinforcing. After all the players have taken their turns, the regime takes 3 automated actions in random sectors. Each battle can be fought with military power, or with popularity.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player (or the regime) reaches a target score, based on popularity and sectors controlled. At that point, the force with the highest score wins, and if the regime is highest, all the players lose. In the standard rules, players can directly attack each other or temporarily align with the regime. There is a fully-cooperative variant, where players face a stronger regime.<br/><br/>",

Just call me &quot;TET.&quot;<br/><br/>There are 10 frames to each game and the player who has the highest score at the end wins. Each player has to complete frame 1 before the play moves on to frame 2 and so on. Maximum score per two rolls is 10. A spare is 10 points. A white dot on the first roll counts as a strike and no second roll is taken.

Your team of grips and electricians must scramble to film as many scenes as possible before production wraps! Don&rsquo;t worry, though: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it in post.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Grips &amp; Gaffers, you are responsible for a production unit filming footage for a movie. Your film set is a &quot;puzzle&quot; in which you attempt to slide the cameras, lights, and director around the board to match the needs of one of the scenes to be filmed. At the same time, every other player is racing to film the same scenes. If they get there first, you may be out of luck; you can only film a scene if the actors aren't busy on another set. Sometimes it might be necessary to film when the set is &quot;close enough,&quot; rather than taking the time to earn a bonus for a perfect setup.<br/><br/>Time is of the essence! Every camera movement advances your Gaffer pawn on the time track, while lighting changes advance your Key Grip pawn. The player whose pawn is at the rear of the track moves next, so being efficient&mdash;and balancing the amount of work your grips and your electricians do&mdash;is key to your filmmaking success!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game for three or more secret-keeping rule enforcers.<br/><br/>Each player gets a secret rule at the start of the game. All rules are in play &ndash; including the ones you don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s up to the person who has the rule to enforce it or not. Your goal is to be the first player to accumulate 3 points. The best way to do this is by learning the secret rules of the game faster than the other players and taking tricks.<br/><br/>You Need:<br/>A standard Poker deck (Jokers removed)<br/>A Hidden Rules trigger deck (available on the game's website)<br/>A Hidden Rules action deck (available on the game's website)<br/>Paper and pencil to track scores (optional, but recommended)<br/><br/>The basic game is played in tricks. The dealer begins the first trick of the game; after that, each trick begins when the last player to take a trick takes the top card of the deck, places it face-up on the table, and announces its value. Starting with the player to his or her left, and proceeding clockwise, each player must play a card from his or her hand on the trick, calculate the sum of all cards in the trick, and announce the sum.<br/><br/>Card Values: 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Aces are worth 1 or 11 (declared when played). Jacks are worth 0 points, Queens are worth -2 points, and Kings are worth -4 points.<br/><br/>If the sum is less than 21, play continues normally. If you bring the sum to exactly 21, you take the trick. If you push the sum over 21, the player to your right takes the trick, for forcing you to exceed 21. When you take a trick, add one to your score, and gather the cards from the trick into a pile face-down in front of you. Once taken, the cards from a trick may not be looked at.<br/><br/>All hidden rules are also in play. Each combination of a trigger and an action is a rule. It&rsquo;s up to you to enforce (or not) a rule that you know about. When you enforce a rule, you must give the person information to indicate in what way their action violated the rule. The information you provide must be more specific than the violation. If you violate a rule, take back the card you played (if applicable), lose a point, and your turn ends (if it&rsquo;s your turn).<br/><br/>For example, trigger #13 says, &ldquo;When you play a card that makes the total exactly zero&hellip;&rdquo; and action #5 says, &ldquo;&hellip;Name a Peanuts character that hasn&rsquo;t been named previously this game before you announce the sum of the trick.&rdquo; If I make the total 0 and don&rsquo;t say anything, you can make me take back my card and say, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say a name.&rdquo; The next time I make the total 0, If I say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong,&rdquo; you can correct me again and say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong isn&rsquo;t fictional.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The first player to end a round with 3 or more points more wins.<br/><br/>This game owes a lot to the children&rsquo;s &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; Mao.<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, the economy may quickly change from normal times to recession or boom, sharply changing your loan portfolio values and affecting your strategy.  Players must also deal with unpredictable court judgments, costly regulatory inquiries, bankruptcies, and documentation errors, among other common celebrations in a lender's day.<br/><br/>The game lasts for one hour, then all players get 2 more turns.

Each game is provided as a learning excercise for the children playing.  The games focus on the language and number concepts such as colours, distance, time, quantity, sequencing etc.<br/><br/>All 12 games follow the same sequence of play:<br/>The teacher setups the board for play.<br/>A background story is provided for the game.<br/>The teacher poses questions to the children based on the board setup.<br/>The children then take turns based on the directions of the teacher (i.e.  the teacher directs the children to move the parts around the board - the teacher then asks additional question to the children).<br/><br/>",

There are two styles of dice:  the blisterpieces (which have a different symbol on each die face) and the blisterblockers<br/><br/>The rule book provides six variations of the game:  blisterboxes, blisterangles, blistercrosses, blistertriangles, blisterpokes and blisterballs.<br/><br/>Depending on the variation in play the blisterpieces are oriented such that they all have the same symbol showing.  The symbol in play determines the movement that is allowed for that particular die (i.e. Blisterangles must move horizontally and vertically, Blisterpokes can move either horizontally or vertically).<br/><br/>The sequence of gameplay is as follows:<br/>Player 1 rolls the 8-side die.  <br/>Player 1 moves one piece (die) the number rolled ensuring they follow the movement rules determined by the symbol on the die.<br/>If the die ends its move within 6 squares with direct line of sight a &quot;Blistermatch&quot; may be started.  During a Blistermatch the two dice being disputed is fought over.  If one player can form the take-out pattern (identified in the rules) the losing die is eliminated.  If a Blistermatch reaches a stalemate it ends and the game resumes as normal.<br/>Gameplay continues with alternating turns until one player eliminates the other players pieces or a stale mate occurs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In honor of the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, military professionals, historians, and game designers created this game to closely replicate the actual battlefield conditions and operations of Gettysburg in 1863. The game comes in both a standard and collector&rsquo;s edition and is played on an oversized game board with 172 miniature commanders and 126 brigade counters. The collector&rsquo;s edition comes with life-like pewter miniatures on a magnetized metal game board for stability, and a carved wood base with drawers for storing the miniatures.<br/> In lieu of the game&rsquo;s dice and chart system, attacking and defending units can enter their strength, location, and orientation into the Interactive Game App (IGA) which then simulates the battle conditions to determine results. A unit&rsquo;s strength is represented by possible Combat Factors on a brigade counter encircling a rotating miniature. The miniature is turned toward lower numbers as casualties are taken or is increased up to full strength as depleted units are merged into it. Reinforcement, Supply, and Morale Cards also affect the Combat Factor and randomness of game play.<br/><br/>The game also uses a Double Turn Rule where after the initial attack, both the attacker and defender may move all of their units one hexagon, defenders first. This allows both sides to retreat, stand, or bring up reinforcements during the turn. Units still in contact fight each other one more time before the turn ends. Artillery has a range of four hexagons and is only required to engage in battle if the enemy&rsquo;s artillery is in range.<br/><br/>Incremental casualties, merging and resupplying units, and double-turn combat combine to recreate actual conditions, while the IGA cuts playing time in half. Tactical skill, not luck prevails, and the winner may rewrite history.<br/><br/>",

When 2 or 3 players are playinging each player gets 2 letter cards (or a special Donkey card) on each spin. If four players are playing there is a twist.

For five players the black player gets one letter plus he can &quot;rob&quot; any player of a letter not in a word.<br/><br/>The game is played for points. 400 points is recommended for 2-4 players, and 500 points for 5 players.

Here, the central area of 9 squares is marked (the &quot;black&quot; squares are red).<br/><br/>Each player has 1 &quot;main&quot; and 8 &quot;additional&quot; pawns. Starting position is on the 9 spaces of one corner (creating another square), the main pawn in the middle of the 8 additional ones.<br/><br/>Before the game, players agree upon a goal to reach: One out of 7 ending positions to fulfill with their pawns. All of these positions are located in the central area, from 2 pawns sitting on two opposing corners of the area up to the full 9 spaces of the centre. If the goal includes the central space, the main piece has to be placed there to reach the goal.<br/><br/>On their turn, players move one of their pawns one space diagonally. You can &quot;catch&quot; an opposing pawn by having two of your own pawns on each side of it - again diagonally. You can then pick it up and place it on any unoccupied space of the same colour anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>The player who manages first to fulfill the goal wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Banners of Betrayal is a lightly structured card game about feudal warfare. The players can freely attack each other, and the losing side of a fight joins the winner as a vassal. The ultimate objective is to eliminate every other contender for the crown.<br/><br/>Combat is based on a modified rock-paper-scissors mechanic. As cards that are played in a combat are discarded, extended fights weaken both players. The focus is on knowing when a player should yield and accept a lower rank, or risking losing in the final round.<br/><br/>There are three game modes called Honor, Tournament of Honor and Betrayal. The first two game modes use the principle described above. The tournament takes several rounds and the players are scored by their end rank. In the Betrayal game mode the King will award points for himself and his allies at the end of each round. The other players can opt to be contenders, who can fight with the king, or lords who can't fight by themselves, but who can sell their services for points.<br/><br/>",

The game gives new meaning to a CCG being a license to print money, because in this CCG, the &quot;cards&quot; are money &mdash; various denominations of bills from $1 to $100, to be more precise.<br/><br/>Each player creates a deck of five bills.  As in War, each player presents a bill, and the higher bill wins the round.  Ties go into a tie pool.  Whoever wins the most rounds wins the game and the money.  The hook, and the mechanism that combats inflation is that you may choose to rip a full bill into halves, which in the game, counts as two copies of that &quot;card&quot;, but in the real world, causes a smidgen of deflation (the rules state that you must throw away torn bills after the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; is a set of rules for American Civil War 15mm military figures. These rules are designed for grand tactical play. The scale is set at six turns per hour and one inch for twenty-five yards. Movement, fire, and morale are based upon the brigade (consisting of one to six regiments for infantry and cavalry.) Artillery is structured around a battery of four to six guns (represented by a single unit.) Included is a sample (and partial) Order of Battle for Gettysburg and a supplement for adapting the rules to fictious battles against forces loyal to the Emperor Maxmillian I of Mexico.<br/><br/> <br/>These rules are quite comprehensive, including command control, weather and other random events (such as pre-battle disease), artillery crew casualties, the effects of unit training/experience, close action procedures, morale, sighting and line-of-fire, and much more. <br/> Three appendices are included: A graphic description of formations; a brief description for conversion to 25mm figures; and a glossary.<br/><br/>",

Urban areas are infested and the military are planning some reconnaissance missions on the major affected areas.<br/><br/>You and your team of soldiers were in one of those missions, flying a town overrun by zombies. But suddenly the unexpected happened! A problem with the helicopter engine causes the loss of altitude and the aircraft is going down. Luckily, (or not), you and the other members survived the crash.<br/><br/>It looks like the survivors crashed over some abandoned and unknown building. The problem is that, just like the whole city, there are zombies everywhere!<br/><br/>With low ammo, the only way to survive is to cross the interior of the building and search for exit.<br/><br/>This is a survival game, where characters are lost in an environment full of zombies.<br/><br/>The map, zombie encounters, weapons and ammo are randomly created and each game is never the same.<br/><br/>It is a print and play game.

        "description": "From the publisher's and Toy Directory websites:<br/>The board is used on a slight incline and the game pieces are magnetic. The Magical Rainbow is a magnetized game that takes children on a special adventure through 7 magical lands. Players race to a pot of gold, watching out for Paddy the Leprechaun, who on every turn travels from land to land protecting his gold. Throughout the journey players will try to collect gold coins, avoid the Leprechaun and his lucky trinkets, and use strategy to win the game. The first player to reach the pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow wins, however the game encourages sharing with others in need. This game is designed to teach children color recognition, sequencing, patterns, counting, strategy and sharing.<br/><br/>&quot;Using a rainbow game theme lets kids imagine what it would be like living on a Magical Rainbow, and helping Paddy the leprechaun give out his gold to people in need.  The rainbow game combines colors and a magnetic 3d game set that keep kids entertained game after game.  The other goal for Magical Rainbow was to create a board game that could be played with one child.  There are a lot of one child families and what good is a board game if you don&rsquo;t have anyone to play the game with?  Magical Rainbow can be used as a standalone make believe play set.&quot;  The game pieces double as flexible magnetic play pieces that have letters and numbers on the reverse side. They can be used on the front or back of the game board or on any metallic surface to assist children in developing recognition with the alphabet, numbers and words.<br/><br/>Awards: 2009 Family Choice Award, Creative Child Magazine's Game of the Year award, Dr Toy Best Picks, 2010<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The pirates have found out that huge golden orbs can be found on the large Caribbean island, and of course they are trying to get them. Each player has a pirate ship and tries to bring a golden orb to his/her home harbour. On their way, the pirates have to avoid other pirates because they will naturally try to steal their golden orb. But even the best pirate has to strike the sails when the weather is bad. A magnetic spinner in the center of the board rotates the golden orbs around and also causes the dreaded storms. This causes surprising twists of fate in the race for the golden orbs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Continuum Games website:<br/>Animoes takes the classic game of dominos and makes it easy for children as young as three to play. Instead of dots, each piece contains cute animal characters. Children match animals as they play.<br/><br/>Animoes offers a unique twist at the end of the game. The player who has played all of their pieces first, becomes the &ldquo;Spin Master&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Spin Master&rdquo; spins the spinner board until an animal is identified. The player to the right of the &ldquo;Spin Master&rdquo; must act like the animal the spinner has identified. If the spinner lands on the Duck, the next player must act like a Duck &ndash; quack like a duck, walk like a Duck and do whatever he/she thinks a Duck would do. It is a great way to end the game laughing!<br/><br/>The pieces are oversized (4&quot; x 2&quot; - perfect for little hands) and dishwasher safe.<br/><br/>36 Game Safe Custom Plastic Tiles (8 Different Animals)<br/>Spinner Board<br/><br/>",

Each player is provided with a 'Note-O' card and enough discs to cover all the symbols on his card.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game, a leader is chosen.  This leader is provided with the deck of dealer's cards and from it calls the symbols, one by one.  As a symbol is called, the player having that symbol covers it with a disc.  The process is repeated until some player has covered all the symbols on his card at which time he calls out 'NOTE-O.'  The first player calling 'NOTE-O', whose symbols have been covered correctly, wins the game.<br/><br/>The game may be varied by having any player announce 'Note-O' when he has covered three symbols in a row on his card.<br/><br/>At the end of each game, cards should be exchanged and the leader's cards shuffled before starting a new game.<br/><br/>The game is made much more difficult and more interesting when each player is provided with two or more 'Note-O' cards.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mathematical card game. The cards feature somewhere interesting in Sunderland, which is in the northeast of England.<br/><br/>Each card has a number between 0 and 9, except for the Double cards. Each player gets 6 cards and must look to see if a pair can be formed. A pair is made up of two numbers that, when multiplied together, make a total that is also on one of the two cards. For instance, you play a 5 and an 8 which makes 40. Thus the number 40 must also be on one of the two cards played. If successful, a pair is formed and can be laid face-up in front of the player. The first player to lay three pairs (6 cards) wins the round.<br/><br/>When a round is one, the other players add up the value of the cards in their hand and that is their score. After 12 rounds, the lowest score is the winner.<br/><br/>There are special rules for the Double Cards which you need to play because if you are caught with them in your hand when a player goes out, you get a nasty negative score.<br/><br/>This is an expanded game (but more subtle and a better design of the cards) that first appeared as Multitu in the 1960's.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Educational card game published by the British Diabetic Association. It is an attempt to make people think about what they eat, especially for them to know the calorie count of their meals.<br/><br/>In it's basic form, players can just ask each other about a card, for instance: &quot; Find me another card with the same calorie count as X&quot;.<br/>But two more interactive games are possible. In 'Shop Shut' (for which you need two copies of the game) each player gets a hand of cards. One player is nominated as the Caller. Everyone plays their cards face up in front of them. The Caller draws a card and if a player has the same card, he shouts &quot;Sold&quot; and turns the card over. This continues until one player turns over his last card and then shouts &quot;Shop Shut&quot;. That player scores nothing but the other players score their cards still 'open' by totalling the Carbohydrates on the card (or the Calorie count if decided before the game begins). After a pre-agrred time limit expires, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>In 'Happy Food Families, it plays exactly the same as a Happy Families/Quartet/Authors game. A set of four cards must all be the same food value as indicated on the card. The player who has the most sets when the cards run out, wins.<br/><br/>",

As humanity has spread throughout the solar system, advances in material sciences have left us wanting for nothing yet craving new forms of entertainment.<br/><br/>3D printers ranging in size from minuscule to mammoth process material known as Nano-Goo (or just &ldquo;Goo&rdquo;) into virtually anything a person could need, from food and clothing to massive, space-faring ships.  Using these technologies, a few enterprising individuals capitalized on humanity&rsquo;s need for entertainment and have brought back to life the ancient custom of gladiatorial combat -- done safely by remotely operating (teleoperating) vastly powerful machines of war known as War Bots.<br/><br/>Large 3D printing structures are dropped onto remote asteroids and other small, celestial bodies. These come with a small complement of devices which begin to process the raw materials of these asteroids into Goo, which these massive printers can use to create War Bots. Printers use a series of programs called .WAR Files, which give them the specifics of War Bots which they can then use Goo to print.<br/><br/>War Bots are printed out of Goo, which is programmed to take a specific form with specific functions. Because they are made of self organizing nanomaterials, War Bots can be modified by simple programs called .UPGrade Files &ndash; or upgrades. These upgrades can be applied to War Bots while they are in the field.<br/><br/>Governed by a strict set of rules, and limited by the programs made available to them, contestants manufacture and then fight with these giant machines, for the delight of audiences throughout the Solar System.<br/><br/>Upgrade Wars is a deck building, tactical combat game. Players begin the game with a starter deck of 10 resources and two War Bots (the giant robots that do the actual fighting).<br/><br/>Through the course of the game, they may purchase new programs to deploy as War Bots or to Upgrade existing War Bots that have already been deployed.<br/><br/>The battle field is divided into three zones - the Printer zone (where the magic happens), the Defensive Ring and the Front Line - a zone shared by all players.<br/><br/>Your bots traverse the battlefield under your command in an attempt to reach other player's printers and destroy them.<br/><br/>Complete Victory: The last player with a Printer still capable of creating War Bots wins the game!<br/>Tactical Victory: Each enemy War Bot you destroy is worth 1 Victory Point. Each enemy Printer is worth 5 Victory Points. Once three card piles are depleted, the player with the most Victory Points wins!<br/><br/>Featuring strategic and tactical play - players must decide where and when to spend their resources, which can go to either purchasing new program files or deploying War Bots into the field of battle. At the same time, you must manage your existing War Bots to defend your Printer and attack the enemy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game made as a promotional item for Dettol, a very popular disinfectand in Britain. The game is endorsed by the Child Accident Protection Trust.<br/><br/>The cards consists of pairs of cards. One of the pair warns of a danger and the other gives advice on how to avoid that danger.<br/><br/>Three games are described in the rules. Keeping Me Safe is the main game. The first player places a danger card face up. The next player checks her hand and plays the advice card on top of it (if she holds it). If not the next player looks, and so on. Once a pair has been completed, the next player lays a danger card and the game proceeds until one player has used all their cards. He/she is the winner.<br/><br/>The other two games are more traditional, Snap and Pairs, but both are a little more difficult because the two cards that match are not mirror images which would be more usual in games of Snap or Pairs.<br/><br/>",

The group of hexes is called the red player's base and contains the red player&rsquo;s counters at the start of the game, similarly for the blue hexes. The black hexes are impassable. They can neither be stopped on nor passed through.<br/><br/>The game is won when the opponent&rsquo;s base is completely occupied. This may be at any time after each player has had his first turn. Although the 6 occupying pieces are normally all of your own colour this does not have to be the case. If your opponent is foolish enough to leave a piece in his base then take advantage of it!<br/><br/>Players take it in turn to move any one of their pieces which is not in the opponent&rsquo;s base. This piece is moved in any direction of the player&rsquo;s choice until blocked by a black hex, the edge of the board or a piece of either colour. A piece must be moved as far as possible in the chosen direction&mdash;it cannot stop &lsquo;en route&rsquo;. At no time can a piece occupy the same hex as, or pass over, any other piece of either colour. A player must make a move on his turn. If he is unable to do so then he has lost the game.

An additional trump color is determined each round by die roll.<br/><br/>Each round, a player starts with eight cards in hand. The starting player plays a card, and the others have to follow the suit, if possible. The player with the higest card of the played color or a trump gets the trick. After eight tricks, players look at the cards they collected. Some of the cards show flowers, and the player with the most flowers scores 1 point.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 3 points wins.<br/><br/>",

However this game is significantly different as the odd card held at the end of the game means you are the winner (so it is a sort of Old Maid in reverse).<br/><br/>Each player gets a hand of cards and your turn exists of drawing a card from another player's hand. If a matching pair is formed, it is laid to one side. When all the pairs are matched, the winner is the one holding the treasure card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules for refighting battles from the Indian Mutiny of 1857 - 58 follow on from previous sets in this series ~ A Good Dusting and Washing the Spears ~ which have received a very positive reception from gamers. They are designed not for competition play but with enjoyment between like-minded friends firmly to the fore and focus very much on throwing loads of dice and feeling the brush of the Devil's Wind across your cheek in the process! Games should play out satisfactorily in two to three hours on a table about 7' x 4' or so. There is no figure, time or ground scale to worry about, just cut straight to the action on the road to Lucknow.<br/><br/>The game mechanisms allow all players in the game to take on commands within an Honourable East India Company or Regular British force, with the Mutineers controlled by all of the players in accordance with the auto generation and action rules. It is equally possible for two or more players to take on opposing Mutineer and HEIC/HM forces and play the game out conventionally. The rules aim to give you an enjoyable game where, if correctly wisely and blessed by the dice gods, the Mutineer forces may win.<br/><br/>The full colour rules include numerous illustrations of action on the tabletop here in GHQ, units and individual character figures; scenic items to enhance your tabletop battlefield; a sample scenario to get you started straight away; a play sheet which can be photocopied; a short reading list; and a suggested list of figure manufacturers, in 28mm at least.<br/><br/>",

Then, each player moves one after the other on a simple board using a D6.

The last one typically consist of question asking you to know something about your partner - favorite dish, name of first pet and more personal things. Actions come from an action card deck. They usually involves some personal things - kissing your partner for more than 10s, doing a massage and so on.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the player arrives at the last position on the board. The loser - player who is going to have less space on the bed - can still decide to perform a few extra actions to regain a bit of space.<br/><br/>",

Areas can generate resource cards.<br/><br/>Resource cards are used to purchase units, activate areas of their card colour to take actions in or are traded in for mana. Resource cards are generated by a dice roll once per round. At the end of the round, you must trade in any unused resource cards for mana points.<br/><br/>Fate cards have a variety of effects, such as creatures, devastating events and strange occurrences that may help or hinder your cause. They may also be used to activate areas of their card colour to take actions in. Fate cards are drawn at the start of each round and can be retained in your hand until used or, perhaps, stolen by your enemies.<br/><br/>All discarded Fate cards are placed face up and some discarded Fate cards may be affected by those held by other players.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the winner is decided by adding up a combination of mana points for areas, units and special places, then adding these to the victory track to see has the most mana in total.<br/><br/>",

Certain rolls will allow you to kill the dragons, if you are willing to take the risk of rolling a special &quot;Dragon Slayer Die&quot;. Collecting the last gem in a level of the cavern results in a big bonus, but failure gives your opponents an easier shot!

These are kept face down. Six cards from the deck are then drawn for each player and play continues with each player attempting to complete the Flight color that matches their Terminal card. All flight cards played are placed face up and used communally.<br/><br/>A point variation for this game my be played where players not completing a Flight total the points from the cards remaining in their hands and the lowest cumulative score over four completed games is declared the winner. In this version all cards except the Air Hostess (50 points) have an assigned value of 10 points. In this version penalty points (100) for poor play may be assessed.<br/><br/>The game consists of 60 cards divided as follows: 4 Aeroplane cards. 4 Pilot cards, 36 Map cards (9 for each of 4 flights numbered 2 through 10), 4 Storm cards, 4 Storm Buster cards, 1 Air Hostess (wild) card, 7 Terminal cards. Cards are colored white, yellow, blue and pink for each of the 4 flights. The Air Hostess (wild) card is green.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The historic Lincoln Highway, the first coast-to-coast highway in 1913, stretched from New York City to San Francisco. So children can learn more about the highway in a fun way, the nonprofit organization Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor created a board game. The Lincoln Highway Road Trip comes with game pieces of a vintage gas pump, antique autos, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and suitcase as well as 200 trivia cards and fortune cards.<br/><br/>The game board reflects the regional part of the highway -- known as Route 30 -- in the six-county area from North Huntingdon at the Allegheny and Westmoreland County border to beyond Gettysburg. A grant from the Sprout Fund in Pittsburgh enabled the organization to develop the game and distribute it to upper elementary and middle schools along the region's 200-mile corridor. It was created by Alex Grab of Ligoni<br/><br/>Using pewter-like game pieces (vintage gas tank, suitcase, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and antique auto), players move along the highway beginning in Irwin. The goal is to be the first to travel the historic route through Westmoreland, Somerset, Bedford, Fulton, Franklin and Adams counties to Abbottstown in eastern Pa.<br/><br/>One of the 200 question cards reads: &ldquo;A volunteer highway crew is picking up debris along the side of the road near Buckstown. How long does it take for a Styrofoam cup to decompose?&rdquo; A. 20 years; B. 90 years; C. 150 years; or D. 400 years?&rdquo; The correct answer is 400 years.<br/><br/>Another is: &ldquo;The Mountain Playhouse and Green Gables Restaurant originally started as a sandwich stand. What was the dessert that became such a hit with Lincoln Highway travelers?&rdquo; A. Ice Cream Sandwich; B. Custard; C. Angel Food Cake; or D. Torte? C is the correct answer.<br/><br/>",

The remaining cards will be left in the pile, face down.<br/><br/>The first player takes the top card of the pile and must consider how to lay out as many cards as possible on to the starting card, according to the following rules:<br/>The player may continue laying out only cards showing countries with common borders (a map of Europe is provided). He is also allowed to lay out two cards of the same country at the same time;<br/><br/>Any country may be reached by aeroplane, i.e. including any country not adjoining the country shown on the card laid out last. However, the rule is that a plane may be used only once in each turn. Flying will be indicated by leaving the previously laid out card uncovered in such a way that the aeroplane will remain visible. (With neighbouring countries the cards will be placed partly on top of each other in the form of scales, the aeroplane remaining covered.) It is left to the discretion of the player himself whether or not and when he wishes to make use of a card as air ticket.<br/><br/>The first player having finished laying out as many cards as possible next to the starting card and in conformity with the above rules, each additional player will follow his turn in corresponding manner, by laying out his cards next to the card laid out by the previous player.<br/><br/>The winner of a round will be the player who first succeeds in laying out all his cards. The game should be played to a pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>Scoring the points: the figure in the left hand corner of each card shows the number of neighbouring countries. The figures shown on the cards remaining with the players will be counted minus points for those players.<br/>Special instructions: in addition to countries with common borders those countries connected with each other by ferry boat (railway ferries) will be considered neighbouring countries too. (See the map of Europe with the game).<br/>In this game Turkey is considered a neighbouring country also of the Soviet Union, although that frontier is in Asia. There is no neighbouring country to Iceland.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blokkerende Botsauto's (Blocking Dodgems) is a print and play game for two players.<br/><br/>Each player is the driver of a car. The cars drive on a 4 by 4 grid of streets. Each player in turn passes one intersection. Each intersection is a double sided tile. One side has an intersection where no right turn is allowed. The other side shows an intersection where no left turn allowed. Driving straight ahead is always allowed. Each time a car has passed an intersection, its tile is flipped. The first player to pass all 16 intersections wins. The cars cannot be both on the same tile at the same time. A player who has nowhere to go (his car can only drive off the grid, or on a blocked tile) loses the game. During the setup phase of the game, each player determines the initial state of half of the grid.<br/><br/>This game was published as a prize question in the Dutch magazine Pythagoras (issue 51/3, Jun 2012). It's a magazine about mathematics for high school students. Readers had to find a winning strategy (no answer was found).<br/><br/>",

A set must contain a pony, a bridle, a saddle, a pair of stirrups and 3 other cards that a rider might need or desire (a rosette is good and is worth 9 points whereas a grooming kit is not so nice and only scores 3 points).<br/><br/>Each card in the set has a points value.

        "description": "Thousands of years ago, this galaxy was in turmoil. Many civilizations discovered the power of Grotons as an energy source, and used it to master interplanetary travel. Unfortunately, they found their neighbors very difficult to relate to. The one thing they all seemed to have in common was their pride in their ability to travel through space, and they all liked to show off. Before long they began having periodical competitions to see who had the better spaceships, and this eventually grew into this regular race.<br/><br/>Players choose an alien race to represent in the race, and they determine the shape of the course. Planets along the course can be chosen at random, and each racer is assigned a Home world and a Rival world, which provide benefits and disadvantages during the race. Who will demonstrate their superior technology and racing skills by crossing the finish line first and win the Groton Cup?<br/><br/>Play Speed cards to move your Rocket along the track and to break orbit from the planets along the way. Status cards played against you by other players will slow you down, but can be repaired using matching Remedy cards. Equipping your ship will protect you from Status cards, but if the status is powerful enough it could destroy your equipment!<br/><br/>The game also features a unique 'Last Place' rule, where the player at the back of the pack gets an extra turn each round to try and catch up to the rest, or blow past them if the circumstances permit. Last Place can change hands multiple times each race, and it's really not a bad place to be!<br/><br/>",

The card deck is a &quot;poker&quot; deck with 2 Jokers, but the splitting of the deck's artwork between Monsters (Black suits) and Heroes (Red suits) led to the design of Silent Hill: Defeated. The game could conceivably be played with any &quot;poker&quot;-style deck, but the Silent Hill deck from Great Eastern Entertainment is highly recommended.<br/><br/>The gameplay is like Silent Hill meets Uno. You start the game by drawing 7 cards and your goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. You do this by &quot;challenging&quot; the top card of the discard pile. Sometimes that card is a Monster and you will need a Hero to fight it. Sometimes, it's the other way around. The Heroes (red-suited cards) and Monsters (black-suited cards) have different rules and play a little differently, but in the end you have to combine both strategies in order to empty your hand of cards, which allows you to finally escape the twisted place called... Silent Hill.<br/>(please check the Files section for the rules pdf.)<br/><br/>",

Marvin has sound effects to go with each image.<br/><br/>Each player gets a number of dominoes depending on the number of players. These are laid out in front of you picture-side up. One domino is also placed in the centre of the table. Marvin must be in easy reach of all the players.<br/><br/>In your turn you must press Marvin's button and he will play a sound (example - ring-a-ding). Now, everyone looks at their dominoes at the same time, looking for a bicycle domino that will fit to the array of dominoes in the centre (of course, normal domino rules apply). If you have a domino that will fit at either end of the array, you must quickly press the blue button on Marvin.

        "description": "Contents: 1 playing board, 4 Wood Pawns, 13 Question Cards (Ellsworth's letters), 1 spinner<br/><br/>Number of Players: 2, 3 or 4<br/><br/>Before the game starts:<br/>1. The card portion of the platform should be broken up into 13 individual cards which are called the &quot;LETTERS&quot;. The LETTERS are then placed, FACE UP, in a POOL next to the playing board, in easy reach of all players.<br/>2. Each player then selects a wood pawn and places it on the space marked &quot;START&quot; in the center of playing board<br/>3. Each player now spins the arrow of the spinner - the one with the highest number starts. In case of tie, player spins again.<br/>4. Play passes to the left<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>The player who is FIRST to enter Ellsworth's House with the most LETTERS, is the WINNER.<br/><br/>Special Feature of the Game:<br/>This game consists of two parts - the first from START to the GATE - the second from the GATE to ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, including the HOME PATH and BONUS SPACE<br/><br/>The Play:<br/>1. In the first part of the game (area from START to GATE) the first player spins and moves his pawn the number of spaces in any direction he chooses (either forward of backward). Player can never split his move and must always move on his turn according to the number he spins.<br/>2. Any number of players may rest on the same space at the same time.<br/>3. Whenever a player, in the first part of the game, lands on a color space by EXACT COUNT, he picks up the LETTER with the matching color stamp from the POOL. He must read aloud the question on that letter and the three different answers given below it. He then must state aloud which ANSWER he thinks is right, A, B or C. Each question on the LETTERS is numbered and the ANSWER CHART here in the box cover lists these numbers with their correct answers - A, B or C. If he has answered correctly, he gets a bonus move of 10 additional spaces. If his answer is incorrect, he remains on that color space until his next turn. In either case, he keeps the LETTER.<br/>4. Each player has to place the LETTERS he picks, FACE UP in front of him, so that all players around the board can see them.<br/>5. As long as there are LETTERS left in the POOL, NO player can enter the second part of the game. After the last LETTER has been picked up from the POOL, all players place their respective pawns on the space marked GATE and all start from there equally on the second part of the game.<br/>6. From the GATE to the Beginning of the HOME PATH, players move only in a forward direction.<br/>7. Whenever a player in the second part of the game lands by EXACT COUNT on a color space, he has this choice - he may take the matching color LETTER from the player who has it, or, he may advance 10 spaces.<br/>8. The section of the pathway from the last color space to Ellsworth's House, is the HOME PATH. Once a player advances into the HOME PATH, he moves within it, forward or backward as he chooses. When a player lands by EXACT COUNT on the BONUS SPACE, he may take from any other player any LETTER he desires, regardless of the color stamp.<br/>9. Since a plyer cannot win, unless he enters ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE with the most LETTERS, he will move back and forth within the HOME PATH until hes has more letters than the other players. As LETTERS can be taken away in the HOME PATH, there is great excitement and suspense. Until the last moment of the game, nobody knows who will safely enter ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE.<br/>10. To enter ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, a player does not need an exact count on the spinner.<br/><br/>FAMILY RULES<br/>When more advanced children or grown-ups join the the game, the regular rules are followed, except that in the first part of the game, all questions and answers are omitted when players pick up LETTERS, but the bonus move of 10 spaces is still given.<br/><br/>",

According to the rules the object of the game is to monopolise as many 'Roo blocks' as possible by forming more 3-counter rows - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - than opponents. 10 points are scored each time a row of 3 is formed. A player rolls the dice to move around the track, and the track block on which he lands indicates the Roo block on which he is allowed to place one of his counters. When a particular Roo block means there is no chance for a player to start a row of 3 or block an opponent that block is considered dead and from then on no player moves to it. When all Roo blocks have been played out players compute their scores and highest score wins.<br/><br/>Publication details from The Game Catalog: US Games Through 1950, 8th edition, 1998.

With Earth identified as the culprit, Terra Nova's governments have resolved to never to be caught off guard again and the Black Talon program was formed for the purpose of being sent off planet to recon Earth&rsquo;s former colony worlds. Their first mission is the gate world Caprice, with its orbital fleet yards that were the staging grounds for the first attack on Terra Nova. They have the training and equipment with which to observe and sabotage Earth's Colonial Expeditionary Force (CEF) wherever opportunities arise and gain new allies whenever possible.<br/><br/>But it was not enough. The CEF is hell-bent on recapturing control of the colonies and has the largest fighting force in human history. War is coming, a war beyond anything that we've seen before.

Each course represents a different stage of the investing process.<br/><br/>The outer &ldquo;Rehabilitation&rdquo; course is where we initially buy, carry, and fix up our properties. The game always starts on this outer course.<br/><br/>The inner &ldquo;Selling&rdquo; course is where we seek deals to sell our investments and cash out. Players individually move onto the inner Selling path as they complete their Rehabilitation process.<br/><br/>Summary of the Game<br/><br/>Players select investment properties, begin on their individual colored Start spot, and take turns moving their pawn around the outer Rehabilitation path to develop their properties.<br/><br/>Eventually, each player will complete their Rehabilitation phase, progress to their colored Start spot on the inner Selling course, then proceed around the Selling course to seek a deal for cashing out and selling their investments.<br/><br/>Play continues until only one player remains which has not settled all debts and cashed out of the game. All players have the option of short-selling and cashing out of the game at any time before completing their full rehabilitation and selling process, which establishes their final cash position. But a final remaining player is always forced into a short-sell to end the game. All players then evaluate their final cash position. The player finishing with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE EPISHELL WARS  Squads of humanoid mecha face off in varying terrains over ever changing goals,commonly resulting in the destruction of the other team.  The game uses a system of 3d12 rolls, with modifiers to the minimum and maximum that may be rolled.  Each roll will have a modifier of +X/-Y (EG. +1/-1, +4/-2, +0/-3).  The +X portion determines the minimum result of each of the d12, and the -Y determines the maximum.  A modifier of +2/-2 would mean that each die can result in the range of 3-10 (1+2, 12-2), the total roll being anywhere between 9 and 30.<br/><br/>The game setup involves a map with 1&quot; hexes of a size predetermined by either a provided scenario or popular decision.  Terrain involves transparent overlays called terrain Plates that have visual cues as to which form(s) of terrain are included (Obscure, Hostile , Hostile , Resistant).  Terrain Plates can overlap, and each terrain type present in a given hex applies in a &quot;yes/no&quot; fashion.<br/><br/>Players agree on the number of units and of which types that each will bring into play.  Given a default game of 1v1 death match, each player will have four Epishell (humanoid mech) units.  For each unit they will decide the variety from Scout, Assault, Marksman, and Escort and apply modular designed equipment based on the carrying capacity of that unit.  Pilots are also assigned to the units with a zero sum trait set.  Typically, each player will have a side of the map to treat as their starting area.  Time and objectives will be determined by popular decision before the terrain is placed and the units outfitted.<br/><br/>During game play, each player has a set number of &quot;MOVE&quot; and &quot;FIRE&quot; actions equal to half of their total unit count, rounded up and may only allot one to each unit at the start of the &quot;Circuit&quot;.  A countdown procedure occurs using the traits of the units, giving priority to &quot;FIRE&quot; actions.  Every action is given a small amount of Movement points, with an extra bonus from a &quot;MOVE&quot; action.  Movements points can be used to change facing or location.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this Princess-Lillifee-themed children's game players try to build garlands as long as possible for the unicorn's birthday party. To do so, players have to collect cards. The 36 cards consist of two parts of different colours (some of them have the same colour on both ends). Players take turns rolling the four colour dice. Dice are then grouped into pairs of two to determine which two cards the player is allowed to take (e.g. if a player rolls orange, yellow, green and green, he/she could take an orange-yellow card and a green-green one). If a player can't use a combination to get a card, he/she removes one card from the game instead. <br/>When all the cards have been distributed, players put together their own cardss like they would put together domino tiles, i.e. with matching ends next to one another. This part of the game is basically a solo puzzle activity.<br/>The player who manages to put together the longest &quot;garland&quot; (row of cards) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Place the cards on the triangle bases of the board according to which attribute they represent. The creatures carry 2 different numbers: The left number indicates the strength and the right number the Bonus you receive when you kill a Creature. To destroy a Creature you must roll a number with your Pawndie higher from the one which represents his Strength and place it on the opposite Tribase where this Creature is located. When you do that, you draw as many Tricards as the Bonus number this Creature caries on his right side. You keep these cards and you may use them as you wish. Note: The Rules of the Basic Game Apply here too, the only difference is that the Creatures add new elements in the game. You also keep and the Creature you killed since it counts as part of the collected cards. The player with the most cards in the end of 3rd round is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marine Global Response (MGR) is a fast-paced game that challenges players with the operations, orders, and opposition faced in twelve different 21st-century theatres.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The game is played solitaire, with a typical campaign requiring 45 minutes to two hours to play. A few of the largest campaigns could stretch to four hours or so.<br/><br/>The game engine has simple systems for geography, human terrain, and operational personality unique to each campaign (theatre) represented.&nbsp;The player takes the role of the colonel in charge of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), a reinforced brigade capable of independent operation. The player selects a Campaign from the Campaign pool. This pool is composed of twelve cards each detailing a hot spot selected for its interesting nature and probability of US ground force involvement in the foreseeable future. The hot spots include Venezuela, Liberia, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, and Gaza.<br/><br/>An expeditionary unit&rsquo;s force composition is variable. After selecting a Campaign card, the player then selects appropriate forces and takes the unit counters for those forces for use during the game. The player takes markers for opposition forces (OpFor) and geography relevant to the Campaign, and sets those into pools for use, as well. Player forces are predominantly ground units, with some air units for supply, transport, and fire support. Naval forces are not represented, though some of the ground forces have amphibious capability.<br/><br/>Play takes place on the OpsDisplay (map) which uses boxes, tables, and other features to manage the information, systems, and battle spaces portrayed in the game.<br/><br/>Each unit typically represents a platoon (about 40 marines) or a handful (2 to 4) helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. Units begin in the Bravo Base box on the OpsDisplay. As the player is assigned Operations, he or she deploys forces from Bravo Base to tracks containing said Operations to meet their respective conditions.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns that represents days or weeks. Each turn introduces an Operation to which the player assigns forces. These forces carry out Missions with the objective of completing the Operation. Each Operation completed yields a measure of success towards the objectives of the Campaign. The Campaign concludes when a set number of Operations is complete. Victory is determined by how effectively the player met the challenges of each Operation.<br/><br/>Each Operation is resolved by maneuvering units on a track of six boxes. The player carries out Missions for only one Operation on a single track at a time. Each track is composed of six boxes, called Grids. A Grid represents a small area, perhaps a few hundred square kilometers typified by a single, prevailing terrain or community. As an Operation&rsquo;s milestones are met, the player&rsquo;s forces move farther down that Operation&rsquo;s track.<br/><br/>The player may carry out as many as six Operations at a time. At that pace, the player&rsquo;s forces will be stretched very thin. Continuous operations will exhaust units, as will enemy action. Units can recover at Bravo Base either at the conclusion of an Operation or by pulling out of the Operation prior to completion. Bravo Base is more than an area for staging and R&amp;R. The player may also have units conduct Rehearsals to improve their respective effectiveness in one of the four capabilities.<br/><br/>Unlike a typical wargame, combat is only one of four primary functions of each unit. Units are rated on the bases of Kinetics (combat), ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), CIMIC (Civil-Military Cooperation), and Engineering. The nature of a unit determines its effectiveness in each of these four capabilities. Each unit&rsquo;s effectiveness is portrayed numerically with a value of zero (no capability) to an upper-limit of five or so. A tank platoon might have capabilities of 5 0 0 0, while a Special Operations team might have values of 2 4 2 0. The tank platoon, with a Kinetics rating of 5, is peerless in a stand-up fight, but has no other capabilities. The Special Operations team can fight, but is much better at gathering Intel.<br/><br/>In most of the Campaigns represented in the game, the role of the MEU is more than just combat. The MGR design focuses on the broader range of missions faced by Marine commanders, including distinguishing bad guys from good guys, establishing bases, gathering intelligence, and gaining the trust and support of the locals.<br/><br/>Units that are not controlled by the player are collectively referred to as Opposition Forces (OpFor). The composition of OpFor is another aspect of MGR that departs from typical wargame design. OpFor units are composed predominantly of non-combatants. Shooting is easy. Separating legitimate targets from civilians is not. As the player&rsquo;s forces enter a Grid, the player will typically exert significant effort to identify the human terrain of the Grid, assess the risk, and take necessary action to establish required security.<br/><br/>",

Using dice, cards, mindgames and general skullduggery, players pit their wits, chance their arm and push their luck to the limit in an attempt to be crowned top bluffooner. An unreadable poker face and nerves of steel will also come in handy.<br/><br/>Bluffoons: a game of bluff, played by buffoons. <br/>Buffoon: joker, jester, clown, wag, bozo.<br/>Bluff: bamboozle, hoodwink, double-cross, confound, baffle.<br/><br/>There are five first-rate bluffing categories, so everyone will have their own favourite. Sometimes you play a DUEL (one against one), sometimes it&rsquo;s ALL PLAY (everyone plays) and sometimes you play &lsquo;BLIND&rsquo; (with no idea of what you have). So whether you are trying to imply that you have drawn the highest card, establishing if your opponent really has rolled a pair of sixes or double-crossing someone despite agreeing to cooperate, Bluffoons will challenge not only your bluffing ability but also your buffooning potential to the maximum.<br/><br/>",

At the start, each player puts 10 counters into the Pool. The Dummy hand is left face-down.<br/><br/>Each player, in their turn, can ask any other player for a card by naming the colour he would like. If successful, that player can ask again, and so on until he gets a negative answer. If this happens he must 'Buy' a card from the Dummy (by paying one counter into the Pool) and add it to his hand. If a set is acquired during his turn then he must expose it by laying down the correct cards (Master Card plus the two colour cards needed to make that Master Card colour. For instance, 1 Yellow + 1 Green makes Blue. For every colour set that a player exposes, he gets a number of counters from the Pool. This varies with the sets exposed, but will result in taking 4, 3 or 2 counters.<br/><br/>One set is different, the Rainbow set, which comprises of the Rainbow Master Card and the rainbows 6 colours (I know there arte 7 colours in a rainbow but the designer of this game did not know that). The round ends when a player lays down the Rainbow set and he or she takes the Pool and every other player must hand over counters for every card still in their hand (1 counter for a colour card, 2 for a Master Card.)<br/><br/>Play as many rounds as there are players and the winner is the one with the most counters.<br/><br/>An alternative way of scoring is given that awards points instead of counters and a further, easier game, called Rainbow Sequence, is described.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game but without the board associated with Pope Joan games. And the cards are not traditional at all. They feature British Royal 'houses', such as the Normans or the Tudors, etc. Because of the uneven number of monarchs in each family, the suits are uneven. For example, the Norman suit consists of five cards, four being monarchs and the fifth is an honour card and features illustrations of the four monarchs in that House. However the Tudors consist of 6 cards; Five monarchs and the honour card showing them all. Others vary according to how many monarchs were in that lineage.<br/><br/>Mark out on the table four areas (called Pools). In order they signify;<br/>Ace of Fleur-de-Lis or William the Norman<br/>The 5 of the Red and White Rose, which is represented by Elizabeth the 1st<br/>The five of the Oak, represented by William IV<br/>and just one known as Game<br/>Each player puts 1 counter into the William the Norman Pool and 1 into Elizabeth Pool and 1 into the Game Pool. And each player puts two counters into the William IV Pool.<br/><br/>The game is one of following suit really. If a card is chosen as the first card in a suit, the 'next' card in the suit can be played on it, and so on. If the highest card in a suit is played. that player can choose to start with a card in one of the other suits. Play goes on until one player plays their last card. That player gets the Game counters. In addition, every player pays the 'out' player one counter for every card still in their hand (or two counters for every card if you happen to still hold the Cromwell card) The other Pools are collected during the game. If a player plays the next card in sequence and that card happens to be William the Norman, Elizabeth or William IV, then that player takes the counters in the associated Pool.<br/><br/>Play as many games as you want and the one with the most counters when you stop, is the winner.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>There are seven suits:<br/>Fleur-de-Lis (sic) or the Norman line<br/>Broom Tree or the Plantagenets<br/>Red Rose or the House of Lancaster<br/>White Rose or the House of York<br/>Red and White Rose joined or the House of Tudor<br/>Thistle or the House of Stuart<br/>Acorn or the House of Hanover<br/>Plus one special card representing Oliver Cromwell (the Usurper as the rules describe him). He does not belong to a royal house at all so does not have an emblem. He can only be played between the two Charles cards. In other words, when Charles I is played, then Cromwell can be played and then Charles II could be played. If you are caught with Cromwell in your hand then you have to pay double for the cards in your hand once someone has gone out.<br/><br/>There are 42 cards and the rules run to 16 pages but do include a sample game. That must have been pretty rare. I have dated it 1838 because the last Monarch is William IV and Victoria was crowned a year later.<br/><br/>",

Each side of the board has two areas - the lower portion contains a thin ledge on which to place the letter tiles and a coordinate system.  The upper portion has the coordinates as well as holes which can be filled with either light or dark pegs, depending on on the result of a query.  The letter tiles, which come in two shades, are imprinted on a quadrille rule themselves, for better alignment with the coordinate system.<br/><br/>The game plays by each person placing a word made from their color of tiles, in secret, on their side of the board, and then the players take turns calling out coordinates. A player records a &quot;hit&quot; with a light peg, and a &quot;miss&quot; with a darker one.  The first player to guess the other's word is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The Ghost is placed in the central diamond on the board and the playing pieces of the other players in the five diamonds nearest the Ferry (but not across the water). The movements are diamond to diamond through the lines joining them and you can cross from one circular line to another when there is a line linking them. The cards can not cross water anywhere but the Ghost may do so by following the dotted lines.<br/><br/>Ghost wins the game if he succeeds in crossing the water to the part of the country at the top of the board. The Hunters win if they surround the Ghost and force him on to the diamond at either of the two houses with diamonds, or on to the either of the two diamonds at the Cave, or on to the centre diamond so that he cannot escape.<br/><br/>The Ghost moves first and then the Hunters, then the Ghost again, and so on. Neither the Ghost or Hunters can be taken. Everyone can move backwards or forwards, but only one move each turn.

        "description": "Abstract game for two players. One takes the Pole playing pieces, the other the Russians. The Poles are lighter in appearance, the Russians darker. Each player puts his men on the spaces marked with an X on his side of the board.<br/><br/>The object is to capture all your opponent's pieces.The men move forwards (or sideways I suspect but the rules are not clear on this) one space at a time. The Captains can move backwards or forwards. No Captains are in play at the start. You capture men by jumping over them, as in Draughts or Checkers. When either player gets a man into the Battlefield (up the centre of the board) that man is changed into a Captain and is placed at the uppermost spot on the outside of the board. Now he can move backwards or forwards but still only one space at a time (unless jumping to capture). Capturing must be done if you are in place to do so.<br/><br/>",

The cannon ball marked spaces are penalty spaces. Lose a turn, go back spaces and so on. the star marked spaces predict good fortune for the player but bestow no advantage in the game itself.<br/><br/>The game uses one six sided die (1-6) for determining the number of spaces to move. The game sample has two dice cups so there may have been more than one die originally. The markers are red, black, yellow, and green.<br/><br/>The game box is mostly red with the title in yellow.

        "description": "123 Dice Game by Collective Wisdom<br/><br/>This small-box game has eight 1&quot; dice with large numbers ranging from 1-72.  Rules for 14 games and a few variations are included.  All are math games designed for preschool through fourth grade.  They are:<br/><br/>________________________________________<br/>Preschool - 1st Grade:<br/><br/>Number Identification Game - Roll the dice and name the numbers, earning a point for each number correctly identified.<br/><br/>Order of Numbers Game - Roll all dice, re-rolling duplicates.  Put the dice in numerical order.  Earn one point per roll and play to five.<br/><br/>Counting Game - Roll all dice except the &quot;81&quot; die.  Select any two dice and say aloud all the numbers between them.  Earn one point per roll.<br/>________________________________________<br/>Games and Activities for 1st and 2nd Grades:<br/><br/>Another More Challenging Counting Game - Plays as &quot;Counting Game&quot; above except that a point is earned for each number named, encouraging players to select dice that are further apart.<br/><br/>Blind Toss Number Value Game - A moderator rolls all the dice and gives one to each player whose eyes are shut.  Each player then goes around the circle, saying whether their number is greater than or less than each other player's die.  If his is less than any player, he is eliminated.  Eventually, one player will remain in the round and earn one point.  This is repeated except that the lowest number will win the second round.  Continue until a single player scores six.<br/><br/>Odd Even Game - Roll all dice and divide them into even and odd piles.  Earn one point for each roll.<br/><br/>Addition Game (Adding 2 numbers) - Roll all dice.  Select two, add them and announce the sum.  One point is given for each correct answer.  Play to ten points.<br/><br/>Addition and Subtraction -  As above for Addition Game, but continue, subtracting the lesser die from the greater die and announcing the difference.  One point is given for each correct answer.  Play to ten points.<br/><br/>Addition Game (Adding 3 Numbers) - Roll all dice and choose three.  Add them together and announce the sum.<br/><br/>Challenging Variation of Additiona &amp; Subtraction Games - Instead of granting one point per correct answer, players earn the answer as the number of points, thus encouraging players to select harder dice.<br/><br/>Place Value Game - Roll dice until all show single-digit numbers.  Select any three and name the three-digit number they form.  Earn one point for each roll and play to 28.  Optionally, offer an extra point for each number that is written out long-hand.<br/><br/>________________________________________<br/>Games and Activities for 3rd and 4th Grades:<br/><br/>Multiplication Game I: Each player writes down a set of five numbers.  Before rolling, each player will announce which of those numbers they will be using.  After rolling all the dice, select three and multiply each by the number chosen before the roll, scoring one point per correct answer.  On his next turn, the player must choose a new multiplicand.<br/><br/>Multiplication Game II: Roll six dice.  Divide the rolled dice into three pairs and multiply each pair, announcing the product.  Earn one point per correct answer.<br/><br/>Challenging Variation to Multiplication Games I and II: Play as above except that players add the products to their scores instead of one point, thus challenging them to select higher-yielding combinations.<br/><br/>Division Game: Roll all dice, removing any duplicate numbers.  Identify any pairs of dice where one can be evenly divided into the other.  Die may be used more than once.  Earn one point per pair identified.  Before the next player rolls the dice, they may review the pairs and earn two points for any missed pairs they identify.  Play to 30 points.<br/><br/>Equation Game: Roll all dice.  Identify any valid equations - addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.  Each equation will require at least three dice, but may use more.   Earn one point for each die used.  Continue making equations, re-using dice as needed.  Play to 25 points.<br/><br/>________________________________________<br/>The dice are of good quality and have the following faces:<br/><br/>A:  1 -  2 -  3 -  4 -  5 -  6<br/>B:  2 -  3 -  4 -  5 -  8 -  9<br/>C:  2 -  9 - 10 - 10 - 11 - 12<br/>D:  3 -  4 -  5 -  6 -  7 -  8<br/>E:  3 -  5 -  6 -  7 -  9 - 10<br/>F:  8 -  8 - 16 - 24 - 32 - 40<br/>G:  9 - 18 - 36 - 54 - 72 - 81 <br/>H: 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 - 40<br/><br/>",

The storm is raging and you're racing to put him back together before it passes. On your turn, pick a symbol, pick a partner to work with you, and roll your bones! If your combined roll shows the right combination, you have successfully mended one of Frankie's parts. Yay! If you don't, the storm keeps coming and the lightning rains down! But be careful, if more lightning hits Frankie before you're ready, some of your hard work will come undone!<br/><br/>Are your fellow scientists and co-workers missing in action? Well then it's up to you to fix Frankie all by yourself - roll all of the bones and with just a pinch of luck, you alone can put him back together!<br/><br/>Frankie is a co-operative game with all of the players working together against the storm tracker (timer).

But what you don't know: your lovely town of Wolfeboro is inhabited entirely by werewolves and all of your neighbors are facing your same dilemma - catch or be caught!<br/><br/>Before the game begins, you and your friends must work together to create the Wolfeboro woods - every player gets a say in how many trees you use and where they go! Yay! And then its time to hunt down one of your friends before they can hunt you! Each turn, roll your bones to move, but be careful, the wrong roll means you get hit by moonlight and become the prey.<br/><br/>The first player to catch a w(h)erewolf wins the game!<br/><br/>",

You and your friends are locked in a silo with a broken jar of Zombie-Maker-243. The end result is a no-brainer: it's only a matter of time until you're all infected. But hey, why not make your last moments fun? After all, when it comes to tag, zombies really bite!<br/><br/>You and your friends start the game locked inside an abondoned military silo contaminated with Zombie-Maker-243. It's inevitable that you'll become a zombie, but that's not exactly the life choice that you prefer! Each turn, you roll your bones to run away from your (former) friends, but you'd better roll lucky: getting the wrong symbols means you've been contaminated and, BAM!, are instantly Zombified!<br/><br/>Zombified can also be played by groups even larger than 10 people! The central logo-staircase allows movement between the silo's underground floors. While there is no limit to the number of floors you can play on, a minimum of 5 people per floor is recommended.<br/><br/>The last player to become Zombified is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The Vampire flies in shadows, taking out the villagers that stray too far from the group.<br/><br/>The Villagers win by surrounding the Vampire with at least 3 pieces.

You'll have to work together with your competitors to eliminate other skeletons, but it'll be up to you alone to take and hold the central Masoleum while the necormancer casts his spell. Don't forget to use of the graveyard's underground tunnel network to move between graves and get the jump on your competition!<br/><br/>Skeletons are captured by being surrounded by any two opposing skeletons (mixed-force captures are allowed!).

If a player stops on a square indicating a promotion or a setback, the player moves forward or backward to the square named. If sent to the Log Cabin, the player must begin over again.

Futbolmate is an innovative option in which the player develops his own winning plays, so the amusement is not lost in any play.<br/><br/>The soccer strategy game Futbolmate has a rectangular board in 108 green and yellow blocks; on these blocks are placed 18 round pieces in two colors to represent the two teams. The two goalkeepers move similar to the Queen in Chess &ndash; that is, as many spaces as desired in any straight direction. The other pieces can move only one diagonal space each turn. Another smaller round piece represents the ball. The objective of the game is to move all the pieces over the rectangular board to score the most goals in an established time. The game ends with a winner or a tie, similar to professional soccer.<br/><br/>The movement of the ball makes the difference. It does not follow a predetermined path, as its movement responds to the logic mazes of S&aacute;gaze, rules that allow the ball to rebound on the pieces and edges board, with players always trying to recover the ball or score a goal. Futbolmate uses no dice, no cards, and no other random elements &ndash; only the skill of the two players.<br/><br/>",

The Occulite Tribes have expanded from their small groups of five, to much larger numbers. Over time individuals in these groups have evolved into specialist roles within their Tribe. Each Tribe pushes towards different objectives.<br/><br/>The game uses a Stratego-like fog of war to place your characters on a modular map. Each character has an ability which can only be utilised when it is revealed. The game also features the 'Natural Selection Deck' which first appeared in original game in the Saga: Dawn - Rise of the Occulites. You draw your hand of cards from the Natural Selection Deck during the game which you use to activate characters, move, fight, resolve events and activate special Tribal abilities.<br/><br/>Revealing your characters at the right time and using the 'Natural Selection Deck', your Tribe's abilities and the features of the map effectively will help you complete your objectives and win.<br/><br/>The composition of each Tribe is different and plays differently. The game offers a number of different Objectives of which between 1 and 3 are selected secretly before the game. The winner is the player who completes all his or her objectives first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Football related card game. Two decks of cards are provided. One is used for a Match number and the other is used for generating the results of the matches.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly basic game considering the expense of producing a game with 127 cards in total. Each player is dealt an even number of Match cards. Then the match results are found, not by subtle, clever play. No, you draw a card and the result will be ticked in the card, either a Home Win (1 point scored), an Away Win (2 points scored) or a Draw (3 points scored). And that's it!<br/><br/>Three variations are provided but still the same game except for the solitaire patience-type game, but that is also dreary. The last rules relate to no game at all. The publishers suggest that you might like to fill in your Football Pools entry form by drawing cards randomly and applying the result to match 1 on the coupon, then match 2, and so on. I would imagine that this use of the cards was the main intention of the publisher.<br/><br/>",

Each package includes 4 cards with the entire collection existing out of 216 cards.<br/><br/>The rules for the game are simple: Every player takes at least 5 cards face down. Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and chooses one of the 5 characteristics (cheerful, romantic, clumsy, playful or relaxed) which all have a specific score. After choosing the category the player places the card on the table so that everybody can see it. Now the other players take the first card from their own deck and compare the score of the choosen characteristic. Each card only has three characteristics, so only players who have a card with the choosen characteristic can play along that round. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.<br/><br/>For collecting purposes people have made their own interpretation of the game or let the winner choose a card from one of the losers decks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The playing area for Das kleine Bankett und andere Abenteuer (&quot;The Little Banquet and Other Adventures&quot;) in most of the game's scenarios is a tad unusual: a circle of chairs, with players starting each round by standing behind a chair. The players represent kids from different countries, specifically brothers and sisters who are accompanied by a pet, and they want to solve puzzles, quests and tasks while meeting and playing with one another. More specifically, some scenarios involve cooperative tasks, while another might have you compete against everyone in a race. Each scenario has been designed to be replayable numerous times.<br/><br/>Once a scenario begins, a golden &quot;ball&quot; will be put into play from the starting point, moving either clockwise or anticlockwise. As soon as the golden ball reaches the first standing player, this player is in charge and can choose to act. Every player has a character card, which depicts his available moves on its backside. Once the player chooses an action, it will likely require other players to move, so the succession of players will change in the circle of chairs.<br/><br/>After his action, the player sits and hands the golden ball to the next player adjacent to him. The next standing player who receives the golden ball takes his turn, and play continues until all players are seated. At this point you check whether you've met any of the winning conditions of the scenario, such as placing members of your faction near goals or hidden treasures, or handing someone a gift. If you manage to exchange places at the right time with your partners, you can achieve different goals; since each character has different abilities to move others around or place themselves near a goal, players often have multiple solutions on their fingertips &ndash; assuming they can find them in time.<br/><br/>Each character also has a loyal pet shown on its card. The pets can be one of two classes &ndash; Growler or Kuddler &ndash; and each class has its own specific move. If needed, a pet's owner can decide to use the action of his pet instead of his own.<br/><br/>Integrates with<br/><br/><br/>    The Last Banquet<br/><br/><br/>",

Playing a board game involves multiple players, each looking to win. The resulting competition can devolve into incredible displays of lunacy. Nit-picking over the rules, collusion against specific players because of grudges carried over from other games, and even fights over bending or missing pieces.<br/><br/>This game harnesses all of this angst into a game in and of itself!<br/><br/>In this game, you move on a board that's only 10-spaces long, trying to be the first person to get to the end. You do this by playing specific cards on your turn, each representing things that might happen during a typical board game. Watch out though, because your opponents will be trying to get there first as well. Cards like &quot;Analysis Paralysis&quot;, &quot;Bathroom Break&quot;, &quot;Blame-Shifter&quot;, and good old-fashioned &quot;Cheating&quot; will no-doubt bring back memories of past board-game fights. Who knows, maybe you'll all get along next time!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In World in Four, players try to assemble sets of nation cards by grabbing them from both the table and opponents. Each player starts with twelve cards in hand (or ten, depending on the number of players) and fourteen cards are arranged in a grid on the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player reveals one card from the table to all players; if she thinks she can make a set of four cards (including the revealed one), she attempts to do so, claiming them as a set if she does so and adding one card from her hand to the face-down array if she fails. (She also turns the revealed card face down again.) The player then identifies an opponent and names a country or number. If that opponent has such a card, he must hand it over to her and she takes another turn; otherwise her turn ends and the player she attempted to steal from takes the next turn.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been played as sets, the game ends. Sets numbered 6-13 are worth that many points, the South Korea set is worth 10 points, and all other sets are worth 5 points each. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Oh, and you're a porcupine.<br/><br/>All players start at the entrance of the supermarket. On a turn, you roll the die, move that many spaces on the track, then take 1-2 food items from the shelves next to you on the movement track. Supermarket employees help you take more goods (so helpful!), while porcupine bullies force you to toss an item previously placed in your cart. Land on another player and you take something from them, potentially messing up both your counts. Some food cards &ndash; being coupons, I suppose &ndash; subtract from your total; others double the total.<br/><br/>Whoever reaches the end of the track first collects five bonus points, and the game ends. Players then announce the total amount of goods they've collected. If correct, they add 20 points to their score; if they're off, they lose 10-50 points depending on how far they're off the mark. Whoever then has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Players follow directions provided on the game board to form completed boxes and capture the most amount space.<br/><br/>The board is 13x13 one inch squares (totaling 169 spaces)each with its own arrows allowing for movement of a specific direction up, down, left or right, or a combination of those movements.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player rolls a die to determine who will place their game piece first (lower number places first higher number places second but moves first). As players exit a tile they place a marker turned to their color on the board. Players must follow the directional arrows in the spaces trying to form a completed box (2x2 or greater). Once you have formed a completed box you are allowed to move freely in that space assuming you can get to the box using directional arrows on the board. If a completed box is fully encircled by the opponents color markers the box is turned to that players markers. You may not move through an opponents completed box. If you move through an opponents marker that is not in a completed box turn it to your color (you must follow the directions of the arrows under the marker). If at any time you find that you have no legal moves you move your game piece to another location on the board and your remaining moves are forfeit.<br/><br/>Each round players roll a single die and the combined roll is the movement allotment for the turn.  Players alternate first position each round eliminating the &quot;first-player advantage&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player has a valid move that they can take.<br/>  <br/>The aesthetics of the game are meant to give you that old-timey feel. From the scroll for a game mat to the stained wooden game pieces and markers, Attrition is meant to feel like a game that has been played for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A long, long time ago, after a loot of a cursed treasure, a pirate ship was devastated by an intense storm and pushed into the lowlands of a distant archipelago. The enigmatic medallions recovered by the natives over the years and the strange events that have taken place ever since, make the population on the islands fear that the curse is upon them. In Medallions, players embrace the characters of the natives charged with exorcising the curse and seeking to recover the medallions to launch them into a giant furnace. The purpose is to transform them into pure metal ingots. But beware: not all members on the mission are well-intentioned...<br/><br/>In Medallions players have to collect medallions of 3 colors within the islands to transform them into gold ingots (VP's). In their turn players move their disc on the track up to 3 cases. Then, their pawn inside the board repeats the move selected. To continue the movement and go further a player may use cards from a common stack. At the beginning of the game each player receives a secret role (there may be a traitor or not in the team). If you are a good charater you will try to transform the highest number of medallions you can, trying to identify and accuse an eventual traitor (there are risks doing so). The traitor will have another goal: collect secretly the highest number of black medallions (traitor VP's). A traitor only can be accused until 3/4 of the game track.<br/><br/>The game has a simple but important economic gestion. To have money to buy new medallions arriving in a island, players will need to sell medallions and special ability cards that may be played in your turn. As they are sold, the pile will increase and someone can buy them all! Note that sold medallions are put face down, and only buyers can have access to the information about who sold what.<br/><br/>",

Players shoudl be careful not to show the faces of their cards to the other players. Any player who holds a pair of card with the same symbols (green leaf, red starfish, yellow snail, etc) in the top left corners should immediately lay them face up on the table. Player to the left of the dealer goes first. He or she picks a card from the player to their left. If the card matches, the player lays them down face up on the table. If the card does not match, or gets the dreaded shark card, their turn ends and it is the next players turn. Play continues until all pairs have been matched up and one player is left holding the shark card. The player with the shark is the looser.

        "description": "Soviet historians tended to see the Great October Socialist Revolution as irrefutable proof of the inevitable scientific laws of economics as pronounced by Marx and interpreted by Lenin. Liberal historians tend to focus on the political and ideological background of the revolution and ignore the social and economic issues. Left wing historians, particularly Anarchist writers, tend to view the revolution as the expression of the mass will to reject authoritarian intervention in their liberty and freedom. Revisionist historians consider the revolution as arising primarily from below, that is, from the peasants and the workers. And most historians tend to take an obligatory swipe at the Tsar, Tsarina and Rasputin, and then ignore the bureaucracy, the armed forces high command (Stavka) and the bourgeois reactionaries forever after.<br/><br/>Rather than attempt to justify one or the other of these dogmas, perhaps it would be easier to realize that Russia in 1917 was an enormous paradox. She was one of the largest countries in the world in terms of both area and population, yet her economy was primitive and underdeveloped, and 85% of her population consisted of illiterate and superstitious peasants with no interests in anything much beyond the limits of their own villages, least of all politics. Russia was about a century behind the development of the other Great Powers, and although she was finally trying to catch up, she was handicapped by a political system and an absolute monarch that were simply unequal to the 20th Century. When the revolution finally came, it was solely Russian, which is to say, a national phenomenon with a traditional outlook; and it adhered to the Standard Operating Procedures for revolutions, which is to say, that it was initiated by the moderates and then ultimately taken over by the extremists. But to Lenin and his Bolshevik organization, the revolution was going to have a global outlook with the intent of imposing Lenin&rsquo;s vision of socialism on the entire world.<br/><br/>Regardless of the name given to the events in Petrograd in 1917, the facts are that there was a popular revolution followed by a Bolshevik coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Petrograd 1917 starts with the popular revolution that had been initiated by the moderates, was taken over by the extremists, and then succumbed to the inevitable coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Players will find that staging a successful coup will not be as easy as it was for Lenin, who was blessed with the unwitting but invaluable assistance of Kerensky.<br/><br/>This is a card-based simulation for 2 to 6 players, each of whom will try to create a political organization and help it to gain influence, so that it becomes the predominant political party in Russia, either by votes or by force.

As well as colonies around the world.<br/><br/>A future module will tie these together with international events, diplomacy, technologies and more. Players will be challenged to build a powerful nation-state, levy taxes, develop their military advancements, build and dismantle fortresses, stay ahead of their enemies, and manage over 300 cards and events to survive the era.

        "description": "Chess taken to the 4th dimension. Played on a 4x4x4x4 board, it includes all the traditional chess pieces, with a slightly different number. Each player has 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 4 bishops, 4 knights and 21 pawns. Players also have 3 types of fairy pieces: 2 unicorns (moving like a knight with an additional single cell right angle move), 2 wizards (moving like a bishop, but only to other levels in the 3rd &amp; 4th dimensions) and 1 minstrel (a non-capturing piece, that moves like a rook and prevents orthogonally adjacent pieces from making a capturing move). Players take turns moving pieces one at a time, but a variant allows players 2 moves a turn to speed up the game. The goal is to checkmate the king.<br/><br/>Some of the traditional pieces have altered moves, beyond the 4 dimensional aspect. The king only moves and captures orthogonally one space. Pawns move orthogonally one space and captures diagonally one space. Rooks move and capture orthogonally, but also changes direction at a right angle once it meets a wall. Bishops move on 2D diagonals and on 3D or 4D diagonals (but not on the 2D diagonals of other levels). Knights move as chess knights. The Queen moves as a Chesseract rook or bishop.<br/><br/>One huge challenge in Chesseract is to try and envision moves in 4 dimensions. While each 2 dimensional level is only 4x4, learning to extend the moves beyond is a little brain-burning.<br/><br/>Chesseract was created by Jim Aikin<br/><br/>",

The game features Invasion and Colonization of Planets, Technology Research, Tactical Space-combat, Ship Construction and Customization, Anomalies and Resource Management.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of building structures (ex. energy collectors) to gather resources, colonize planets to man your spaceships and research technology to equip your fleet, planets and shipyard.<br/><br/>This is accomplished by drawing cards from your deck and playing them according to various rules and time-based mechanics (building ships takes time for example).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player according to three different victory-conditions:<br/><br/>Extinction - The opposing player loses all Population (by invasion or destruction of planets or structures)<br/><br/>Starvation - The opposing player loses all Energy (by stealing energy or destroying collectors)<br/><br/>Burnout - The opposing player loses the ability to play Units (by losing all cards in his main deck and hand)<br/><br/>Millennium Gravitas relies less on luck-of-the-draw than other comparable games and gives the player more control over their strategy. The core mechanics are focused on flexibility and tactics rather than deck-building or owning the most powerful cards to overpower your opponent.<br/><br/>The game supports different game-modes, like 1vs1, 2vs2 or +4vs (the mechanics theoretically do not limit the amount of players that are able to play together or against each other). All complex play styles are supported, from team-matches to last-man-standing. This creates many interesting games with temporary alliances and even politics as emergent game-play. Additionally Millennium does not require a game-board or sophisticated game-pieces and miniatures, all you need to play is knowledge of the rules, your own deck, and something to be used as tokens.<br/><br/>",

Prepare twelve playing fields that correspond to individual rooms. Then shuffle the word cards and give them out among the players. Everyone holds their cards hidden. When you insert a CD into the player and turn on the shuffle mode. The game begins. Youngest player chooses a card and pantomime the word shown. Other players have one attempt to guess words, anyone can guess. Correct guess is the first successful step to avert danger in the room (you put the card in the appropriate room). If guessing is not successful, then take a card in your hand and performs a new word. Words are selected from the songs, so playing song can serve as a hint. You have to guess 5 words for each room. Compositions have a length of about three minutes, that means to guess each word have approximately 20 to 50 seconds. Guessing must be quick, otherwise fail.

There are then fourteen movement and combat turns each year. Ships are moved via dice roll (reflecting the unpredictability of the winds), but players can choose how to allocate each die. There are also prevailing winds and currents which can affect movement.<br/><br/>Players can attack other players' colonies, but can also send merchant ships to obtain trade goods and carry them back to home ports (where they add to the treasury) or send warships to attack other players' treasure fleets. There are occasional random events.<br/><br/>At the end of three years victory points are awarded for gold in the treasury, ships, and captured colonies. Each nation subtracts a different amount from their final score to reflect imbalance in the positions; each nation starts with different amounts of money and units, and also collects a different amount of taxes each year.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A German card-based game intended for teaching teenagers about society/ethics/sociopolitical issues. The cards can also be used as a starting point for discussion.<br/><br/>The game centers around questions like &quot;What would you do if you wanted to get home from a party at night and the driver is drunk?&quot; or &quot;What would you do if a friend tells you he is homosexual?&quot;<br/><br/>The game confronts you with 60 tricky situations from the area of politics, ethics and society. There is one card for each situation. The front side introduces the situation and the back describes three possible reactions to the situation. Players decide how they would react and try to guess what others would do. If you know the other players well, you earn points.<br/><br/>There are three variants for playing the game:<br/><br/>1) In the most basic variant, one player reads one of the reactions from the back of a card. The other players try to guess what the situation is by asking yes/no questions. The player who first guesses the situation wins the card. The game ends when each player has been the &quot;reader&quot; once or twice. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 3<br/><br/>2) One player reads a situation and the three reactions from the back of the card. All players (including the reader, R) guess how R would most likely react. They write down the letter assigned to this reaction on a slip of paper. Before the players hand in their guesses, R chooses three players of which he/she thinks that they've guessed correctly. The chosen players show their guesses and R shows his/her answer. For each matching answer R gets one point, the chosen players get 2 points if they've guessed correctly. Now all the other guesses are collected and counted. All other players (i.e. everyone except R and the 3 chosen players) get one point if the majority has guessed correctly. Then the next player becomes R. The game ends when each player has been R once. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 8<br/><br/>3) A situation and the three reactions are read. Each player decides how he/she would react and writes down the corresponding letter on a slip of paper. The answers are handed in. Now each player guesses how many people have chosen answers A, B and C. They right the numbers down in a table. Then the answers are counted. Players get 3 points for a correct guess, one points if their guess is off by one.<br/>The game ends after 14 situations. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/>Suggested minimum number of players: 4<br/><br/>Example situation: <br/>Situation: &quot;The party is over. We've all been drinking. This is particularly obvious in the person who was intended to be the driver. He gets behind the wheel. It's a 20-minutes' drive. There is no bus that late at night and we want to get home fast.<br/>Possible reactions: &quot;A: I ask the driver if he's confident he can do it. If he says yes, I'll go with him this one time. After all, it isn't far and we can take back roads.&quot; <br/>&quot;B: We judge who's most likely to be capable of driving and decide on a driver that way.&quot; <br/>&quot;C: Under no circumstances am I going to drive or take a ride with a drunken driver. We'll have to call a taxi and collect the car later.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In addition to rock, paper and scissor symbols, there are fire (burns paper), well (extinguishes fire etc.), and joker pictures. Each player receives one joker card and puts it face-up in front of him/herself. The other cards are shuffled and each player gets six cards. Players take turns choosing one other player for a duel. The duel partners each play one card of their choice simultaneously. The winner of the duel gets the card that the loser played. Then the next player chooses his/her partner for this turn's duel.<br/><br/>If both players play the same symbol, both cards stay in the pool and the next symbols decide who wins. If a player has lost all his/her cards, he/she uses the joker card. This means that the joker player uses a hand gesture while his/her duel partner plays a card as usual. If the joker player wins, he/she gets to draw two new cards. If the joker player loses, he/she is eliminated from the game.

The cards are used to build a one-meter long path. The card backs have path segments, bridges and turns printed on them. In order to be allowed to add a card to the path, one has to complete a task or answer a question from the card. The cards come in 4 different categories, but they are all related to hiking, conservation, youth politics and youth culture, and knowledge about the &quot;Deutsche Wanderjugend&quot;.<br/>Questions come in different levels of difficulty and players earn different numbers of chits (&quot;Wandertaler&quot;) accordingly.<br/>The game ends when the path has been completed.

        "description": "The first 4x strategy game fully integrated into an immersive storytelling/choose-your-own-adventure system.<br/><br/>60 years after the most powerful nations on Earth obliterated the planet, small tribes emerge to transition from mere survivors into a functioning society. You play as the leader of one of these tribes, each with a unique method of governing their people, a specific moral alignment, and explicit spiritual beliefs. You are leading a small group of lieutenants and followers. Your objective, specific to your unique character and motivations, is to mold this emerging world in the way you best see fit.<br/><br/>Explore the wasteland to find essential materials, find and recruit other small pockets of survivors, and discover the competing tribes. You must conquer hearts, minds and bodies if you want to emerge as your region's guiding force in forging the world to come The Day After Tomorrow.<br/><br/>In the early game, players explore and expand by revealing hidden tiles, hoping to find modest food sources that will allow them to add tribe members, find groups of other survivors who may be interested in joining forces, fighting for their autonomy, or simply keeping an arms-length relationship. Most importantly players are hoping to find precious rare materials such as ammunition, horses and power sources to assist their growth and expansion.<br/><br/>Through exploration players discover one another on our unique modular hex map system. Then the main phase of the game begins, where culture and religion pass between connected tribes, where the leaders fight for the best people, and each tribe's rare and valuable resources are being plundered during daring raids and defended by courageous sacrifices. Tribes will need to work together in order to achieve shared ends, but ultimately the most important thing is: will your particular vision for the world to come end up proving dominant?<br/><br/>The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are brought to life with voluminous text in a choose-your-own-adventure style. You will need to carefully roleplay your leader as adhering to his or her particular moral, spiritual and governmental predilections is required to achieve success. There will be numerous character choices for players to make and, for those who want The Day After Tomorrow to do so, the design is intended to support deep RPG-style character play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dominion of the Gods is a tactical miniatures game played on a board created by the players. The players buy, assemble and paint miniatures for use with the game. The miniatures come with stat cards, these stats will also be available in a rulebook. The stat card tells the player how far the model can move, how many dice it uses to attack, how many dice it gets while defending, how far its combat reach is how many hits the model can sustain before being removed from gameplay as dead and the level of faith it has in its God.<br/><br/>Monsters, heroes, and gods of different pantheons battle in a miniatures skirmish game. Intuitive dice-based combat.  Cards list what models can accomplish, and dice rolls determine hits and blocks. Rolling the power die in special situations can prevent un-blockable hits.<br/><br/>Players start off by choosing a God from a pantheon to play as their main character. Players then decide on a point total for the game they want to play. Once the point total is decided, each player puts together an army with models (using the models point cost) that equal up to the point total decided by the players. Players can only use models from their chosen pantheon at this time. There is the possibility that some  pantheons may be able to benefit from rogue legends in the future. Players are allowed to select one coin that they possess to use during the game. Different coins will be manufactured with different abilities. Some coins will be standard while others will be collectible items sold only during certain times of the year or at specific locations.<br/><br/>If a God is killed during the game, the faith scores of all the models on that team are reduced making them more likely to fail psychology checks. If a God is the only model left on the board, the God loses the ability to use any influence. Influence is a score that tells a God how much magic he can use every round. When a God is left without followers, he loses his magic ability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Concurrent is a tabletop adaptation of the PC game, Risk 2, which is a computer adaptation of the classic board game, Risk.<br/><br/>Instead of the standard turn-taking that occurs in Risk, Concurrent utilizes a system where the players determine their troop deployment and attacks simultaneously.<br/><br/>The game consists of a game board, representing various countries and territories across the Earth, with connections between the countries by borders and some lines across continents and to island countries/territories.  In addition, there are cards which have the various countries/territories listed on the card, and plastic figures which represent the player's army.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all cards are passed out to the players, which represents the starting countries for each player.  Afterward, the players are allowed a certain number of army units, relative to the total number of players, which they are allow to place on their starting countries.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players are given a piece of paper to write all their actions on.  Included is new unit deployment (based on total countries controlled, largest connected empire, continents controlled, and any matching card set the player can turn in), attacks, and the player's surge attack.  Players may attack any country using army units they control on adjacent countries, but must leave at least one unit in their country as a defender.  In addition, players may elect to make one surge attack, where if one of their attacks is successful, after all other attacks are resolved, they may make one more attack to attempt to conquer another country.<br/><br/>Once all players have completed their decisions for the round, they reveal said decisions, deploy new units, and announce all attacks.  If there are any border clashes (two countries trying to attack each other), they are resolved first.  Battles are resolved using custom 12-sided dice.  There are multiple dice that are rolled relative to the army size.  Each die is numbered 1-6, but the distribution of numbers changes relative to the army size (eg. the larger the army, the more likely the die is to roll higher numbers).  Each player rolls the die, with the player rolling the lowest number losing a number of units relative to the smallest army (the larger the army, the more units lost per roll).  In the event of a tie on the die roll, both players reroll.  The battle is over once one attacking army in the border clash is eliminated.<br/><br/>After border clashes are resolved, mass invasions are resolved.  Mass invasions occur when multiple countries attack the same country.  This can be multiple armies from one player, or more than one.  Mass invasions are resolved the same as border clashes, the only difference being that, unlike border clashes where there is not a specific attacker, the attacking player wins ties.  Just like border clashes, the player who loses the roll also loses units relative to the smallest army size in the battle.  The mass invasion is completed when one of the armies is eliminated.<br/><br/>Invasions are then resolved, which are the same as mass invasions, but are only from one country to another.  After invasions are resolved, spoils of war are resolved.  Spoils of war occur when two or more players attack the same country in a mass invasion and multiple attacking armies remain.  Spoils of war are resolved like border clashes, where ties are resolved with a reroll.<br/><br/>After all attacks are resolved, players will resolve the surge attack they noted on their paper.  Surge attacks are resolved like invasions, or mass invasions if multiple players surge into country.  In the event of a successful mass invasion surge attack, the players resolve the conquest with a spoils of war.<br/><br/>Each round occurs the same as listed above, until one player finishes the round with a previously agreed upon control limit (60% control of countries, 80%, etc).  That player is the winner of Concurrent!<br/><br/>",

These phrases are known as wordners, and may make starter words plural, change their tense, and add other words to them.<br/><br/>The players submit their wordners on a piece of paper to the player on the judge's left, who reads them out loud. The judge selects his/her favorite, and the creator of this is awarded a point represented by the round's blue card.<br/><br/>Now, the player to the judge's left becomes the judge and a new round begins. The first player to collect 5 blue cards wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stavropol Bashni is a stacking game from the Checkers family. It features shared pieces. As in all Checkers games, the aim of the game is to leave the opponent without a legal move. It is played on a traditional 8x8 Checkers board with stones that are suitable for Bashni, i.e. stackable and with kings being turned men or pieces of a different color, as most traditional Russian sets are.<br/><br/>The rules follow Bashni. In short, when a man or king is captured, it is not taken from the board, but put under the piece which captures the men. This way, stacks are formed. Generally, to topmost of piece of a stack decides which player the stack belongs to, how the stack moves, it is the piece that is promoted on reaching a back rank, and it is the piece that is captured. If the topmost piece of a stack is captured and the next piece at the top belongs to the opponent, the stack switches allegiance and belongs to the opponent then.<br/><br/>The difference to Bashni is that pieyes are shared - as in Stavropol Checkers. A player may move stacks owned by the opponent, too, according to the rules for the topmost piece. The exact winning condition is therefor: a player loses when it is his turn and the stacks belonging to him have no  legal move.<br/><br/>Online play:<br/><br/>     igGameCenter<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The land of Nippon is riven by civil war and the leaders of the different factions have a number of secret missions they need carried out. As master of one of the four great Ninja clans you must train your warriors so they are ready to carry out the missions offered. But beware, if you take too long one of your rival clans may undertake a mission before you and steal the rich reward offered for carrying it out.<br/><br/>In Shinobi: Way of the Ninja, you control a ninja clan and must perform different missions in order to obtain wealth and win the game. The missions you are called on to carry out are represented by three Mission cards that will tell you what you need to do (the task), where the mission is to be carried out (the location), and what problems may arise that will hinder you in the missions execution (complications). Each of these things requires one or more Skill cards from your hand to overcome. For example, if the mission required the use of unarmed combat you would need to play that Skill card in order to carry it out.<br/><br/>Once you have collected all of the Skill cards you need you may carry out a mission and reap the rewards for your clan. Unfortunately you will rarely have the right cards in your hand to perform a mission straight away. Instead you will need to store cards from your hand for future use by placing cards face-down from your hand into one of two dojos you control. Storing cards in this way represents you training the ninjas in your clan to perform a mission.<br/><br/>Keeping track of the cards placed in each dojo is challenging as you are not normally allowed to examine the cards once they are placed. You must use your powers of concentration and memory to remember which cards you have placed so that you can use them when you are ready to carry out a mission. Although this is difficult at first, you will find that your mental abilities quickly sharpen and that you will become increasingly skilled at the game. This is as it should be: being the master of a ninja clan requires great mental fortitude, and Shinobi: Way of the Ninja will test it to the utmost. However, if you get completely stuck, you can always visit the sensei who will (at a cost) allow you to examine the cards you have placed.<br/><br/>You receive a reward for completing each mission in the form of gold. The harder a mission the more gold you will receive, but the more cards you will need to play to carry the mission out. At the end of the game the player who has amassed the largest fortune wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The time theme is very loosely pasted onto this game. The clocks used on the board and the cards could have just as easily been card denominations. This is a simple game of match.<br/><br/>A dealer/banker is assigned. Each player is dealt five cards face up. The dealer then deals one card face down on each of the 12 clocks on the board. In the first round of play the dealer turns up one of the twelve cards at a time. If a player has a matching card in one of his/her upturned five, then the player has to pay in the amount of chips/points indicated at that point on the board in large red letters. If the player has two matching cards, the player must pay double and so on. If the overturned card matches the time on the board at that spot, TIME is called and all payments are doubled. In this round all payments are made to the pot. After all twelve cards are overturned they are returned to the deck, reshuffled, and a fresh twelve are distributed to the twelve clock positions face down. The players keep their original five cards.<br/><br/>In the second round, as each of the twelve cards are overturned, payments are made to the players following the same rules as in round one. The rules do not explain the end of the game scenario. Nor do they explain if the rounds continue to alternate put/take. It is also unclear how many chips the players start with. It is suggested that the white chips equal 1, the yellow chips 2, the red chips 5 and the blue chips 10.<br/><br/>",

There are four pawns. Players take turns rolling the colour die. The active player moves a pawn of his/her choice to the next space of the colour on the die roll (all players can move all pawns). If a pawn lands on a yellow space, one of the twenty, randomly distributed face-down tiles has to be turned over. If it shows a picture from the board, the pawn is moved to the corresponding space. If the tile shows Notail Nogoodnik, it stays face-up and the player's turn is over.<br/>To get a pawn to the finish line, the spaces has to be reached exactly.<br/><br/>If all four player pawns reach the finish line, all players win together. If five tiles showing Notail Nogoodnik are turned over, they all lose together.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A post-apocalyptic vehicular combat game for 2 to 8 players.  It uses the quick setup and rapid play of a card game and combines it with the tactile and visual strategy and excitement of a miniatures game.  Nothing needs to be written down during play, it's a great way to introduce younger card game players to the world of miniature gaming.  Gameplay is normally 15-30 minutes and most players will understand the rules after their first game.  How many wargames can fit all their rules on a single sheet of paper?<br/><br/>ScrapIron is 100% Zombie Free!<br/><br/>Players each use a miniature vehicle as their playing piece.  The game was designed around the popular Hot Wheels and Matchbox lines but can be easily adapted to any size vehicle.<br/><br/>Players choose equipment from an Equipment Deck prior to the start of the game.<br/><br/>Action cards are chosen during the planning phase and placed face down.  Order if play is determined randomly and actions are then carried out in that order.<br/><br/>When damage is dealt, cards of the Damage Deck are given to the target player.  Damage cards will either assign Structural Damage to the vehicle, 10 points and the car is out of the game, or cause special effects.  These effects could cause the car to spin out and face a random direction, cause the player to lose Action cards or otherwise harm the target.<br/><br/>When the last car remains that player is the winner!  That did not take long, why not play again?<br/><br/>",

The 3-minute timer is begun and the players have that long to write down their definition of the word.<br/><br/>Scoring is determined the players voting for the &quot;best definition&quot; and points are awarded to the player with the most votes and the player with the best definition and the Blarney Master if no one votes for the correct definition.  The one with the most points gets a green Blarney stone to indicate such.  That ends a round; then the Blarney Master position passes to the next player.<br/><br/>On certain cards, one of the words has no meaning so is simply &quot;Blarney&quot; and the Master must make up a plausible definition.<br/><br/>The game ends after 10 rounds; the winner being the player with the most Blarney stones.<br/><br/>",
