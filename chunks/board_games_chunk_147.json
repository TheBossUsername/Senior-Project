Pirates raid the Island for slaves to sell in the slave markets. The other islanders have tasked you to protect their cities from Pirate attacks by building walled fortifications around their small Island cities. As a reward for the protection your fortifications provide, the first crewmember to fortify cities worth 100 points will be named King or Queen of Shipwreck Island.<br/><br/>Players draw Wall Segment Cards which allow them to place Wall Segment pieces on Wall Plans around their cities. They trade with other players for the wall Segment types they need, or draw from the Supply Station. Wall Plans are color coded so they must get the right type of Wall Segment to build on the needed segments for their cities. Players are dealt 3 City Defense plans at the beginning of the game and choose one as their starting city. They can build on their starting city or any city connected by one road to it.<br/><br/>They try to finish all the wall plans around a city to protect it from Pirate attacks. At the end of their turn, they roll to see if the Pirates attack their cities or what other actions may happen. If they are attacked, any any part of the city's Wall Plans are unfinished, wall segments are destroyed and must be rebuilt on the next turn.<br/><br/>Other rolls allow for moving the &quot;Island Army&quot; marker to protect a city from attacks, drawing extra cards, stealing a card from another player, or placing a wall segment piece.<br/><br/>Players may also purchase Reinforcement Cards which allow for extra building actions or protection from attacks.<br/><br/>Players score points after completing a city's defense plan. They move their scoring marker around the scoring track. The final round begins when one player passes 100 points. Each player gets one more turn to score points. The player with the most points after the final round wins and is declared King or Queen of Shipwreck Island.<br/><br/>",

Catch flies, claim lily-pads, build hat stands, hat shops, and haberdasheries, and trade goods at the driftwood market.<br/><br/>In Froggy Bazaar players play the part of a froggy merchant. They take turns moving around the floating market. They claim lily-pads and construct various shops. As the market expands, player options increase.<br/><br/>The game board consists a central driftwood market tile, surrounded by 8 lily-pad tiles. In each turn players 1) move their frog, 2) take either one or both actions on the tile that they moved onto. This can be a range of actions from building a shop on a lily-pad tile, to collecting resources from shops, or upgrading shops.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players collect river rocks which they place in a felt bag. As players achieve objectives (build or upgrade shops, collect hats, visit every tile) they achieve objectives (and collect more river rocks). The game ends when a player achieves their fourth objective. The player with the most river rocks wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guts &lsquo;N Glory is a World War II skirmish rules system for N-scale Miniatures.<br/><br/>This innovative system allows for faster game resolution taking into account troop quality, leadership, and moral. <br/>The game was designed to be a pleasing combination of playability and realism.<br/><br/>The heart of the game system is a fairly innovative concept (at least to historical gaming) that uses different dice rather than die modifiers. In most games, one type of dice is used and the &quot;success&quot; number for hitting a target, spotting a target or passing morale is determined by adding or subtracting a number from a base number. This forces the player to go through some mathematical calculations each time and the &quot;success&quot; number always changes. In Guts 'N Glory, the &quot;success&quot; number never changes. Instead, the dice you roll changes. <br/>For example, a successful morale check is made on a roll of a 4 or less. Veteran troops usually roll a 6-sided die to check morale (66% chance), but green troops roll a 10-sided die (40% chance). Of course, things happen to make troops more or less likely to pass that morale check. In Guts 'N Glory, these factors are taken into account by the use of &quot;die higher penalties&quot; or &quot;die lower bonuses.&quot; When checking morale, you put your finger on the &quot;dice hierarchy&quot; chart and move it to the right for each penalty and to the left for each bonus. No need to add/subtract modifiers&hellip;.No need to remember a different &quot;success&quot; number for every roll you make. <br/>For example, let's say a veteran fire team needs to take a morale check. There are enemy tanks visible to the fire team, they were under fire last turn and they are in cover. The enemy tanks and being under fire are both &quot;die higher penalties.&quot; The fact that the team is in cover is a &quot;die lower bonus. This yields a net result of one &quot;die higher&quot; penalty. The veteran fire team checks for morale by rolling an 8-sided die instead of the usual 6-sided die. The &quot;success&quot; number for a morale check is always a four or less. The use of this concept really speeds up play.<br/><br/>Guts 'N Glory only considers factors that are necessary to create a realistic simulation. We didn't deal with details that added complexity/realism at the expense of playability. For example, in Guts 'N Glory tank armor is classified as light, medium, heavy or very heavy. <br/>There are bonuses/penalties on the charts for sloped armor, side armor, rear armor and top armor. Also, if a tank is hit, you then check to see whether or not it was immobilized or put &quot;out of action.&quot; This is all any platoon commander needs to know anyway. Therefore a Tiger tank is still a tougher target than a Stuart tank, but we didn't create an overly complicated system to model this. No need to find out exactly where the round hit, exactly what systems were taken out, or which crewmember was killed.<br/><br/>Don't think that Guts 'N Glory is a beer and pretzels game though. <br/>It plays fast, but it rewards good tactics. It also punishes the player who makes tactical mistakes. <br/>The results are very realistic when compared with historical instances. <br/>Another concept that speeds play is the use of &quot;fire teams.&quot; Infantry are grouped in teams of 2-5 men. Three fire teams make up a squad. The troops are individually based on metal stands. The fire team stands are magnetic. This allows you to tailor your fire teams to the situation at hand. You can decide which weapons go with which team and your squad leader can be attached to any team you wish. The rules allow you to detach tank hunters as well. Squads generally were divided up into teams to execute real battle tactics. It speeds up the game considerably to allow you to move your men in similar teams. All members of a fire team direct their fire at the same target (with the exception of tank hunters&hellip;They need to be free to engage armored targets.) when they fire. This speeds up play and is very reasonable when compared with accounts of actual combat.<br/><br/>Guts 'N Glory uses an initiative system and special fire modes or orders that allow both players to exercise control over their troops at the same time. <br/>It is not an &quot;I go, you go&quot; system. <br/>This adds realism to the simulation. I must admit that it is the hardest part of the system to grasp, but the most rewarding. <br/>For example, veteran troops are easier to control than green troops. They have a better chance of gaining the initiative and have more special orders to give. This makes them more flexible to the changing battlefield environment. We believe that this is how it should be!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is both entertaining and designed to teach the lay person about the criminal justice system. The player will be taken through the court process, starting with bail hearings and lawyer's fees through to the trial and sentencing. Players will enjoy playing the roles of police officers, lawyers and Judges (sic). The winner of the game is the player with the most amount of money, but, he must also have the least number of criminal convictions.<br/><br/>Jailbait equipment consists of a board with crime squares, tokens for the various players, one die, Judge's dice, Jailbait money, small chips which are the players' conviction chips and 3 sets of cards&mdash;crime cards (which correspond to the various crime squares on the board), lawyer's fee/bail cards and pre-trial cards.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the person with the most amount of money after he purchases back all his conviction chips. The game may conclude at any time, simply purchase back the conviction chips and count your money. Alternatively, the game concludes when only two players are left playing.<br/><br/>This game was designed to follow the actual process of the Canadian Criminal Justice system as closely as possible within the framework of a game. There are many aspects and possibilities that arise within the court system which were impossible to include: however, the pertinent section of the Criminal Code of Canada has been noted in the glossary when appropriate to enable the player to obtain further information if he or she so desires by referring to that document. The United States glossary version will follow.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for.<br/><br/>The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp; white illustrations. <br/>The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The primary objective in introducing this product is that it should be both entertaining and educational - for every kind of Muslim.<br/><br/>As Muslims come from every geographical area, and from every different culture, we hope that Ikra gives all Muslims an appreciation for their different brothers and sisters, and helps each type address some of the problems specific to themselves as individuals. A few questions have been included in Ikra to show a contrast with Islam. This can initiate interesting discussion and can help us understand the place of Muslims in the world view at least a little more, insha-Allah. As such, there is something in Ikra for everybody!<br/>-In game summary<br/><br/>Ikra is a game where the goal is the reach the center of the board by answering 1 of 3 questions on a given card and moving a player token counter-clockwise. Questions are largely focused on Islamic teachings, culture, and history, with the addition of general science and geography questions included. Once the player does a full lap and ends on their &quot;ladder,&quot; they can answer a corresponding question to achieve that pillar of Islam and go up one rung. Game ends when a player is able to reach the Ka'aba in the center.<br/><br/>",

A Fortress consists of three Towers, each with 200 hit points, or Wall Points.  The first player to bring their opponent's Towers to 0 Wall Points each has breached the Fortress and won the game.<br/><br/>Commanders deploy Creatures as their main attack force, each with a set of Attack Points, Guard Points, and Health Points.  Creatures attack each other by comparing Attack Points to Guard Points, and the difference is dealt as damage to the weaker Creature's Health Points.  Creatures are placed on a Battlefield, a 3-by-2 grid that allows or restricts attacks depending on placement.  A Creature that has not been deployed the same turn, occupies a certain space on the Battlefield, and has no opposing Creatures directly in front of it, has a chance to directly attack the opposing Towers.<br/><br/>Commanders change the flow of the game with Sorcery cards, each with its own category and level that dictates their effectiveness.  Commanders equip weaponry in the form of Armory cards to their Creatures, modifying their effectiveness in the game.  And Commanders change field conditions with Field cards, granting advantages and disadvantages to Creatures depending on a variety of stats and classifications.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Splinter is an abstract strategy game for two players.  The object of the game is to knock out your opponent&rsquo;s king, rooks, bishops and pawns while protecting your own pieces from enemy attack.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 4 types of pieces &ndash; 1 king (star), 2 rooks (squares), 3 bishops (crosses) and 9 pawns (circles).  Play begins with the pieces arranged in a checkerboard pattern at the center of the board.<br/><br/>Choose a player to go first, then continue playing, alternating turns with your opponent.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may slide any one of your pieces one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally).  Any pieces that lie in the way (regardless of number, color or type) get pushed along, including off the board.  If a piece is pushed off the board, it is eliminated and is out of play for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>To avoid an infinite loop, you may not move any piece to a square that it vacated on your opponent&rsquo;s last turn.<br/><br/>A splinter occurs when one or more pieces become disconnected from the original group so that there are empty squares between those pieces and the original group.<br/><br/>Following a splinter, the largest group remains on the board and all other groups are removed.  If the groups are of equal size, the player who caused the splinter decides which group is removed.  If a piece is removed as a result of a splinter, it is eliminated and is out of play for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>Each time a player runs out of any type of piece (king, rook, bishop or pawn), the other player scores a knockout.  The first player to reach two knockouts wins the game.<br/><br/>Click here for official rules and diagrams: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://splinterboardgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/splinter-is-two-player-abstractstrategy.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://splinterboardgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/splinter-is-t...</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game is played on a playing field with a network of paths over which you move your pieces and on which you can set up bases. The player whose turn it is rolls 2 dice and can convert the points rolled into: Movement of the individual agents (1 dice point each), deployment of the robot (9 dice points), establishment of a base (6 dice points), air strike (10 dice points), air landing (12 dice points). In addition, it is possible to waive the dice roll and save additional dice points for an action in the next round.

The rule system is simple and easy to learn, yet sophisticated enough to allow &ldquo;realistic&ldquo; battles to be fought between a diverse range of medieval armies. It is easy to play, but more difficult to master.<br/><br/>One A4 Quick Reference Sheet is sufficient to contain all the information necessary to play. The Combat Results Tables can be printed or photocopied, cut and pasted together as required. The main rules need only be consulted when players are learning the rules, and occasionally thereafter, to clarify situations as they arise.<br/><br/>The precision of the movement system and the speed and efficiency of the combat system ensure that the game flows quickly and even a closely fought contest between two armies of 150 points can be concluded within 1&frac12; hours to 2 hours.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be played on modular hex terrain which can accommodate a range of different terrain features, e.g. open ground, hills and slopes, rivers, woods, impenetrable terrain etc. Larger terrain features can extend over a number of adjacent hexes. The terrain is an extremely important aspect of the rules, in that, it is of great strategical and tactical significance because of the way it influences movement, Command and Control, and combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Hits to the head = Disqualification.<br/><br/>As someone who has some experience in throwing cards, the speed element of this can make things pretty wild.

The Combat Results Tables can be printed or photocopied, cut and pasted together as required. There is a Quick Reference Sheet Generator on the website to enable players to quickly create and print the play sheet for a game between any fantasy armies contained in the army lists. The main rules need only be consulted when players are learning the rules, and occasionally thereafter, to clarify situations as they arise.<br/><br/>The precision of the movement system and the speed and efficiency of the combat system ensure that the game flows quickly and even a closely fought contest between two armies of 150 points can be concluded within 1&frac12; hours to 2 hours. This makes the system ideally suited for competitive and tournament play.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be played on modular hex terrain which can accommodate a range of different terrain features, e.g. open ground, hills and slopes, rivers, woods, impenetrable terrain etc.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All cards in play are placed face up, showing the built trios and the remaining cards.<br/><br/>In turn, each player will pick up a card from the deck: If an image card comes out, the following two movements are made:<br/>1- The card is used to make a trio or laid in the player's sector of the table to use it later and Exchange is made (mandatory). For this, an image card of one of the playmates is chosen and it is exchanged for an own image card (the one that has just been lifted or another). You cannot break a trio already built by another player. If an action card is drawn, only the action specified on it is done and the exchange is not made.<br/>Whenever one of these cards appears, it is played immediately.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player manages to assemble three different trios, that is, a trio of each type.<br/><br/>",

But hedgehogs are very slow creatures. And the other animals are growing impatient!  So one by one, the animals begin to push the hedgehogs along the forest floor, hoping to finish the race before tea time.<br/><br/>In this preschool game, each player picks their favorite hedgehog and lines it up at the beginning of the jungle track track.  A shuffled deck of animal cards, as well as the big and small animal disks, wait off to the side, cheering on the racers.  On your turn, flip over the top animal card and find the matching animal disk. Then use that animal to push the hedgehogs further along the track, but only as far as the canopy!  As more and more animals crowd in behind the little hedgehogs, they'll get shoved, pushed, and jostled further and further down the field until one unlikely hedgehog pops out the other end of the racetrack and is declared the winner.  If it's your hedgehog, you win!<br/><br/>Safari Sprint features all real world plants and animals that can be found in the Greater Rift Valley of Africa.  The language free cards display each animal's range, size, and diet.

As a Hider you are randomly dealt a bean. It might be a silent bean, but it also might be one of the farting kind.  Everyone starts at a predetermined base, then presses the button on their bean and runs off to hide while the Seeker closes their eyes and counts.<br/><br/>While you try to hide, your bean may be unable to control itself and continuously let out little farts and giggles.  Or you may have a silent bean.  Either way, try to get back to base without being tagged by the Seeker.  If the Seeker tags you before you get back to base, they'll collect your bean.  If you make it back safely, you can exchange your bean for its matching score card.<br/><br/>Once all players have been tagged or returned to base, the round ends and each player earns points based on how well they did that round.  The Seeker earns points for any beans they collected (silent beans are worth more than loud ones).  Seekers earn points for any card they collected (loud bean cards are worth more than silent ones).  Continue playing until each player has had a turn as the Seeker, adding up the points you earn each round, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Besides being possible to recreate the endless struggle of Protestants against Catholics in Flanders, we will be able to transport ourselves to the Christian border with the Ottoman Empire, to the Russian steppes or even to the early conquest of America.<br/><br/>As with Tercios, there is a complete version of the game Liber Militum (forthcoming) and a lighter one, Brevis Editio. The Brevis Editio is fully functional and fully compatible with the other, the rules are the same. Only additional content is added in the Liber Militum: Encamisada<br/><br/>Factions: In the Liber Militum version it will be possible to choose a Faction for our company. In doing so, the rules of each one will be applied to us, with restrictions and benefits. There are a significant number of Factions, giving us great freedom of customization.<br/><br/>Campaign: Probably the most attractive addition is the possibility of playing in campaign. Different alternative methods are added to manage it with sample maps.<br/><br/>Progression: We have a system of evolution by experience for campaigns, with which we can improve our Captain and the Company.<br/><br/>Scenarios: In the full version we have several extra scenarios: shooting cannons, ambushes or assaults in which civilians participate are some of them.<br/><br/>Multiplayer: Rules are provided for more than two players, including special scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Apocalypse Zombie Core Set is a miniature skirmish game set in the zombie apocalypse. The outbreak has spread throughout the world while many people thought it was a hoax. Before the world realized that it was indeed happening it was too late.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse Zombie you have two ways to play. First is quick battles that allow you to choose a character, select a mission, set up, and play. It is a fast, fun, and bloody intro into the game. The second is the campaign. In campaign mode, you are tasked with performing missions to gather supplies, rescue survivors, upgrade home base and kill boss zombies. Campaigns can last as long as you want. With 14 Missions each with variable set up and more coming the carnage can be long lasting or short and sweet. You can &ldquo;win&rdquo; just by killing the Butcher Zombie and saying you have settled the area enough to prosper. Or you can trudge the blood to new bosses, new buildings, and increase the scope of the world.  You may use either pre- made characters for fast entry into the unforgiving world. Or you can create your own character to level and guide through the world.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Zombie is played with a player turn followed by the zombie turn. Zombies are pretty much automated - reacting to sight or sound. This allows for all players to be on the same side and fight and die together. Apocalypse Zombie does have options for those more combative players that bring player vs player into the game. Zombie Abilities can hinder or severely damage your attempts to survive. Players have the choice of being sneaky or going in guns blazing. It really depends on your play style.<br/><br/>Combat is done with rolling attack dice to see if you hit. Defense works the same way. Hit Points are tracked with Heart Tokens.<br/><br/>Searching is done the same way. Each building has its own search deck in Zombie Apocalypse. So searching the Clinic will give you different results then searching the Cabin.<br/><br/>So how about those Zombies? Well the first boss, the one that comes in the core set, is the Butcher. He is big ugly and hard to kill. You must face him in the Butcher Shop. Players should not attempt this until they are truly prepared. Along with the Butcher you get 18 Shamblers. Slow, pesky zombies that can put your survivors in a bind. Next you get 6 Brute Zombies. These big boys will ruin your day real quick.<br/><br/>",

The slime slowly begins to ooze from the syringe.  Taking turns, the Interrogators quickly draw a card and read the question aloud to their teammate.  If they answer correctly, the Interrogator gets to move the crane into position over the other team's Subject.  Play continues in this manner until one player ends up with a face full of slime.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player selects a frog and places the frog joker of the same color into his mini pond.<br/><br/>In turn, players try to let their frog jump into the pond with the help of the seesaw. Before you let your frog jump, you may adjust the position of the game box at your discretion. You can also decide to play a trial round and to agree on the number of jumps that a player can take on his turn to succeed. If you manage to make your frog jump into the pond, you may either draw a booty tile or select one from the pond to put into your own pond. A tile that does not fit or for which there is no room, is put back. Once in the game you can use your Theo joker and swap it for a tile that you need, albeit not for one of the last two missing tiles. If you are first to fill your pond completely, you win.<br/><br/>Theo Teichh&uuml;pfer is part of the Ene Mene Muh series, designed as first games for toddlers, and is a very nice dexterity game; the tiles in the pond are double-sided and easily distinguished by shape and image - fishes are oval, mussels are circular and water lilies rectangular; so, for selecting a suitable tile in the Selection variant is very easy. The seesaw works well, and the pond holes are big enough.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each ninja has different abilities and should play strategically to win the game.The game can be played by two or four players.<br/><br/>The armies are placed on the tableau opposing each other.<br/>Behind each army their own treasure is protected. <br/>Each unit has its own way of movement and attack.<br/>Units unlike Chess do not occupy the space of the fallen enemy, but stay in the space that they attacked. All but one unit, move horizontally and vertically only. ​<br/><br/>Each army is consisted by 7 different units:<br/><br/>     7x Ashigaru - The most basic unit which moves 1 space horizontally or vertically. It can attack in one direction.<br/>     2x Double Edge - This unit can move 3 spaces and attack simultaneously on its front, left and right.<br/>     2x Monkey - This unit can move 3 spaces in any direction they like and then attack an enemy in left, right, front or back direction.<br/>     1x Cannon - This unit can move 1 space in any direction. This unit attacks the 3 spaces in a line. On attack this unit fires a cannon ball that hits all the targets, friendly or not.<br/>     1x Rope - This is the only unit that can move diagonally. It moves as many spaces it likes and attacks only diagonally one adjacent space.<br/>     1x King - This unit is the most liked. It can move 1 space in any direction but it can shoot its valistra and assassinate any enemy unit occupying a space up to 3 spaces in front of the King.<br/>     2x Wall - This unit is indestructible. It can move 1 space in any direction and also blocks all cannonballs and valistra arrows.<br/><br/><br/>Once again, to win, a player should eliminate all enemy units or put a unit on the space occupied by the enemy treasure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

We have endeavoured to offer an in-depth game system with the focus on realism, but the system we have developed is easy to learn and games flow well.<br/><br/>As a 1:1 system the models you have on the tabletop represent the exact troops and vehicles. The majority of other game systems use a more abstract method where one unit actually represents several, or where entire units are modelled on a single base and dealt with as a whole. We found that our method provides a more accurate and realistic impression of real warfare.<br/><br/>By focusing our game on realism we have found that real-world tactics work just as well on the tabletop and we highly recommend reading the fantastic range of WWII tactics books published by Osprey.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence:<br/><br/>     Check Universal Morale<br/>     Resolve Battlefield Effects<br/>     Movement Phase<br/>     Firing Phase<br/>     Close Assault Phase<br/>     Re-organisation Phase<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Diamond Heist features fun art, a relaxing theme, and elegant gameplay all packaged together for decades of family fun.<br/><br/>The game starts by selecting one of the many unique characters. Each turn, players roll dice, and must decide whether they want to lock in their arsenal of guns, knives, bulletproof vests, pickpocket action, or take a chance and re-roll. Vests block guns, and helmets block knives. Each unblocked attack allows the player to steal a diamond from the opposing player. To add additional strategy, players must balance doing direct damage, and building up cash reserves. Cash can be spent on each player's character ability, which ranges from stealing mass amounts of diamonds, to blocking certain damage types, to swapping 2 players' dice.<br/><br/>Players can save up if they roll Bonus Cash, to spend on their character speciality. Players must balance short term and long term rewards for building up cash. Then, players battle it out with their selected arsenal, stealing as many diamonds and as much cash as they can.<br/><br/>Diamond Heist relies on easy to learn, but hard to master strategies with a cast of interesting characters to keep gameplay fresh. Manage your strategy with 4 competing players, to be able to steal diamonds when they are vulnerable.<br/><br/>Diamond Heist keeps things new, fun and challenging by including a selection of 18 different characters. Combinations of these creates numerous matchup possibilities, each with their own strategy to consider.<br/><br/>In this game, there are a lot of things to pay attention to.  You must make decisions whether you will keep a guaranteed dice roll, or risk it to try to get something better. Players will need to weigh whether they want to steal cash to use their special abilities, or steal diamonds to add to their Offshore Accounts. Another tough decision will be whether to spend your cash for short term gains, or save up for a larger impact special ability. In 3 and 4 player games, you may need to team up and form alliances with other players, while making sure you have enough defenses such that you don&rsquo;t get backstabbed yourself!<br/><br/>",

Yet, some break their programming. Mega-City One has been hit with two major robot-related conflicts. The first was initiated by the rogue 'Call-me-Kenneth' unit. A bloody campaign of extermination against the 'Fleshy Ones' ensued. The second was precipitated by the arch-criminal Nero Narcos, who unleashed hordes of Assassinator Droids in his bid to seize control of Mega-City One.<br/><br/>Despite these incidents, robots continue to be an indispensable part of Mega-City life. With Mega-City One's population decimated by recent events the presence of robots as a tireless workforce has become ever more important.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A hole in the crowd&hellip; a big, fat zero.<br/><br/>There are some criminal investigations that require intelligence gathering, where the presence of a uniformed Judge brandishing a Lawgiver is not appropriate. For these activities the Justice Department has formed an undercover division known informally in the Department as the &lsquo;Wally Squad&rsquo;. These Judges adopt civilian garb and move amongst the street life of Mega‐City One always on the lookout for leads on criminal activity. If required, they will infiltrate gangs and criminal organisations on highly dangerous undercover missions. Activities like these are abhorrent to most Street Judges who tend to view their Wally Squad colleagues as necessary &lsquo;oddballs&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Whilst some undercover operations can be concluded in a short time, dedicated squad members have been known to spend years on a case, all the time maintaining a false identity. There is a danger in such deep cover that some Wally Squad members, such as the infamous Lenny Zero, have had their outlook and life values completely changed. Their beliefs have been sequestered by the roles they are playing, and many have &lsquo;gone rogue&rsquo; working out of sight, but not out of mind, of the Justice Department. A Judge gone rogue can become the most dangerous of criminals.<br/><br/>Here we present three of the most infamous members of the Wally Squad.<br/><br/><br/>     Dirty Frank: Originally a respected Street Judge, Frank now appears to be a deeply unhygienic lunatic living in &lsquo;Low Life&rsquo;, the Mega-City One&rsquo;s most crime-ridden area.<br/>     Jack Point: A deep cover Wally Squad Judge, Jack is a follower of the Church of Simpology. Despite this, Jack is an effective and dangerous operative.<br/>     Aimee Nixon: An &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade cadet, Nixon joined the Wally Squad and was mentored by Dirty Frank.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now you must begin the incredible journey that lies ahead, mustering every ounce of strength and willpower you have left, with one goal in mind ... staying alive.<br/><br/>Players travel a modular tile map to reveal uncharted areas, acquire resources, and build necessary items needed to outlast nature's harshest elements. Over the course of eight rounds, an event-driven scenario containing mission-critical objectives force players to wisely manage their precious inventories and prized possessions. These objectives must be completed by the end of the eighth round in order for players to be victorious.<br/><br/>Journey's Edge features strictly strategic gameplay, with hardly any luck (or dice). At each player's disposal is a deck of action cards that are used to move their character across the board to gather food, wood, stone, and fur, which can then be spent to create items like clothing and shelter. They must manage these limited resources carefully and work together as a team to determine the best course of action. To succeed, no one can be left behind.<br/><br/>Discover enchanted locations. Gather valuable resources. Craft useful tools and weapons. Encounter deadly creatures and monsters, and uncover magical artifacts that will assist you in your quest at Journey's Edge. Odds are against you, but perhaps your fate is not sealed. As part of a team of seasoned expeditionists, you know what must be done. The question is, will it be enough to ensure your survival?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Because you choose which workers and markets to use within each game, the strategies in each game will change.

Assemble a team of workers that allow you to access unique special abilities.<br/><br/>Medley: A unique blended game experience that combines the worker placement in Trading Cards with the trick-taking aspects of Tricks of the Trade. As you play a worker placement phase, you will also draft from the available cards which can be played to tricks in the trick-taking phase.<br/><br/>Trading Cards and Medley also feature AI opponents for a solitaire game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was chaos at first, but, for the most part, the mega hives a have started to create some stability. The United Sol Colonies, or U.S.C. for short (who this expansion is focused on), are doing their part to bring structure (or structures =P) to the system. They are currently building a network of space stations that all Replicants may have access to, provided they follow a few simple rules:<br/><br/><br/>     No fighting on the space stations.<br/>     Use the rooms you need to and move on, so others may use them too.<br/>     Help build additions to the stations you visit.<br/>     Everyone must spend their own resources to activate functions they wish to use.<br/>     Stay out of other hives&rsquo; lockers.<br/><br/><br/>In the U.S.C. Expansion you will pick your favorite hive and join the effort to make the system a better place for all Replicants.<br/><br/>Game play, for the most part, is similar to the core game (which is required to play the expansion.)<br/><br/>Like in the core game, you will deal out a resource grid each round, and place your drones to collect resources. But between those two phases, you now have a Station phase. During the Station phase, you will get to move your two personnel around the station to access the functions of the different rooms. Room functions consist of things like: build new rooms, resource discounts when leveling up new replicants, buying points, and more.<br/><br/>After the Drone phase, you still spend the resources you produced or gained to level up your Replicants. However, instead of discarding any unused resources from your hand at the end of the round, you now send them off to your locker on the space station. Once resources are in your locker, you may not use them for leveling up your replicants, but they can be used for activating any functions on the station.<br/><br/>",

Then, with the Emperor on his deathbed and the Turks harassing the frontier, you must launch your bid for the throne and defeat your rivals on the battlefield to become EMPEROR.<br/><br/>Emperor! has a unique two-phase feature. In phase one players move around a map of the city collecting money, military units and characters to build up their faction. Then, in phase two, the board flips over to the battle phase. Players cash in their cards and sets to build their armies. These are deployed face-down on the battle map. Players then select tactical cards (outflank, charge! etc) for their army and combat is resolved.<br/><br/>Emperor! is card-based with no dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For the Homeworld is designed around the simple concepts of &ldquo;Full Thrust&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babylon 5: A Call to Arms&rdquo; that got people back into playing Starship Combat games. We also need enough depth to make the games play out like your favorite Science Fiction Shows. We had a lot of success from 2004-2010 between the Babylon 5, Noble Armada and Starfleet license that Mongoose Publishing had. So like me, you might have a closet full of Starship Miniatures that you would like to interact with each other.<br/><br/>Included in the game are rules and weapons to make it &quot;multi-verse&quot; for your own IP, but also includes ready to go Generic Ships and Lists if you want to play in our Universe. In addition to the Data Cards you can photo copy out of the rulebook, we also have Generic Starship Cards you can download here and on our website. Sized to conveniently be the size of a playing card so you can slip them into a conventional card sleeve with a backing card.<br/><br/>Some of the basics are a basic distance movement value, to keep it simple. But to add some tactical flare, there are both Arcs of fire on weapons - as well as - Arcs where the Hull value on a ship differs (the sides or the rear usually).<br/><br/>As a gamer I have really enjoyed the break from reality that Starship Combat games offer. Working on the &quot;Wolf 359 Combat Simulator&quot; for Last Unicorn Games in the early 2000's, and later with Mongoose in their playtesting and development of the (3) &quot;A Call to Arms&quot; games. It is my hope that through modern production technology, I can bring these rules to life and you can join me in enjoying this sort of Non Electronic Tabletop Wargame.<br/><br/>This will be our 3rd self-published release, and I hope you will join us in playing it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To win, you&rsquo;ll have to successfully assemble all the components needed to build the best houses: Lots, Financing, an Architect and Materials. You&rsquo;ll also need to add some custom features that buyers want, such as a swimming pool or sun deck.<br/><br/>During the game, you&rsquo;ll compete for the above components and features by playing hands of 3-card poker. However, since this is a friendly competition, the &ldquo;pots&rdquo; are not winner-take-all. Instead, the winner of a round will gain two components, while his/her opponent will gain one &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the winner&rsquo;s decision. Close attention to your needs and your opponent&rsquo;s needs is required. Your goal is, ideally, to build each house with the same level of components: fair, good, better, best; this is not always easy. Additionally, land in the Tri-Valley is a bit scarce, so you&rsquo;re limited to five housing starts. Also, card management in the form of &ldquo;what to play now and what to save for later&rdquo; is an important factor in winning the game.<br/><br/>This is the second game in a series using the 3CP Game Engine, which employs custom cards and a deck of standard playing cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Print &amp; Play cards available in Files section.<br/>     Professionally produced card deck available at thegamecrafter.com SOON.<br/><br/><br/>",

During a battle, players play out a facedown dragon and then the players reveal. The type and number of the dragon will determine the winner of that battle.<br/><br/>What separates this game from simple rock-paper-scissors randomness is the powers of each dragon. Fire dragon powers focus on scoring more points in certain scenarios, Ice dragon powers focus on revealing information and trading cards, and Water dragon powers focus on exchanging cards from hand with those in the draw pile. Throughout the game, you may find your strategies evolving as you learn your opponent's tendencies and patterns, and as they learn yours as well.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches a certain amount of points at the end of a round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This volume contains &ldquo;ship cards&rdquo; for the rule set Coal &amp; Guns!. In order to play with them you need the basic rulebook.<br/><br/>Coal &amp; Guns! is a three-dimensional tactical naval wargame for the era of the so-called &quot;Pre-Dreadnought&quot;.<br/><br/>Above all, it wants to be a very simple and fast way to arrange on the table some models of those picturesque ships that marked the transition period between sailing ships and warships as we know them today.<br/><br/>It was a short period of only a few tens of years, between the end of the 19th century and the very first years of the 20th century (conventionally from 1880 to 1905), but which, from a technical point of view, was literally upset by new inventions or applications that followed one another at a frenzied pace.<br/><br/>The intensive use of steam energy, the construction of increasingly efficient breech-loading guns, the production of enhanced explosives, the invention of the electric motor and the radio, the use of torpedoes, the continuous development of steel armor and aiming devices are just incredible examples of applied technology that changed the way of waging war at sea in those few years.<br/><br/>The shipbuilding industry, of course, had to keep up and in less than half a century they passed from sailing ships to battleships, through a series of intermediate stages that made the obsolescence of the projects very rapid.<br/><br/>All this caused the flourishing of projects among the most imaginative and disparate that have ever been seen, with ships that were a synthesis, with different shades, between the pomp and romanticism of sailing ships and the solid reality of steel, the dirt of coal and the cold effectiveness of modern technologies.<br/><br/>Those vessels, especially in the bright pre-war colors, with white or black hulls, wooden decks, light or ocher superstructures, bright yellow chimneys, red or green keels, gold finishes, were a triumph of Art Nouveau style applied to instruments of death, often destined to be torn apart by the cannon fire of opponents who are perhaps less attentive to aesthetics but with the most advanced technology.<br/><br/>From a wargame point of view, playing with these ships is very interesting, because they are often very different from each other and because, despite being equipped with powerful guns, they did not fight at unimaginable distances on the gaming table.<br/><br/>The individual ships of the different nations, even within the same fleet and the same category, have great differences between them in terms of armament and armor, so the game can become quite varied and exciting.<br/><br/>Here, on a 180 x 120 cm table you can use models in 1: 2400 or 1: 1500 scale, in order to allow a good representation of the ships involved.<br/><br/>Coal &amp; Guns! is very simple and intuitive and the heart of the system lies in the &ldquo;status&rdquo; cards of the ships.<br/><br/>Drawing free inspiration from the very nice Brigade Models steampunk rules Imperial Skies, we tried to create a very linear and pleasant game system, but with rational mechanisms that, even in a few rules, aim to give you the flavor of that way of fighting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One player takes on the role of Katsuhisa, a businessman who grew a large company, and his daughter, Kumiko, whom he left the management decisions to when he grew older.  However, Kumiko thought her father's ideas were not for the modern times and changed many company policies, which made Katsuhisa furious.  Through their roles and Chairman and President, the two set the stage for a proxy fight at the next shareholders' meeting.<br/><br/>The game takes place over several rounds as each player tries to woo the shareholder for the round, such as the institutional investors or the employee stock ownership plan, over to their side.<br/><br/>Each shareholder to be courted presents a number of shares (victory points) and some conditions for the current round, such as determining the trump suit.  In addition to the cards for playing the tricks, each player has a hand of &quot;Proposal Cards&quot; which represent the policy proposal they are using to win the shareholder's votes, and these have game effects, such as reversing the ranks of cards or making certain suits worth negative points.<br/><br/>After a volley of proposals, the two players complete a series of tricks and evaluate who earned more points in the current round.  The winner collects the shareholder and their votes, represented by their number of shares.  The player with the most votes at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Of the original crew only myself and three others survived the trial. We were saddened by the loss of our brothers and sisters at sea, yet somehow smiles found us again as we finally stepped upon the shores of an uncharted desert island. The island was just rich enough with fresh water and resources to support the four of us. After years on the island, we missed our old life so much, that we came up with this game to remind us of who we once were. Other than our bones, it is all that remains of a life that once was.&quot;<br/><br/>Black Flags is a competitive table-top game which uses a unique rondel system, story telling, dice rolling, and narrative choice to transport players to a fantasy world of piracy, commerce, and nautical adventure.<br/><br/>Players take turns in clockwise fashion until a player takes the last gold coin from the bank.

        "description": "The object of Sirocco is to move the 6 pawns to the diagonally opposite field which is marked by a bar in your own color. On the way, you must try to take as many pawns from your opponents as you can. Since captured pawns from opponents have more value than your own pawns which have been brought into the opposite goal, the pursuit of the opponent is the hallmark of sirocco.<br/><br/>Each player receives 6 pawns in one color, which he places on the starting space of the same color. <br/>One throws in turn (clockwise) and advances one of his pawns the number of points thrown.<br/>One's own pawns and those of opposing players may be jumped over. The grey dots form the neutral starting space. pawns of the opponent may not be knocked over in this space.<br/><br/>Important: You must first move all 6 pawns from the grey neutral space into the green playing field (= onto the green lines) before you can make a move or capture with a pawn that is already in the green space.<br/><br/>Once all pawns have been moved into play (i.e., no pawn may be on the starting spot, base, or on the gray dots), one may move into the playing field. On the playing fields, players move from point to point, provided they are connected by lines. It is not possible to move an opponent's pawn on red-bordered spots, because these spots are protected. One may move one's own pawn back, but one may not return to one's own neutral square.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has lost all his pawns or has moved them into the base (= the large colored circle). Each player then counts the points he has scored. <br/>The following points are scored: - captured pawn of an opponent <br/><br/>     Captured pawn of an opponent: 3 points.<br/>     own pawn in the opposite corner: 2 points<br/>     A pawn of your own that is already in the neutral opposite field but not yet in the base: 1 point<br/><br/><br/>Pawns which are still in the playing field at the end of the game have no value. The player who scores the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Extend the experience by reading the documentary booklet that presents the 66 themes of the game.<br/><br/>The master of the game shows a card at random and hides the speed indication with his index finger.<br/>The player who is asked to guess where he should place the card: is the object slower, faster or the same speed as one of the cards already on the table?  The player being questioned has 3 possibilities, but only one possible answer. With each turn, the game becomes more complicated, as the number of cards increases and the range of possibilities becomes wider and wider.<br/><br/>When a player make a mistake, he holds the card in front of him. When he have 5 cards (2 to 3 players) or 3 cards (4 players), he is eliminated from the game.

The boat parades. The Pandemic. The Cancel Culture. The Riots. Left-wing Globalists. The Laptop!!<br/>Such Fun!!<br/><br/>And let's not forget the cheating. Mail-in ballot cheating. Poll watcher cheating. Dead guys voting in droves!<br/><br/>Can the Incumbent president navigate public opinion, the Main-Stream-Media and win the swing votes he needs? Can he get them back after they've been stolen?<br/><br/>Swing State Steal is a premium quality product and the perfect consolation gift for the disheartened Republican.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>One player is the incumbent president, the other players represent swing states controlled by the opposite party.  The president is playing against all other players in the quest to collect votes.  Each state collects votes in their own color and the president is collecting votes in each of the opponent's colors.  At the end of the game, the president compares his collected votes with each of the states and whoever has more wins that state.  President needs to win a majority of the states to win the election.<br/><br/>The board is organized in four rounds:  The Campaign Round represents the time from the beginning of the year until election day, the Election day round, After the Polls Close and finally the Challenge Round.  First round is two laps, all other rounds are one lap.  Players roll a die to advance.<br/><br/>First three rounds are about collecting and stealing votes from the incumbent.  Any player can land on a Fake News space that has a story from the headlines (maybe) and an opportunity to take or give votes away.  Swing states can land on a Cheat space where they draw a cheat card.   The president can land on an Evidence space where he collects evidence cards for the final round.<br/><br/>States use Cheat cards to steal votes.  They are color coded and organized by rounds.  Green cheats (Campaign) are mail-in cheats, Blue (Election Day) are polling place cheats and Purple (After Polls Close) are big-time cheats.<br/><br/>The final round represents the weeks between Nov 3 and Jan 6 and is a card games.  The president presents evidence cards he has collected and the State have to play cheat cards they've played that match and return some votes.<br/><br/>On Jan 6th, the end of the game, is when all of the votes are tallied and a winner declared.<br/><br/>",

Featuring full rules for ship-based games, this expansion expands on how you can craft your cinematic horror tales.<br/><br/>The USS Australis has a dark and lurid past. Technically, the ship is owned by Dr. Ethan De'Graw, but over the last decade it has been used by the research division from several of the corporations that Dr. Ethan has business dealings with. These partners have used it for anything from shipping to experimentation in international waters.<br/><br/>Whether the characters are waking up in surprise or spending the weekend on a school funded trip, they have found themselves on the research vessel the USS Australis. Now, they must try to survive whatever is lurking below decks or just under the surface of the water.<br/><br/>This supplement is designed to be used with the Black Site Studio 'USS Australis' kit but is easily replaced with a desert island or old run-down dock. The expansion includes a full re-hash of all the core DLB scenarios with a nautical twist!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>This expansion adds an 18-page nautical expansion booklet, 1 Captain Erasmus Drake Hero miniature, 1 Deep One Killer miniature, 4 resin egg markers, 4 new items and weapons, and associated Character and Visage sheets to the base game.<br/><br/>",

Control various mages as they seek to learn from the magical world and, ultimately, control it.<br/><br/>What makes Arcana Resurgence unique is the usage of Mage permanents as a means of using spells and relics. Unlike traditional deckbuilding games, players are limited in the amount of cards they can directly use. In order to cast spells or create relics, a player needs not only the right resources, but a Mage available to use it.<br/><br/>Additionally, Mages provide their own resource outside of mana: Intelligence. In the process of opening their eyes to the world of magic, these individuals have also expanded their minds to both the schools of science and the arcane. Once per turn, each Mage may focus their knowledge towards creating a non-magical Relic or &quot;Spell&quot;. However, some Mages are wiser than others, allowing them to create more complex and powerful Relics without spending mana.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Cards count as both money and track, so finding the balance between investing too much and investing too little can be a fine line to walk.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players choose an available action from their action cards. After performing the action, players must flip over that card to a different action. Players can auction a share, build track, or call dividends.<br/><br/>While auctioning and calling dividends are pretty straightforward, building track can get tricky. Along with building track to increase the value of their company, players may also build junctions that pivot into other company's track lines.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players get money equal to each company's most profitable line multiplied by the shares in that company they own. The most money wins.<br/><br/>Card Rails Junction is a standalone game in the Card Rails line.<br/><br/>",

Some games are more dexterity based - such as roll a putty ball into a supplied table top skee-ball like ramp to score points. Others are more on the creative side - such as trying to guess what someone else's sculpture is while holding it behind your back.<br/><br/>What does a player do on their turn - roll dice, pick a card?<br/><br/>The person (or team) whose turn it is picks one of the 25 cards randomly with the mini game, and that card dictates the terms of the that round and winning criteria for that round (tallest stack, most pins knocked down, one chosen by judge, etc). All of those mini games involve doing something with the putty. Depending on the card criteria also is whether players (teams) need to take turns or if it is simultaneous action. Once the winning criteria on the card is satisfied, that person (or team) wins that mini game and can move their scoring token on their score track.<br/><br/>A couple examples of these mini games - One has them use a sand timer and see who can make little cubes of putty and create the largest stack of cubes (without pressing them together to make them stick) in the sand timer length. Winner is one with largest stack of cubes.<br/><br/>The game ends, and player (or team) wins when one player (or team) wins 6 of of the mini games.<br/><br/>Gamebox includes<br/>4 Tins Putty (all different colors)<br/>Score track boards<br/>Score track tokens<br/>Sand timer<br/>&quot;coin&quot; token<br/>Cardboard obstacles for certain challenges<br/><br/>     cardboard bowling pins<br/>     little cornhole boards (2)<br/>     golf green<br/>     Skeeball - like ramp<br/><br/><br/>",

The Numbers Game consists of four sets of 20 cards. Each set has a set of numbers running from 1 to 20. The goal of the game is to collect one set of 20 cards. However, the cards may only be added to your collection in ascending order, if you first pick a number-1 card, or in descending order, if you first pick a number-20 card.<br/>The player who first completes a full 1-20 row wins the game.<br/><br/>The numbers on the cards have been photographed on the streets of cities around the world, from house numbers to traffic signs and commercial signage. Paul Baarss sharp eye for graphic candor resulted in a collection of thousands of street graphics depicting numbers. For this game, he selected 80 striking numbers in surprising settings from his large collection.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Visit a bygone Hagen, Hagen in 1888, one year after it became an independent city in Germany. On this &quot;dice walk&quot; through the city, you can visit thirteen historical places, many of which are still in the same place today, while others have changed structure significantly and some have moved locations or disappeared.<br/><br/>In Hagen 1888, you want to visit a variety of locations, but ideally you can reach the right locations at the right time to score more points than others. On a turn, you roll the six-sided die, then either bank those movement points or roll again; if you roll again and get a result higher than your first roll, you bank the sum of the two rolls; if your second roll is equal to or lesser than the first roll, you bank no movement points this turn.<br/><br/>Next, you can move your figure on the game board, which depicts a network of walkways. Most spaces on the walkways are gray, but the board has twelve lettered building spaces in six colors as well as the Rathaus (town hall) in a seventh color. If you start on a building, you must move; otherwise movement is optional. One point of movement takes you to an adjacent space on a walkway.<br/><br/>If you end your movement on a lettered building (which must differ from where you started), you can place one of your eight tokens in the lowest open space on the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board for that letter.<br/><br/>If you end your movement at the Rathaus, you remove your figure from the game board and place it on a 4-point space in the Rathaus section of the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board. On each subsequent turn, you no longer move your figure, but instead you may spend 6 movement points to raise a previously placed token in a letter column to the first open space higher in that column; alternatively you can spend 12 points to move it up two spaces. Once you are in the Rathaus, to end your turn, place one of your eight tokens on a 1-point space in the Rathaus.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you must have fewer than 8 movement points banked. Once a player has placed all eight of their tokens on the Hagen points board, the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players score the points listed next to their placed tokens, in addition to 1 point per 4 banked movement points and 3 points for each color of building in which they have a token, with a maximum color bonus of 21. Whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. <br/>A ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.<br/><br/>The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.<br/><br/>This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1861 to 1865, the American Civil War. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.<br/><br/>In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de gr&acirc;ce. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chits, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry manoeuvres and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>Your role will be that of a brigadier in the Confederate or Union armies, commanding a brigade of troops. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in-Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.<br/><br/>So onwards, to glory! And, off course: have fun!<br/><br/>This product contains one rulebook and two commander dice.<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Collect gemstones (and Runes) fight monsters<br/><br/>&quot;You live alone in an underground cave where you keep your precious stash of gemstones. The thing is, dwarves are quite greedy when it comes to gems so every day you go adventuring for more, and if you are lucky you might also find Rune Stones; Runes, it is said, give you magical abilities.  Of course adventuring in dungeons can be dangerous. They say that there are zombies, skeletons&quot;<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect as many Gems (&amp; Runes) as possible. The dwarf-players move around the board using two six-sided dice, and each square they land upon means that something happens e.g. take a Fight card, find a gem etc. Runes confer extra skills such as - Speed, Resistance to Curses and Luck etc. They also have a points value at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The winner of the games is the player who has the most gems and runes when all the gems have been given out.<br/><br/>",

Your job is to drive tourists across the savannah where they may take photos of animals.<br/><br/>The Mara consists of face down tiles where only the habitat color is known, not the animal symbol. The players take turns to either pick up/drop off tourist cards at lodges or to drive their jeeps and peek at adjacent tiles. The more tourists they have, the less drive actions can they take.<br/><br/>If both color and symbol matches a tourist on picked up card, the player takes a photo by placing a gem on the tourist.<br/><br/>Each tourist has a favourite animal and each animal has its favourite habitat. When all the tourists have been picked up or all the animals have been photographed, the game ends and the player with the most complete sets of animal photos wins.<br/><br/>The Mara combines child-friendly mechanics like deduction, memory and pick-up and delivery with a healthy dose of randomness to provide a fun experience for the entire family. Animal cards tell you where on the map the animals are likely to be found, memorizing the animals you pass help you find them for the next tourist, and skilful jeep driving let you deliver as many tourists to the animals as possible.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players play job cards to order items to the store, move them to the shelves, pick up customer cards and match them with items on the shelves.<br/><br/>Timely actions will let you work where the store needs it the most and skilful placement of items will bring &rdquo;your&rdquo; customers&rsquo; items to the shelves first - both of which will earn you satisfied customers.<br/><br/>The better you execute the jobs, the higher the Customer Satisfaction Index increases.

Each placed estate card lets you execute all the actions of the estate cards in that column.<br/><br/><br/>     Peasant: Place farms or sell resources to shops.<br/>     Burgher: Place shops or use buy basic resources from shops to turn them into advanced resources.<br/>     Clergy: Place churches to collect tax from farms or supply Royal missions with advanced resources.<br/>     Nobility: Add provinces to the Kingdom or supply Royal missions with advanced resources.<br/><br/><br/>Resources enter and exit the city to and from different sides of the city grid. As more advanced resources enter the economy, they can be invested in advanced farms and shops that enable the production of advanced resources within the Kingdom. However, such actions also require a combination of two similar estate cards in the same column so plan your card tableau wisely.<br/><br/>The players who has supplied the most resources to the Royal Missions wins.<br/><br/>",

It's a game system using simple programmable &quot;joystick cards&quot; and generic boards to recreate old C64 games.<br/><br/>Among the games included in the base pack are Tanks (move tanks and fire bouncing shots at opponents), Monsters (move hero and monster with the same action), Maze (find your way through a maze with movable walls), Cars (use gears and turns to race and bump your opponents, Trains (move trains and lay tracks to connect to as many opponent rails as possible), and Snakes (move snakes and try to eat your opponents).<br/><br/>The board consists of 8x8 squares, possibly with additional components depending on the game. Each player has a card tableau of 3x3 joystick cards. The player starts with any 2 cards from any row or column as active joystick cards and play them one at the time to either move in a direction or press a button. The last played card determines the row or column to take up the next 2 cards from. The game proceeds in this manner until its victory condition has been fulfilled.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game allows for 1-4 player cooperation as each player takes their own character with a unique set of abilities and strengths as they discover new tiles on their way to defeat Cerberus by gaining more powerful cards and leveling up.<br/><br/>Each turn the player rolls the die to move across the board or rolls the die if they're in battle. Rolling a 1 or a 2 places them in battle. Once a player is in battle, life clips keep track of health for both the player and each enemy they fight in battle.<br/><br/>While in battle, a player will use as many action cards as levels they are and use those actions to either damage the enemy or heal their health. On the enemy's turn to attack, the player must roll the die. Each enemy has a standard attack and most have a special attack. If the die roll matches the enemy's special attack, then it usually damages the player more than a standard attack. Once the enemy has been defeated, players earn coins which they can use to either purchase more action cards at the market or level up.<br/><br/>As it is a rogue-lite game, you can expect to die. But don't worry! Upon death, you only lose half your coins and you keep any cards you purchased.<br/><br/>",

The game was to teach children the rules of the road.<br/><br/>Each player has their own car on the game board - dice and tokens (money) are used to play, which are used to pay fines for violating the rules of the road.<br/><br/>Interesting fact: <br/>The official rules of the game also provide a basic overview of road traffic signs.<br/>The preface to the rules was written by the Ministry of Emergency Security<br/><br/>Basic course of the game:<br/>It is played on a game board that shows the road (which has a clearly defined start and finish) and each player has his own figure (in the shape of a race car), which moves around the playing area. To move around the board, players roll the dice (three dice with numbers 1 to 6). At the beginning of the game, players roll the dice - the player with the highest total starts and then the others according to the sum on the dice.<br/>Subsequently, the players take turns - everyone rolls the dice on their turn - and according to the sum on the dice, they move on the playing field towards the goal with the toy car.<br/><br/>The game board shows the roads, including traffic signs - for example:<br/><br/>     Main road in front of the intersection - the player can continue without interruption<br/>     Side road in front of the intersection - you are on a side road and you have to pass all the vehicles on the main road - so deduct 2 points from your roll of the dice for the delay at the intersection.<br/>     Prohibition of overtaking - in corners or marked places, players may not overtake the vehicles of other players in front of them - they must follow them, even if they threw a larger number of points on the dice. It is possible to overtake only after the end of the overtaking ban.<br/>     Traffic light - the game contains a dice that has colors on the sides - red, yellow and green. When a player arrives at the intersection square with a traffic light, he must roll this dice and may not continue until he is green.<br/>     Speed ​​limit - a player who moves in this part of the road counts only half the value of his dice roll.<br/>     No stop sign - if a player ends his turn on this square, he must pay one coin fine.<br/><br/><br/>The game also contains red wooden chips that represent money. At the beginning of the game, the players distribute them evenly. When playing, the places where fines are paid are defined - for example, No stop sign.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who reaches the finish line first and at the same time has at least one more money - so he did not spend everything on fines.<br/><br/>",

Each time period has its own theme and mechanics, and each class has specific uses and value depending on the situation and your Traveler's needs. Each card you draft provides elemental power. Collecting certain elements will level up your Traveler's spells, enabling power plays that can shift the pace of a fight dramatically. Each Traveler uses each element differently, and can greatly affect how you prioritize your drafting and banning.<br/><br/>Banishing enemy characters, securing artifacts, and defeating rival Travelers will destabilize your opponent's timeline, but also grant them more power. Once their stability is lost, defeat their Traveler one final time to win!<br/><br/>The game ends when you defeat the enemy Traveler after they have 3+ instability cards.<br/><br/>",

To win, Robin Hood, Ars&egrave;ne Lupin and the other thieves will have to travel through time and space to steal the world's most precious treasures.<br/><br/>&quot;Kayros: A Game of Thieves&quot; is a board game for 2-6 players (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all).<br/><br/>Each player leads a Thief with unique abilities and statistics.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, and at the end of each turn, players draw 2 cards from the Main Deck consisting of Tool and Event cards and earn 1 coin.<br/><br/>Tool cards are used to provide additional abilities and increase the Thief's statistics, while Event cards have an immediate effect and also contain objectives that, if completed, provide Victory Points. With Coins, players can buy Silver and Gold Tools, cards that will greatly enhance your character!<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to steal the Treasures placed in the center of the table, but it is not the only way to win the game. In fact, many different factors contribute to Victory Points.<br/><br/>The game comes to an end when a player fills their Loot or steals two sets of Treasures (a set consists of three treasures of the same type). The final &quot;special&quot; turn is executed, and Victory Points are counted!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This guide is written to help you fight wargames campaigns. The guide is written to help both the player with enthusiastic opponents but also to support the solo player as well.<br/><br/>Although written with Hellfire rules in mind, a lot of the campaign systems will work comfortably with any rule system you like. The rest will be be easily modifiable to cope with whatever rules or figure scale you want to use. The rules will cope with a wide variety of periods as well.<br/><br/>I confess that I've always regarded the wargames campaign to be wargaming at its finest. Done properly a campaign can provide far more interesting and unexpected games than just facing an equal points army across the table. This guide is written in an attempt to ensure that you manage to extract the maximum amount of fun whilst limiting the book-keeping. Whether you want to use massed heavy armour, or ride the fleeing enemy infantry down with your wild horsemen, this rule set will help you make sure it's all done in a suitably cost-efficient manner.<br/><br/>Combat accountancy has never been a particular love of mine and I'd hate to impose it on anybody else.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer / publisher<br/><br/>",

Each ingredient card has different stat categories that affect how desirable an ingredient is for a given Challenge. At the beginning of each round, a Challenge card is drawn. The Challenge card outlines which stat categories each player&rsquo;s sandwich should have. Players must play a minimum of 1 card for their sandwich. Cards must be played face-down. When all players are done creating their sandwich, the ingredients are revealed and the player with the sandwich best suited to the Challenge wins the round.<br/><br/>The player with the winning sandwich will keep the Challenge card for the round.

There are 2 draw piles and a discard area. Play begins when the dealer says &quot;Blitz&quot;. The play action is DRAW, DISCARD, DOWN. Players (simultaneously, not taking turns) draw a round Blitz card, then discards (face up) a card that they don't need. This card becomes available for other players. Then places one down from their hand to fill in the row. When a player matches their BLiTZ row to their Challenge card, they yell &quot;CHEDDAR&quot; and all play pauses while they reset the board and turn over a new challenge card.<br/>You can use any number of wild cards and can rearrange your row at any time. The winner is the one who completes all five Challenges and Shouts &quot;CHEDDAR!&quot;<br/><br/>Unique colorful round BLiTZ cards highlights the special Emoji on each card.<br/><br/>",

So, we've all decided: The Emperor must die.<br/><br/>So...ahem. We challenge you to a duel!<br/><br/>Experience:<br/>Suspicious Brew is a bluffing game where you and your royal court are locked in a tea-time battle of wits, serving up a deserving death to the Emperor as you compete for the title of &ldquo;tricksiest hero of all.&rdquo; The game gets really intriguing and silly when you start choosing your secret agendas based on the evolving social dynamics of the court, knowing your friends know that you know they know you know how they play each role, and that they will use that against you, and you know it! When that happens, you feel determined to outwit them, or to just plain old lie your pants off to thwart their efforts!<br/><br/>Interesting elements:<br/>Your Agendas are chosen, not dealt randomly. The role of Emperor has all the authority to make decisions, and the players they rely on have all the first hand information and are the only ones who can influence the outcome of each round. Each Secret Agenda has a vague alignment, but everyone is in it for themselves, so cooperation outside of your &quot;faction&quot; can be valuable. Everyone has the chance to play the Emperor once before the Emperor dies.

        "description": "La Guerre &agrave; Outrance is a traditional miniatures game for recreating the larger actions of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Players maneuver brigades -- whole armies can be fielded to re-play entire battles over the course of a normal gaming session. It is designed to be a fast-play alternative to other grand-tactical systems, and uses a common basing system for figures. Time, figure, and ground scales are higher, making for shorter, more decisive actions.<br/><br/>The emphasis is on army and corps-level command: the functions of lower-level generals and officers are handled by the system. This speeds play, and lets players focus on commanding armies instead of regiments or brigades. The game does not use dice, and allows one or more players to use a device to moderate play. The interface is simple and easy to use.<br/><br/>The system is built on a large body of research into the weapons, formations, and doctrine of the period, hiding this complexity to let players experience a more detailed level of simulation in a fast-play format. So go ahead and discover what it is like to fight war to the uttermost, in the most decisive European conflict of the later 19th century!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are working together to save a life-giving river and its ecosystem. For each one of us, It is not just flowing water, but a deep connection to our being. How will we all work together to save it from contamination?<br/><br/>The players are specialists in their own right taking unique roles with the knowledge and the power that they bring in to save the situation and find a solution. A separate deck of cards for the abilities and contamination levels and land and river tiles for the various zones make up the components of the game.<br/><br/>Players use cards and place tiles to move around the board. The game ends when the last contaminated zone tile has been removed.<br/><br/>Players must together plan their strategy to mesh with their expert's strengths in order to prevent contamination. For example, the Tribe head can identify and find cures for ecosystem contamination, and the bio-Scientist needs only four cards of particular contamination to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the contamination is spreading rapidly and time is running out.<br/><br/>If contamination spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they stop and regenerate the ecosystem, they all win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Army of the Rhine is the fourteenth volume in Red Sash Games&rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the last in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years' War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV.<br/><br/>As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France&rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&rsquo; war of middle age &ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men. There was not even supposed to be a war, only a demonstration of France&rsquo;s power. France was engaged in a long process of securing her eastern and northeastern frontiers. Louis felt his prestige was on the line when some of his German neighbours &ndash; specifically the Elector Palatine and the good burghers of Cologne &ndash;&nbsp;refused to give him what he wanted. A strong message needed to be sent. Also, by taking military action the French would put heart into the Turks, who were fighting a losing battle against the forces of the Holy League; keeping the Ottoman Empire in the game would ensure the Holy Roman Emperor could not support the minor powers who were the real object of King Louis&rsquo; wrath. But, things did not go as planned. <br/>  <br/>In Army of the Rhine, you will have a chance to change history &ndash; and perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books. As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops. They are nearly all German, but that means very little. In the Empire, a prince only contributes greatly to the Cause if he expects to be greatly rewarded; otherwise, he will contribute as little as he thinks he can get away with. And, because the princes have the option to aid either Emperor Leopold or King William of England, they can play the one off against the other without being accused of letting the side down. Vienna may tell you to expect 30,000 men from Brandenburg, only to learn their Elector has chosen to fight in Brabant this year, because King William paid him in advance. And as for expecting help from the Emperor himself, forget it. French passivity in the face of your outstanding defense of the frontier last year has given him the excuse to siphon away yet more resources to his never-ending Hungarian war.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Old North is an area majority game for 2-4 players. Players battle to have the most influence points over several rounds of gameplay by maintaining the strongest loyalties to the four warring Houses in the North.<br/><br/>In Old North, you have no armies of your own. Instead, you maintain a court (or open hand) of five nobles belonging to the four Houses to manipulate and use their armies for your benefit.<br/><br/>Gameplay revolves around a central board containing six important regions in the realm. Occupying these regions are the armies of the four Houses, vying for control of each one. Over the course of the game, players score points for each noble in their court based on it's House's presence and control of the six regions. Controlling nobles in your court that belong to the most dominant Houses on the board will score you the most points - but comes at a cost.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will play a noble from your hand and perform one of over 30 unique actions and events. Playing a noble improves its House&rsquo;s numbers and advantage on the board, but in turn removes its presence from your court &ndash; eliminating its ability to score points. On one hand, maintaining a court of nobles belonging to the most powerful Houses is the key to victory &ndash; but that means keeping them tucked away in your court, away from danger and unable to add to their House's strength on the board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game title is actually published as Bird$eed on the box front, and also as 'bird seed' in the game rules.<br/><br/>Players are roosters, trying to get food to score points. Getting sets of the same food scores best. Each rooster has a pair of favourite foods, and getting up to five of these adds points.<br/><br/>The food comes in three types, wheat, corn and nuts, in 1,2 or 3, or one of each. Cards showing a left wing, right wing and roosters are laid out, and three food cards dealt face-up to each one. Players then use card hands to win these food cards. Any food not collected stays in place and more food is added.<br/><br/>The players have hand cards to match the positions, and cards numbered 0,1,2,3 in different amounts. Players play three cards face-down, a place and two numbers to show which food pile they are going for and what number they bid. The numbers are added together and the game follows a butting process like Hols der Geier. But before the cards are assessed, any special combos take effect. So a pair, such as 11, gets you a free food card off the draw deck. A 00 gets you a food card from the player with the most.<br/><br/>Then players with a unique choice (left, right, centre) get their food. Then players with the same choice compare values. The highest value wins, but matching high values means the next highest wins, and so on.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, most points scored wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

It's more &quot;warlike&quot; than the others in that it uses a familiar &quot;battle line&quot; format, with players competing for five &quot;theaters of war&quot; by playing cards on either side of them.<br/><br/>During the game you&rsquo;ll acquire Force cards representing Land, Air, Sea, and Production &ndash; by playing 3-card poker hands from a hand of seven cards.

You don&rsquo;t need to know a thing about aardvarks to become an apex hunter.<br/><br/>Unlike some trivia games, this one offers you closed choices (&ldquo;A, B, or C?&rdquo;). So if a question stumps the central organ in your nervous system, you can frequently survive on hunches, or guessing.<br/><br/>If you think trivia questions are about as friendly as rattlesnakes, then go light on the gnarly questions. Find &ldquo;camouflage and dodge&rdquo; or &ldquo;ink and stink&rdquo; cards to build your defenses. Or land on a human to damage someone else&rsquo;s habitat (or repair your own).<br/><br/>Triviavore takes two or three minutes to set up and 15-20 minutes to play. It is printed entirely in the USA on sustainably harvested paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. It has no plastic parts, and is not even shrink-wrapped. The cards celebrate nature and are colorful and attractive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be the champion by eating the most delicious sandwiches, or just have fun by making your opponent eat road kill and rotten tomatoes between two moldy croissants.  But beware, because your opponent might completely change what&rsquo;s happening by throwing down a special napkin card at the last moment!<br/><br/>The Sandwich game is a card game played in multiple phases.  Play starts in the Building Sandwiches phase where players take turns drawing cards and building communal sandwiches.<br/><br/>Once a sandwich is completed play enters the Bidding phase where players take turns placing bid cards face down in front of any player (including themselves).  Once all players have finished placing bids, the bid score for each player is calculated to determine who eats the sandwich.  Eating the sandwich will reward that player with the point value of the sandwich (determined by the cards that make up the sandwich). Players can interrupt play and sour their opponent's plans by playing Napkin Cards.  These cards have specific effects on game play and scoring.<br/><br/>The game end is determined by the number of players playing.  For 2 player games, the first player to 25 points wins.  In 3-4 player games the first player to 15 points is victorious.  For a 5 player game the Ultimate Sandwich Champion is the player with the most points after 5 sandwiches have been eaten.<br/><br/>",

With this seeming simplicity is a very low barrier to entry for new players, but a lot of complexity, strategy, and deck building for dedicated players to maximize the win: loss of the game mechanics!<br/><br/>Aside from the game aspect of Esotera, it is also a cultural doorway to many religions, societies, fantasy, science fiction, and even Alien Conspiracy theory that unites all of these things into an easy to digest medium that will push the imagination and interest of the player. Finally the post Kickstarter goals of the project will be to establish a non-profit debt forgiveness program that collects Student loan and medical debts and forgives them unconditionally as a way of giving back to the greater community during these unprecedented times!<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns rolling the dice, one of which always moves a leprechaun forwards and the other of which may move one backwards; the player rolling the dice decides which leprechaun(s) to move.<br/><br/>When a leprechaun reaches the end of the track it pays out: players who bet on it to win split a pot (100 times the round number) and players who bet on it as the alternate split a half-size pot. The player with the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Your manager has told you to get out there and 'SELL, SELL SELL!' as you take to the Grandstands to move as many hot dogs as you can to keep the crowd happy and in their seats.<br/>In the game Hot Diggity Dog, 2 to 5 players grab their trusty hot dog supply box and hit the Grandstands, looking to turn their carefully selected inventory into fistfuls of cash. Moving quickly but strategically around the sections, they look for opportunities to turn dogs into dollars and make the most of the seven innings before the concessions begin to close down.<br/><br/>In every inning of the game, each player has 5 action points to take any combination of the actions listed below to increase their sales.  <br/>With these points, they can:<br/>- Fulfill a hot dog order (1 AP)<br/>- Move to an adjacent (no diagonals) Grandstand section (1 AP)<br/>- Hawk your hot dogs to the crowd, adding another order to the section you are in (1 AP)<br/>- Play a 'Dog Eat Dog' card (1 AP)<br/>- Return to the commissary and restock your supply box (2 AP)<br/><br/>An event is revealed from the Huge-0-Tron deck at the top of every inning, potentially altering the course of play for the next turn. Players must also be on their toes and watch for opportunities to capture extra points by fulfilling the combination showing on the top card of the Incentive deck.  There is also an optional player interaction deck, the Dog Eat Dog deck, which allows you to get hands on in thwarting the efforts of your fellow vendors while you seize crazy opportunities to better your own position.<br/><br/>Carefully choose your route through the Grandstands, manage your delicious inventory, and seize the best opportunities to turn dogs into dollars to claim the spot as 'Top Dog' by the time the last 'Out' is called!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Turalia is a democratic land, where people vote for the government every few years. Now is time to vote for a new president but, in an unfortunate coincidence, a fire has started in the north of the land. Join other candidates to stop the fire. But do not lose sight of the people votes: there can be only one president.<br/><br/>The protection of Turalia is a familiar semi cooperative game for 2 to 4 players. Suggested age is from 10 years and game complexity is low. Each game will take about 30 to 45 minutes. Game materials are a main board, a secondary board, some cardboard tiles and the following components in five colors: wooden cubes, wooden discs and six sided dice.<br/><br/>The game main mechanic is action selection. Players will throw dices and group them by values. A player will select a dice from a group and, for each other dice on that group, the fire will advance. If a city has too much fire, the fire will be out of control in that city. If that happens in too many cities, players will lose the game.<br/><br/>Then, the player will perform some actions and deploy some new units in the south. At the end of the turn, if there are enough units in a city, that city will be fortified. But only one player can fortify the city. Also, fortifying cities will improve all players actions: more movement, more fire extinction, etc. And the player with more cities fortified will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Even though it&rsquo;s critical that tasks be carried out in a timely manner, the sleepyhead dwarves never rush to get things done. As the proprietress of the workshop, you need to manage the dwarves&rsquo; various abilities in order to produce a beautiful necklace.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, the starting player (who holds the hearth card) selects one dwarf card from the two in their hand and places it so the card is visible to all other players. The remaining players then chose which card they will play from their hand. These cards should be revealed at the same time.<br/><br/>After the cards have been revealed, the player with the dwarf card of the lowest number gets to go first.<br/><br/>On their turn, players execute the abilities written on their dwarf card in order from top to bottom in order to build a necklace. After all abilities are executed, the player picks any card from the upper row of cards placed in the middle of the table and adds this card to his or her hand. If there are any jewels on this card, the player also receives them. Then, the player disposes their previously used card into the lower row.  <br/><br/>This ends the player&rsquo;s turn and the next player now starts his or her turn until all players have carried out one turn each.<br/><br/>  At the end of the round, one jewel is drawn randomly from the jewel bag and placed onto any card remaining the the upper row in the middle of the table. Then, all cards in the lower round are moved into the upper row so that the row is replenished to a total of 5 cards.<br/><br/>Also at the end the round, the current starting player receives one jewel. <br/><br/>When a player completes stringing 8+ jewels onto their necklace string (6+ in case of a 3 player game), the game proceeds to the final round. The player with the highest valued necklace at the end of the game is the victor.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll need all that and more if you wish to out maneuver and out gun all the goons, ninjas, and thugs trying to run you off the road. So make sure your clothes are impeccable, your hair in place, and buckle up for a ride!<br/><br/>In Spy Car, you have one goal. Eliminate enough of the Bad Guy's cars to force out the Boss Car. Kill the Boss Car and you win. If you lose all your Vehicle Damage or Health before then, you lose.<br/><br/>You start the game with 6 gadget cards, which give you special abilities above and beyond what you can normally do with your die rolls. You also place out a grid of enemy vehicles cards according to the diagram on the city you are in.<br/><br/>Each turn, you roll 8 standard dice, and 1-4 specialty dice, which are skewed to certain abilities.  The specialty dice can give you certain results you are looking for easier, but there is also a Danger result not found in the regular dice, so you need to weigh that risk into your decision on how many to roll. You will use the die results for their basic abilities, or to power up gadgets or combos, which will help you eliminate the enemy's spy vehicles.<br/><br/>Your goal is to eliminate the Boss Car at the end of the wave. Once 10 vehicles are eliminated, the Boss Car comes out. You win the game if you eliminate the Boss. You lose the game if either your health or vehicle damage is reduced to zero.<br/><br/>",

If you solve the task in the given time, you receive a chip, roll a color die and move your piece to the next corresponding color field. If the task is not solved, you have to stand still.

In each case, the interrogators are provided with a total overview of all possible offenders. There are several variations of the game, in the simplest one a player receives a secret perpetrator card and answers yes or no to questions from the other players. For each no, a point card (14 to 1) is discarded and the interrogator changes. The sooner the perpetrator is identified, the more points are awarded to the interrogator.

We meet the 'Strong', the 'Fitness Fanatic', the 'Sadist', and many others.<br/><br/>There are game variations on classic card games.<br/><br/>1) &quot;Classical&ldquo; Quartet: players try to make pairs (e.g.cards 1A and 1B are a pair, 1C and 1D another), by asking one of the other players if they have the card they need.<br/><br/>2) Piranhas: similar to 1, but the Piranhas card does not have a 'partner'. the player stuck with the Piranhas card at the end has to do a fine (e.g. 10 push-ups)<br/><br/>3) Quartet variation &lsquo;Trumps&rsquo;: Here the categories come into play. one player choses for example 'Pain Tolerance' and then all players have to say the value of their card. The highest (or lowest) value wins over the others.<br/><br/>4) As 3 but with a dice: after the active player has announced the category, anyone can throw the dice (he/she has to pay 1 card to do this though). depending on the number he/she can e.g. change the category, take a card from somebody else, the value is doubled, etc.<br/><br/>5)The 'Randori' Cards (5 different ones). These cards can be used at the end of a game round (played as in 3): As soon as it is clear who has actually won this round, another player can put down a Randori card to challenge the round winner. The first player to lay a Randori card is the challenger for this round. Each round can also end without a Randori card being played. Challenges are e.g. reaction (who grabs the dice first on a sign of a third player), Mushin: try to lure the round winner from the state of 'empty mind': with grimaces, jokes, and sounds trying to make him/her laugh.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Calaveras is a poker-style party game based on a popular Mexican game called Viuda. Viuda (which means &ldquo;Widow&rdquo; in Spanish) has it roots in the older game of Whiskey Poker, which in turn took ideas from the much older game of Widow Whist; in Widow Whist, an extra hand is dealt to the center of the table (the widow), which players can then use in addition to their own hand. Calaveras takes the general game-play ideas from Viuda, but adds an extra suit and some special cards that make the game much more strategic and appealing  to the sensibilities of modern gamers.<br/><br/>Each player receives 5 cards in their hand. 5 cards are also dealt to the center of the table. Before the round begins, in turn order, each player can swap their hand with the cards on the table, turning their cards face up. Once the center cards are revealed, each player in turn order can swap one card from their hand with a card on the table, swap their entire hand with all the cards on the table, or pass. This continues until a player knocks, indicating they want the round to end. After knocking, every other player (except the knocker) gets one last turn, then hands are revealed; the lowest hand then loses one of the three skulls they started the game with (the hands are ranked similar to poker, but with 5 suits rather than 4)<br/>  <br/>The goal of Calaveras is to be the last player in the game. Each player starts the game with three skull tokens. After each round of play, the player with the lowest hand loses one of his skulls; when a player loses his last skull, he is out of the game. The winner is the last player to still have skulls after everyone has lost theirs.<br/><br/>",

The game is themed around visiting the graves of your departed family members through a trick-taking mechanic.<br/><br/>The suits in the game correspond to your different family members (e.g. Grandpa, Aunt, &quot;That Uncle&quot;), and each is worth a different number of points.  At the start of a hand, players choose one card from their hand to bid with.<br/><br/>During the game play, tricks can have 1 or 2 winners. The first winner of the trick is the person who played the highest card of the lead suit or the trump suit (monks).  That player takes each of those cards, and sets them in a pile next to their bid card, with a specified card on top.  If any players visited the grave adjacent to the lead suit, that suit can also have a winner, and that person makes a similar stack.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a player has met their bid if in the piles they've created next to it from winning tricks, they are showing another card of the bid suit, and the points for the visible cards sum to exactly the rank of the bid card.  The player who met their bid and scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game includes several &quot;advanced&quot; modules, such as special powers; a tie-break card; and a story-telling aspect where the winner of a trick is encouraged to share a memory of a family member of the lead suit.<br/><br/>",

Scrooge McDuck (along with Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck) try to get the treasure from the island to the harbor. Players have ships that are trying to save this way.<br/><br/>Each player has one or more ships of their color (wooden figures in the shape of a ship) and starts on the island in the middle of the game board. Two Beagle Boys are placed on a field marked with a pirate symbol on the game board.<br/><br/>The players gradually roll the dice - each round moves both one of the players and one of the pirates. The pirates remain only on the main route, but the ducks can hide in several shortcuts, where they are not in danger from the pirates. But if the Beagle Boys catch up with one of the player ships, the ship is captured and imprisoned on a pirate island. There is a possibility to free it if one of the players gets his ship directly on one of several squares with a star symbol.<br/><br/>The player must get to the port by rolling the dice on exactly two green squares, and if he does not roll the necessary number on the dice to allow him to enter, he must wait or go around the next round so that the Beagle Boys do not catch up with him.<br/><br/>If all players manage with minimal losses, Scrooge McDuck is satisfied and the game is won. Against are the Beagle Boys, who are trying to capture ships loaded with gold.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mark of the Muse is a new card game, designed with the idea of community in mind. This system allows for artists to submit their art for a team of game designers to turn their work into a playable card. It&rsquo;s meant to be fun for collectors, and a recognition opportunity for artists. Cards are of course completely playable as a game, encouraging collectors to seek out and browse artists for new cards, and aid artists by both getting their names out there and being another source of income.<br/><br/>The cards are designed to maximize the original artwork while being easy to understand and see all the necessary stats and abilities. We decided to not use any borders on the edge in order to see as much of the art as possible.<br/><br/>On a turn,  players draw a card then play cards to attack their opponent. When a player has defeated 10 cards the player wins.<br/><br/>Certain cards have a life point on them, with only a specific amount being playable each turn. If these cards' HP get reduced to zero that card goes to the Lifeline. Cards on the Lifeline may still be used as resources, fueling other cards' abilities when flipped. When the Lifeline contains 10 cards, that player is out and the remaining player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This board game from South Africa uses custom dice to try to replicate the sport of golf. The contents include a scorepad, instructions sheet, 4 golf course boards with 4 or 5 holes on each one (18 total holes), one D6 die with letters A to F on it (representing which track your ball follows down a golf hole green), 17 different D6 dice representing various golf clubs and distances hit, and 8 player markers (2 each in 4 colors).<br/><br/>Each player rolls the letter die to determine which of the 6 tracks they will follow on the first hole. Then take turns choosing an appropriate golf club die (woods, drivers, etc), each with different possible distances on the six sides, to roll to proceed down the course. There are sand/water traps along the way that your ball can either fly over (if you roll a long enough distance) or land in, which requires you to switch to a different die such as a sand wedge with shorter potential distances on it. Once you reach the putting green near the end of a hole, you switch to a putter die that tells you how many putts it took you to get the ball in that hole. Add up the total of each player's strokes/putts on that hole, and record it on the scoresheet. Then continue on the next hole. Just like in real golf, the player with the lowest score after either 9 or all 18 holes is the winner; or if only 1 player is playing, compete against the provided par numbers.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A test of strategy, luck, and concentration based on the solitaire-style card game Calculation.<br/><br/>Players begin with four base piles (which can only be built on following a sequence going from atomic to galactic) and four empty stock piles (which can be built on in any order). <br/>Shuffle the deck and draw one card at a time. These must either be placed on a base pile (if possible) or one of the stock piles. Cards can also be moved from stock piles to base piles.<br/><br/>The aim is to use up all cards to complete the sequence on the four base piles.<br/>If you reach the end of the deck and still have cards in stock piles that can't be moved, you lose!<br/><br/>Work out the optimum strategy for success (it's all down to how you order your stock piles, and a bit of luck). A good player can complete the game 1 out of 4 times, but can you do better?<br/><br/>",

The Pegasus and Faun are wild. . multiple rounds are played until a player or team reaches 6,000 points and wins the game.<br/><br/>2-3 player games are not played in teams. 4-8 players must pick partners. Partners sit opposite each other The dealer deals 10 cards face down to each player. The undealt remainder of the deck is placed face down in the center of the table, becoming the stock, and the top card is turned face up beside it.<br/><br/>Each player starts their turn by drawing one card and discarding one. players and teams collect cards and place melds down in front of them. Players add to these melds throughout the round to gain more points. If a player is able to get rid of all their cards on a turn, the round ends.<br/><br/>Everything that is on the table when a round ends counts as positive points. All cards left in players hands count as negative, even for the team that went out to end the round.<br/>A player may meld as many cards as they please, of one rank or different ranks, forming new melds or adding cards to previous melds. All the melds of a partnership are placed in front of either partner.<br/> &mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can spin the spinner only if you roll two spins or a spin and a double it.<br/><br/>Your turn begins by rolling all 3 dice. Keep aside any one dice of your choice and resolve the other two. When collecting tokens from the resource bank, you must collect them one at a time without looking! If you collect the quantity mentioned of any 1 resource on the survival card, it does not mean that you &lsquo;lock&rsquo; that particular resource. Opponents can still grab tokens off you and reduce your quantity. When grabbing resources from opponents you must always pick the top most token from any pile. Once you&rsquo;ve performed all actions, your turn ends. If at the end of a turn you have the exact quantity of all resources listed on the survival card, you win the game. Otherwise the game continues.<br/><br/>",

The anointment, moreover, can only take place after a battle in which the prospective knight has blooded his blade. These mandates were established to ensure that only men of true prowess earned the rank of Knight. Even with the Empire dissolved, those mandates are well preserved traditions and those who ignore them meet ridicule. In fact, a recurring article presented in the Imperial Conclaves is the appointment of Counts Palatine, to replace those who may have fallen in battle or died or old age.<br/><br/>The massed charge of Household Knights is one of the most powerful weapons at the disposal of a Hundred Kingdoms commander. Hundreds of pounds of obdurate metal and muscle, forged through years of training and experience, they have shattered men, formations, and kingdoms throughout the ages.<br/><br/>",

(&quot;Long live the knights!&quot;) is a tower defense game with 2 levels of difficulty - one for children age 7-12 and the other, more advance version, for gamers age 12 and up.<br/><br/>Each round has 6 phases that are repeated until the end of the game is triggered.<br/>Phase 1: Taking action card. Every player takes 6 action cards in the first round, in other rounds takes 3.<br/>Phase 2: Evil knights are coming. The number of evil knights depends on the number of players. In the first round number of evil knights is the same as the number of players + two extra more, in other rounds without two extra more.<br/>Phase 3: Playing action cards. Players use their cards to fight the evil knights. On their turn, players can play as many cards as they can. Players place their cards under evil knights, face down, and put a token in their color on top of it.<br/>Phase 4: Action card payment. Action cards are turned face up (tokens must remain on the cards) and players pay the sum of their face up cards. If they can't pay, all of their face up cards are discarded. If they pay more than necessary, they don't get any money back.<br/>Phase 5: Fighting knights. Evaluate every knight separately. If the sum of the action cards under a knight is greater than the power of the knight, a knight is defeated and the player gets a point. If the sum of the action cards is lower, knight survives (card is not discarded), action cards are discarded and tokens are returned to the player.<br/>Phase 6: Knights attacking. Every knight that survived is going to attack the castle. Every knight attack after another. A knight can destroy a castle card only if his crest color matches the color of the castle card. This card is then discarded.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds, if all the castle cards are destroyed, all players lose. If all the knight cards are used and the castle is still standing, you successfully defended the castle. All players are considered heroes, but only the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Right Cruel and Fell is a wargame for field battles in the Hundred Years War (1337-1453). <br/>It covers closely-related conflicts, such as the War of Breton Succession, the Castilian Civil War, or the Anglo-Scottish wars of the same time. <br/>The system is specific to time and place, although supplements expand the scope to include the War of the Roses, Italy (1300-1492) and the Teutonic Knights (1200-1410). <br/>The mechanisms particularly reflect these conflicts and the interaction of troops in them, with historical accuracy and even zeitgeist.<br/><br/>A battlefield in RC&amp;F is divided into a grid of 3&rdquo; squares called acres, each of which represents approximately 70 yards in each direction. <br/>&ldquo;Troops&rdquo; of 400 infantry or 200 mounted men are the basic units; each troop on one base with a recommended size of 2&rdquo;x1&rdquo; although the gaming standard of 40mm frontages (or 60mm with 4&rdquo; acres) will work as well. <br/>There is likely no need to rebase miniatures. <br/>Each type of historical soldier and unit is accurately represented. <br/>The status-based attrition system (step loss) accounts for both physical and psychological deterioration. <br/>The game uses both six-sided and ten-sided dice, sometimes as singular rolls, sometimes in opposition to the enemy. <br/>RC&amp;F accounts for command and control, or lack thereof, as well as the character of leaders and their influence on troops&rsquo; behavior. <br/>The mechanics are straight forward, leaving players to concentrate on historical tactics, rather than worry more about rules. <br/>A large number of orders of battle and battlefield maps is included.<br/><br/>RC&amp;F players should be ready for a challenge that accurately simulates battles in the Hundred Years War in a playable and enjoyable game. <br/>The author is a professional historian with decades of wargaming experience, who has extensively playtested these rules with both experienced and novice players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rules are included for figures based on 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 historic men per figure/stand.

        "description": "Stingbad is a set of Fantasy wargame rules developed as part of a new series covering different periods.<br/>They were developed from the pedigree of our popular Sacre Bleu massed skirmish rules, using a variable sequence of play which means even underdogs stand a chance of winning.<br/><br/>The rules stand alone, no other sets in the series are required, but all those in the Streamlined Play Rules Series share a core set of rules, so if you learn one picking up another one of the rules in the series is easy. Each set is, of course, heavily tweaked for the period they cover and are streamlined for fast play. We want our games to be straightforward, so we can concentrate on trying to defeat our tabletop enemy insted of spending our time 'fighting' the rules to get them to work! That is central to the design philosophy of these wargame rules.<br/><br/>In the case of Stingbad, included are three ways of choosing armies, and the features include amongst other things flexible unit sizes, different types of battle, weather rules, commander ratings, fluke hits, heroes and speeches, collapsing buildings, smoke and - as you'd expect - magic rules. Magic can be powerful, it can cause hills to rise up or collapse, and trees to animate and become walking creatures and water to rage for instance, all assuming you can get the magic to work!<br/><br/>The rules have taken years to develop, during which keeping them simple and not complicating things was a major challenge. They can be used with as many or as few figures as you want (individually based, that is!).<br/><br/>We hope you decide to give them a go, and enjoy leading your hordes to ultimate victory, or even to glorious defeat... ?!<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We invite you to create the story of these anonymous people who have forged the world we live in at the cost of their lives. <br/>The game includes a scenario generator with 288 possible combinations, 29 skills and 6 nations represented. <br/>The campaign possibilities are therefore very numerous and not one part will be the same. <br/>The figures can be of any brand. <br/>The rules are written for 28mm but by dividing all the distances by 2 you can play in 15mm or even 1/72. <br/>The playing surface can simply be your living room table, you can use a play mat. <br/>For the terrain, leave room to your imagination. For more interesting games, the playing area should have a minimum of obstruction items to provide shelter and strategic stakes.<br/><br/>&ndash; Description (translated) from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Les Voltigeurs is a skirmish game for 2 to 6 players. <br/>It invites you to relive the confrontations under the Napoleonic era on a smaller scale than usual. <br/>Far from the great mass battles, small clashes between small groups of men played a role that was sometimes crucial and not recounted in the history books. <br/>In this game the individual soldier is honored and you will focus on following his progress as the battle progresses and sometimes accompany him until his death. <br/>We invite you to create the story of these anonymous people who have forged the world we live in at the cost of their lives. <br/>The game includes a scenario generator with 288 possible combinations, 29 skills and 6 nations represented. The campaign possibilities are therefore very numerous and not one part will be the same. <br/>The figures can be of any brand. <br/>The rules are written for 28mm but by dividing all the distances by 2 you can play in 15mm or even 1/72. <br/>The playing surface can simply be your living room table or you can use a play mat. <br/>For the terrain, leave room to your imagination. For more interesting games, the playing area should have a minimum of obstruction items to provide shelter and strategic stakes.<br/><br/>&ndash; Description (Translated) from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Everybody else is dealt 7 blue skill cards. The green job card displays the name of a job or occupation of some kind. The remaining players are &quot;Candidates&quot;, and they must choose from their hand of blue skill cards which card they wish to hand face-down to the Employer. After everybody hands their blue skill cards face-down to the Employer, the Employer will decide based on the skill cards, which Candidate was the best and most appropriate match for the job. Whoever wins the round becomes the Employer for the next round, the cards are re-shuffled and the game restarts.

Carefully manage your inventory of colors, invest at the right time to obtain useful bonuses and abilities, and assemble sets to fulfill the requirements for rare and valuable color swatches.<br/><br/>Chromatics is a tight, two-player strategy game about colors. In a fresh twist on established game mechanics, each player's resources - red, blue, and yellow &quot;primary color cubes&quot; - also function as the &quot;workers&quot; used to secure positions around a contested 4x4 grid of cards. Each round, players place cubes from their inventory on various border cards, before deciding to take one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>     investing cubes, allowing players to build up their supply of colors, or<br/>     spending cubes, obtaining a wide variety of action cards featuring inventive abilities and lucrative scoring bonuses<br/><br/><br/>When each round ends, players are also provided an opportunity to purchase vibrant paint swatches, further adding to their score - but depleting their inventory of resources at the same time. At the end of the game, players tally their scores. Most points is the winner!<br/><br/>Featuring an approachable art style, a creative blend of mechanics familiar to veteran players, and a variety of cards to ensure no two games are alike, Chromatics is an exciting entry into the genre of two-player strategy games.

Players may purchase more characters and actions to add to their Mafia, earn money from various crimes, or encounter other enemy Mafia members on the community streets.

As you acquire cards and build your deck, your decisions will shape your Pirates&rsquo; personality.<br/><br/>Using your cards you will sail across the map, strike fear on enemies, recruit crew, attack, defend, form a pirate haven, sack forts, complete global missions, or build infamy (which lets you gain even stronger cards). Each turn you will draw a hand of cards and take actions with them. Once you are out of cards, play goes to the next Pirate, and this continues until everyone has exhausted their decks.<br/><br/>Individually you are amassing Swagger as quickly as you can while collectively completing the global missions. The game ends when the global mission (chosen by the players before the game begins) is completed Alternatively, whoever reaches 120 Swagger first is the winner.<br/><br/>.....<br/><br/>",

These decks are:<br/><br/>     DIM: A variety of dark, absurd, and twisted trivia. <br/>     SAD: Player must use Sound, Act, Draw, or a combination of these.<br/>     LEMON: Space-themed action cards that move players forward or backward on the board. They can be used on any player and have the potential to become lemon-scented sabotage.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player reaches the black hole and shouts, &quot;Does It Matter&quot; as their piece lands on the final space. If another player says &quot;Does It Matter&quot; first, the win is rejected and the player must move back to their original position.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this very simple and fun game, the players take turns trying to get all the ingredients to make a nice fruit salad: grapes, blueberries, strawberries, kiwis, tangerines and bananas. The first one to complete the set wins.<br/><br/>In terms of gameplay, initially there's a pile with fruit and &quot;veggie&quot; tokens. Each player on their turn rolls two custom dice, one with the 6 fruits on its faces and one blank, except for one face, that shows a broccoli (&quot;veggie&quot;). Depending on the roll, they either pick up a corresponding fruit token or a veggie token from the pile. If they already have the fruit, they have the option of picking up a second one (only up to two per fruit are allowed) or return their fruit token back to the pile.<br/><br/>Veggie tokens are &quot;jokers&quot;, in that they can stand in the place of any fruit token. However if you roll for veggie and already have one, you have to give it back; you can have at most one veggie at any given time.<br/><br/>Winning condition is having exactly 6 different tokens (6 fruit or 5 fruit and a veggie) with no duplicates.<br/><br/>",

With the help of colourful renditions of the original Zener cards as well as your very own minds, you and your friends can perform the same scientific experiment to disover which one of you has the greatest capacity for telepathic communication - or simply is the luckiest. Who knows? See for yourself!<br/><br/>Telepatio is turn-based and played over 24 rounds, or until the first player reaches 17 or -11 ESP points. You score ESP points by successfully sending or receiving the correct telepathic signals.<br/><br/>Every round a player assumes the role of a 'Sender'. The Sender rolls the Zener dice with the dice cup and views the result in secrecy. The Sender then flips over the hourglass, and must try to telepathically communicate the right Zener symbol to the other players. No words or visual cues of any kind are allowed, you must rely on the power of your mind.<br/><br/>By the time the hourglass runs out all other players, known as 'Recipients', must have chosen a Zener card with the symbol they believe is being telepathically sent to them. The Sender then reveals their dice roll and Recipients reveal their cards. Was the Sender successful in communicating the Zener symbol? Did the Recipients read Sender's mind, or did they score by simple guesswork?<br/><br/>If a Recipient chooses the wrong card, the Recipient moves one step back. The Sender moves as many steps forward as the number of correct matches from the Recipients, plus two extra steps. If the Sender does not match up with any of the Recipients, the Sender stays put.<br/><br/>The player with the most ESP points after 24 rounds is the most telepathic of the players, or does it all come down to luck?<br/><br/>",

Omen cards act as a jolly and can turn luck and memory against everybody.<br/>Valhalla is a combat game where players compete against each other and against monsters to remain the last man standing in the arena.<br/><br/>Once the games are complete, the results and the points obtained by the players, together, form the traits of their characers in Mask of Loki, the Role-playing game that acts as a forth module. The game comes with a handy game manual explaining the rules: Mask of Loki, in fact, is a very simple game (it takes half an hour to be mastered) that rewards cooperative play and awards poor luck in the previous character creation session.<br/><br/>Hours of funny, thrilling and amazing adventures in the Norse society are waiting for you.

There are several domains of meaning in the game that can be chosen and are puzzled in a game board: neighbourhood, relationship, freetime, family, household, work, friends and school. In each domain you will face questions, exercises and challenges depending on the chosen mission. You gain 'join' points by doing missions and by engaging in the missions of other explorers.<br/><br/>The game ends after a fixed amount of gathered missions (depending on how long you want to play: between 1 hour and 3 hours) and the explorer with the most 'join' points (victory points), wins.<br/><br/>In a search for new ways to 'do psychotherapy', we offer in this board game an unseen constellation of play and therapy, where we let go of the necessary presence of a therapist in the therapeutic process. Narrato is a board game that has it's inspiration from concepts within the narrative psychotherapy and systemic psychotherapy. In an atmosphere of fun and connection, players remember not only rich stories but they also write new ones with the playing of Narrato. Players can get connected in surprising ways and through the specific design of the game. We expect new kinds of experiences for themselves, their partner, their family, friends and other meaningful persons in life.  Increasing each other's sense of influence is rewarded ('relational agency&rsquo;) through 'join' points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new game for people who like word games, crosswords and other educational, challenging family friendly games.<br/><br/>Literatio is a game of word creation where 2 to 5 players build words from cards drawn with cards used from preceding players&rsquo; words to ultimately achieve the highest score. A player&rsquo;s word is scored by the numeric value of each letter plus the total number of cards used.  Each word played after the first must contain at least one card from the previous word and at least one card from their hand. A fast, portable word making game that's also fun as a solitaire game.<br/><br/>Literatio comes in a cloth draw-string bag containing 100 small laminated letter cards, instructions, pencil, and score sheets.<br/><br/>Player One builds as high a scoring word as he can. For example, 8 points for the total of the numerical values of the letters <br/>plus 6 points for the number of cards used.<br/><br/>Player Two discards one card from Player One's word into a used letter pool and rearranges the remaining letters while adding at least one of his own to make a new word.  Play continues until all cards have been drawn and one of the players has used all of his cards or until all possible words are played. The value of the <br/>unused cards that players are unable to play are subtracted from their scores.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins! Players may use a timer if desired.<br/><br/>",

There are four different ways to play this game.<br/><br/>Line game (2-4 players): The players start in Germany or the USA. Each player has his own track. The players take turns to roll with 3 dice and move. Only rolls over 12 count. If a 13 or 14 are rolled, the player may move 1 space, at the roll of 15 or 16 he may move 2 spaces and so on. The first player to reach his destination wins the game.<br/><br/>Double game (2-6 players): The players form two teams. One team starts from Germany, the other from the USA. Movement is like in the line game. On some spaces events hinder or benefit the players. The first Team to finish the journey wins the game.<br/><br/>Line or double game with the Novuma-die: The  players use only the special die, which determines a movement of 1 or 2 spaces or 4 different events that hinder or benefit the pilots.<br/><br/>",

[From a 1934 Australian newspaper advert.]<br/><br/>The Combo deck is a traditional card deck with a letter in its center and below the suit symbol in the corners.  Back in 1934, it might well have been the only such deck available.<br/><br/>The deck comes with rules for 3 games:<br/><br/>Lexical: A rummy game. Each player starts with 10 cards, and during their turn may either: discard a card to draw the top card of the draw or discard pile; lay a word down on the table form their hand; exchange a letter from the hand for one on the table (as long as it makes a valid word; or add one or more cards from the hand to an existing word to make a new word.<br/><br/>When one player empties their hand, each other player adds the points of the cards in their hand to their score. Face cards are 10 points, number cards have points equal to the number of spots, and the Joker (wild card) is 15 points. When someone reaches 100+ points the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Kittylex: The same as Lexical, except it scores by each player placing a chip in the kitty at the start of the round, and the winner claiming the kitty.<br/><br/>Combolex: The same as Lexical, except you may also lay down a flush or run of 5+ cards. You may not lay off cards on opponents' flushes or runs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed for funraising in the Netherlands for a local Kiwanis group. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case a geographic region in the Netherlands around the city Axel.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

If they cannot play any card they draw a card and end their turn.<br/><br/>The You Lose! card makes the next player draw two cards and otherwise skip their turn.  To win the hand, a player must play a You Lose! card as their final card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Cheese Royale you will become a little mouse in the middle of the field, where you will fight against hunger, traps and the rest of mice, to be able to get hold of the central cheese.<br/><br/>The game map consists of 37 tiles:  All the tiles, except the starter and the central cheese, are placed face down on the map so that they cannot be seen. Each mouse at the beginning of the game has a starting life and food and its corresponding attack and defense values. Each mouse has also a different ability.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to be the last surviving mouse. The game is divided into rounds, in which each player has 2 actions to perform in his turn. At the beginning of each round an event card is revealed and it can affect the whole round, such as reduction of the map at the end of the round. In this case, the last layer of tiles is removed from the map making it smaller.<br/><br/>Actions that can be performed in your turn:<br/><br/>     Sniff: View the content of a tile without executing its content. <br/>     Move: Move to adjacent tile, if it is face down, the tile is turned over and its content is executed. <br/>     Attacking: When  attacking, the attacker's values and the defender's values are compared, that is, base characteristics of mouse, its equipment and the fight cards used in combat. If the attacker wins, he gets a fight card reward and the opponent loses a life. In case if the defender wins, he gets a reward from fighting cards and has the possibility to counterattack.<br/>     Rest: if you have excess actions you can rest to get fight cards or food.<br/><br/><br/>After taking your 2 actions, your turn ends and you consume 1 food from your supply. If you don't have food, you lose one life.<br/>If a mouse reaches 0 life, it's eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is for your Hero to get calm and stay calm when facing monsters on an epic journey. Players learn to Think Like a Hero &mdash; to focus their power to see a situation for what it is, consider options, and make the best of it.<br/><br/>The game is cooperative and is for 1-3 players. A player will start by choosing a Hero card, deciding what Play Style (class) they want, and a fill-in story card. Each fill-in story card has fill-in the blank lines that you will choose a word for based off of what cards you draw each turn. The games lasts for 6 chapters (rounds).<br/><br/>Depending on their Play Style, the player will draw different cards. They then decide if they want to trade cards, and if they have any cards they can match to be able to unlock the letter for that chapter's story. If they don't unlock a letter, they can spend a mimo (action point) at the end of their turn to buy one. You get 4 mimos each turn, and if you don't use any or all of them, they carry over to the next chapter.<br/><br/>Then, every player draws a monster card, Magicians will try to befriend the monster, Collectors will try to collect them and Warriors will try to fight them.<br/><br/>You win by succeeding in as many monster encounters as possible, the monsters add to your Hero's overall strength. Whatever mimos you have left over by the 6th chapter also add to your Hero's strength. The 6th chapter card is a Boss Monster, you defeat it with your accumulated strength.<br/><br/>",

Languages are one of the most beautiful and wonderful human creations.

If they do not match, you must leave them in the same place. Whoever finds the most pairs wins.<br/><br/>Konew<br/>Objective: each participant has to guess which card was played from the clues provided by the other players.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck without looking at it. The other players, in turn, must provide a clue in Mapuzugun about the appearance of the image of the card that the player has to guess (Ex: it does not fly, it has feathers). If they guess, they keep that card. If they don't guess, the card returns to the bottom of the deck. The one who collected the most cards wins.<br/><br/>The guessing game (Konew) is an ancient Mapuche game. Older people say that in the winters when families were gathered in their homes they used to play to tell riddles, thus the cold weather passed.<br/><br/>",

These maps are filled with various scenes in which inhabitants and magical creatures take part.<br/>Players learn a mission which consists in finding a particular event on the map on the basis of its description, the coordinates of this place are a password to open a PDF with the next task (for this purpose we use a computer or a phone - to read tasks from PDF files). In this way the players go through the story scenarios during which they also draw on the map and color its elements. The game is cooperative and players win when they manage to solve all puzzles and learn all passwords in a given scenario. All scenarios make up one big campaign<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each action can be done by a dice roll action based on the 'push your luck' mechanic or by spending 'fatigue' points (which he will also lose if he fails, but more). When he runs out of 'fatigue' points he has to pay with health points, their end means losing the game.<br/><br/>In some locations, we will be able to get raw materials (5 types), which will be used for crafting items that will help to significantly increase the chances of testing for certain actions (e.g. bow increases the chances of hunting).<br/><br/>The game takes place in different scenarios with specific victory conditions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your long and perilous journey home is almost over. Only one last obstacle stands between you and your destination: that wobbly suspension bridge, unstable and treacherous, especially when winter is approaching and the wind is blowing in icy, unpredictable gusts. One false step, one shift, and you could lose part of your precious cargo. Hunger and cold will also sap your strength.  And the night which is inevitably approaching will be your doom if it catches up with you before you have found refuge on dry land, on the other side of the bridge. Despite all these dangers, you set off and begin the crossing.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will program a few actions from their board (with action tokens) and resolve them. This will often involve moving forward along the bridge, revealing and resolving bridge cards and potentially weather cards. The game ends when the bridge is crossed or the night has caught up to the character or too much cargo has been lost along the way.<br/><br/>",

The action that the player takes after moving is determined by the color of the space they land on.<br/><br/>When you encounter a Yokai, they will either fight you, curse you, or help you, depending on the symbol in the upper-left corner:  combat-oriented Yokai feature a black symbol, and effect-oriented Yokai feature a red symbol.

You can compete one on one or form teams and embark on a real intelligence fight.<br/>The game begins with the first round of cards (101 to 150 cards and with 5 joker cards) to be shuffled and folded on the table. Cards are drawn in turn, questions are read aloud. If the game is a team based, team members can consult with each other. Answers are checked by the opponent or the opposing team. After playing the first round, the second is played on the same principle (from 151 to 200 cards and with 5 joker cards).<br/>1 point is awarded for the correct answer. For proper performance of the joker's task - 3 points. For transferring a joker card to another player (or team) without reading the QR code - 0 points. After scanning the QR code of a missed task, 1 point is deducted. The participant or team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The cards can be used as a stand-alone game or as an expansion for &quot;Golden Mind: a great board game&quot;. Also, this game can be expanded with &quot;Golden Mind. Start No. 1&quot; cards.<br/><br/><br/>Žaidimą sudaro 100 kortelių su 200 klausimų, atsakymų knygelė ir 10 džokerio kortelių, nuo kurių nuskaičius QR smagias užduotis žaidėjams pateiks patys TV žaidėjų vedėjai - Arūnas Valinskas ir Andrius Tapinas. Galite rungtis vienas prie&scaron; vieną arba sudaryti komandas ir leistis į tikriausią intelekto kovą.<br/>Žaidimas pradedamas pirmojo turo kortelėmis (nuo 101 iki 150 kortelės ir su 5 džokerio kortelėmis), kurias reikia sumai&scaron;yti ir užverstas padėti ant stalo. Kortelės traukiamos paeiliui, klausimai skaitomi garsiai. Jei žaidimas komandinis, komandos nariai gali tartis tarpusavyje. Atsakymus tikrina prie&scaron;ininkas arba prie&scaron;ininkų komanda. Sužaidus pirmąjį turą, tokiu pat principu žaidžiamas antrasis (nuo 151 iki 200 kortelės ir su 5 džokerio kortelėmis).<br/>Už teisingą atsakymą skiriamas 1 ta&scaron;kas. Už tinkamą džokerio užduoties atlikimą &ndash; 3 ta&scaron;kai. Už džokerio kortelės perleidimą kitam žaidėjui (ar komandai) nenuskaičius QR kodo &ndash; 0 ta&scaron;kų. Už neatliktą užduotį nuskaičius QR kodą atimamas 1 ta&scaron;kas. Laimi daugiausia ta&scaron;kų surinkęs dalyvis arba komanda.<br/><br/>Kortelės gali būti naudojamos kaip atskiras žaidimas arba papildyti žaidimą &bdquo;Auksinis protas: Didysis stalo žaidimas&quot;. Taip pat, &scaron;į žaidimą galima praplėsti su &quot;Auksinis protas. Startas Nr. 1&quot; kortomis.<br/><br/>",

The cards a colored by word type such as &ldquo;Noun,&rdquo; &ldquo;Verb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adjective,&rdquo; &quot;Adverb,&quot; and &ldquo;Participle&rdquo; as well as plenty of space to write the Kanji character, description, and example sentence in Japanese. Once all the blank fields have been completed, the cards can be integrated into a Core Deck. There are also 2 cards outlining the Godan Conjugation Table for reference.<br/><br/>This expansion to Japanese: The Game gives you the opportunity to customize your learning experience by adding new vocabulary words that are more specific to your personal needs.<br/><br/>The expansion decks are shuffled in with the main deck to accommodate more players (the game plays 2 by itself and needs either an additional core deck or an expansion to accommodate more), or just to add less common words to the mix for 1-2 players.<br/><br/>",

Each player chooses one of four characters from that period. The choice of character also determines the way the player moves in the game.

The judge reveals the top of the Target Card deck. Each other player chooses one of the six Tech Cards in their hand which they think best impacts the revealed target area.  The judge chooses which is the best fit; players can try to persuade the judge why their choice is best.  The player whose Tech Card the judge chooses keeps the Target Card, players draw to replace the Tech Cards played, and the next player is the judge for the next round. The player with the most Target Cards after they are all distributed is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Canadian spin-off of the I.Q. 2000 game, published some time in the mid-1980s, has you navigate across Canada rather than the solar system. It comes with 800 cards (200 per category - History/Geography, Famous People, General Knowledge for Adults, and General Knowledge for Children), each with 5 questions on it, for a total of 4000 trivia questions about Canada and Canadians. It also includes a gameboard with the Canadian map, 6 player pieces (which are stackable if two players land on the same space), 1 die, a plastic storage tray, and instructions.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to correctly answer a trivia question after reaching the last circle on the gameboard (in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Players take turns rolling the die to move. The color of the space they land on determines which category of question should be asked to them by the player to their right. When children are playing, they can be asked questions only from the easier children's category regardless of which color of space they land on. As long as a player continues answering questions correctly, they get to keep taking more turns. When they get a question wrong, then the player to their left gets a turn. When someone reaches the final space in Victoria, they must answer a final question correctly to win; otherwise, they must move 4 spaces backwards and wait for another turn to try again.<br/><br/>The publisher considers certain topics &quot;integral to the educational aspects of the game&quot;, so there is some overlap between the adults' and children's questions, just with different phrasing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Doctor Who TV show reached its 50th anniversary in 2013. The European division of Topps released a collectible trading card game in honor of this, with both a first edition earlier in the year and a 50th Anniversary edition later in the year. It was primarily sold in the UK.<br/><br/>Alien Attax is a simple card game for two players. Each player lays 9 cards face-down. Decide who goes first by flipping a coin. The first player picks their first card and decides whether to attack or defend with it, while it is still face-down. The second player chooses which of their cards to respond with, again while it is still face-down. Then both cards are revealed, and their attack/defence numbers are compared to determine who wins that round. For the next round, the opposite player gets to make the first choice. After all 9 rounds have been played, the person who won the most rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The first-edition Alien Attax series had 240+ different cards available, and the 50th Anniversary series had an additional 160+ different cards. The 50th Anniversary cards have a grey Tardis '50' symbol in the top right corner of the fronts of the cards. Starter packs were available that included a &quot;Collector Binder&quot;, &quot;Collector Guide&quot; with checklist and how to play, and a two-sided paper play mat, in addition to cards. A Collector Tin was also offered with a bundle of cards.<br/><br/>Note: Although 2012 copyright dates are stated on some items, this game was first sold in March 2013.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The French colony of Saint-Domingue produced more wealth than the rest of France's colonies combined. France chose to meet the demand for these labor-intensive crops by way of an explosive increase in slavery with nearly half a million enslaved West Africans working the Saint-Domingue plantations. The brutality and greed of the plantation owners and overseers, coupled with the extreme disregard for the enslaved Africans' humanity, set the stage for revolt. After months of hidden preparation, the signal was given following a secret Vodou ceremony. On the 21st of August, 1791, the fuse to the powder keg that was Saint-Domingue ignited with the flame of liberation.<br/><br/>In the cooperative deck-building and strategic war game Liberation - Haiti. the players each control a geographical faction of enslaved Africans or those who escaped enslavement living in the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the early period of the Haitian Revolution, 1791 to 1793. These factions seek both the abolition of their slavery and social equality.<br/><br/>Before rebelling and fighting for your liberty, you need to recruit people to your cause, gather information, develop maneuvers, and stockpile supplies, all while the game is opposing your actions. You have to face well-armed colonial militia and foreign armies, navigate fragile or fleeting alliances, and overcome both political and environmental challenges to win freedom for your people.<br/><br/>The game is played in two stages: the Planning Stage and the Revolution Stage. In the Planning Stage, you use a deck of cards specific to your faction to acquire planning cards that represent intelligence, people, and materiel. Cards added to your pool will in turn help accumulate more and stronger cards of these types. In the Revolution Stage, you use your acquired card pool to overthrow the colonial slave system by deploying units to raid plantations, defeat enemy forces, seize control of strategic locations, increase the morale of your people, and meet political challenges.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "America The New Game is a word game whose deck celebrates the United States of America, probably in conjunction with the 1993 Chicago World's Fair -- it being published in Chicago that year.<br/><br/>Its deck includes letters cards to cover the alphabet twice, in red and in black, and each letter has a different painting by the designer about an aspect of American history and heritage. About half the cards cover history, including Leif Ericsson, Columbus, the Mayflower, Declaration of Independence, first railroads, etc.  The rest of the cards cover the geographic range of America: the cities Washington D. C., Chicago and New York; the Statue of Liberty, steamboats, Niagara Falls, cotton plantations, wheat fields, orange groves, farms, cattle ranches, etc. It also includes an American Flag wild card, and a rules card. The cards are bridge size, measuring 88mm x 57mm.<br/><br/>It has rules for two games. &quot;America&quot; plays like Gin Rummy, with players drawing and discarding until someone goes out by playing a 7-letter word. At that point, everyone scores a word from their hand with bonus points for longer words, and for names of American cities or states. The largest point total is awarded if the 7-letter word is &quot;America&quot;. &quot;Alphabet Rhummy&quot; plays like normal rummy, letting you play words to the table once you have them, as well as add letters to existing words to make new words. The first player out of cards gets one point per card in everyone else's hands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Birdy can be played in two very different ways. Whether it involves matching colours and collecting birds or putting down bird cards on ones that have already been set out &ndash; both game variants promise loads of fun and develop children&rsquo;s matching abilities.<br/><br/>Game 1: Feeding the birds <br/> At the moment the birds can&rsquo;t find anything to eat around them and need help from humans. Attract the  birds with food so that they don&rsquo;t have to go hungry. The 25 bird cards are shuffled and then spread out on  the table face down. Three arbitrary cards are left face up so they are visible to all players, and the dice are <br/>placed nearby.<br/> The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He then chooses one of the 3 face-up cards and tries to attract the selected bird by rolling the matching colours. The player has a total of 3 attempts, and can set aside any matching dice with each attempt &ndash; and continue to roll the dice/die the remaining times. The picture of a birdhouse functions as a joker and can stand for any colour. The X on the die is a &bdquo;Lame Duck&ldquo;, and can&rsquo;t be placed anywhere. If the player manages to cover all colours after rolling the dice (a maximum of) three times, he can keep the card &ndash; otherwise, he has to put the card back. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn. If the previous player was able to collect a bird, then a new card is turned face up, so that there are 3 cards face up again. The object of the game is to attract 3 of the same kind of bird.<br/>The game ends when one player has attracted 3 of the same birds. That player wins the round. If none of the players succeeds, the one who has collected the most birds wins.<br/><br/>Game 2: Bird dominoes<br/><br/>Can you link all of the birds onto the long chain of birds? Try to be the first player to attach all of your birds to the long row of birds. The 25 bird cards are shuffled thoroughly and spread out face down on the table &ndash; one card in the middle is turned face up, and one die is placed nearby. Then each player is given 4 bird cards to start with.<br/><br/>The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He rolls with one die, and there are the following possibilities:<br/><br/>     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled matches a &ldquo;free colour point&rdquo; on the card in the middle and one of the bird cards that the active player has shows the same colour &ndash; very good, the bird  card can be placed<br/>     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled is not a &ldquo;free colour point&rdquo; or the active player doesn&rsquo;t have a bird card that shows the colour &ndash; too bad, it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn<br/>     Rolls a &ldquo;Lame Duck&rdquo;: The active player draws a &ldquo;penalty card&rdquo;<br/>     Rolls a joker: The active player can place an arbitrary card on a free and matching colour point<br/><br/><br/>The player who is first to place all of his bird cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are many secrets hidden in this big old city. But the main one is vampires. A hundred years ago there were so many of them here, and they behaved so openly and brazenly that people declared a hunt for them. The angry crowd caught all the bloodsuckers and buried them with aspen stakes in their chests. And this was forgotten for many years. But a small group of vampires managed to escape. For a hundred years they wandered around the world, and it's time to return to their hometown to resurrect their deceased relatives.<br/><br/>In the game Family Affairs, players will take on the role of the heads of vampire families. Their task is to resurrect as many of their blood-sucking relatives as possible in six nights. To do this, you need to find as many tombstones as possible. Then dig up the bodies and give the poor fellows fresh blood to drink.<br/>Capturing cemeteries will help your family complete the mission faster, but you should be wary of fanatical Vampire Hunters.<br/><br/>Family Affairs is a roll and write game. In it, you will take on the role of vampire families who are looking for their long-dead relatives. There are eight vampire families to choose from in the game, each of which gives you a unique gaming experience. The main task of the game is to paint over as many graves with vampires as possible, resurrecting them. To do this, you will need to find the tombstones first.<br/><br/>Gameplay: throw dice and try to throw &quot;6&quot; on them - i.e. resurrect a vampire and not throw &quot;1&quot; - i.e. stumble upon a Vampire Hunter.<br/><br/>Each turn you will capture a new cemetery. Each captured cemetery will give you new opportunities for the rest of the game. For example, to throw more dice or resurrect vampires not only by &quot;6&quot;, but also by &quot;5&quot;. The head of the vampire family must skillfully decide which cemetery to capture first and which to leave for later. The opportunity to make Sorties brings more excitement. You can double all the resurrected vampires, but at the same time reduce the number of Vampire Hunters from whom your family can hide.<br/><br/>You have only six moves to assemble a well-functioning game engine and win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead of a mana system, players can play ships for free but need to discard cards to move them around the board. Islands can be captured to increase one's draw power, but these are out of the way and come at the cost of tempo. Additionally, as ships begin to sink, the deck gradually thins, and eventually draw power becomes irrelevant in the end game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We encourage parents to join children in the game and help them grasp basic wealth management concepts like saving and spending wisely in a fun interactive setting, while inculcating positive values like civic consciousness and the importance of sharing.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player draws three cards from the draw pile. After resolving any charity or vice cards, the player then chooses whether to save or spend. If a player chooses &quot;save&quot;, they put any coin cards in their wallet for use on a future turn. If they save three coins in one turn, they get to advance one space as a bonus. If a player chooses &quot;spend&quot;, they pay the price and move the number of spaces indicated on the item card. Some item cards also have ongoing special effects.<br/><br/>After each player has taken a turn, the spinner is spun and all players must take the action indicated by the spinner.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the goal at the end of the board is the winner. That player has mastered the importance of saving and spending wisely.<br/><br/>",

Anachronistic aesthetics and wicked machine designs bring the game to life.<br/><br/>Planes Battle Buildings is a 2 to 4 player miniature strategic game. Each player controls a faction of miniature planes or walking buildings.<br/><br/>Players then draw terrain hex cards to reveal and traverse the unknown landscape. The aim is for each player to gain area control, retain enough resources to maintain and expand their collection of planes or buildings. Conflict arises when players battle over terrain or attempt to pilfer the other player's resources.<br/><br/>Game play is either skirmish mode (where one players wins all) or adventure mode where a scenario is chosen with its own unique set of rules for the players to follow.<br/><br/>",

The box is decorated with the same artwork as part of the board.

With the Third League unlikely to stand for treason, Taiw...St. Ives will be the center of the universe for a brief period.<br/><br/>Turning Points: Taiw...St. Ives fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Third League Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for control--and survival--of this instrumental world.<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &circ;_&Ntilde;??Taiw...St. Ives flavor.&circ;? The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Taiw...St. Ives, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion.

Each opponent draws his/her word on a sheet of his/her drawing pad. When all drawings are completed, each opponent shows his/her drawing to the others, long enough for them to try and figure out the word drawn.

Each player controls a character represented by three randomly determined stats: Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina. The game is played on a square grid representing a bread shop. The basic object of the game is for the characters to beat the heck out of each other in an effort to obtain the bread and exit the bread shop.<br/><br/>To start the game, one player is selected at random to be in possession of the bread. The other players then set up their characters around the one with the bread. Starting with the player who has the bread, each player takes a turn consisting of movement and combat actions.<br/><br/>These turns continue until one player's character escapes with the bread, somebody flips over the game board, or everybody just gets tired of the silliness and moves on to a real game. Somewhat similar in spirit to the parody game Panzer Pranks, the emphasis of Bread in October appears to be on satire rather than simulation or playability.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lindisfarne Monastery is a competitive euro-style dice worker placement game about monks working at a Christian monastery in the early Medieval period. Inspired by the real monastery of Lindisfarne, players work to create resources, feed themselves, and write religious texts for the library, culminating in the great Lindisfarne Gospels.<br/><br/>The monks are represented by dice, and the pips on the dice represent their level of experience. As the monks are placed on action spaces each round, their pips are converted to action points to spend in that action space. Each round, the player who has pip majority in each action space may claim an available bonus, which may include the ability to pip up a die.<br/><br/>Monks can also be sent in pilgrimage to holy sites overseas, and to collect rare, vivid inks to take home for use in their scriptorium. The monks must also beware the Vikings, who raid the monastery every summer, and who must be paid off in beer and mead, lest they steal the treasures of the monastery or murder the monks!<br/><br/>A full game of Lindisfarne Monastery is played over four game rounds, representing calendar years, where in each year there are two action phases, and within each action phase the monk dice are placed, and then resolved. Points are scored from pilgrimage, from writing religious texts, commissioning treasures for the monastery chapel, and for retiring monk dice from the board. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Cards represent fleshed-out characters or the vehicles or vehicle upgrades they use, or major story elements that can be played to shift the game's dynamics. It feels like playing a streamlined Warhammer 40k with Magic: The Gathering cards.<br/><br/>1 - 2 players, ages 12 and up, games lasting 30 mins to 1 hr.<br/><br/>Played on a tabletop with cards, six-sided dice, a ruler, and elements representing terrain. Everything required to get started is available in the Sourcebook And Core Rules.<br/><br/>The narrative background of the game and its associated and ongoing book series is based on classics like Dune, Star Wars, Firefly, and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series:<br/><br/>&quot;Two thousand years ago, the Salt Mystic declared her vision of the forces of history, and how to harness them to shape human events. Naraia was the name they gave to the sprawling republic that arose from her teachings, encompassing countless cities on land, floating on the seas and tethered to the seafloor, and tucked into pockets of artificial space called oriels.<br/><br/>All of that shattered a generation ago in a terrifying and almost supernatural conflict called 'The War Of The Rupture'. Now, roving bands of Naraia's remnant fleets and soldiers and its marvelous machines scatter like maple seeds for anyone with a vision to seize them. And abandoned oriels lie in wait for brave explorers with the heart to enter inside.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Valenrelm you play as a kingdom that is competing for domination of the land. Start the game by choosing which kingdom you will play as and the tactic and specialty you will start off with. Tactics change the way your armies move on the map and specialties give you a bonus in one area. You can change these during the game as the world map unfolds changing situations require new capabilities.<br/><br/>There are two main decks that you draw from, the tile deck and the action cards. The tiles are used to explore the world and build the world map as the game progresses. This means the game has near infinite variation and no two games will ever result in the same world map. As you explore, you will encounter brigands who have come to inhabit the land of Valenrelm. Defeat them in battle and occupy the farms and villages they guard to expand your kingdom and gain the resources you'll need to recruit more armies and play action cards. Farms provide you with food while villages provide either iron, wood, or stone. There are also camps and castles that are used to recruit armies. The different types of armies have different abilities on the world map and are useful in different situations. Moving your armies on the map will allow you to conquer more territory.<br/><br/>Action cards are used to give you a temporary advantage over the other players. Most of the cards cost resources so having a steady supply of them is essential. Some cards affect your armies, some affect the armies of other players, some have negative effects. Using them at the right time could tip the balance of power and help you achieve victory.<br/><br/>When armies battle, the two players use their battle cards to play out the battle on the battlefield. Every player has the same battle cards unless they have chosen one of the specialized armies that has their own unique battle card. The cards are orders to the units in your army to perform a specific maneuver on the battlefield. The maneuvers each have their own offensive and/or defensive capabilities. Each player chooses their three cards for the center and left and right flanks and reveals the cards at the same time. You could order one of your units to charge at the enemy but if their unit used shield wall, the attack would be blocked. Another unit could flank the shield wall and defeat it. The battle mini games are quick, only lasting a minute or two. You could win, lose, or tie a battle. The result of the battle then effects what happens on the world map.<br/><br/>You can win by occupying most of the settlements, all of the castles, being very wealthy, or destroying everyone else's settlements. Valenrelm is a dangerous place where your fortunes could change at any moment. How will you forge your path to victory?<br/><br/>",
