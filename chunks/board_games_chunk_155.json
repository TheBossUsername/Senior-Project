        "description": "Enter the captivating world of Dungeon Twister, the famous strategy game created by Christophe Boelinger, with this revised and improved 20th Anniversary Edition.<br/><br/>In Dungeon Twister, 2 to 4 players take on the role of a team of heroes imprisoned by the Mad Archmage in an ever-changing dungeon riddled with deadly traps. Will you be up to the challenge of surviving and entertaining your jailer?<br/><br/>Players compete by strategically exploiting their adventurers' skills and the opportunities created by the maze's ever-changing shape. To win the game, eliminate your opponents by magic, force or cunning, and activate the mechanisms that will make them fall into a trap. Bring back precious treasures or escape alive to earn victory points.<br/><br/>With Dungeon Twister, strategy is at the heart of each and every one of your actions. The game features :<br/><br/><br/>     A tactical action system: plan your turn and choose the best action card to optimize your moves. Keep track of the cards played by your opponents to anticipate their next actions.<br/>     Multiple ways to win: take advantage of the enemy heroes' weaknesses and defeat them, control strategic points or dodge the battle and escape the dungeon to earn victory points.<br/>     An evolutive and interactive board: adapt your tactics with each tile revealed. Activate mechanisms to rotate them to your advantage, open up new opportunities or block other players' strategies. Strengthen your heroes with magic items scattered throughout the labyrinth.<br/>     Heroes with diverse skills: each adventurer has unique skills to overcome the maze's challenges or thwart your opponents' plans. Will you choose a skillful passe-muraille, a powerful ogre, or why not both?<br/><br/><br/>For its 20th anniversary, Dungeon Twister is back with a whole range of improvements.<br/><br/><br/>     Reinvented art direction: dive into Dungeon Twister's labyrinth with completely revamped illustrations and designs. Each room and passageway comes to life thanks to a modern, dynamic and colourful art direction, offering a new level of immersion in the face of countless dungeon challenges. All this is possible thanks to the creativity of talented illustrators such as Guillaume Tavernier, Myl&egrave;ne Bertrand and Didier Poli.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Never-before-seen miniatures: Every character in the game, from the clever wizard to the mighty warrior, has been beautifully redesigned and sculpted. These new, finely detailed miniatures faithfully reflect their special abilities and strategic roles in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Improved materials and enlarged tiles: We're thinking big for this Anniversary Edition. Every tile is now larger and thicker. The design of the dungeon corridors has been re-imagined for more surprises and challenges. The game boards are more sturdy and every component has been carefully chosen to guarantee greater durability and enhanced game enjoyment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A well-stocked basic box: Vary your Dungeon Twister games with this new edition, which includes the Paladins &amp; Dragons expansion and the module for playing with up to 4 players. Diversify your team settings and take on even more challenges!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two field camps face each other in trenches. There are obstacles between these entrenchments, so that the advance can only take place in zigzags.<br/>Each field camp has the same number of divisions and regiments, represented by large and small colored pyramids that tilt as you move. In doing so, they push enemy companies (red dots on the game board), which are captured by covering up. The goal is to take as many prisoners as possible and conquer the enemy entrenchment.<br/>The starting position is indicated by the red border line, where the two large pyramids are first placed on the triangles that are outlined with a white double line. A small pyramid is placed to the right and left of each large pyramid, also on the triangles that are bordered with a white double line.<br/>Germany moves first by tilting one of its pyramids and placing it on an adjacent field. The opponent does the same, so the game is played one move at a time. The pyramids can only be tilted by folding over one of the three sides in such a way that the rotating edge remains on the original line, so it must not be tilted over the top.<br/>Whoever has occupied all 8 bright squares marked with points in the opponent's fortifications with his or her own or someone else's pieces can call &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;; the game is then over.<br/>The party that has taken the most prisoners, i.e. can add up the most points under their pyramids, wins.<br/><br/>The game was published during WWI.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played alternately by pushing all cruisers and pushing an ironclad. The cruisers are all set in motion with each turn; They may advance up to three spaces at will, but only in a straight line. Every cruiser must be moved as long as it is not on one of the small crosses within the large red crosses. In this case, it can be set in motion again from there at the player's discretion.<br/>The ironclads are only set in motion one at a time and can travel as far as they want in one direction, i.e. unless it encounters another ship and is forced to stop.<br/>Ironclads or cruisers can drive over the minefields, but are lost as soon as they stop or have to stop on them.<br/>If a cruiser sinks a mine ring when leaving one of the harbor bases, which can only happen if the chimney was vertically on the base during the move, the 9 spaces that the mine ring touches may no longer be used by both parties.<br/>No ship is allowed to jump over another one of your own or enemy fleet. This only happens when an ironclad is drilling a cruiser into the ground; it must do so as soon as the cruiser is within one of the ironclad's four directions of travel.<br/>A ship that is wedged in such a way that it can no longer move will be taken away by the opponent on the next move. But as long as one of the ironclads can still move, the other ironclads that may be wedged in cannot be taken away.<br/><br/>Germany has won<br/><br/>     if it has occupied the three crosses within the large red crosses with three cruisers and has also occupied the base closest to the coast with a cruiser or occupied it with a mine ring;<br/>     when the three ironclads have been put out of action.<br/><br/><br/>England has won<br/><br/>     if two of its ironclads come to rest in such a way that they completely or partially cover at least four of the former cruiser locations;<br/>     if at least 5 cruisers are out of action and one ironclad is still maneuverable.<br/><br/><br/>",

It is ok if shapes sometimes match up. The starting grid will be different each game.<br/><br/>Put the remaining tiles face down near the board to form several draw piles. Each player draws a starting tile.<br/><br/>Players take turns scoring as many points as possible each turn by matching the sides of the placed tile to the sides of the tiles in the playing field.<br/><br/>The center of each tile is numbered 1 through 4 for scoring at the end of the game. Around the outside of each tile are a selection of half-shapes. There are six half-shapes in the game. Your goal is to place a tile to match two identical halves of a shape to create a whole shape. Then, collect the tile you matched, leaving the tile you placed.<br/><br/>As tiles are matched and collected, the remaining tiles above will slide down, possibly creating more matches and earning you more points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The ranch, once known as a quiet and uneventful place, now holds an air of mystery and unease due to a recent incident. The young owner of Crimson Sky Ranch, Samuel Blackwood, was recently found lifeless in his residence with no visible wounds, and the scene was devoid of any conventional clues. With Samuel having no reason to die this way due to his young age and good health, the officers at the local police department are left scratching their heads. With no evidence linking anyone to a committed crime, they&rsquo;ve had no choice but to write the case off as an unfortunate event of natural cause, thereby closing the investigation.<br/><br/>The townsfolk however, having a history of telling myths and legends around the ranch, believe otherwise. They whisper of something supernatural among them. The people were quick to dub the potential assailant as &ldquo;The Ghost of Crimson Sky Ranch&quot; - a phantom that struck without leaving a trace.<br/><br/>Upon learning about this case, you feel a sense of unease and a suspicion that there's more to the story waiting to be uncovered. Being the detective you are, with a strong determination to solve difficult cases, you decide to reopen the case to pursue the truth. As the ghostly tales echo through the town, you arrive at Crimson Sky Ranch to figure out what truly happened.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As with all things wild, there is an element of luck involved, as the roll of the dice will prompt your next move, but then comes the strategy; do you attack or defend, run and hide, or stalk and pounce? Every decision has a consequence, every move could be fatal, so keep your wits about you as you prepare to strike.<br/>Survival of the Fittest can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players, and each variation requires a new strategy and a new way of surviving. Depending on the type of lion you are, the game plays between 30 - 45 minutes and keep in mind that there are obstacles that are introduced during the game, so be careful not to get blocked in&hellip; or out!<br/>The third big element to the game: can you convince the other players to help you when you need it, even though you both know you are doing your best to try to eat each other&rsquo;s prey? Survival of the Fittest is an interactive game where having alliances will definitely help you&hellip;but look out for the double cross!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Sets are called 'Books' in such games by the publisher.<br/>Rules are similar to Quartet games nowadays.<br/>When asking for a card from another player, the questioner must state a country, the Book it comes from AND the population in that country. If the questioned player has that card he must pass to to the questioner. If he does not have the card he must draw a card from the deck and end his turn.<br/>The winner is the player with most books when all have been collected.<br/>Game must be made for trivia buffs with the population of countries in 1896 in their heads!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In German, the term &quot;dunkelflaute&quot; refers to a period in which energy demand is high but electricity production is low, as in winter on windless days with little sunlight. This expression underlines the importance of planning and diversification in our energy mix.<br/><br/>Dunkelflaute is a competitive game in which players try to build a resilient energy park to guarantee sufficient electricity production on each turn. To achieve this, players must invest wisely in different energy sources and allocate their budgets to maximize production while limiting risk.<br/><br/>On each round, players have three discs of different values to allocate to three different purposes: to purchase new tiles for their park, to purchase new houses to power, and to purchase dice to be used that round. Players then roll the dice and try to place them on the tiles they've bought to power the houses they've purchased. The number of houses a player has managed to power in his park will determine the value of his discs for the following round, and so on until a player ends the game by buying a twelfth house. The round then ends as normal, and the player who has powered up the most houses wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of SG Gwint is to offer the opportunity to play Gwent, which we all love, in a form worthy of the title &quot;well-balanced card game.&quot; Unfortunately, the old good Gwent is not that, and it's no wonder. In The Witcher 3, players collect their decks on their journey towards the title of Gwent Grandmaster, and the variety of cards ranges from unusable to absurdly strong.<br/><br/>We approached the new version with respect for the original version and the preservation of the spirit of the game. However, we also utilized the space for innovation - in addition to balancing the strength of the cards and their abilities, we added some of our own, created a few new cards, and replaced the card illustrations with those from the online game GWENT to give them a fresh touch. Furthermore, we replaced the existing interface with our own for enhancement.<br/><br/>How to play SG Gwint<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>The objective of Gwent is to win two out of three rounds by having more points on the board than your opponent.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Each player begins with a deck of cards that consists of unit cards representing different factions, abilities, and values. A standard deck contains a minimum of 25 cards. Player takes 10 cards and can change 2 of them.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Round Structure: The game is played over a series of rounds. Each round allows players to play one card per turn until both players pass consecutively.<br/><br/>Board: The board consists of three rows for each player: melee, ranged, and siege. Each row can hold a certain type of unit card.<br/><br/>Unit Cards: There are different types of cards: melee, ranged, siege, and special cards. Unit cards have a power value and sometimes an ability.<br/><br/>Leader Cards: Each player has a leader card that can be used once per game, usually having a powerful effect that can influence the game significantly.<br/><br/>The Hand: Players draw a certain number of cards at the beginning of each round. Players can mulligan (exchange) a few cards from their hand if they wish.<br/><br/>Scoring: The player with the highest total power on the board at the end of each round wins that round.<br/><br/>Winning a Round: Winning a round does not mean winning the game. Players need to balance winning rounds with conserving cards for future rounds.<br/><br/>Round Length: Players can play as many cards as they like in a round until both players pass. Passing means the player ends their turn and cannot play any more cards in that round.<br/><br/>Card Effects: Many cards have special abilities that can influence the game, such as boosting other units, damaging enemy units, or affecting the game board.<br/><br/>Tiebreakers: In the event of a tie at the end of a round, the player who won the previous round wins the game. If neither player has won a round, the game continues with another round.<br/><br/>Strategy:<br/>Gwent requires strategic thinking, bluffing, and careful resource management. Players must decide when to commit powerful cards and when to hold back to secure victory in later rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The venerable Lord George McAllister is dead - shot with an old duel gun on the sofa of his hunting room. Everything points to a suicide - if it weren't for Chief Inspector Paul Higgins, who is plagued by doubts.<br/><br/>And so he asks you to search the crime scene...<br/><br/>Can you confirm the thesis of suicide or is there perhaps something even more terrible behind it?<br/><br/>Are you ready to become the master of the puzzle and detectives? It's time to solve the case!<br/><br/>Puzzle X Crime is a combination of exciting mystery and puzzle fun! First, the crime scene is assembled from 406 puzzle pieces, then the puzzlers slip into the role of investigators. Which objects in the motif should be examined more closely? The numbers on the back of the puzzle pieces lead to playing cards and envelopes with important evidence. Is it possible to combine all the clues correctly and get on the trail of the perpetrators? Puzzle meets crime game! The popular game principle, in which you examine a case file with evidence and solve a criminal case, is now also available as a Ravensburger puzzle - Puzzle X Crime! The highlight: the puzzle is also printed on the back with numbers that provide valuable information on how to solve the case. Then intuition, combination skills and criminalist sense are required. Together with the enclosed playing cards and the evidence in envelopes, the puzzlers gradually determine the murder and can find the perpetrator, murder motif and murder weapon. Also ideal as joint puzzle and investigation fun! No game material has to be destroyed and the Puzzle X Crime can be played again.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>- 408 puzzle pieces with printed back in two different colours<br/>- A suction cup for flipping puzzle pieces<br/>- 72 playing cards with valuable clues<br/>- 10 envelopes with different evidence material<br/><br/>",

The player with the most wins at the end of 5 rounds is the victor.<br/><br/>The biggest feature of this game: the fact that you cannot tell for sure what card (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) you are playing until it&rsquo;s too late. There are a total of 16 numbered cards and while Card #1 and Card #16 are clearly defined as Rock and Paper respectively, it&rsquo;s impossible to say what range is defined as Scissors until the end of the game.<br/><br/>After five rounds of placing out your cards, you use the two remaining cards left in your hand to figure out what range of cards actually count as &ldquo;Scissors&rdquo; for each individual player &mdash; and therefore how many of the five rounds you actually won.<br/><br/>If you play with 3 players, there will be 3 rounds.<br/><br/>A playful game of psychological warfare that combines funnily illustrated cards with serious strategy as you guess what cards your opponent could possibly have left in his or her hand and play your own hand accordingly.<br/><br/>グーやパーなどの手が描かれたカードを同時に伏せて出し、じゃんけんをする２～４人用ゲームです。じゃんけん勝負を５回行い、勝った回数が多い方のプレイヤーが勝者となります。<br/><br/>このゲームの大きな特徴は、５回の勝負に使うカードをすべて出すまで各カードのグー・チョキ・パーが確定しないことです。最終的にじゃんけん勝負に使わなかったカードによって各カードのグー・チョキ・パーが決まります。<br/>3人戦なら3回の勝負を行います。<br/><br/>人をからかっているかのような変わったカードの図柄と、相手がどんなカードを残しているのかを推理しながら手札を出していく心理戦が特徴的なゲームです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2231 AD&hellip; Humanity has embarked on a full-fledged space migration plan, and you, as a scientist belonging to one of the four research institutions engaged in a fierce research battle, are involved in the &ldquo;Human Settlement Planet Design Project&rdquo;. Your mission is to create the longest-lived planet. The idea is to produce better simulation results than other research institutes at the once-a-month planetary research presentations.<br/><br/>To create a harmonious long-lived planet, you need to venture into space to collect materials, then conduct research to create the refined materials used to build planets. The key to creating a planet with a long life is to create a large amount of high-quality planetary materials.<br/><br/>Now, compete with your rival scientists to create the best planet!<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>What is PLANET LAB? Players repeat [Gather] and [Research] actions to collect space materials that are then researched to recombine into planetary materials. Various types of materials are required to make these &quot;refined materials&quot;, but the rarer the material, the longer it will take to bring it back to the laboratory. If you are absent from your laboratory or take a break from carrying materials, a rival researcher might secretly come to use the materials you worked so hard to transport! Once you have finished building your planet, you can simulate the planet using your smartphone! The resulting planets will change depending on the combination of planetary materials used. Who can create the longest living planet? Determine the materials you need, predict your rival's actions, and sometimes sneak into their laboratories to obtain the best planetary materials!<br/><br/>&mdash; Description from the publisher (Translated)<br/><br/>PLANET LAB is a simultaneous action selection game in which players draft material cards in an effort to collect the right material sets to convert them into planetary materials. Higher-valued raw materials take longer to return to your laboratory - which can expose you to others using your materials for their own gain! Each round consists of a Morning, Midday, and Night activity. Your action selection takes place in the morning and based on your selected action, your Midday and Night action follow.  The game ends when all the raw materials cards are collected and players assemble their planet simulation using their converted planetary materials.<br/><br/>The game advertises that this last feature (scoring of the planet) is done with a smartphone app; however, the base game can be played entirely without this functionality. If players DO use the application, the extended game play allows material cards to have a variable range of values, resulting in holding the determination of final winner until the very end of the game.  The app reveals the winner by creating a hologram of each planet and then destroying them from last to second place. Only the winner's planet remains.<br/><br/>",

When a fish lands on a colored hook, the player whose fishing pole matches the color of the hook must move the t fish up his pole.

The criminal element never sleeps. When it&rsquo;s discovered someone is killing con attendees who are dressed as the popular comic book hero, Knight Detective, you get pulled into the case. Now that a comic book villain has come to life and is loose at Stargeek Comic Expo, is anyone really safe? It&rsquo;s up to you to find and stop this super villain before more tragedy can unfold.

        "description": "In Cogs and Carts you and up to three of your friends race to collect diamonds in a maze of rotating interconnected cogs.<br/><br/>All cogs are mechanically linked and turning a single cog will rotate all the cogs on the board - changing the maze in dramatic and meaningful way. At any point in time there are 8 versions of the board that exists simultaneously; they are accessible by simply rotating the cogs.<br/><br/>A game of Cogs and Cart begins with empty board; each turn a player flips over an empty cog to the track side, growing and creating a unique puzzle every time you play. The location of the diamonds also get randomized at the beginning of the game to shake things up.<br/><br/>Cogs and Carts is a culmination of two distinct goals - one is to play a game that make use of a gear or a cog in a meaningful and mechanical way just like one of my favorite Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calender. The other is the desire of wanting to play a more tactical and less luck dependent version of Tsuro; an aesthetically beautiful tile laying game.<br/><br/>The final result being a quick to learn fun little game that takes about 5 minutes to learn and plays in about half an hour. With each turn revealing a new fun puzzle to solve but not so disruptive that you cannot plan your move in advance. Finding clever route that net multiple diamonds per turn feels rewarding, just as snatching the ones your friends are aiming for right from under their noses.<br/><br/>How-To-Play<br/><br/>To setup a game of Cogs and carts flip all the cogs so that the empty side is facing up.<br/><br/>Place all the diamonds inside the bag. Randomly draw the diamonds out one by one and place in around the board in clockwise manner with the numbered side facing up until all 28 spots are occupied.<br/><br/>The number on the diamond indicates how many cogs from the edge of the board to place the diamond when adding it to the board.<br/><br/>Starting from the youngest player and going around clockwise each player choose which of the middle four cogs to place their cart.<br/><br/>The last player then chooses which of the diamonds to start adding the board. Add three diamonds to the board.<br/><br/>The first player is now ready to take their turn!<br/><br/>Each turn a player can do any, all, or none of the followings in this order:<br/><br/>1) Rotate the cogs by 45&deg; any number of times you like.<br/><br/>2) Pick up one of the cog with its empty side facing up. Orient and place is back down with its track side showing. You may not flip a cog that is occupied by one or more cart.<br/><br/>3) Start moving your cart along a path that connects to the cog your cart currently occupies. Your cart will continue following this path until it encounters an unflipped cog, or your cart has fallen off the board.<br/><br/>- If you encounter an unflipped cog - your cart stop there for the turn.<br/><br/>- If you have fallen off the board, on your next turn you must enter the board from the track where you've fallen off.<br/><br/>As your cart travels along the path you will collect the diamonds on the cogs your cart entered. Any time a diamond is collected pause the cart and immediately add a new diamond to the board if one is available.<br/><br/>Remember that your cart picks up diamond when it arrives at a cog - so a diamond added to a cog that already has a cart on it will not be picked up. It is also possible to have multiple diamonds on the same cog.<br/><br/>Once your cart has come to a stop, your turn has ended.<br/><br/>When all diamonds has been collected, the player with the most diamonds is the winner.<br/><br/>If there are ties - the player who started later in the turn order amongst the tied players is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Train Trek, players experience travel by placing landscape cards each turn. The tracks accumulate into a path for plenty of scoring options. Enjoy this relaxing and carefree game with friends and family, or play it solo. Train Trek is all about that travel vibe and can be enjoyed at home, abroad, at the pub, a restaurant, even on a train!<br/><br/>Players lay a card then decide how to best score it. Should it cover up part of another card, be placed adjacent, maybe turn it upside down to continue a really good track, or even tuck part of it underneath another card. The challenge with finding the perfect placement depend a lot more on what your longer goals may be.<br/><br/>Most scoring options require the connection of two Stations, but each of the four score sheets has a different track scoring. Connect two of the preferred landscape and you&rsquo;re on your way to using your special power to move any one card that doesn&rsquo;t have any other card on top of it. This tricky bit of strategy is going to keep your opponents guessing as you place it in just the right spot for those extra big points!<br/>Let&rsquo;s take a ride on this Train Trek!<br/><br/>Each turn the player will play 1 card from their hand or the face up card in the offer. The placed card can be played partly under another card or two, partly over a card or two, or even next to other cards. Players are encouraged to continue the track, but this is not necessary. <br/> After the card is placed, the player will assess the path they formed with the tracks on the card to another card or more cards that continue the path. In the event of two stations being connected on this path, the player will be able to score in any area of the player sheet as long as they meet the criteria. Or they can ignore the stations and aim for the path to connect multiple landscapes of the same type. Doing so will start to fill a track which allows the player to move a &quot;top&quot; card. Top cards are cards that do not have another card over them. The player can move a Top card to another spot on the landscape of cards to create another scoring opportunity for themselves.  <br/> Players will find plenty of strategy with placing cards and then moving cards to create those scoring paths. There are cards for multiple player counts. In solo play the player will use 18 cards, in two player there are 27 cards that are used giving each player 13 turns. In 3 player there are 36 cards and for4 players 45 cards. No two cards are the same allowing for plenty of variation. Players may which to use the starting card and then shuffle the rest of the cards to form a different deck depending on their player count.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The British Way: Enemy of My Enemy is an expansion for The British Way, including two entirely new games on &ldquo;prequel&rdquo; conflicts using the Malaya and Palestine maps, and also expanding the base game experience with new variants for all four conflicts originally covered. The British Way: Japanese Occupation puts the British and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) on the same side in their efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II. The British Way: Arab Revolt allows players to explore the brutal suppression of the Arab Revolt (1936-1939) that preceded the Jewish insurgency covered by the original Palestine game. The two new games involve entirely new mechanics to capture the unique features of each conflict and can each be linked to the original Palestine and Malaya games, which also allows them to feed into the &ldquo;End of Empire&rdquo; Campaign Scenario. The two new games in the expansion allow players to explore how British attempts to combat earlier threats to colonial rule involved collaborating with local armed groups that they would later end up fighting against (Jewish paramilitary groups in Palestine and the MCP in Malaya), ironically strengthening and preparing these groups for two of the conflicts featured in the The British Way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In Hidden Agendas players take on the role of a political operative, each with their own secret Agenda. Play as the outspoken Activist, the cunning Ambassador, the hot-headed General, the slick Lobbyist, the seasoned Party Leader or the conniving Opposition Party. By creating, debating and voting on Bills, players compete to see their Agenda achieve victory by the end of the game with careful strategy, political maneuvering and a healthy helping of bribery, blackmail and deceit. <br/>Gameplay is a mix of strategy and party-game elements with players having to make calculated decisions about which Legislation cards to play when creating Bills so as not to give away their true intentions. During the debate stage of the game, players will argue for which Bills to Kill and which to Pass into law. Either by enticing rhetoric, or a well-placed bribe of sweet Taxpayer Dollars, players will try to Pass enough Legislation matching their Agenda to win them the game. <br/> &mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On the rare occasions you're allowed out, you've managed to gather a small treasure, which you guard meticulously beside your bed.<br/><br/>Mostly, your days are filled with nothing but the taunts of fellow prisoners and the sneering laughter of the jailers.<br/><br/>Then, on one dark and indistinguishable night, when the jailers have neglected to bring food, the gates of two cells swing open. Your heart pounds with adrenaline&mdash;not to escape, as any sane person might, but driven by all those insults endured, to snatch your rival&rsquo;s treasure.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/>Players find themselves on opposite ends of the Dungeon-Prison map. The objective is simple: navigate through the dungeon, seize the opponent's treasure, and return to your cell first to claim victory.<br/><br/>Each turn, maneuver your character with a strategic pencil flick, then draw an event card that needs immediate resolution. The dungeon throws challenges at every turn, from monsters and magical barriers to perplexing walls, testing every player's resolve.<br/><br/>As you navigate the map, any element you encounter (be it debris or treasure) can be collected:<br/><br/>     Debris: Draw from a deck filled with various equipment and advantageous items that could tilt the scales in your favor.<br/>     Treasure: Capture your opponent&rsquo;s treasure and make a swift return to your cell.<br/><br/><br/>But tread carefully&mdash;the dungeon is fraught with peril, your adversary is unyielding, and your life points are precious. Every move could be your last. Navigate wisely to survive and triumph.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.<br/><br/>Imagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time. Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.<br/><br/>In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.<br/><br/>Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Midnight Hero enables couples to find greater pleasure by using competition to reconcile different preferences and re-introduce novelty.  You will take a journey with your companion to learn what makes them excited and what they shy away from.  This game is not for the timid, because the real-life outcome of your evening is shaped through competition rather than the standard formula.<br/><br/>While this game cannot solve all barriers to intimacy (health issues, sleepless nights with kids, or wider relationship issues  as examples), it is designed to help break down common barriers to sexual intimacy in healthy relationships.  Some of those common barriers are:<br/><br/>Initiation of sex can be an awkward song and dance<br/>Switching from everyday life to being intimate can be a difficult transition<br/>Trying new things can be intimidating, and for some it is hard to even know what to do<br/>Sexual preferences often differ and those differences are frequently ignored rather than explored.<br/><br/>The game is played in 3 phases<br/><br/>In phase 1 you play a game of would you rather.<br/><br/>Step 1:  Deal 10 cards to each player from the foundation building deck<br/><br/>Step 2:  Player 1 reads 2 cards at a time from their deck to player 2 (tip do not show cards while reading)<br/><br/>Step 3:  Player 2 selects their preferred card and the remaining card goes to player 1.  The cards should be distributed face down.<br/><br/>Step 4:  Player 1 repeats steps 2-3 until all cards from their hand are distributed.<br/><br/>Step 5:  Player 2 now follows the same steps 2-4<br/><br/>Step 6:  Both players turn their cards face up and organize by color<br/><br/>Phase 2 you&rsquo;re playing to get to 9 points first.<br/><br/>The board needs to be set up with the bonus cards up top while the scoring cards are in a pile with 5 cards turned over just below that.  The moonlight tokens are stacked below the scoring cards and 2 blocking tokens are given to both players.<br/><br/>The player who has the next birthday starts.  If this isn&rsquo;t your first time playing, the loser from the previous round starts.<br/><br/>A player has 2 options for their turn.<br/><br/>Option 1:  Select 3 moonlight tokens (or 2 of the same color if there are 4 or more of the same color available)<br/><br/>Option 2:  purchase a scoring card<br/><br/>The Scoring cards and foundation cards subsidize future purchases by discounting the purchase price by the number of cards you have.<br/> When a scoring card is purchased the point value purchased is in the upper right hand corner.  The first player to 9 points wins the phase.  <br/> Players may also use their blocking token during their turn.  This does not count as their turn, however it removes the scoring card from the line up.<br/><br/>If a wild card is drawn the scoring cards that have not been purchased need to be reshuffled.<br/><br/>Bonus cards contain no point value and are earned when a player obtains the minimum of scoring cards displayed on the bonus card.  The bonus card holder may be different than the Midnight Hero (winner of phase 2) however the Midnight Hero collects any remaining bonus cards at the end of phase 2.  These do not require an extra turn to obtain but do require to be picked up during the turn of the player securing the bonus card.<br/><br/>Phase 3 is all about rewards.<br/><br/>The Midnight Hero gets to select one foundation card and 3 points worth of consequences from the scoring cards.  The bonus cards are performed before the foundation and scoring cards are performed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These cards are spread openly on the table, then each player in turn picks a card with a word they think nobody drew on their board. Once everyone has had a turn, only the words that were originally dealt should remain on the table, so any face-up card that was not drawn by anyone is a mistake.

        "description": "Lost in Translation is a cooperative game in which players interpret the meaning of unusual expressions from 35 languages. These are expressions that mean something entirely different from the sum of their parts. English examples (not included in the game) would be &quot;to spill the beans&quot; or &quot;to beat around the bush&quot;.<br/><br/>The game consists of cards with one side showing the expression in the original language (and a transcription when non-Roman script is used) and a literal translation into German. The other side shows the actual meaning of the expression. One player draws seven cards from the deck, shuffles them under the table and reads a meaning, then shuffles the cards again and spreads out the cards with the literal translations on the table. The group now has to guess the phrase with that meaning, then flip that card. If correct, the group gains a point. If not, they will flip another card, etc. After flipping ten cards, the game ends and the group tallies their points - the more, the better.<br/><br/>There is also a competitive mode in which players read a literal translation and then write down explanations. A vote on the funniest/most original/most creative answer yields a point; the player with most points after 10 cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Through a series of turns, players will build their crew, acquire ships, trade goods, and complete missions, all in an effort to gain the most victory points by game&rsquo;s end.<br/><br/>In this immersive world, players will encounter four powerful nations, The Spanish, The English, The French, and The Dutch&mdash;vie for dominance, each with its own ambitions and strategies. As you set sail, remember, the seas are not just home to merchants and adventurers but also to ruthless pirates who will stop at nothing to claim their bounty.<br/><br/>Each nation starts with NPC merchant ships laden with riches, tempting targets for daring pirates. These merchant ships sail the seas, carrying valuable cargo waiting to be plundered by those brave enough to attack.<br/><br/>The pirate NPC is a constant threat, lurking on the horizon, ready to pounce on unsuspecting ships. While they chase everyone, their primary targets are those who choose not to engage in combat, making them easy prey for the ruthless pirates.<br/><br/>Provoking the ire of a nation comes with consequences. Once a player attacks a ship of a particular nation, that nation will unleash its naval might. Naval ships from that nation will relentlessly pursue the aggressor, seeking retribution for their attacked brethren.<br/><br/>As a captain, you are not alone in this quest. You can recruit sailors at different ports, each with their own skills and abilities.<br/><br/>Combat between ships and crew is resolved by dice roll; the amount of dice will depend on the specific abilities of the ship or crew.<br/><br/>Ships also use dice roll for movement and the amount of dice will depend on the particular ship.  You have several options at ports as what ship to purchase and use in your adventure.<br/><br/>Your goal is simple: to become the most famous captain on the high seas. But achieving this goal will require more than just skill and cunning. You must be prepared to face challenges from all sides, whether it be battling rival ships, delivering precious cargo to distant ports, or searching for hidden treasure beneath the waves.<br/><br/>Navigate the treacherous waters, recruit skilled sailors, engage in epic battles with other ships, and embark on daring quests for gold and riches, Each player is a sailor looking to be the most famous in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players select from six pre-established factions, each embodying exaggerated caricatures of real-world political personas: Est-Left, Est-Right, MIGA, Libertarian, Leftist, and Alt-Right. Set in a swampy political landscape, players choose a Champion, deploy Heroes, Operatives, Traps, and more in their swamp to strategically engage opponents. The game&rsquo;s turn-based structure involves resource management, card deployment, and attacks, with the objective of diminishing opponents&rsquo; Champion Political Power (PP). &ldquo;Swamp Monsters TCG&rdquo; offers players a unique blend of strategic decision-making and humorous satire, inviting them to navigate a hilarious political arena while strategizing to achieve victory.<br/><br/>In a multi-dimensional universe a rift has opened between the Earth and Mars. From the other side of the Rift, humans of Earth are being manipulated by beings from the planet Devora. Devora has been at war for hundreds of years, and a few beings have learned powerful abilities that allow them to absorb energy from the rift between our world and theirs to gain amazing new powers. This metaphysical energy eminates from humans under great distress, and Devorans have learned they can increase this energy by telepathically connecting to humans to cause chaos on Earth.<br/><br/>This game is a 2-6 player deck building strategy card game, where players compete to be the &quot;last man standing&quot; in a turn base trading card game. To begin, players place a pre-selected Champion card this card is the leader of their deck. After turn order is determined, players take turn moving through the 5 phases of their turn(Draw,Resource,Deployment,Action, and End Turn). Players aim is to deploy Trap, Utility, Event,and Capitol cards to gain a tactical advantage. Persona cards (Heroes and Operatives) are used to defend their Champion and attack enemy Champions. This TCG utilized a three resource system (morale, influence, and crumbling fiat currency) to pay for deploying Persona cards, using abilities, or amplifying card actions.

In each of these regions, they will be challenged by teachers to channel their energy through spelling words. Meet the goal and move to the next challenge with the teacher's praise. Fail and the teacher will make things more difficult. WordWeaver Adventures is highly modular and difficulty of play can be scaled to accommodate a wide variety of play groups and styles. A playthrough can be a breezy 15 minutes or a strategic 60+ minutes. Adventure awaits!<br/><br/>Theme: This game is set in the 18th century Philippines, Vietnam and Japan with animals from each region. The animals are either indigenous to or can be found in those regions. Whenever they are dressed, they are dressed in period specific attire. For example, the Court Musician is a tiger dressed in an 18th century Vietnamese dress (ao dai) and playing a Vietnamese instrument.<br/><br/>How to play: To play the game, players select a region with a corresponding Head Teacher and Assistant Teachers. Players will select an Adventurer board and draw seven tiles to put on their board.<br/><br/>Players will flip over one Assistant Teacher card at a time and be faced with a &quot;Challenge Value&quot; (CV) from that teacher. Each player will spell a word. Once all players have spelled a word, the point values are added up across all players and compared to the CV. If the total is greater then or equal to the CV, then the players will redraw back up to 7 tiles while placing all used tiles back in the tile bag. The next player will then flip over the next Assistant Teacher.<br/><br/>If the players do not meet the CV, the Teacher will &quot;crack a tile slot&quot; of the current player. All players must return all tiles back to the tile bag and then redraw. If a player has a &quot;cracked tile slot&quot; they draw one less tile for each cracked tile slot. For instance, if the current player has one cracked tile slot, they can only redraw 6 tiles instead of seven.<br/><br/>The next player then flips the next card and play continues until all Assistant Teachers have been challenged. The Head Teacher features a much larger challenge and multiple rounds to meet that challenge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sangram is a Hindi word, often used to refer to India's 'struggle' for freedom against colonisers. This game gives players a taste of that struggle through simple mechanics, in just 30 minutes of game time. The aim is to build the strongest army out of all competing kingdoms. But beware....as history has shown us, infighting between the kingdoms makes it easy for foreigners to enter in the name of trade and slowly take over the entire subcontinent.<br/><br/>Players start with 3 warrior cards, each having a 'strength' number which they contribute to the kingdom's army. In each round of the game, first, players send one warrior each to battle, activating the special power of that card. Then, in the order of motivation of those cards, players can recruit 1 extra warrior from the market of volunteer warriors. Unfortunately, these recruited warriors attract some coloniser tokens. So the choice of recruited warriors depends on multiple factors - the coloniser count, motivation, strength and the special power of that card which could be useful later. Finally, in the training phase, all players gain 1 Army strength. However, if players have more than 4 coloniser tokens, they are weakened from within and don't gain that extra 1 Strength in that round.<br/><br/>This mechanic creates a constant tussle between choosing to activate warriors which attack other kingdoms, or warriors which keep the Coloniser tokens from piling up. This was a dilemma that rajas often faced at that time in India. Ultimately the winner is one who finds the fine balance between both paths. The first player to reach an Army Strength of 18, through smart recruitment, attacking opponents and consistent training, becomes all-powerful - the ruler of the entire subcontinent of Bharata!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Zombies roam the city, but you and your dog friends have found refuge in Central Bark. You&rsquo;ll have to cooperate as a pack of dogs to sniff out humans in hiding and bring them back to safety. But beware! The danger of the city could turn your pack feral before you get a chance to build your forever home.<br/><br/>The second edition version of the game features new art, upgraded components, and new playable dog characters!<br/><br/>GDBZ aims to provide players with an immersive dog's-eye-view of the zombie apocalypse. Track down the humans from their smells, lick one another for boosts of energy, and bark at anything and everything!<br/><br/>On their turns, each player may take two actions, which can consist of running to different locations, playing energy cards from their hands, sniffing scent tokens, and giving each other licks in order to draw more energy. Each energy card has an ability, such as: Run, Herd, Bark, Chew, and Good Dog, the last of which allows each dog to perform a unique and powerful ability. Some cards can be chained together for elaborate, tactical turns. At the end of each player's turn they will have to roll the dice in order to add another zombie to the board, which may eat unsuspecting humans or get into Central Bark.<br/><br/>If too many humans are eaten or too many zombies get into Central Bark, the Feral Tracker will reach 10 - and we become wild dogs, forgetting our love of humanity . However, if the players rescue enough humans(6 on easier difficulties, and 8 on expert modes), we all win the game!<br/><br/>",

CENTCOM can also be played by two or more players, controlling different parts of CENTCOM operations. This is explained in the Optional rules.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents from three weeks of intense combat to six months of logistical buildup and counterinsurgency operations.

If after 3 times around no one guesses, the player gives a clue and guessing continues.<br/><br/>The first player to 10 game points wins.<br/><br/>There is also a deck of Spice Up cards, and one is revealed each round, affecting how that round is played, e.g. more or less time, additional letter cards, double points for words that include certain letters, handicaps for certain players, team play, etc.<br/><br/>Words for Nerds contains: <br/>- 75 consonant cards<br/>- 20 vowel cards<br/>- 3 wild cards (shuffled into the consonant deck)<br/>- 25 Spice Up cards<br/>- 1 Bonus Round card<br/>- 6 pencils <br/>- 1 pad of paper for writing words on<br/>- An electronic timer<br/><br/>",

Each game, players set up their town using 5 of 8 locations: Pick up a movie at the Video Store, get high scores at the Arcade, skate at the Roller Rink, grab some Fast Food, hang at the Quick Mart, get the coolest (but not too cool) albums at the Music Store, get the latest fashions at the Mall, or just kill time at the  Comic Book Store. Each of these locations links 80's theme to a classic mechanism - set collection, tile placement, market manipulation, racing, mancala, push your luck, dice rolling, and more.<br/><br/>Players plan their day and then simultaneously move from place to place as they compete to make friends with the coolest kids in town, get invited to the best parties, and complete location specific goals. As you complete goals you make memories by placing cassettes on locations (these represent the songs that bring you back to those summer days). Whoever has the most cassettes after 7 days is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Choose a star to guide your way, then heed or reject the compelling voices of other stars on your journey.<br/><br/>The star card you choose has a goal you must fulfill to find a home for your people. As you travel through the deck, choose between three star cards at a time, each with a number that represents a competing value. Each star card belongs to one of three suits, or sectors, and has two sides that represent heeding or rejecting that star's call. Cards may also have omens that allow you to take paths that you would otherwise miss.<br/><br/>Each choice you make is added to the course you chart through the heavens, a fan at the back of the deck, which will guide the remnant of humanity for millennia to come. Each card you do not choose spins to its opposite side, limiting your choices for the next turn.

In each village lies opportunity for intrepid merchants willing to engage the rangers, delvers, and pilgrims who choose to live in these small settlements off the beaten path. And everyone is talking about the latest news out of Farglen&mdash;it seems the Baroness of the Bards is missing! While on business in Highreach, merchants should keep their ears open for hints of what befell her, as these rumors are of great interest at the Ringway Inn.<br/><br/>This game introduces 2 new modules for enhanced gameplay in the Merchants of the Dark Road game. The first module, Secret Villages, adds 3 new travel locations to the road, expanding the rewards available and increases the opportunities players have to follow one another&rsquo;s travel actions. Along with rules for wagon upgrades, this module adds a light sense of engine-building to the game.<br/><br/>The second module, Ringway Rumors, adds rumor tokens to the game board, as everyone wonders what happened to the Baroness of the Bards. These tokens help make certain district actions (Queen&rsquo;s Commissions, Ruins of Yin, Dark Market) more dynamic and rewarding. They also provide players another opportunity to maximize their sales and strategize when they sell to heroes at the Ringway Inn.<br/><br/>Modules can be easily integrated into the base game and are designed to be played either individually or together. The expansion also adds solo rules for using the module(s) and a new solo/adventure mini-campaign for players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If the experiment results support their hypotheses, player can get more influence on the paradigm board which represents swaying scientific community members to their framework for explaining natural phenomena. Watch out for paradigm-breaking anomalies in the results though, as they can easily lead to a paradigm shift! The game is played in a historical setting, during a transition period between two competing scientific paradigms, and ends once the paradigm shift is complete and one of the two paradigms is debunked by accumulating too many anomalies. Players who have influence on the paradigm board for the winning paradigm are victorious, with the player contributing the most support for the final paradigm crowned leader among the winners.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Develop the imagination using various techniques of surrealism, developed at the beginning of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Retratos en Juego offers 5 gameplay modes:<br/><br/>Automatic Sequence<br/><br/>Deal five cards to each player and leave one face up in the center of the table. Participants must find a link between the letter on display and the portraits they received. Whoever discovers it first will place their card on the table and say it out loud. If the connection is accepted by the group, the game continues and the new search will have to occur with the last supported character. The first person to run out of cards will win. The sequence can be given by aspects linked to the characters (profession, nationality, affiliations) or by the elements that are part of the construction of each portrait. Associations linked to gender do not add up in this type of game.<br/><br/>Surreal Interview<br/><br/>The player on duty takes out a portrait and places it on the table for everyone to see. He must think of a question for said character and write it on a piece of paper, without the rest seeing it. Then he will fold the paper covering the writing and pass it, along with the letter, to the player on the right. Whoever receives the portrait will write the answer, as if they were completely certain about the question, taking the voice of the &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; character. Then they will fold the paper again and pass it to the next player, who must now write a new question, always inspired by that portrait. The game will continue alternating the writing of questions and answers, as many rounds as the group wishes. At the end, whoever asked the first question will unfold the sheet and read the text created with everyone's contribution.<br/><br/>Poetic Metaphors<br/><br/>Place a portrait in view of the entire group. Each player must write a short poetic text or metaphor. They will be able to choose an element present in the portrait and cross it with an adjective or describe the character (without naming it) using what the construction of that portrait generates for them. For example, regarding Fontanarrosa, we could say: &ldquo;His arguments were very sharp.&rdquo; Everyone will write their metaphor on a piece of paper, fold the sheet so that the rest cannot see it, and leave it on the table. One of the participants will read the poetic texts aloud. Then, each player will vote for the one they consider most creative or original, taking into account that they will not be able to choose their own text. They will add one point for each vote obtained. In this game creativity wins!<br/><br/>Who am I?<br/><br/>A card is distributed to each participant. Without looking at it, they will place it on her forehead, leaving it visible to the rest of the group. Taking turns, each person will try to guess which portrait they got by asking questions about certain traits or qualities that she might have. The rest of the group will only be able to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the questions asked. If the answer is yes, you can continue asking until you receive a negative. In this case, it will be the turn of the player on the right to ask. The dynamic will be repeated until someone guesses the character.<br/><br/>Allegation<br/><br/>Based on a portrait obtained at random, one participant challenges another to substantiate or explain the presence of any of the elements with which the portrait is constructed. For example, someone proposes Edgar Allan Poe's &ldquo;black cat&rdquo; and both players have to explain what it means, arguing why it is there. The rest of the team will choose the argument that seemed most convincing to them. Players who spoke will receive one point for each vote obtained.<br/><br/>",

Introduce the neighbors who are there and tell a story where these characters meet.<br/><br/>The sounds of the neighborhood<br/><br/>In turns, each participant takes five cards and puts them face up on the table.

The next player takes another card, says In this room there is, repeating what the first participant said and adds an element that he finds on the new card. He leaves her arranged next to the first one (above, below or to the side) creating a scene. So on, until a player forgets or confuses an element.

Lastly, those with a roof are placed. If on your turn you get another floor again, you will place it next to the previous one, and you must continue adding cards to your construction. Play continues until one player has completed a building or the deck runs out of cards. Whoever has the tallest building wins.

Cada correspond&ecirc;ncia dos dados com as cartas na mesa, junto com as caracter&iacute;sticas do campo, marca um gol para o time correspondente.<br/>Todos tentam descobrir o placar simultaneamente.

Come on, let's learn all about the Numerous Rituals!<br/><br/>アマタノ儀式 (Amatano Gisiki / Numerous Rituals) is a communication game in which players perform rituals using the languages ​​of various cultures. In Interpretation (the cooperative game), players work together to perform as many rituals as they can in 10 minutes. The master speaks the language of another culture, the interpreter translates it, and the other players have to guess the ritual without looking at the language record. In the Study Session (competitive game), students compete to be the best at understanding different cultural languages. Players take turns as the master and exchange questions with each other. This mode tests both your ability to speak and listen to different cultural languages.<br/><br/>Both modes of play use only one language per game. Each language has various characteristics and ranges from easy to difficult to understand. There are 26 different languages ​​included in the Intercultural Languages ​​book. There is also a tutorial and a practice language sheet. As soon as you open the box, you can play and learn the game!<br/><br/>",

Fight to conquer the world and show that you are the one who knows the most! Answer questions, carefully consider the territories you want to conquer, and learn while proving that you are the best in World Challenge Game.<br/><br/>World Challenge Game Asia is a new version set in the Asian continent, featuring a new map, new characters, and new thematic cards. It is played independently from the original World Challenge Game and can be combined with it.<br/><br/>Choose one of the two game modes:<br/><br/>Conqueror, where you conquer as many countries as possible before the game ends, or Attack, where you attack and win countries conquered by other players to take control of the entire continent. In this mode, you can conquer a country that another player has won.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player will draw a card and choose one of the two existing questions, which they must read aloud, along with the four answers. The other participants will write their chosen answer on their card, marking an &quot;X&quot; in options A, B, C, or D. When everyone has answered the question, the answers will be revealed, starting with the player to the left of the one who read the question. If the answer is correct, the player can place a conquest token in an available border country, and the same goes for the rest of the players.<br/><br/>The Conqueror game mode will automatically end once the last country on the continent is conquered. At that time, the countries conquered by each player will be counted, so the player with the most conquered countries will be the winner of the game. If there are two or more players with the same maximum number of conquered countries, tiebreaker questions will be read to them. Players who cannot answer the question lose.<br/><br/>The Attack game mode will end when only one player remains on the continent, who will be crowned the winner.

Working together, they expel the invaders and free the country. But all is not well.

As you sail closer to the sirens' waters with your friends, you hear singing coming from everywhere... Will you collect the most attractive singing voices without falling into temptation?<br/><br/>In The Temptation of Siren, players push their luck to be the first to build sets. On each turn, players may turn over as many Singing Voice cards as they like from the deck and add them to a lineup. Each card contains two sections of color, and a player's turn ends if a fourth matching section of color appears in the lineup. A player may stop at any time and take as many cards as they like from the lineup, as long as they do not have more than three matching sections of color in their area.<br/><br/>Players may trade in their cards for one of the three visible Singing Voice Points cards after or instead of drawing, but not before. The Singing Voice Points cards require different combinations and numbers of color sections, with more challenging combinations being worth more points. The first player to collect 15 points worth of Singing Voice Points cards wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary (translated and adapted from the rules and publisher's description)<br/><br/>",

For if Napoleon won at Waterloo, he would still have to face large Russian and Austrian armies.<br/><br/>Key to the game is the revealing of the Allied forces. When Napoleon arranged his forces at Waterloo most of the Allied forces were hidden behind tall crops, hedges, ridges and other terrain features. So it will be with you - as you make contact with the enemy, their forces will start to be revealed. Perhaps your attack will hit weak troops, or maybe you'll end up facing the British Guard and their fearsome heavy cavalry! Every game will be different and your decisions will determine victory or defeat. The Allies do not just sit back either: They will reinforce, launch cavalry charges and/or infantry attacks and of course the Prussians are on their way&hellip;<br/><br/>The destiny of France is in your hands.<br/><br/>Features<br/>Napoleon at Waterloo is an area movement game of the Battle of Waterloo. Units are generally brigades, and there are over 100 of them as the game includes not just the forces that actually fought at Waterloo but also:<br/><br/>     The entire French Arm&eacute;e du Nord.<br/>     The entire Prussian I, II and IV Corps.<br/>     The Allied forces (Dutch and British Divisions) in reserve at Hal.<br/><br/><br/>A great many options and scenarios are included for variety, such as:<br/><br/>     Uncertain Prussian arrival.<br/>     An early start.<br/>     Reaction of the Allied forces at Hal.<br/>     Blocking the Prussians in the forests.<br/>     Grouchy.<br/>     Different difficulty settings.<br/><br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>     Bombardment Phase.<br/>     Roll Command Dice Phase.<br/>     Expend Command Dice Phase.<br/>     Enemy Reaction Phase.<br/>     Check for Victory/Defeat Phase.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The more animals of a type that you see together, the better &mdash; yet you also want to diversify your sightings, while moving your totem animal toward the pack ice as far as possible.<br/><br/>In Arctic, you move across the landscape and spot animals, creating a pile of animal cards in front of you. The card on top of your personal pile is your &quot;visible&quot; animal card. Each animal card contains four pieces of information:<br/><br/><br/>     A placement value<br/>     The main animal depicted on the card<br/>     A companion animal<br/>     A draw value<br/><br/><br/>At the start of your turn, place as many cards from your hand into your personal pile as the placement value of your visible animal card. (On your first turn, place one animal from your starting hand of three cards.) For each card you can't place, draw a card facedown from the deck and place it in a personal penalty pile. Next, using your new visible animal card, move the token of the main animal forward one space on the landscape and the companion animal backward one space or vice versa. Finally, draw as many animal cards from the &quot;river&quot; of six animal cards as the draw value of your visible animal card. (If you now have more than seven cards in hand, discard into your penalty pile until you have seven.)<br/><br/>Each time you place an animal on your pile, take the matching animal power card from the center of play or whoever currently has it. You can use the listed power each turn for as long as you hold this card, such as moving an animal token an additional space, drawing from your penalty pile, or refilling the river after each card you draw.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, you finish the round, then place cards one more time, then score points. For each type of animal, you score points based on the largest set of consecutive cards of this type you have in your pile. You score a bonus based on the number of sets you've completed. Reveal the animal token you received at the start of the game, and score based on how far it advanced across the landscape. Lose 1 point for each card in your penalty pile. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

However, only the one who deals the final blow to the monster will take home the monster's head as an achievement. Who among you shall achieve the most feats?<br/><br/>In Todome Knights, players have a hand of numbered Knights, Archers, and Beasts. A monster card with its own special abilities is revealed, and players each select a warrior card and simultaneously reveal them. The player who plays the lowest number attacks first, with the number causing that much damage to the demon. If players reveal equal numbers, they are resolved in the order of blue Knight, then yellow Archer, then red Beast (this order matches the color order of a Japanese traffic light). But be careful! Monsters have hidden strengths, making it difficult to predict which attack will claim victory! Sometimes you may even be defeated by the demons.<br/><br/>The player who administers the finishing blow to the monster takes that card as a trophy, which is worth 1 point. If you defeat a monster by hitting its weak point, the trophy is worth 2 points.  After six monsters, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>user summary (adapted and translated from the publisher's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take on the roles of apprentice wizards who visit magical caves to obtain dice that generate magical power. When an apprentice wizard acquires dice scattered in a cave, the magical power flowing from the dice changes the number of dice he holds. The overflowing magical power also affects the apprentice magicians watching from nearby. Only one type of dice can be brought back from a cave. Which apprentice magician will obtain the most magic power?<br/><br/>In Nozoku Dice, you must pay attention to the sides of the dice, not just the top! Players are each assigned a color and start with that color's hand of cards and two of that color's dice. The rest of the dice go to the center of the table. Cards are played by taking a matching die of another player's color and placing it on the card. The one who played the card takes both the primary and secondary actions on the card, capable of affecting the two dice they started with or dice they gain throughout the game. When a die is placed on a card, other players may play cards that match the side of the played die that is facing them. This allows them to take the secondary action. Players don't take back up their cards until they completely run out&mdash;and receive a bonus&mdash;or are unable to take an action when required.<br/><br/>The game ends when all dice of any one color have been removed from the center. Players each choose a number from 1 to 6, and remove all the dice of that color from their acquired dice. Players calculate their magic power by totaling all the remaining dice. The player with the most dice receives a 2-point magic power bonus. The player with the most magic power at the end wins the game. The game also offers solo play.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary (adapted and translated from the rules and publisher's description)<br/><br/>",

The chef player tells the other players or customers which ingredient cards they should flip. For example, &quot;Tomato cheese chicken onion sandwich!&quot; Orders are placed using tokens, so the customers won't forget.<br/><br/>Every time you turn over a card with a correct answer, you receive points and may face greater challenges. If you can guess what the card will be when you flip it over, you receive additional points. What's more, if you flip the last piece of the order, you get a burger completion bonus! But if everyone tries and fails, it will be the chef who flips the final card.<br/><br/>You can stack the round ingredient cards in a staggered manner to create a fun-looking hamburger!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

The more difficult a project is, the more PI you will get, but the more resources it will cost to complete.<br/>The main resources are glass cubes, which represent the material that can be found in a laboratory, and rats, which are used in some investigations.<br/>The game time is measured in months, and each one begins with the Breeding Phase, where we will be provided with money and the rats will breed, followed by the Work Phase, in which the researchers are placed, and ending with the Maintenance Phase, in which everything will be prepared for the following month.<br/>The main board has a calendar that marks the months, the locations where the actions are carried out and the project board.<br/>The game ends when the year ends and that is when the finished projects must be presented. The winner will be the one with the most IP at the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Mechanically, here are the three biggest differences:<br/><br/><br/>     It's a drafting-&amp;-racing game where you start each turn by choosing an itinerary. 1st edition was a set-collection-&amp;-racing game where you start each turn by drawing cards with no thematic meaning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the new edition, you can get special powers for free by going to various destinations, which can be played in combos for big turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     It has a solo mode.<br/><br/><br/>There are many other changes as well. No rule is unchanged.<br/><br/>There are also component upgrades. For example, the art fills out more of each card, and the suitcases are now double-layered cardboard with slots for cubes, instead of cardstock.<br/><br/>Other ways 2nd Edition differs from 1st:<br/><br/><br/>     has quicker-to-learn rules<br/>     has higher decision complexity (gateway+ instead of gateway)<br/>     feels more like traveling<br/>     has more game-to-game variety<br/>     has more turn-to-turn variety<br/>     has more story: better integrated content and gameplay<br/>     is faster to set up<br/>     has an expansion that turns it into a mid-weight strategy game, with asymmetrical player powers<br/>     has less negative player interaction (no blocking, etc)<br/>     no more 1st player advantage<br/>     has bigger &ldquo;big&rdquo; turns (including card combos)<br/>     feels like it rewards you more, in greater variety<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Use them to make a better hand or to determine everyone else's number!<br/><br/>Cards with an identical number are stacked on top of each other, and when there are three piles of stacked cards, the game is over! Should you go out now or wait until your next turn...?<br/><br/>",

Collect relics scattered throughout the dungeon while defeating monsters lurking in the darkness.<br/><br/>The game of まっくらダンジョン (Dark Dungeon) comes with a clear file, multiple dungeons on grid paper, and a &quot;dicil&quot; (combination dice and pencil). By moving a transparent area of the folder over a map, the player has limited visibility as they explore the variety of ready-made maps. You can download &quot;DLC&quot; maps online and even create your own. Players also choose a difficulty level for each game and randomly assign locations for the relics and monsters, creating more replayability.<br/><br/>On each turn, the player writes down the combination of commands they will activate that turn, using the directional arrows (movement), A (Attack), and B (Defend). Combinations of commands allow you to shoot arrows or dash. As you take turns, you lose stamina points but gain skill points, allowing you to strengthen your skills or take more actions. You further increase your abilities by gathering relics, which function both as victory points and useful items, like tools and weapons.<br/><br/>Are you ready to challenge the Dark Dungeon? You can compete in a time attack, gathering as many relics as you can before your timer runs out. Or you can aim for a high score and try to gather all the relics before leaving the dungeon.<br/><br/>",

A group of people appear in front of her, claiming to be trapped in the mansion. They claim to be her allies and plan to find a way out together. Are they really her allies? While she still doubts, Serena joins their escape.<br/><br/>Recollection -リコレクション- is a semi-cooperative game of hidden identities. The main character of the story, Serena, and the five characters surrounding her act according to their own motives. The game will be different each time, so you can enjoy it even more by imagining the story as you play.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of the characters, secretly divided into factions of allies aiming to escape and traitors trying to prevent an escape. Players also have a secret mission they must complete before the game ends. If players successfully complete quests in the revealed rooms, they can obtain items essential to their escape. But if they fail, there will be a penalty. Each character has their own physical strength and mental status, and if either of them reaches zero, they become incapacitated and will be unable to do anything for a period of time, so be careful!<br/><br/>Every 12 in-game hours, a story card will activate. Once all story cards have appeared, the time limit is reached&nbsp;and the game ends. Determine which players share your faction, work together, and achieve your victory conditions within the time limit!<br/><br/>",

Elfric&rsquo;s magic also manifested itself in the form of a deadly gaze from a gem-like third eye in his forehead that could shatter armour and boil away flesh. Only with great effort and the aid of many allies was Sl&aacute;ine able to halt Elfric&rsquo;s rampages across space and time, yet the demonic being was never utterly destroyed and will doubtless return to plague humanity another day.<br/><br/>Els were creatures from another dimension that exists at a right angle to our own. Dark-Els were evil beings, intent on spreading destruction for Crom Cruach. Sometimes these took the form of seductive human women to lure their prey into traps.

Command two unique decks - the Tactics Deck and the Eco Deck - to outwit your opponents and claim victory.<br/>The Tactics Deck is your arsenal for political maneuvering. Play Action Cards to influence the political landscape, enact sweeping changes with Policy Cards, and outsmart your rivals with clever Trick Cards. Will you sway public opinion, forge alliances, or orchestrate a cunning power play?<br/>Meanwhile, the Eco Deck fuels your economic engine. Construct a thriving industrial empire with Industry Cards, engage in economic warfare with Basic Attack Cards, and defend your assets with Basic Defense Cards. Cultivate the support of communities through Community Cards and watch your nation prosper.<br/>Choose your path to power in one of three captivating game modes:<br/>1) Polarity of War: Form teams and protect your designated &quot;polarity&quot; player while aiming to dismantle opposing teams. The last polarity standing reigns supreme as the ultimate superpower.<br/>2) Brawl Survivor: Every player for themselves! Navigate the treacherous political landscape, strategically utilize your cards, and outlast your rivals to emerge as the sole survivor.<br/>3) 1 on 1: Engage in intense head-to-head battles, adapting to new roles every three rounds as you strive to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory.<br/><br/>With unexpected twists and turns introduced by Opportunity Cards and the ever-present element of chance with Dice Cards, Polarity of Power guarantees an engaging and unpredictable experience. Manage your resources wisely, leverage the unique abilities of your Role Card, and forge your path to political and economic dominance.<br/><br/>Opportunity Cards in Polarity of Power<br/>Opportunity Cards inject dynamism and unexpected twists into Polarity of Power, ensuring each game is a unique experience. These cards represent unforeseen events, challenges, or opportunities that can dramatically shift the political landscape.<br/>Drawing Opportunity Cards:<br/>Timing: Opportunity Cards are drawn at the beginning of each round, before any player takes their round.<br/>Who Draws: In Polarity of War and Brawl Survivor modes, players take rounds drawing Opportunity Cards, following the established term order. For example, if Team A starts the round in Polarity of War, they draw the first Opportunity Card. In the next round, Team B would draw, and so on. Similarly, in Brawl Survivor, Player A would draw first, then Player B in the following round, etc.<br/>1 on 1 Mode: Players alternate drawing Opportunity Cards at the start of each round.<br/>Executing Opportunity Cards:<br/>Immediate Effect: The effects of Opportunity Cards are resolved immediately upon being drawn. Players must adapt their strategies and actions accordingly.<br/>One-Time Use: Once an Opportunity Card is drawn and resolved, it is removed from the game for that particular playthrough. This ensures that each game presents unique challenges and prevents repetition.<br/><br/>Examples of Opportunity Card Effects:<br/>1)Sudden Economic Boom: Grants bonus National Power to all players with Industry Cards in specific sectors.<br/>2)Political Scandal: Forces a player to discard cards or lose Popularity Points.<br/>3)Natural Disaster: Damages Industry Cards or disrupts resource generation.<br/>4)Technological Breakthrough: Provides a temporary advantage or unlocks new strategic options for a player.<br/>5)Shifting Public Opinion / Issues: Influences Popularity Points for players based on their Role Cards or recent actions.<br/><br/>Opportunity Cards add a layer of excitement and unpredictability to Polarity of Power. They force players to think on their feet, adapt their strategies, and capitalize on sudden opportunities or overcome unexpected challenges. This dynamic element keeps players engaged and ensures that each game is a thrilling and unique experience.<br/><br/>Player Actions on Their Turn in Polarity of Power<br/>A player's turn in Polarity of Power is a strategic dance of managing resources, playing cards, and maneuvering for political and economic dominance. Here's a breakdown of the actions a player can take during their turn:<br/>1. Draw Cards:<br/>Choose a Deck: At the start of their turn, the player chooses to draw from either the Tactics Deck (Action, Policy, Trick cards) or the Eco Deck (Industry, Basic Attack/Defense, Community cards). This choice allows players to tailor their strategy based on their current goals and the game state.<br/>Draw Two Cards: The player draws two cards from their chosen deck, adding them to their hand.<br/>2. Play Cards:<br/>Card Selection: The player can choose to play any number of cards from their hand, as long as they have the required Action Points (AP) to activate them.<br/>Card Types and Effects: Each card type has unique activation conditions and effects.<br/>Action Cards: Immediately trigger political events or actions.<br/>Policy Cards: Enact lasting changes to the game's rules or conditions.<br/>Trick Cards: Played face-down and activated under specific circumstances to manipulate the game.<br/>Industry Cards: Placed on the field to generate National Power and represent economic ventures.<br/>Basic Attack/Defense Cards: Used to attack opponents' industries or defend against attacks.<br/>Community Cards: Provide strategic actions and have cooldown periods.<br/>3. Manage Resources:<br/>Action Points (AP): Players start each round with a set number of AP (typically 5-7). Each card played has an AP cost, which is deducted from the player's available AP pool or Use the round tracker to mark the AP spent and keep track of your remaining AP for the turn.<br/>(Players recover their Action Points (AP) at the beginning of each new turn. This means that any unspent AP from the previous turn do not carry over)<br/>National Power (NP) and Popularity (PT): Players need to carefully manage their NP and PT levels, as reaching zero in either results in elimination. Industry Cards and certain card effects can increase NP, while Policy Cards and other actions can influence PT.<br/>4. Other Actions:<br/>Negotiate and Form Alliances: Players can engage in discussions and negotiate deals with other players, depending on the game mode and their current objectives.<br/>React to Opponents: Players can respond to their opponents' actions by playing cards or utilizing abilities on their Role Card.<br/>5. End Turn:<br/>Discard Down to 2-3 Cards: At the end of their turn, the player must discard cards from their hand until they have a maximum of cards (typically 2-3)remaining. This ensures a dynamic flow and prevents players from hoarding cards.<br/><br/>The combination of card play, resource management, and strategic decision-making makes each player's turn in Polarity of Power a captivating and impactful experience. Mastering the various card types and their interactions is key to achieving victory in this dynamic and engaging game.<br/><br/>Game End and Victory Conditions in Polarity of Power<br/>The climax of Polarity of Power arrives when specific conditions are met, leading to the game's end and the crowning of a victor. Victory conditions and the path to success vary depending on the chosen game mode, adding to the game's replayability and strategic depth.<br/>1) Polarity of War:<br/>Game End: The game concludes when only one &quot;polarity&quot; player remains on the stage. This means all other teams have had their polarity player eliminated by having their National Power (NP) or Popularity (PT) reduced to zero.<br/>Winning: The team with the last surviving polarity player is declared the winner. Their ability to strategically protect their polarity while dismantling opposing teams leads them to triumph and the prestigious title of &quot;Superpower.&quot;<br/>2) Brawl Survivor:<br/>Game End: The game ends when only one player remains on the stage. All other players have been eliminated by having their NP or PT depleted to zero.<br/>Winning: The last player standing is crowned the victor, having outmaneuvered and outlasted all rivals in the fierce battle for political survival.<br/>3) 1 on 1:<br/>Game End: Similar to Brawl Survivor, the game concludes when one player's NP or PT reaches zero, resulting in their elimination.<br/>Winning: The remaining player, having successfully navigated the challenges of shifting roles and strategic card play, emerges as the champion of this intense head-to-head battle.<br/><br/>General Gameplay Flow:<br/>While the specific victory conditions differ across game modes, the core gameplay loop involves players strategically utilizing cards from the Tactics and Eco Decks to influence the political landscape, develop their economic power, and ultimately, ensure their survival or their team's victory.<br/>1) Turns and Rounds: Players take turns within each round, drawing cards, playing cards from their hand, managing resources like Action Points (AP), National Power (NP), and Popularity (PT), and reacting to opponents' moves.<br/>2) Opportunity Cards and Dice Cards: These elements introduce unexpected events and chance, forcing players to adapt their strategies and adding to the excitement.<br/>3) Card Interactions and Abilities: Players leverage the unique effects of different card types and their Role Card abilities to gain advantages and outmaneuver their opponents.<br/><br/>In essence, Polarity of Power is a game of strategic decision-making, resource management, and adapting to a dynamic and ever-changing political and economic landscape. Players must carefully choose which cards to play, when to play them, and how to best utilize their resources to achieve victory in their chosen game mode.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

These card suits wind around each other like a DNA double helix.<br/><br/>LOVE(LA)PLACE is a deck of cards that includes the numbers 0 to 19 in 3 suits. However, each number only exists in two of the three suits (with the exception of 0, 10, and 19, of which there is only one of each, with 0 being an unsuited card). Rules for many games were available on the publisher's website following the LOVE(LA)PLACE's release.<br/><br/>Triangular Situation, the rules that shipped with the deck, is a must-follow trick-taking game for two or three players. As for each turn, Players must play a card that matches the led suit, with the 0 card acting as a wild that may be played at any time. Regardless of suit, the highest card wins, with ties going to the later card played. In a 2-player game, a player sets aside their winning card where it can be seen, because the round ends when a color has won three tricks. The final winning card of the round is set aside and the other cards are returned to the deck, and when a color has won three rounds the last player who won with that colors wins the entire game.<br/><br/>The rules for a 3-player game, except the lead passes to the left instead of alternating, the winning card for each round is recorded and mixed back in with the other cards,<br/><br/>Before each round begins, players may play one face-down card for a maximum of three throughout the game, which will work toward a tiebreaker.&nbsp;If no color wins three times before players run out of cards, players compete in a round-long tiebreaker involving any cards turned face-down.<br/><br/>",

Earn kobans (large Japanese golden coins) as a prize for the heads of villains killed by your kunoichis. Each night, you must launch one assault after another until the end of the game. But the key to winning may be deciding when to hold back...<br/><br/>In 10 Kunoichis, each player has a hand made up of the ten ninja cards. Villains are drawn and laid out, and players may choose one of their ninjas to attack. Choose carefully, because only certain ninjas can attack the different villains. When all players who chose a card are ready, everyone calls out &quot;Seibai!&quot; (Punish!) and reveal their cards. If only one player plays a card, they will defeat all the villains they can. If multiple players are involved, ninjas act from fastest to slowest, with lower numbers being faster. Each ninja defeats all the villains they can before the next ninja begins. Play continues until all ninjas are played or the villain deck runs out.<br/><br/>To keep everyone on their toes, each player may also declare &quot;Ninpo!&quot; once per game. Declaring Ninpo reverses the speed of the ninjas, with 10 becoming the fastest and 1 the slowest. The effect remains until another player declares &quot;Ninpo!&quot; and the speeds return to normal.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most kobans is the winner. Keep an eye out for the round where the Evil Merchant appears, because he doubles the value of all villains currently in play!<br/><br/>&mdash; adapted from the publisher's description<br/><br/>",

You gather the students to start a new life in the dormitory you oversee. Students who want friends with similar hobbies, students who want someone with similar passions, students who want more variety in their community...  Build a sisterhood that satisfies all their requests and build the reputation of your dormitory family!<br/><br/>In Planetary Sisters, players draft a set of cards representing students with a variety of interests and contributions. Each player has a personal deck that they draw their hand from, with their hand representing the dormitory full of students. The cards in their hand are used to acquire cards from the central tableau. Players must decide which cards they would like to get rid of, but those cards may be taken by other players. Players must also take into account how the cards they use and acquire relate, because the difference between them affects who will be start player for the following round.<br/><br/>After players have drawn all their cards and drafted their full dormitory, cards are scored. Cards show one or more elements; there are common elements, such as Food and Animals, and less common elements, like Axe and Shield. There are also rare, unique elements, like Knight and Queen. Points are scored using special formulas involving the number of elements and the number of cards containing those elements. Bonuses are rewarded based on how the player's dormitory related to the cards left in the tableau. The 2-player rules add variety to the way a player's final hand and the tableau create a score.<br/><br/>",

Will the baggage pass through the door or not? If it doesn't pass, will the goblins be burned by the Demon Queen's hellfire!?<br/><br/>Players take on the role of the Demon Queen's goblins, and it's their job to decide if items in the real world around them will pass through the castle's doors. At the beginning of each round, a door card is drawn. A corresponding colored string shows the physical size of that door opening, and each player may examine that string for 5 seconds. Then a command card is drawn, with an item such as the top of a desk or the length of a curtain. The designated player chooses an item in the real-life environment that matches the item. If no item matches the command card, the turn ends and the next player begins by drawing a new command card.<br/><br/>Players vote whether the item or the door opening is larger. If all players vote the same way, the turn ends. If the decision is split, the item is measured and the correct players each receive a point. If only one player is correct, they gain extra points depending on the round. The game ends once round 4 is completed, the command cards run out, or a player scores their seventh point. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You are a little-known hero from a place called &ldquo;Earth.&rdquo; They think you have what it takes to help save their planet from total annihilation. Being a kindhearted soul, you are happy to help this poor planet and its people. There is only one problem, though: due to the war, the economy has fallen into shambles.

Other well-known heroes won&rsquo;t even think about taking Banana Bitz as payment or even as a gift! Fear not! There are those who are willing to work for this crypto-currency: monkeys and heroes that really, really need the work. You can ask heroes such as Chinchebula or Star Fish to help defend TerraFyte. They are willing to take any form of payment. Will you use military might to destroy the other planet? Or will you use diplomacy to end this war?<br/><br/>TerraFyte, created by the small indie group Arkidogo Interactive, is a customizable card game featuring a 6x2 board for intense 1v1 battles. Think Magic the Gathering meets Hearthstone with a space twist&mdash;imagine monkeys in spaceships battling it out, inspired by old RTS games and featuring charming pixel art. Players take turns at the same time switching priority to see who plays next. The game has a rhythm that most card games do not have.

        "description": "You've been invited to a parade in Wonderland! You were excited to attend, but it looks like they haven't settled on the order of the parade. If you leave it up to the residents of Wonderland, there's no telling when the parade could start. &quot;We'll never get anywhere like this!&quot; shouts the Queen of Hearts. &quot;Let's ask a third party to decide it fairly!&quot; And just like that, you're in charge. Choose how you want to organize the parade, and let's get this show on the road!<br/><br/>In アリスは１番前がいい (Alice should be in front), five Row Cards showing residents of Wonderland (the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, Alice, and the White Rabbit) form a parade line. There is a deck of Resident Cards showing these same residents, with each card displaying a priority letter from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;H&quot; and a majority value of 1, 1.5, or 2. All of a character's Resident Cards show the same action, but they will have different letters and values. Each player has a hand of two resident cards, and there is a common area with as many face-up resident cards as there are players.<br/><br/>Each turn, all players choose one of the cards in their hand and reveal it simultaneously. Players then acquire a card from the common area in order of priority. The played card's ability then activates, which rearranges the Row Cards in the parade, and the played card is placed in a column of matching cards in front of the player. After a pre-determined number of rounds have passed, the Row Cards in the 2nd and 4th positions are &quot;awakened&quot; and flipped over, revealing additional scoring rules.<br/><br/>After a number of turns have passed based on the player count, players receive victory points. A player receives 1 victory point if they have the highest value of Resident Cards for a character. The character at the front of the parade line is worth 2 victory points. Players also receive bonuses based on the awakened Row Cards. If any player has reached 10 victory points, the game ends, and the player with the most victory points wins. If that condition isn't reached, the game continues until someone reaches 10 points, with the ties going to the player who scored the most points in the final round.<br/><br/>",

Soon it will expand and swallow up the rest of the land. Some of you have a nearby hamlet or village you call home. Some of you have heard that there are great and ancient secrets hidden in the Valley. Some of you long for a chance to prove your prowess. But all of you agree that the fog must be stopped before it poisons the world.<br/><br/>Echoes of the Sundering is a 1-5 player cooperative, open-world, deck construction adventure taking over 30 hours to complete.

The story reacts to players' decisions and no two play-throughs will be the same!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As they hunt through the primordial jungle depths of the valley, they discover ancient horrors that not only threaten to unravel their minds, but to end their lives as well! When the casualties mount, the men of Vulture Squad must abandon their human nature and give in to their savage instincts in order to survive!   ​<br/><br/>Embark on a suicide mission within the lush jungle valley, taking on the role of either Vulture Squad or the Dogs of War. Your objective is to outsmart and hunt your opponent while swiftly completing the mission. In this primeval jungle, danger takes many forms! Beware not only of enemy soldiers but of the jungle valley's dinosaurs that stalk the jungle with predatory intent. Their gaze is fixed and their stomachs yearn to feast on the ultimate prey... You!​<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of the first book, Opiate Undertow, players have access to 3 In-Game factions; the Americans, the Russians, and the Dinosaurs!<br/><br/>Each match centers around a series of Objectives that a player must complete in order to achieve their mission and win the game. The game is centered around 3 game modes:<br/><br/>​Primitive Warrior: Players take control of either Human faction and compete against each other and achieve victory on behalf of their country. Players can play a free-mode game, a pre-written scenario, or a full campaign based on the events that took place in the first novel as well as all new missions created by the series' Author!<br/><br/>Hunted: Players take control of either the Humans or Dinosaurs to compete in a battle of tenacity and wits. Each player has two objectives, Survive and Hunt! Players can play a free-mode match or a scenario based on the events of the first novel!<br/><br/>Primitive War: It's a three-way fight for supremacy in the Valley! The Americans face off against the Russians to complete their mission... but the jungle is filled to the brim with vicious dinosaurs that are looking to make the invasive humans their lunch! Who will walk away victorious?<br/><br/>Primitive War: The Miniatures Game is a Tabletop Skirmish Game that uses a modified set of rules from Clone-a-Saurus that combines traditional wargaming with the fluid and chaotic violence of a rampaging dinosaur!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

If the value rolled is equal to or greater than the sum of the Track cards, rotate the Speed card to the next higher Speed.<br/><br/>If the value rolled is less than the sum of the Track cards, do not rotate the Speed card.

        "description": "At a magic school where aspiring magicians gather from all over the world, a dangerous group of girls are on a deadline! After a long vacation, five students haven't started summoning class assignment that's due tomorrow. The assignment: Catch a devil in your magic cauldron. Even if a student stayed up all night, it would be impossible. After trying to figure out how to finish in a signle day, they have an idea. &quot;What if we stay up all night and work together?&quot; So, five classmates have one last chance. Can they finish the assignment tonight, or will the night finish them?<br/><br/>オールナイトサモナー (All Night Summoner) is a cooperative game that for 1 to 5 players. If the player secures all the Tasudebi-kun Cards in in the deck before the timer reaches the skull, the players win. If the timer passes the skull, all players lose. In the advanced modes, if more than 3 Tasudebi-kun Cards are in play at once, the players will also lose.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player summons 1 to 3 Spirit Cards. Matching Spirits are stacked together in columns. Players then use either one matching Spirit Card or two different Spirits to form a contract with a one Spirit, which puts the Spirit face-up in front of them. The cards spent on the contract turn into Magic Points, which may be used to cast spells unique to each character. After drawing a new card, players may capture Tasudebi-kun Cards by paying matching contracted Spirits. If the timer has not reached the skull at this time, player now advance the timer. Be careful! Once the timer hits the red zone, players experience a Summoner's High, and they are no longer able to speak except to say &quot;Dangerous!&quot; Fortunately, they can also accomplish more than one contract per turn.<br/><br/>If any Spirit column contains three or more matching Spirits, it causes a rampage! The Spirits are discarded and the timer advances one space for each type of Spirit discarded. Players generally have one more turn to finish the game after the timer runs out, but if a rampage pushes the timer past the skull, the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>The first edition of All Night Summoner includes a crossover collaboration! Roko, one of the students from Discipline: 3 Years at Jeremiah School of Magic and Witches Whisk by 636GAMES, is available as a fully playable character.<br/><br/>",

By rolling dice you will choose an area of your homestead for you and your neighbor to work in.<br/><br/>Each round has two phases. In the work phase, you will roll dice to select areas of your homestead in which to build features that improve your ability to grow vegetables, canned goods, cultivate plants, collect water, and raise livestock. In the market phase, you will use your resources to contribute to community events or make delicious authentic recipes. If either of these doesn&rsquo;t appeal, you can collect free goods from the community market to aid you in later rounds.<br/><br/>By fully cultivating an area of your homestead, stockpiling your goods for the troubled times ahead, utilizing your harvest to make a recipe or contributing to events, you will earn prestige trophies and victory points.<br/><br/>The player with the most prestige points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Are you ready to dig your way to victory?<br/><br/>Victory Garden is a light roll/flip-and-write game, designed for ages 12+.

The player will look at all the answers and arrange them in the order they believe they fit on the  TIER LIST.

Alongside rondel and dice drafting mechanics, determining how you will attack, how far you can delve into the dungeon, and what you will find, it also introduces an innovative and immersive fighting system, allowing players to almost feel every hit they deal to a monster. It is also crucial to hit specific parts of the monster&rsquo;s body to finish it faster or disable some of its abilities. Each beast presents a different challenge, with unique skills and behaviors. During the game, players will also level up their heroes and delve into different dungeons full of traps, locked doors, treasures, and other surprises. Their goal will be different depending on the current quest.<br/><br/>The game will include a roguelike solo mode.<br/><br/>Rules are going to be translated into several languages, however the game itself is 100% language-independent.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The first player must roll the die before their turn to determine the beginning market value. Then they may begin their turn.<br/><br/>During the initial game setup, the first player rolls to determine the market value and places the treasure chest on the corresponding section of the market sheet.

The next player then takes their turn but will only roll for the new market value on their subsequent turn, after the market sheet has made a full round.<br/><br/>Each ingredient has two sides, a shown side and a hidden side. The shown side consists of two colors. The hidden side of the ingredient has a number (1-3) and a piece of a larger recipe. Each image is made up of six ingredients, and your goal is to collect as many ingredients from the same recipe as possible. Each recipe is a unique color, so collecting ingredients with matching colors is the name of the game!<br/><br/>The first player to collect all six ingredients of any matching color completes their dish and immediately wins the game!

        "description": "The Witches Council has issued a decree announcing that the relics to the major powers would be hidden at the top of the mountain Great Peak. Each family of witches decides she has to find them for their own benefit. The Woodbane will seek to expand their power; Rowanwand the desire to acquire the knowledge contained in these relics, the Vikroth (great warriors) will draw a new combat power; the Brightendale use them to improve their medical knowledge; Burnhide exploit the relics in their search for crystals and precious metals; Wyndenkell want to use the relics to discover new spells, and Leapvaughn, although taking the whole thing lightly, just as much wish recover these invaluable artifacts. All players, as members of one of these great families, will leave in search of relics in a race to the summit of Great Mountain Peak. They must overcome obstacles and use all their expertise to thwart magick spells cast against them by their opponents. The players use dice to move their characters between the different locations, some spaces will award them with relics and some will have consequences (like the loss of an item). Collect the cards with the right items to cast the different spells and get advantages in the game. In their ascent, they can branch off to adjacent trails that will lead them in the forest of Westwood, the old Methodist cemetery, the dark cave and shop practice magick. These paths will allow them to earn magick potions helping them cancel the spells that will be inflicted. The first player to reach the summit of the mountain then retrieve the relics and will be declared winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The dark monsters of Greek mythology have gathered for one final assault on Mount Olympus. The Greek gods are prepared to defend their sacred ground. Who will prevail in this decisive battle of blood and Ichor?<br/><br/>Ichor is an asymmetric strategy game for 2-players by Reiner Knizia.  In this mythological battle of wits, one player controls the Greek gods while the other controls the Greek monsters.  On your turn, you&rsquo;ll simply move one of your figures in a straight line as far as you wish, leaving behind a trail of your tokens on each space you pass over.  You can never move onto or over a space containing another figure, but you can replace opposing tokens with your own.  The first player to get all of their tokens on the board wins.<br/><br/>Each figure possesses a unique ability that can only be used once per game. Thus, the winner will be the one who best leverages their abilities, sets themself up for big plays, and blocks their opponent from doing the same.<br/><br/>Reiner Knizia has developed and evolved Ichor from previous versions of this elegant design by:<br/><br/>     Polishing the existing character abilities while adding new ones<br/>     Introducing an advanced gameplay expansion that features powerful gate tiles and even more gods and monsters (called the Reinforcements &amp; Gates expansion)<br/>     Focusing the competition on a dual-play experience that grows in tension<br/>     Providing nearly 50 million possible setups thanks to 2 game boards, 24 characters, and 8 gate tiles<br/><br/><br/>Ichor is the second game in the Mythos Collection, a line of 2-player titles by Bitewing Games featuring strategy and mythology.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pieces connected by ruled lines form a group and grow in size. However, only groups with an odd number of pieces can survive, so any even groups of that player remaining after the end of the turn are removed from the board.<br/>Depending on the placement of the pieces, an enemy piece can be flipped over like in Othello by pinching it in a straight line to become your piece (multiple pieces, multiple directions are possible). By eating enemy pieces (Eat) they grow larger like an amoeba.<br/>The game is over when two players have finished placing all their pieces. At that point, all even groups on the board are removed.<br/>The player with the largest group wins.<br/><br/>The key to the game is that no even-numbered groups can survive.<br/>Test play can be done with Othello pieces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players move their abbots along these corridors, strategically selecting rows or columns from the grid to acquire the most coveted artifacts. Utilizing abbot cards, players can execute sequences that emulate &quot;The Rule of Saint Benedict.&quot; Successfully aligning their plays with these revered guidelines rewards players with powerful bonus cards, enhancing their ability to dictate the course of the game.<br/><br/>Scoring in Treasures of Bornem Abbey demands both tactical acumen and foresight, as players must assemble their collections according to specific patterns to amass points.

        "description": "COLOR STACK is an abstract game for two players in which the dice serve as pawns. The objective is to roll four different colors of dice: red, blue, yellow, and green. The board is randomly generated with cards, so unlike chess, the strategy changes each time.<br/><br/>Each player has three dice of two different colors in his or her hand. On his or her turn, the player chooses one of the following two actions.<br/><br/>     Move his or her dice as many times as the number of eyes on the board.<br/>     Change the number of eyes on your dice to the number you want.<br/><br/><br/>For example, a dice with a 6 can be moved 6 squares, and a dice with a 3 can be moved 3 squares.<br/><br/>The dice must be moved by exactly the number of eyes, but once a square is passed, it cannot be passed.<br/><br/>If there is another dice on a square with exactly the same number of dice, it can only be stacked on top of it if it is &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; than the dice on top of it. The dice on top of the dice are moved together with the dice on top of the dice.<br/><br/>Dice have a strength, the smaller the number of dice, the stronger the dice. In other words, the harder the dice are to move, the stronger they are. The exception to this rule is 1, which is weaker than 6.<br/><br/>When the strengths are the same, they can be stacked. So, to be precise, if the strength of the dice you are moving is greater than or equal to the strength of the dice in the square you are stopping on, you can stack the dice.<br/>The key to strategy is the placement of the dice. Since you cannot pass through a square once you have passed through it, dice with large eyes cannot be utilized unless there is a large space available.<br/><br/>It is important to place your dice well to block the opponent's dice movement.<br/><br/>Let's begin!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publiser<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Breaking the Siegfried Line, 1944<br/><br/>On 11 September 1944, a patrol from the U.S. 5th Armored Division crossed the German border, beginning a campaign that would last three and a half months and cost over 140,000 casualties as the Americans tried to break through the Siegfried Line defenses, known to the Germans as the West Wall.<br/><br/>Dragon&rsquo;s Teeth is a complete Panzer Grenadier game based on these epic battles, as America took the fight into Nazi territory. German resistance had crumbled during the long retreat across France, but it now grew much more resolute on German soil, while the Americans had gained combat experience and sought to end the war.<br/><br/>Dragon&rsquo;s Teeth includes 495 die-cut playing pieces, most of which originally appeared in our long out-of-print Battle of the Bulge game. There are also four heavy cardstock maps, and 42 scenarios organized in our popular story-arc format with historical background to put the scenarios in their context and battle games to tie them together.<br/><br/>Dragon&rsquo;s Teeth comes in our Playbook format: everything you need to play, except dice, inside a book.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Defying the whispers of downfall that echoed through the ages, The Eternal City stands stronger than ever with its marble edifices casting shadows over three millennia of unbroken rule. As the fading health of the Emperor looms over the empire, the stage is set for a epic struggle among the Imperators vying for the throne's mantle. Each Imperator must assemble a Cadre of loyalists and champions drawn from the diverse tapestry of Roman society. From the elite Praetorian Guards to the elusive Thieves, every choice carries weight, shaping not only the outcome of battles but the very fate of the empire itself. As the Bank of Aureus overflows with the lifeblood of the city, fortunes rise and fall as Imperators strive to amass the wealth and influence needed to secure their claim to the throne. Yet, amidst the clash of steel, one truth remains: in the Eternal City, only the strongest will ascend to rule.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Recruit a variety of Fidelis (Loyalists) to form a strategic Cadre (Army) that will protect your Imperator (Commander). Aquire enough funds from the Bank of Aureus to afford the cost of your Fidelis actions. Weaken your opponent&rsquo;s Cadre until only their Imperator remains. Remove them from their power position with one final attack. Last Imperator remaining claims the throne of the Eternal City.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Civil War Board Games #1: The Civil War Begins game is set during the American Civil War. It's a 2 player game where players are attempting to capture 3 enemy spaces on the board. They do this by rolling the dice and adding or removing counters to the board. When they add counters to a troop icon they are able to &quot;fight&quot; the other player's spaces by using Rock,Paper,Scissors' as a determiner of who wins the round.<br/><br/>Background/Context: During the Civil War, women played vital roles both on the home front and directly on the battlefield. With men leaving to fight, women took over responsibilities traditionally considered masculine, such as managing farms, businesses, and even operating as spies for both the Union and Confederate forces. In this game it allows players to fight for control of the United States and also see how women had to help out in the men's old jobs.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/><br/>     When a player adds 3 counters to 3 separate enemy spaces, they win.<br/>     OR, when one player has beaten all the other player&rsquo;s troops.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Instructions - Setup<br/><br/>     Union &ndash; place a blue counter on all of your icon spaces. Place 5-10 blue counters in your stockpile icons.<br/>     Confederate &ndash; place a red counter on all of your icon spaces. Place 5-10 blue counters in your stockpile icons.<br/><br/><br/>Instructions &ndash; Gameplay<br/><br/>     Each player rolls the dice and follows the instructions for each number, listed on the gameboard.<br/><br/><br/>Extra Gameplay Notes<br/><br/>     Players have extra counters they add to the game from their stockpile.<br/>     When a player rolls the number 1 or 2, they remove a counter from the other player&rsquo;s side, and give it back to the<br/><br/><br/>enemy&rsquo;s stockpile.<br/><br/>     When a player rolls the number 3 or 4, they take a counter from their own stockpile.<br/>     When a player rolls a 5 or 6, they do NOT take the counter from their stockpile. They must use a counter already on<br/><br/><br/>the board to capture an empty enemy tile.<br/><br/>     When a player rolls a 6, they must have a counter on the troop to fight. They need to play &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; to remove the other player&rsquo;s counter and replace it with their own. The winning player must move its own troop into the enemy territory. (It does not get an extra counter to replace the icon it moved from).<br/>     Red and blue counters cannot occupy the same space, unless you roll a 6 and are in the middle of a &lsquo;Rock, Paper,<br/><br/><br/>Scissors&rsquo; fight. Variations<br/><br/>     Players can choose to play the game where you are able to stack counters.<br/>     Players can vary the amount of counters they begin with on their board.<br/>     Play the game where the players do not put the &lsquo;taken&rsquo; counters back into their stockpile.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the French Republican forces lead by general Faidherbe trying to reduce the pressure on the siege of Paris and threatening the Prussian line of supply running from Germany to Paris. The other player is in command of three strong German corps who must prevent this threat and destroy the French Army.<br/>This is an operational game, with hidden corps, division, columns or dummies evoluting on the map featuring the northern part of France, from Rouen to Lille and Amiens, one turn for one week. The map represents all major cities, fortresses, main roads and railroads, based on point to point movements. Infantry, cavalry, artillery and siege artillery units are placed on boards for each nominative combat force on the map. Their status is follow-up on this board ; full or reduced strength, supplied or unsupplied, their tired level &ndash; rested &ndash; tired &ndash; exhausted -. Normal and railroad movements are done through activation shits. Initiative may switch from one side to the other, depending on the number of combat forces moved on the previous turn. There are three combat resolution tables ; pitched battles and skirmish, depending of the sizes involved in the fight, and a specific siege table. Reconnaissance and retreat are possible before fights which are never mandatory. A dozen of random events bring chrome and allow uncertainty.<br/>La campagne de l&rsquo;Arm&eacute;e du Nord (The North Army Campaign) contains two independant scenarios The opening fights for Amiens (2 turns, 1 hour)  and the Campaign (10 turns, 5 hours).

(Captain&rsquo;s log Entry Device) which has been password protected in an alien language and discover the whereabout of Captain Landon Plannet.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a super game and takes experienced puzzlers around an hour to solve. For those who aren&rsquo;t as experienced in puzzles, you may need a little longer &ndash; average solve time 90 minutes for less experienced puzzle solvers.<br/><br/>You can play the game in a small team, as the puzzles are printed on individual cards, meaning you can work together on different puzzles at the same time, and combine answers to create the master password.  There's no time limite either, so you can do 2-3 cards, stop, then do another 2-3 later.<br/><br/>If you have a larger group of friends, you can buy multiple copies and run the game in groups simultaneously and see who solves it first?  It can easily become a &ldquo;team escape experience&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game rules allow for easy immersion while still providing room for strategic thinking and enjoyment. Below, I'd like to highlight some of the game's strengths:<br/><br/>Sustainability: The entire game, including the board, game pieces, and packaging, is made from recycled plastic, promoting not only environmental friendliness but also awareness of sustainable gaming practices.<br/><br/>Fun and Strategy: Its resemblance to Connect Four allows players to quickly grasp the game, while the rules and longer playtime of 10-20 minutes ensure a tactical and entertaining experience.<br/><br/>Practicality: Quattromania impresses not only with its gameplay but also with its practicality. The game pieces are taken out of the board at the start, and the game tidies up itself during play. It's highly durable and easily transportable in its game sleeve.<br/><br/>Aesthetics: With its striking graphics and colorful game pieces, Quattromania not only provides enjoyment but also boasts aesthetic appeal. After the game, the remaining pieces create new patterns, making it suitable as a decorative element in the living room, perhaps as a &quot;coffee table game.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Holiday Hills, players collaborate to transform the town square into a dazzling winter spectacle, adorning trees with twinkling lights and festive decorations. Elves and humans work and live together in a town that loves to celebrate Christmas. But this year, everyone has procrastinated too much and each team only has one day to get Jingle Bell Square decorated in time for the annual parade!<br/><br/>Each turn, players will move either Elf or Human as far down the track as they wish. They'll gather a decoration from the shop they land on and then either take as many decorate actions as they passed over, or pick up as many presents as they passed over and add them to their meeple. Each elf/human can only fit so many items in their bag, so be sure to decorate often!<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will be adding trees to squares in town, adding various decorations to their and other players' trees, and placing dice presents under trees. All of this is to complete scoring objectives and become the best decorator in town!<br/><br/>Compete to create the most enchanting display and spread holiday cheer in this delightful decorating adventure!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players who Pounce must place their Pounce action card on one of the revealed prey. If only one player chooses it, they can catch it by discarding Energy cards from their hand. If multiple players Pounce on the same prey, they must fight over it using Intimidation and Hiss cards. Sleeping lets you refill your hand of cat cards, and Stalking gives you an advantage in your next fight.<br/><br/>The cat deck is filled with many different cards, split between Energy (used to catch prey), Stars (e.g. Hiss, Scratch, Catnip, which can be played once at a specific time), and Skills (e.g. Fishing (allows you catch fish), Intimidation, Sharp Vision, which can be played multiple times). The game is fast-paced and highly thematic.<br/><br/>The game also comes with a mini-expansion that adds event cards to the prey deck.<br/><br/>",

Following the Vatican's guidelines, you should employ various techniques according to the requirements of each area to be restored. However, the discrepancy between the Vatican's criteria and the judgment of a skilled restorer could lead to controversial restorations that are valued more by experts than by the Vatican institution itself. Prepare yourselves to embark on a challenge where art and history intertwine in every brushstroke!<br/><br/>The restoration of the Sistine Chapel in 1980 marked a significant milestone in the preservation of the Renaissance artistic legacy. This ambitious project, led by a team of experts, embarked on the daunting task of returning Michelangelo's masterful frescoes to their original splendor. Over several years, meticulous cleaning and consolidation work allowed the vibrant palette of colors and intricate details hidden beneath centuries of dirt and degradation to be rediscovered. The restoration of the Sistine Chapel not only revitalized one of the most iconic masterpieces in art history but also inspired a renewed appreciation for the importance of preserving the world's cultural heritage.<br/><br/>",

Mainly they came in ones and twos, or small unassuming groups, but they came. Spellcasters, mercenaries, knights-errant, desert nomads... heroes from the lands surrounding Alladore have come to stand with their brothers and sisters. Individually, they seem an insignificant force, but with their skills and special abilities added to those of the rangers, they might just tip the balance!<br/><br/>The 192-page hardcover Rangers of Shadow Deep: A Gathering of Heroes features:<br/><br/><br/>     Advanced Character Creation including new Traits and Limitations that players can use to bring greater tactical and narrative variation to their rangers.<br/>     Ten &lsquo;Archetypes&rsquo; that players can use to create new characters, representing the heroes that have come from the lands around Alladore to join the fight against the Shadow Deep.<br/>     Collects five previously stand-alone supplements for the game: Blood Moon, Temple of Madness, Ghost Stone, Incinerator, and Menagerie.<br/>     Fifty-two unique enchanted weapons.<br/>     A bestiary featuring all the creatures from the core rulebook and all the collected supplements.<br/>     Copious new artwork from the visionary of the Shadow Deep, Barrett Stanley.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An educational life science board game for kids and their families. Find and raise monarchs and learn about their life cycle. Backyard Butterfly is a game played in 4 stages:<br/><br/>Stage 1: Hunt for eggs. Roll the leaf shaped die and flip over 1-3 leaf tiles until you find an egg. Place an 'egg tile' on your milkweed board. Move on to stage 2 on your next turn. <br/>Stage 2: Feed your hungry caterpillar. Action sequence:<br/><br/>     Roll leaf die to populate leaf tiles onto your milkweed board.<br/>     Roll both caterpillar dice. Move your caterpillar meeple around the milkweed board twice with the goal of landing on leaf tiles to eat.<br/>     Place any eaten leaves onto your leaf tracker board. <br/><br/><br/>Continue with this stage until your leaf tracker board is full. <br/>Stage 3: Chrysalis Coin. Flip the coin (twice per turn). <br/>Green side- continue to wait. <br/>Orange and Black side- your monarch butterfly is ready to emerge! Move on to stage 4!<br/>Stage 4: Your monarch has emerged and flys away! Place a monarch butterfly token in the sky above the leaf tracker board. Butterfly tokens represent points earned. Begin your next turn back at the egg stage.<br/><br/>There are two additional gameplay variations: <br/>'BB Helper' walks parents through how to teach even the youngest gamers to play a game with multiple actions and stages in a way that is intuitive and fun.<br/>'Field of Milkweed' is a competitive version of the base game where all 4 milkweed boards are placed together to form a field. All resources are up for grabs and nature can strike at any time. Nature being an additional d12 rolled at the beginning of the caterpillar stage causing havoc.<br/><br/>",

Which contestant will get the most medals to obtain the magnificent X of eternal wisdom?<br/><br/>During his life, Alfonso X has sponsored and translated works of different disciplines in his court, such as law and politics (Fuero Real de Castilla, Esp&eacute;culo, Setenario and Siete Partidas), history (Estoria de Espa&ntilde;a and General estoria), art and music (Cantigas de Santa Mar&iacute;a and Cantigas de escarnio y maldezir), games (Libro de los juegos, that includes chess &amp; variants, alquerque, dice and tables games, nine men&rsquo;s morris or the mil game&hellip;), science and magic (such as Tablas alfons&iacute;es and Libro complido en los judizios de las estrellas, both about astronomy and astrology; Lapidario, about natural properties of the stones; and Picatrix, about hellenistic magic), and sapiential literature (Sendebar or Libro de los enga&ntilde;os, Calila e Dimna, Liber Scale Machometi and Bocados de oro).<br/><br/>Las Ligas de la &Ntilde;: Los Juegos de la X (The &Ntilde; Leagues: The X Games) is a board game played by 2 to 8 players that contains 15 playable characters of the Middle Ages and Renaissance (Alfonso X, Wallada, Ramon Llull, Christine de Pizan, Maim&oacute;nides, Urganda the Unknown&hellip;).<br/><br/>In this new &Ntilde; game (seventh in the series), the players play as one of the characters to obtain X number of medals (5 for a short game, 7 for a semi-fast one and 10 for a long game). During the game, the players move on the board to reach special squares (sacred relics and category squares) to obtain medals in different ways, either on minigames played after each round or by using the characters' or relics' special powers. In every round, the players take turns to do their actions (one of the following three: 1. Moving, 2. Using a character&rsquo;s power or 3. Using a relics&rsquo; power).<br/><br/>Each category (discipline) has its minigames (Art, Medieval sciences, Fantasy, Games and Politics). For example, the discipline &ldquo;games&rdquo; contains, among others, chess and its variants, nine men&rsquo;s morris, dice games, table games and card games.<br/><br/>Each character has unique powers and a range of movement (following a line or diagonally). The &Ntilde; is a neutral character which can be used by every player to win its favour or to put it against the opponents.<br/><br/>Even though the game is played on a 64-squared board (like chess), the players move on the intersections (like in go), making it an 81-squared board. Every player starts at the letter X in the middle of the board and can move according to the characters&rsquo; pace to every square.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the skirmish game BelloLudi Vietnam! We are so happy that you have taken an interest in wargaming. These rules have been developed especially for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. BelloLudi have created a ruleset of just fifteen pages, a little more than the game of RISK. From page 21 onwards, we included some, advanced, rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have a few battles under your belt.<br/><br/>BelloLudi Vietnam! is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. It is possible to start with around 20 miniatures, but that can easily be expanded. We hope that playing BelloLudi Vietnam! will encourage you to create your own armies. Similarly, the distances are given in inches for use with 28mm scale soldiers. Feel free to adapt to centimetres should you not have the space or when you use a smaller scale of miniatures.<br/><br/>This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1955 to roughly 1975, the age in which the worlds&rsquo; nations fought various conflicts. The most famous being the Vietnam War. The rules will work for skirmishes in this conflict, but also in other conflicts in this period. They cover the Vietnam War, Israeli Arab conflicts and the various wars of decolonisation.<br/><br/>Modern combat uses the tactic of &lsquo;Fire and Manoeuvre&rsquo; in which the enemy was pinned in place or disorganised by the concentration of fire from the infantry and artillery. Once this was accomplished, other elements of the unit could deliver the coup de gr&acirc;ce. These tactics meant that command and control (C2) were essential on the battlefield. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim in this game, is not to annihilate the enemy&rsquo;s units to the last man, but to inflict enough damage that morale is reduced and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and consequently removed from the tabletop. This can be achieved by a clever combination of movement, shooting and dashing charges. The tactics are based on teamwork within a group, as well as between groups and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>Your role will be that of a commander of a small group of soldiers. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number is right, for now.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;re right on top of us!&rdquo; &ndash;First lieutenant Fred McGrath&rsquo;s final radio broadcast from Lang Vei.<br/><br/>When the Communist forces of North and South Vietnam launched the 1968 Tet Offensive one component was the siege of Khe Sanh. The fortified hilltop positions at Khe Sanh were located near the border of North and South Vietnam. An important strongpoint to the south and west of Khe Sanh was at Lang Vei. It was from Lang Vei that US trained Montagnard and Laotian natives would launch raids into communist held territories to disrupt the &ldquo;Ho Chi Minh&rdquo; trail by which the Communist insurgency throughout South Vietnam was supplied, and to capture prisoners for intelligence. Destroying the US outpost at Lang Vei was key to Communist success in the siege as well as their larger war effort.<br/><br/>The Communist offensive was launched by the 24th Regiment of the 304th Infantry Division (one of the formations that had fought at Dien Bien Phu fourteen years earlier). The assault force would also include Soviet built PT-76 tanks of the NVA&rsquo;s 198th Tank Battalion of the 203rd Armored Regiment, the first these types of weapons would be deployed by the Communists in the war, as well as heavy artillery batteries in North Vietnam. The battle here would usher in a new phase of the Vietnam conflict. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

German forces made initial advances in an attempt to control key areas before the main offensive, called Operation Citadel. The Germans planned to attack from the north and south simultaneously, in an attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. After the German offensive stalled, the Soviets launched a counteroffensive on 12 July 1943: Operation Kutuzov. By August 1943, their second counteroffensive, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev, was launched. The Soviets built a formidable defence, causing the Germans to delay whilst they built up their forces. In the end, Hitler diverted his forces to central Europe following the invasion of Sicily by the Allies. The Germans were unable to launch another strategic offensive on the Eastern front for the remainder of the war.<br/><br/>In Battles of Kursk, you will be commanding a range of Soviet units in order to achieve a variety of Objectives in small scale skirmishes as part of the main Battle of Kursk.<br/><br/>As with all my &ldquo;Battles&rdquo; games, the aim here was to produce a fairly traditional hex and counter wargame experience with clear and straightforward rules and a manageable &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; which will not take up too much time or effort to operate, but which will give the Player a formidable challenge.<br/><br/>The game contains the rules and charts, 12 battles with full colour maps and suggested counters (to be cut out and mounted on card).<br/><br/>Playing time: 20 to 50 minutes per Battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The figures (1 king, 4 shooters, 8 cavalry, 12 footers) are placed on the game board in two opposing, outer rows of spaces marked by a red colored line, in any order. A dice is rolled alternately once. The meaning of the throw is as follows:<br/><br/>     For throws with 1, 2, 3 or 4 points, the same number of any figures move or capture. (Each figure may only be used once in a roll.)<br/>     If the dice shows 5 points, then the king alone has to move and capture.<br/>     If 6 points are rolled the player loses a turn.<br/><br/><br/>The pieces move or hit in all directions on all spaces.<br/><br/>Capturing is made by moving a piece onto the space of an opponent's piece. (The latter is then removed from the game). There is no obligation to capture. You are not allowed to move or capture across occupied spaces.<br/>According to their kind, the figures move or capture as follows:<br/><br/>     Footer: 1 or 2 spaces.<br/>     Cavalry: 1, 2 or 3 spaces.<br/>     Shooters: like the footers, 1 or 2 spaces.<br/><br/><br/>The shooters can also shoot 1, 2 or 3 spaces. This means that they can take an opponent's piece that is in the direction of their capture without moving onto that piece's space. (This &ldquo;hitting from a standing start&rdquo; applies to one move.)<br/>The King moves or captures 1 or 2 spaces. He can also shoot 1 or 2 spaces like the shooters.<br/><br/>The game is won if: the enemy king is captured, or your own king moves to the outermost row of the opponent's deployment space behind the colored line, or the enemy can no longer move.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You start with a random weapon and a random trait and from there you must find the best strategy to defend yourself from your opponents. Inspired by Berserk and the Souls games, Astrophobia is set in a dark fantasy world mixed with the horrors of space. The combat is body-part-based and losing each one has different consequences.<br/><br/>The game includes a total of 177 cards, which feature 30 unique weapons, 25 unique traits, 2 sets of 36 unique sorceries, 2 sets of 12 unique board events, and 2 sets of 13 unique lucky cards, 8 different player tokens, 10 board event tokens and a 10x10 grid square board. Each card has written lore for the player to explore.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the last person standing, and you do that by either killing or disarming the other players, or by running away and letting them get caught in a dagger rain. Astrophobia's random nature can lead to both epic and silly moments and you must improvise in every situation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you move a second knight into a space with an opposing pawn or village, remove those tokens and take one resource from the village owner.<br/>     Construction: Remove one or more of your knights from the game board and replace each with a village or stronghold, gaining one resource.<br/>     New City: Replace one of your villages with a city and earn 10 victory points (VPs).<br/>     Expedition: Remove two knights from your reserve, placing one back in the box out of play and the other on any empty space on the edge of the game board.<br/>     Noble Title: Discard at least 15 resource points, then upgrade your title: baron to viscount, then count, marquis, and finally duke.<br/><br/><br/>Once any player has gained the title of duke, finish the round, then tally the VPs, with players scoring for resources still in their possession, their rank in the game, and the number of cities they built. Whoever has the most VPs wins!<br/><br/>This new edition of Barony includes the Barony: Sorcery expansion and all-new asymmetric player powers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, as modern plumbing is still generations away, the city is gradually filling up with human waste, making it a terribly fragrant place to live.<br/><br/>Players are competing Night Soil companies. By night, Labourer cards will be used to carefully manoeuvre waste cubes through the narrow streets of London to turn a profit and to recruit workers. By day, these workers can be sent out into London to advertise, garner favour with local businesses, or to improve their company&rsquo;s assets. However, crowds of workers do tend to add to the waste problem...<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player who has managed to make the most money wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Before a game, the cards you will use are created by placing each character transparency together with an attribute card in a card sleeve. You&rsquo;ll never know what new characters are in the deck, and the combinations are almost endless! During play, each character card will give the players special actions, such as earning money, drawing more cards, and most importantly, gaining influence in the mountain, forest, sea, and city regions of the kingdom. When a player has collected 6 influence they may claim a region of the corresponding type, which scores them points. The player who best uses their characters in combination and gains the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

What they want is a mystery to most - though Priests and Cultists gather in ritual to try and divine deific action from their passing.

Your objective is to gather the most currency (Metal Scrap) by safely escorting batches of clients to their desired settlements, selling the valuable loot you find along the way and by facing ravenous mutated beasts...all while fighting off other guides who are trying to beat you to it!<br/><br/>The game is asymmetric and highly interactive. It mixes strategy with a dose of luck to keep things fresh and exciting, while strongly enforcing player agency instead of completely taking it away. The game's systems and the number of variables at play will provide an endlessly replayable experience each time you and your group pick it up.<br/><br/>The main focus with Deadholt is creating an intriguing and immersive experience for players by blending flavor with the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>Lose yourself in this unforgiving world and prove to everyone around the table that you've got what it takes to master its secrets!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With 520 general knowledge questions to play from, teams take turns to try and climb up the tower by correctly answering the questions on the cards.  The questions get trickier the higher up the tower you go.  With just two minutes on the clock, will you be able to reach dizzying heights, or will you get stuck on a level as the time ticks down?<br/><br/>Played over three rounds, teams score points based on the difficulty of the questions they are able to answer before the timer runs out.  Higher difficulty questions can only be unlocked if the lower level questions are successfully answered, thus climbing the tower.  An incorrect answer drops you back down to the easiest tier of questions, which are worth fewer points, forcing you to climb back up if you want to increase your score faster (at the risk of dropping back down again).<br/><br/>",

This unique terrain, enriched with rare elements, is the birthplace of the mystical Tochon Magnets&mdash;ancient artifacts infused with immense magical energies. Drawn by the allure of these powerful entities, human Mage Warriors have come to Magneterra, driven by a thirst for magical knowledge, each aspiring to become the most powerful mage.<br/><br/>Magneterra introduces an innovative game mechanic centered around the fascinating properties of magnetism. Players begin the game with the ability to attract Tochon Magnets from the shortest pillars on the game board, utilizing specially designed figurines that interact with magnetic fields. As players gather more magnets, their magnetic powers increase, enabling them to draw from increasingly taller pillars. The ultimate challenge lies in being the first to claim the Tochon Magnet from the tallest pillar, a feat that not only requires strategic maneuvering and skillful play but also crowns the winner as the supreme Mage Warrior of Magneterra.<br/><br/>However, the quest for magnetic supremacy is fraught with danger. The native Thians&mdash;part metal, part flesh giants&mdash;and their loyal Ankylocat companions fiercely defend the Tochons. These formidable opponents roam the landscape, determined to thwart the Mage Warriors and preserve the natural balance of their planet. As tensions rise, players must decide whether to confront these monsters directly or find more cunning ways to navigate the perilous terrains and claim the ultimate magnetic prize. With every move fraught with peril and opportunity, who will emerge victorious, and at what cost? The battle for Magneterra's Tochon Magnets is about to begin!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The people shown in this abstracted model are moving away from some kind of threat - a battle or invasion, a disaster, a violent mass movement, some kind of monster protected by copyright legislation, etc.. The United States Department of Defense calls these people Dislocated Civilians or DCs; the Department of State calls them Internally Displaced Persons, and other organizations variously call them refugees, evacuees or other descriptive terms.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. In each turn cards representing groups of DCs will be drawn from a deck of ordinary playing cards and placed at the top of a notional grid of spaces arranged in rows and columns, while other card groups move downwards towards the bottom of the grid. Think of columns of people moving down the Lines of Communication, away from whatever started them moving.<br/><br/>The player will move their unit counters representing organizations and services to place them with groups of cards, and then roll dice to obtain a score that will allow all, some or none of the cards in the groups to be removed from the game (signifying that their primary needs have been addressed, so that in the short term at least they may be considered safe or healthy or settled).<br/><br/>But the needs and demands to be satisfied are larger than the resources and services available, so some cards will exit off the bottom of the Field; these cards are &ldquo;lost&rdquo;.

The lane in-between these 2 colored lanes with arrows pointing inward is called a rising lane and allows players to move to another ring.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The game starts by each player rolling the 2 dice in a clockwise manner.<br/>The player who rolls a 6 on any of their two die can start and move any of his/her pieces into play. They can then move the value of the other die on the piece(s) in play.<br/>After rolling, a player can move the value of any die on any of the movable pieces in play until all the values on the 2 die have been used.<br/>If a player is has no pieces in play after rolling, the game's turn moves to the next player.<br/><br/>Players keep moving their pieces clockwise until they find their rising lane - at which point they can move to an inner/higher ring and continue moving clockwise until they reach their home.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on an opponent's piece after moving their dice value, the opponent's piece is displaced and sent one ring back/outside maintaining the lane they were in i.e the opponent's piece moves 40 steps back.<br/>If an opponent is displaced from the outer most ring, they return to their base.<br/>However, opponents cannot be displaced from their safe zones. Any of the colored tiles on the board are safe zones for all players i.e no piece can be displaced from these regions. Additionally, the rising lane of a specific player is a safe zone for that player alone i.e, a blue player cannot be displaced from the blue rising lane, but can be displaced from any other player's rising lane.<br/><br/>Players can reroll in any of these cases;<br/>- After rolling a double i.e the same number on all the die.<br/>- After a roll that enabled a player to leave their base.<br/>- After a roll that enabled a player to reach their home.<br/>- After displacing an opponent's piece.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The mother fox asked her children to pack everything they would need. However, you need to do it as soon as possible, because the adventure begins in a moment! Liski is a quick card game that develops reflexes and observation. Includes 5 additional variants, designed to both educate and entertain.<br/><br/>There are 5 variants of the game, here is a quick summary of each:<br/><br/>     Each player receive the same set of items on the cards. When the task card is flipped everyone has to choose matching cards from their hand and place them in a grid 2x2 with correct orientation to fulfill the task. The first player to do it receives the task card and the round is over. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.<br/>     At the beginning of the game the item cards are placed at the table in a grid 3x3. The active player has to flip two cards that are the same on the other side. Almost like classic memory... but! The cards are not onesided, both of the sides show items, so when the player reveals non-matching cards they do not flip them again and just leave as they are. The game ends when there are no cards to refill the grid and whoever collected the most is the winner.<br/>     Only task cards are used. The players place the cards from their hands to cover the card on the table. Each matching symbol provides 1 point. After all the cards are played whoever gathered most points wins.<br/>     Four task cards are placed in the middle in a grid 2x2. Now all the players together have to build the same configuration but with a item cards. This should be done three times and the game is over.<br/>     Two task cards are revealed and the players quickly count the most present symbol. Then they need to play a matching item card(s) from their hand. The first player to do it receive the task cards. After the task cards are depleted the game ends and whoever gathered most wins.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Though only using a portion of the forces that fought at Gettysburg, Pipe Creek adds most of the cavalry that fought at the East Cavalry Field and includes some &ldquo;What If&rdquo; troops for the Army of Northern Virginia.<br/><br/>Pipe Creek allows players to see what could have happened if Meade had left Gettysburg under a variety of scenarios. Two are based on the Confederate&rsquo;s July 2nd attack being successful and Meade deciding to pull back to his pre-planned line. The third scenario is completely up to the players and has Meade refusing to fight at Gettysburg and making his stand at Pipe Creek with a fresh army. The fourth scenario, however, is played solely on the maps for A Most Fearful Sacrifice and allows gamers to replay Pickett&rsquo;s charge but make it significantly more powerful.<br/><br/>Longstreet didn&rsquo;t think that 15,000 men could break the Union line, but what if Lee had given him 23,300 troops! Is that enough manpower for Longstreet to be successful?

This operational showdown pits the Nationalist forces, led by General Varela, against the determined Republican defenders, as they clash in a desperate struggle for control of Madrid.<br/><br/>The Battle of Jarama, fought from February 6 to 27, 1937, marked the third and bloodiest attempt by the Nationalists to capture Madrid, the heart of the Republican resistance. As the Nationalists sought to sever Madrid's lifeline to the Mediterranean port of Valencia, the Republicans stood firm, determined to protect their capital and the cause of the Republic.<br/><br/>In Jarama, each player assumes the command of either the Nationalist or Republican forces, maneuvering their troops across the battlefield in a tactical dance of conquest and defense. The game utilizes a very particular chit-activation system, ensuring that each decision carries weight and every move has the potential to alter the course of the battle. The chit-activation systems makes this game suitable to be played solo by playing both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>As the Nationalist player, your primary objective is to cut off the Valencia road, effectively isolating Madrid and crippling the Republican war effort. To achieve this, you must skillfully employ your forces, utilizing their strengths and exploiting enemy weaknesses. Seize historical key cities and hills along the way, for they will not only bolster your strategic position but also provide valuable victory points.<br/><br/>If you command the Republican forces, your mission is to halt the Nationalist advance, protect the vital Valencia road, and ultimately launch a counteroffensive to push the enemy back to their starting positions. This will require unwavering resilience, strategic planning, and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing tides of battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The property cards are cities and the railways and utilities are distribution centers and services. The money features Sandy McTire, a figure appearing on Canadian Tire &quot;money&quot; (coupons worth 5 cents to $2) since 1961. Unlike most versions this version is bilingual.<br/><br/>Play remains the same as in other Monopoly games. Players roll dice to determine how far they move. Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property. When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent. Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game. The winner is the last player left in the game.<br/><br/>",

At the game's start, players agree whether the cards will be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get that player's hand value. Player with the high value hand wins and puts the higher card of the two in a pile at his right hand side, retaining the other as one of the two for the next hand. The losing players discard their lower card to their left hand side and retain the other.

Each round, the monster pointer is increased by the number of monsters on the table. Afterwards a new monster comes into the city which must be defeated along with any older one. To do this, all dice must be rolled at the same time and the items rolled or secured item token from the last rounds must be placed on the corresponding symbols of the monsters.<br/><br/>If a monster is defeated (no free normal symbol slots), you get one point. If even the individual optional symbol field on the monster is still covered, you get two points instead.<br/><br/>For every two Grandpa symbols on the dice you can reveal a helping Grandpa card. The Grandpa dice can be re-rolled at any time if they are not needed to get useful items.<br/><br/>Unused dice can be converted into item token that can be used in the next round as long as you can store them.<br/><br/>The game ends when 10 victory points have been reached or the monster pointer has reached the last field.

Once finished, the Alien then replies by using pre-set rules only they can see to add, remove, and adjust the signal, both to be helpful and to try and reach an agreement- represented by a pre-set signal that they are trying to achieve with their limited response capabilities. As the Experts analyze and understand the Alien, they can use limited guesses and a few hint-like abilities to discover what signal they can send that will result in agreement. The Alien even has a little leeway in how they respond- they want to be understood.<br/><br/>After succeeding at the first round, Experts then reset and continue with the same Alien, except new rules are in play on top of the previous ones, showing a deeper and deeper familiarity with the Alien player. After three rounds of successful agreements, all players win cooperatively, and receive a score based on leftover guesses and unused abilities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They then flip the lock and check if the key fits. Each lock has only 1 unique key, and there are 16 of them in the game.<br/><br/>The locks are arranged so that the keys can only be inserted from the backside. Therefore, players will not only have to try their luck but also memorize which keys are needed to the already-tried locks.<br/>At the same time, the fearsome dragon rises to the princess if the Dragon side falls on the die.<br/>The player's goal is to open all the doors in the tower and get to the princess before the fearsome Dragon.<br/><br/>All players act together, win or lose together, so the game is ideal for the youngest players and will teach them to memorize the location of the right components and enjoy saving the princess as a family.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Those can be either green or black (fermented) &ndash; the value of green leaves decreases each round, but the value of black leaves increases. But you can&rsquo;t gain black leaves directly, you can just change the green leaves to the black leaves.

The Basic game is 7 turns long; the Extended game is 9 turns; and the third option is a 3-player game with 2 Russian players competing against each other (which can be either 7 or 9 turns).<br/><br/>Game scale:  About 12-18 km per hex; 2 days/turn (except for 1st turn which covers 16 April 1945 only); 7 or 9 game turns long.

Peleliu is a simulation of the US invasion of the islands of Peleliu and Angaur, in the Palaus (east of The Philippines) in the Fall of 1944.  Peleliu is one of the many battles in the Pacific that is often overlooked.  The battle, however, rivalled Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa in its ferocity and savagery.<br/><br/>The game has three Scenarios: Peleliu (15 September to 27 November 1944, 27 Turns), Angaur (17 September to 22 October 1944, 14 turns), and the Peleliu Campaign including both islands (15 September to 27 November 1944, 27 Turns).  Because of its small size and shorter length, the Angaur Scenario is a good introductory scenario for those who are new to the Island War system.<br/><br/>Peleliu is mainly a 2-3 player game, where one player controls the Japanese ground forces (both army and navy), and where 1-2 players control the US forces (USMC and US Army).  Because the Japanese units are initially face down, and because there are some Japanese Dummy units, there is some hidden information in the game which means that 2-3 players are best.  However, the game can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>Game scale:  About XX miles per hex (YY meters/hex); 2 to 3 days/turn; the game is 14-27 game turns long; units are battalions and companies.<br/><br/>Provisional Contents of Peleliu: <br/>One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color paper map of Peleliu; <br/>one 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; color paper map of Angaur; <br/>140 counters (0.6&rdquo; counters); <br/>15 pages of rules; <br/>2 player aids.<br/><br/>",

Their research led them to a vast underground cavern, and inside they discovered the ancient runes that both detail the curse, and the way to dispel it.<br/><br/>Each section of the curse board is paired with a certain Envoy and Seal type. As those elements are gathered by players, the cursed enegy at the center of the board spreads to their regions, giving scoring penalties to affected players.<br/><br/>The Prophecies of the cavern are visions of the future as seen detailed in the ancient sigils. When a player satisfies the condition of a Prophecy, they will be able to remove curse tokens from the inscriptions, limiting the spread of the curse and earning victory points for their heroic deed.<br/><br/>Desperate times call for desperate measures. Queen Tabitha realizes that this is a time to call in the experts with Royal Summons to save this new realm. These allow players to gain several envoys at once, giving them more control over the colors they take. These Royal Summons will then need to be paid off, before another one can be issued.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played in four different ways.<br/><br/>1. Learning about Feelings<br/>Kids explore different feelings by looking at the expressions on Singa's faces. The objective is to collect as many cards as possible, but the real goal is to learn about feelings and have fun!<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Separate the decks by their different backs (red and black).<br/>    . Spread the colorful cards face-up on the table (red back).<br/>     Shuffle the rest of the cards, stack them, and place them on the table (black back).<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     Take one card from the black deck and say: &quot;I feel ... (name of the feeling)&quot;.<br/>     Ask the child to find the same feeling on the open cards.<br/>     If the child finds the matching face, hand over the card from your hand and compare them.<br/>     If the child doesn't find it, the adult shows the matching card from the table and takes both cards.<br/>     When the pile is over, count the cards!<br/><br/><br/>2. Finding the Feeling<br/>Kids learn about feelings while also memorizing their corresponding expressions. This game enhances memory, attention to detail, and recognition of feelings.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Separate the red deck by their different backs (red and black).<br/>     Spread the black-backed cards face-up on the left side of the table.<br/>     Spread the red-backed cards face-down on the right side of the table.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     Pick one of the feelings on the table and say: &quot;I feel ... (name of the feeling)&quot;.<br/>     Flip over a red card and see if the feeling matches.<br/>     If it matches, claim both cards for yourself and pass your turn.<br/>     If it doesn't match, close the card you just flipped and pass your turn.<br/><br/><br/>3. How Was Your Day?<br/>This game offers a way to explore the feelings both you and the child experienced throughout the day in an easy and fun way. Are you ready to embark on this journey together? The objective is to use different faces to encourage engaging conversations.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Separate the red deck and set it aside.<br/>     Spread the black deck face-up on the table.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     Take one card from the pile and say: &quot;I felt ... (name of the feeling) today when/because...&quot;<br/>     Take the card for yourself and then encourage the child to do the same.<br/><br/><br/>4. Telling a Story<br/>In this game, you will craft a story together using your imaginations. The goal is to collaborate on telling a story while guessing the feelings indicated by the other player.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Separate the decks by their different backs (red and black).<br/>     Spread the colorful cards face-up on the table (red back) and remove the rest of the cards (they can be used as a guide, if necessary).<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     The adult starts the tale by saying &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and begins talking about the place and the main character.<br/>     Let the adventure roll and remember to keep the child engaged.<br/>     When ready, add a feeling to your story. Pick a card that matches the feeling you want, then say, &quot;The (name of the character) feels... (show the card)&quot;.<br/>     If the child guesses the feeling correctly, give them the card and invite them to continue the story from where it left off. Encourage them to do the same.<br/>     If they guess wrong, reveal the feeling and take the card for yourself. Continue the story, and when ready, select another card to repeat the process.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pizza Roles is a ten-minute &quot;filler&quot; hidden roles game where your role is what you want on your pizza but are too timid to say.  Play simulates a conversation about what kind of pizza to order with each player vying for what they want while trying not to seem overbearing.<br/><br/>Eight Topping cards represent the game state. Gameplay consists mostly of moving these Topping cards back and forth between the &quot;not on the pizza&quot; zone and the &quot;on the pizza&quot; zone. Each player is dealt a secret Role card showing their objectives in the game and a small hand of Conversation cards they can play to manipulate the Topping cards.<br/><br/>Players take turns either playing a Conversation card from their hand to change the Toppings or choosing to pass. Players can always choose to pass, but the game will end as soon as the majority of players pass in succession.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players reveal their secret Roles and any Toppings in the &quot;on the pizza&quot; zone will score. Points are totaled and all players with a positive score are joint winners.  Sometimes, everybody wins!<br/><br/>There is also a cooperative mode with slightly modified rules:  Players must work together to make sure that everybody is happy with a pizza because if a single player loses, ALL players lose.  Luckily, players make two pizzas instead of one and only score using the best pizza for each Role.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each Escape Leader competes to set the most captives free from the clutches of the Doom Master while committing the fewest blunders. Too many blunders and the Doom Master discovers and destroys the only way of escape ending the game.<br/><br/>The basic mechanic is simple. Players play numbered cards in ascending or descending order on stacks as fast as possible in order to be the first player to play every card in their hand. Any cards left in a player's hand at the end of a round count as blunders against them. The player with the fewest blunders when the blunder breaking point is reached wins. Special cards such as traps and dead ends add a twist to the game making it more difficult for players to escape. Various card combinations and asymmetric Escape Leader abilities also add an additional level of complexity and fun to the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players will assemble a unique creature by combining a front and back.  The combination will not only determine its battle stats, but also create a unique &quot;if-then&quot; power that can be triggered to sway the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Players will roll dice to determine their Attack.  Energy and special powers can be used to manipulate the results.<br/><br/>Once the dice are locked in, players simultaneously reveal a hand signal.  They can add 0-5 Attack by &quot;Boosting&quot; (spending Energy), or they can Defend to reduce their Damage and regain Energy equal to their intelligence, or they can hit the &quot;Panic Button&quot; and force both players to re-roll.  BUT, if a player Defends against a Panic Button, they auto-kill their opponent's creature.<br/><br/>The loser of the battle takes damage equal to the Arena level plus any special attack damage.  The Arena gets increasingly deadly until a battle is resolved.

The Dice form their Die Pool.<br/><br/>Turns consist of playing a single die from your die pool to one of the open spaces on your Battle Grid.  The value of the die interacts with the space you play to determines the attack and defense value of your die.  Players must defend with a value higher than their opponent's attack. But attacks of 6 or greater can be parried with a Defense of 1.<br/><br/>Playing white dice allows you to re-roll your remaining die pool.  Your red die activates your unique Warrior power.<br/><br/>Play continues until a player loses because they can't respond to an attack.  The loser flips their warrior and their grid to their damaged side where they have more powerful options for the next round.  Play continues until one Warrior wins 2 Battles.<br/><br/>Dice Clash was inspired by and re-implements the dice placement system in Scuttleball by Crossbow Games (Jonathan and Ryan).  Art is by Super Snipers artist, Hwa Siang.<br/><br/>&mdash;description frpm the publisher<br/><br/>",

To make the search for the adorable puppies even more difficult, Cruella decided to hide them in various locations across the city's neighborhoods. Kicking off the rescue mission, a team of fearless investigators has been assembled, and each volunteer must search two neighborhoods in the city. The one who finds all 101 Dalmatians will be the great hero of this story!<br/><br/>In 101 Dalmatians, you control two groups of 5 cards called neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are positioned on the table between the players, so each player has one neighborhood to their left and another to their right. On your turn, you decide whether to replace one of the cards in one of the neighborhoods beside you, perform the action of one of the cards in your hand, or discard a card. Throughout the game, the cards in the neighborhoods will be revealed or replaced, so that at some point, all the cards in a neighborhood are revealed. The game ends at the end of the turn in which all the cards in both neighborhoods controlled by a player are revealed. All still hidden cards are revealed, and the values of each neighborhood are summed. Your goal is to sum up 101 dalmatians with all 10 cards from the two neighborhoods beside you. If no one sums 101 Dalmatians, the winner will be the one who sums the most puppies without exceeding the total of 101.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you leave the Chicken and Fox alone, the Chicken will get eaten.  If you leave the Chicken alone with the Corn, the Corn will get eaten.  The twist in this game is that you can stick the other player watching over your resources along with theirs.  Players compete to be the first to get 2 sets of Chicken, Fox, Corn across the river!<br/><br/>On your turn, you may load 1 Farmer and 1 Good into your boat to move across the river.  If this leaves the card without any Farmers (your's or your opponent's), &quot;Nature's Law&quot; takes place: Foxes eat Chickens there, and Chickens eat Corn there.  If a player loses 3 of their goods, they lose immediately.<br/><br/>When delivering your Farmer to the Market, you reveal the Market Bonus there.  You collect it when your Farmer leaves that card.  Market Bonuses provide powerful one-time abilities like moving your opponent's boat, allow you to place 2 Farmers on a card, move a good up or down a card, or move a Farmer up or down a card.<br/><br/>The first player to get 2 sets of Chicken, Fox, and Corn to their Markets wins.<br/><br/>Advanced Mode adds Zombie Chickens and Poisoned Corn!

Now Shredder intends to leave Earth and destroy the civilization of the utroms. Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello must break through the ninja army of the Foot clan and stop their most important enemy.<br/><br/>Shredder's Citadel is a cooperative board game in which participants play together against the playing field. The Oroku Saki estate is attacked by all four turtles, the players divide them among themselves. The role of the fifth player is reduced to preparing the field and throwing dice for enemies, so it is optimal to sit down at the game together (players have two characters) or four (each has its own character).<br/><br/>The playing field is a section of the Oroku Saki citadel. After landing in the Shredder's chambers on the top floor, the turtles must make their way through two tiers of rooms to the basement, find the launch pad and defeat the villain. This should be done in 10 moves while the starship's engine is warming up. At the beginning of the game, 9 rooms of the citadel are randomly laid out on the playing field: the turtles do not know what awaits them in a particular room until they go inside.<br/><br/>The hero can spend his turn on rest (to restore his health to the maximum), or to move to the next room of the citadel. If this room has not yet been explored by the turtles, its card is turned upside down, where the enemies located here are listed. There are three types of them in the game: ninjas, elite ninjas and combat robots; as well as four &quot;bosses&quot; led by Shredder. The &quot;bosses&quot; are unique and each sit in their own basement room, and the number of ordinary enemies of each type in the room is determined by a roll of dice. Thus, 3-4 opponents and a crowd of 15-20 heads can meet you in the room. All of them will have to be defeated &mdash; either alone, or by calling for help from brothers from neighboring rooms. The combat mechanics are quite simple and elegant, although based on the same hexagon rolls. The cycle repeats until the turtles defeat Shredder, are themselves defeated by his servants, or until Shredder escapes the green hands of justice.<br/><br/>There is only one strategy in the game: first, make your way straight down to the basement (fortunately, the enemies along the way are mostly frivolous), then explore it, hoping for luck &mdash; with bad throws, even a couple of basement rooms may not be able to clear the enemy from the enemy. April should be sent to one of the rooms, and the support of Splinter and Casey Jones should be saved until the final battle. It is not recommended to get carried away with searching for equipment on the upper floors: you will lose time and effort, but there is little sense from technology.<br/><br/>Present:<br/><br/>Don, Raf, Leo and Mikey;<br/>        The randomness factor;<br/>        Hordes of enemies.<br/><br/>Missing:<br/><br/>Strategic diversity;<br/>        Krang;<br/>        Bebop and Rocksteady.<br/><br/>",

Everything dies, and dies anew, in a loop infected by the germ of iteration. Creatures are born, whose only purpose being to be crushed, torn, mangled.<br/>Endlessly. Again and again.<br/>With neither end nor beginning.<br/><br/>In this dungeon crawler with roguelike elements, players will navigate through the Stomach Prison maze trying to find two sirens which, once activated, will open the gate for the freedom. Each turn the players will reveal a maze tile and face what it hides which may be loot (draw from a deck), mutations (draw from another deck), monsters (up to five per tile, spawned through the roll of a die and then draw from a dedicated deck of cards), sirens or events. In the last two cases players will be instructed to read a dedicated paragraph on an event booklet and, sometimes, will be give choices to take tests to attempt. On the other hand, ringing sirens will summon a sub-boss players will have to defeat.<br/>The combat system is based on the &quot;D8-entropy system&quot;, in which every attack (both from players and from enemies) is resolved by a modified d8 roll with 8 representing a critical hit and 1 always a miss (modifiers applied due to player and weapons characteristics, mutations or altered status): if the modified result is 8 or more the attack is successful and damage is dealt.<br/>But be careful. Even defeating the last boss won't be enough to grant your freedom, since only one player will be able to escape...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A revised edition of &ldquo;The Fashion Game&rdquo; produced in early 2023 in Japan, Fashion Police has players put on the badge to judge the fashion sense of the others at the table, identifying who dressed for which occasion. But being a critique isn&rsquo;t enough! At the same time, you must design your outfit for your occasion. Did you dress for the Stone Age in the latest fast fashion treads? Clad head to toe in faux fur for the beach? Don&rsquo;t get caught failing to dress for the occasion!<br/><br/>Fashion Police is a party game that offers three game modes (including both competitive and cooperative play). Regardless of which ruleset you choose, players are first given a theme/occasion (60 unique ones including tacky tourist, apocalypse, Monday at the office, too young for your age, etc.) for which they need to design an outfit. Players then place, layer, combine, rotate, flip, etc. their randomly drawn pattern cards (60 unique options) under clothing templates to create their look&mdash;creativity knows no bounds! Players finally guess who dressed for which occasion to score points.<br/><br/>Adopting the mechanics of popular word-based party games, Fashion Police creates lively, organic discussions over player answers and designs without the exclusivity some of these language-dependent games have. Laugh as you learn just how much you (don&rsquo;t) get fashion in this easy-to-learn game for all ages and groups!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players assume the leaders of wolfpacks in Lone Wolves, vying over regions to become the Alpha. To assert your dominance and ensure victory, dispatch wolves to territories. The stronger wolf wins and thus strengthens your pack&rsquo;s position; but despite gaining a scar from the battle and becoming a lone wolf, the weaker learns from the experience, improving your pack&rsquo;s status for the next encounter. In your struggle, know when to bare your teeth, but also when to go it alone.<br/><br/>Lone Wolves is a two-player dueling game with trick-taking and area majority elements that is played over thirteen rounds (tricks). Players start with thirteen cards, and each trick consists of players playing a single wolf card, of which there are five suits each with cards 2&ndash;7 (thirty cards). The cards, however, are played into one of five territories of your choosing, each awarding points to the player that controls it at the end of the game. The value of the card represents the strength dispatched to that territory. The winner of the trick&rsquo;s card remains faceup and then flips the wolf of the other player to its lone wolf side (strength of 1); whereas the loser gains a scar token with an effect (i.e., awarding points for specific cards played into territories, altering strength values, affecting points awarded in territories, etc.) that can be placed in a territory.<br/><br/>Distinguishing itself from most trick-taking games, however, the trump suit in Lone Wolves is dynamic, shifting as the game progresses! Once all scar tokens have been obtained from one territory, the corresponding becomes trump; and once it happens a second time, the trump suit changes yet again. The push and pull of knowing when to take or strategically lose the trick means that there are no weak hands, just weak leaders!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Walk&uuml;re is a single-player-only game that recreates the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany during his dictatorial rule.<br/><br/>Players negotiate with the Allied Forces while gaining generals and civilians as allies, with the aim of establishing a new government after Hitler's assassination. The game covers the period from the summer of 1941, when the war between Germany and the Soviet Union began, to the winter of 1944, when Germany's defeat was assured.<br/><br/>The player controls an anti-Hitler unit consisting of generals, counter-intelligence and civilians, whose goal is to find opportunities to assassinate Hitler and &lsquo;eliminate&rsquo; him by increasing their influence by attracting key Allied military and intelligence personnel, German generals and civilians to their side. The Hitlerites, on the other hand, are &lsquo;sabotaged&rsquo; by the system's manipulation of the SS and by investigating and placing anti-Hitler and collaborators under arrest and surveillance.<br/><br/>By the winter of 1944, as the war draws to a close, the Fatherland must be saved from the &lsquo;dictatorship&rsquo; that is pushing the German people to the brink of destruction.<br/><br/>",
