Miners, knights, and sell-swords have all fallen at the claws of these foul creatures. With the Kingdom of Yule already on the verge of bankruptcy, the King cannot afford to lose control of these mines. No amount of death can stop his desire to retain his power.Lucky for you, your reputation as a Bounty Hunter has earned you a chance to prove your worth. Capturing criminals has been easy, surely your unique skill set will transfer to killing beasts. The King is willing to empty the last of the kingdom's coffers for the heads of these creatures. Will you fall amongst the treasure and corpses of the cavern or slay your enemies to claim your due glory?&quot;<br/><br/>Dungeon Bounty is a fast paced hand management game designed to be played with a single standard deck of playing cards. On each turn, players flip two cards from the deck (dungeon). If the cards are a 1-10 of clubs (weapons), diamonds (gemstones), or spades (spells), the player chooses one to add to their play area. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are the bounties, the creatures you are hunting, and when they pop up as one of the two drawn cards from the dungeon, you need to defeat them using your attack power from weapons and spells. The more bounties you collect, the higher your score.<br/><br/>If you are unable to defeat a monster, they do damage to you, reducing your strength, which is represented by the 1-10 of hearts. If you are at 1 strength and are damaged by an enemy, you lose. If you manage to stay alive, the game ends after two trips through the dungeon. After you've depleted the deck the first time, you shuffle the discard pile and play through the deck a second time. Compare your score to the scoring guide and see your destiny.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;The position of Prussia in Germany will not be determined by its liberalism but by its power &hellip; Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided&hellip; but by iron and blood.&rdquo; <br/>&ndash; Otto von Bismarck, Sept. 30, 1862<br/><br/>By Iron and Blood is a two-player wargame depicting the final, decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. The Battle of Koniggratz (or Sadowa) occurred on July 3, 1866 and it was the largest European land engagement fought between the Battle of Leipzig (1813) and the mammoth battles of the First World War. Koniggratz involved over 450,000 men from multiple European nations and principalities. The battle would decide the destiny of Europe, determining whether Prussia or Austria would be the dominate force binding the various German states together to form a new potential super-power, born with a united Germany. The Prussians under General Helmuth von Moltke invaded Austria in late June of 1866 with three major armies, each following a separate axis of advance. Using divergent approaches was risking defeat in detail, but Moltke counted on superior Prussian maneuverability to outflank the Austrian North Army under Feldzugmeister Ludwig von Benedek. Battles were fought at Nachod, Tratenau, Skalitz, Soor and Gitschen with the Prussians prevailing in nearly all those encounters. The demoralized Austrians gathered their remaining strength in front of the fortress of Koniggratz, hoping that one last titanic defensive battle would win them the war. The Prussians rushed ahead with the 1st and Elbe Armies, engaging the Austrians in their prepared positions. Prussian commanders then looked to the north for the approaching 2nd Army, hoping it would arrive in time to deliver the killing blow. But where was that army and how long would it take to deploy effectively to the battlefield? The race was on &ndash; could the North Army defeat the outnumbered Prussians before 2nd Army closed the vise or would the war end under the walls of Koniggratz?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Final Challenge is a party game so packed with action it does not have to pose as a drinking game! However, if you decide to drink while playing it please record the conversations next morning, and send them to us (we want a portion of the laugh too)!<br/><br/>Our seemingly harmless and colourful cards may give you a false sense of security, but after the first card is drawn you will be sent into a hectic and hilarious whirlwind of challenges. Watch your friends speak in an invented language, convince the rest of the group they are Satan himself, while someone is crying heavily for no apparent reason! And all of that while you are trying to use the force on a piece of paper, with a straight face on.<br/><br/>After some playing time and a couple of successfully performed challenges you may get cocky, as anyone would, which is usually when other players will use one of their special abilities to put you back in your place! It is not uncommon to get yourself in a situation where you have to perform more than one challenge simultaneously. One second you are trying to be the funniest, the next you are trying not to die of laughter because one of the players decided it was a good idea to call their mom at 3 in the morning to tell her they were arrested!<br/>In this game you are competing to outplay everyone in a creative way and be the funniest, bravest and most resourceful. Perform the challenges successfully, delegate unwanted challenges tactically, use the active and passive abilities to your advantage and be the first to gather one of the cards of each type and unlock the Final Challenge!<br/><br/>Players draw a card and reads the challenge out loud. They then choose to: Perform the challenge themself, Ask for a volunteer to perform the challenge or Attack another player.  If the challenge is performed successfully, the player keeps the card.<br/><br/>The player with the most challenge card at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is your task to undertake research at each Outpost and use the knowledge acquired to defeat the Alien threat once and for all.<br/><br/>In the game, you will be operating three astronauts as they try to research and defend their Outpost.<br/><br/>The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. Each of the 10 Outposts can be played in around 30 to 50 minutes, and each one should provide plenty of replayability due to the different combinations of starting astronauts and the random operation of the Aliens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

SSU forces considered it fortunate if their heavy equipment could be salvaged or repaired, but many damaged machines were simply left to rust on the battlefield. Now, the SSU&rsquo;s development of VK-powered walkers has led to a change in philosophy. Even destroyed, these units are still  valuable for their rare minerals and parts. Accordingly, SSU forces operate under standing orders to salvage their wreckage or, at the least, destroy fallen vehicles properly, in order to prevent their enemies from capturing their VK technology.<br/><br/>The KV47 Recovery &amp; Demolition Walker introduces one medium combat walker that can be configured as one of four different models: Maksim, Marlen, Melor, or Mikhail. Each of these walkers affords the SSU strategic advantages from its salvage operations and can pack a punch in close combat.<br/><br/>",

Periods covered in Hallowed Ground 2nd Edition include:<br/><br/>The Mexican Wars  (Texas War of Independence, Mexican-American War)<br/><br/>The Wars in India  (Sikh Wars, Indian Mutiny)<br/><br/>The Russian Wars  (Crimean War, Russo-Turkish War)<br/><br/>The Taiping Rebellion<br/><br/>The Risorgimento (1848-49, 1859)<br/><br/>The Great Paraguayan War<br/><br/>The Wars of German Unification (1866 Austro-Prussian War, 1870 Franco-Prussian War)<br/><br/>The American Civil War<br/><br/>Three scales of game are introduced in Hallowed Ground 2nd Edition - the Company Scale game, the Battalion Scale game, and the Grand Tactical Scale game.  The Company game which uses the company as the standard infantry game unit gives you the chance to be a battalion or a brigade commander in the thick of battle;  the Battalion game uses battalions as the standard infantry game unit - players can easily command a division on the tabletop.  The Grand Tactical game uses the infantry regiment as the standard infantry game unit - allowing players to command Corps on the tabletop.  The variety of wars, battles, and skirmishes throughout the period covered by Hallowed Ground, 2nd Edition requires rules that can cover engagements of all sizes.  You can use Hallowed Ground to play a skirmish between Texans and Mexicans in 1836 up to the large battles of the American Civil War and Franco-Prussian War.<br/><br/>Specific sequence deck compositions and army ratings for each period and army, combined with three unique sets of rules that cover different scale games, gives Hallowed Ground 2nd Edition unparalleled flexibility in gaming the vast array of conflicts of the 19th century.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Below is the description for &quot;signal for close action&quot; taken from the 2nd edition (1993). This are closely related to the later &quot;Signal Close Action, Fast Play&quot;, but trade complexity/depth for speed.<br/><br/>Signal Close Action has been designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set. In the Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable. His possible courses of action were governed by the &lsquo;technology&rsquo; of the time, the wind, weather, ship&rsquo;s condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships&rsquo; companies.<br/><br/>Fundamental to the rules is the Ability Chart which requires only 1 throw of dice and governs the core game (except Weather) as well as other options. Note:<br/>When for example &lsquo;movement section&rsquo; is referred to in the rules, this relates to the movement section of the Ability Chart.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Taken from the 4th edition (2005), is the description for &quot;Signal Close Action&quot; by Mr. Rod Langton.<br/><br/>&quot;This new edition of Signal Close Action is very timely, this being the year of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  It inspired me to produce, not just an update of previous editions, but an enhanced game, smoother, with more fluid movement and ability for vessels.<br/><br/>Signal Close Action was designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set.  In Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable.  His possible courses of action were governed by the 'technology' of the time, the win, weather, ship's condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships' companies.<br/><br/>For those who re very new to Napoleonic naval wargaming, you might find my Fast Play set a good introduction.  Even after you progress to a full comprehensive game, your Fast Play will still be very useful for club games and introducing others to the hobby.<br/><br/>Experienced Signal Close Action players will want to know 'what's new' in Fourth Edition.  Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.<br/><br/>Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.  The actual Firing rules are not changed noticeably but there are new separate charts for firing at unrated vessels.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sport of Kings (SOK) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the German theaters of Silesia, Moravia, Bohemia, Bavaria, and the Rhineland, beginning with the outbreak of war in 1740 and running until 1745, when Prussia withdrew from the conflict and the emphasis shifted to other theaters. From December 1740 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe.<br/><br/>SOK is a two or three-player operational study. One player is the French, one is the Allies, and a third may play the Prussians (under French control in a two-player game). The Allied army includes contingents from Britain, Hanover, Holland, Austria, Hesse, and Denmark. Saxony is a potential ally, but could join the Franco-Prussians instead. Under French command are Bavarian and Pfalz troops. The forces of the Empire are available to the side that can demonstrate the greater strength.<br/><br/>The game system is essentially the same as CoE. A number of important changes have been made to deal with the fact that there are three sides. Map scale is still 8.5 miles per hex. The counters are brigades. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions), Effectiveness (a combination of morale and training), and Movement. Turns are equivalent to months. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc. There are scenarios for the 1st and 2nd Silesian Wars, the Austro-Bavarian War, and the Dettingen campaign, plus a huge Campaign Game covering the entire period.<br/><br/>",

As commander of one of these &quot;eggshells armed with sledgehammers&quot;, it will be your task to strike first and strike hard at the enemies of your nation, whether they come in the form of fast, vicious craft like your own, or as a huge carrier battlegroup.<br/><br/>As commander of a carrier battlegroup, you must contend with tense, portentous confrontations short of war.  A nerve-wracking game of cat-and-mouse, full of posturings, threats and test of intent, must be played before the order can be given: &quot;Weapons free&quot;.  To assist you in your mission, Troubled Waters contains:<br/>- 40 new Ship Data Forms, from tiny patrol boats to a venerable aircraft carrier.<br/>- 10 new Aircraft Data Forms, from special operations helos to Mach 2 interceptors.<br/>- Missile and radar data for Soviet exported SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5 SAM systems.<br/>- Detailed carrier air wing compositions for 1986-1991 operations.<br/><br/>In order to recreate the dramatic events of this period, Troubled Waters presents 10 new scenarios covering Middle East naval clashes from 1973 to the present day:<br/>- 1973 Arab-Israeli War<br/>- Iran-Iraq War, 1980<br/>- Persian Gulf Tanker War, 1984-88<br/>- &quot;Line of Death,&quot; 1986<br/>- US reprisals against Iran, 1988<br/>- Operation Desert Storm, 1991<br/><br/>In addition, six scenario generators allow players to create and fight hypothetical battles with accurate forces from the coast of North Africa to the Strait of Hormuz.<br/><br/>With Harpoon and Troubled Waters, the possibilities of the last 18 violent years of Middle East history are laid before you.

        "description": "From the Publishers website:<br/><br/>Championship Boxing is intended to be a realistic simulation of top-class boxing producing accurate results and incorporating all the relevant factors such as boxing skill, punching power, stamina etc. Considerable thought has been given to a system of play that captures some of the 'feel' of boxing, while still playing quickly. Once the play mechanics have been thoroughly grasped each round takes only on to two minutes to play and each bout can be set up and the Scorecard prepared in about five minutes. It is thus feasible to fight a whole series of bouts in an evening's play, quickly building up statistics and rankings for all weight divisions.<br/><br/>The ratings will, of course be contentious. Everyone has their own opinion about the qualities of their own favourite fighter. All I can say is that each rating has been carefully researched, contemporary fight reports have been studied where possible, different opinions have been carefully weighed and several sources have been examined in arriving at the final figures. If you disagree with any rating try to clear your mind of bias and prejudice an if you still disagree, change it! As the purchaser the game is presented entirely for your pleasure, don't let my opinions spoil it for you!<br/><br/>On the subject of alteration of ratings the game does have another function beyond the mere replay angle. It can be used to answer some otherwise unanswerable questions. Not just, 'Who was the best, Marciano or Ali? But questions like, 'How good could Henry Cooper have been if he had not been so vulnerable to cutting around the eyes?. Would Sugar Ray Leonard have been the world's greatest ever welterweight if he had had the hitting power of Thomas Hearns? Would Floyd Paterson have been a great champion if he had had a sounder chin? The answers are there for you to  explore, just change those rating! While you are about it, why not conjure up your own personal ratings and step into the ring with Frank Bruno, Sugar Ray Robinson or Barry McGuigan.<br/><br/>LET'S RUMBLE&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Colonel Marcus Barton commands the Second Regiment of McCarron's Armored Cavalry, also known as Barton's Regiment, and he is a man obsessed. He has waited forty years to avenge his father's dishonor at the hands of Lester J. Otto. He blew his first chance, but he swears he will not make another mistake. He knows he has a second chance on Marlette, and Marcus Barton will have his revenge this time or die trying. And either way he plans to take his regiment with him...<br/><br/>McCarron's Armored Cavalry is a BattleTech scenario pack which includes the unit's history, prominent members, and special equipment. The scenarios chronicle the campaign known as &quot;Otto's Last Stand,&quot; and can be used individually or as a campaign culminating in one of three different endings. &quot;Otto's Last Stand&quot; features deadly installations and a point-based system for customizing the defending forces, so that scenarios can be fought more than once and never be the same game twice.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Like a number of similar scenario packs, this BattleTech expansion focusses on a particular unit; in this case, it's McCarron's Armored Cavalry, or &quot;the Big Mac&quot; as it's sometimes described in novels and fan circles. This scenario pack doesn't include any BattleForce scenarios, but does give more information on the unit's history and personalities than any other sourcebook out there, and introduces four new Star League era BattleMechs, along with a couple of new vehicles, which would evenutally be republished in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058. The BattleTech scenarios include a host of options that make them among the most interesting scenarios produced by FASA up to this point.<br/><br/>",

For every fleet action, there were a hundred frigate, sloop and small ship of the line engagements that turned &ldquo;command of the sea&rdquo; into the daily reality of using and controlling the sea lanes.<br/><br/>It is time for a game that focuses on the single ship duels and small squadron actions that were the main fare of sea officers - a game that provides you an opportunity to highlight seamanship and experience the differences in armament, crews and types of ships along with the details of sea tactics in this era. Post Captain has been developed to do just that.<br/><br/>It enables you to simulate convoy actions, commerce raiding, cutting out expeditions, gunboat clashes, and shore raids along with a variety of single ship duels and small squadron actions. Boat and cargo handling, challenge and deception, current and tide, floating batteries and shore defenses, kedging, mortar bombardments by bomb vessels, prize crews, stern way, blanketing and wind shadow and the less well known types of sailing rigs and vessels are all covered<br/><br/>Set during naval warfare in the period 1793 - 1815 ( the height of Age of Sail Era - the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812) and is designed for naval miniatures of all scales.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Towering several stories over its smaller brethren, this creature shakes the ground wherever it goes, causing small localized earthquakes in its wake. Near impervious to small arms fire, wounds dealt to it are regenerated almost instantly. It has been noted that when it eats its victims, its alien healing power actually speeds up, knitting even the most terrible wounds back together.<br/><br/>At range, it can project a huge ball of acid which if it hits even a target that is dug in, will melt them to little more than a puddle of matter. When it gets in close, it will unleash a screech, killing its initial enemies and then rush in with surprising speed for a creature of its size. Its gigantic claws and long tail are able to tear tanks and infantry to pieces in equal measure. Luckily, only a handful of such creatures found in the largest xenomorph hives, has ever been catalogued by human scientists.<br/><br/>Shipping of this product starts 16th of April 2018.<br/><br/>Box contains:<br/><br/>1x multipart resin Alien King model<br/><br/>1x &quot;The Bug Hunt Gamemode&quot; booklet in English language<br/><br/>",

Each player is the conductor of his/her own train and cooperates with the other players to pick up and deliver passengers to their destinations within the time frame indicated on their tickets. The number of passengers that show up each round is determined by dice and event cards bring along specific challenges. Players need to cooperate and discuss very well in order to plan each round, identify the best strategy and transfer passengers where possible in order to avoid complaints. The special dynamics of the game pick up speed when all players make their moves simultaneously within 30 seconds. At the end of the round passengers being delayed leave the game and complain if you cannot manage to smoothen the situation with vouchers. The game is lost when 8 or more passengers have complained.<br/><br/>Every gameplay is unique and influenced by different factors. Add-on variants included are<br/>(A) 8 passengers who need &quot;special treatment&quot;<br/>(B) every train has a different super-power that can be used<br/><br/>Note to everyone who does not know about German trains: Most Germans tend to complain about their railway system all the time. Everyone you approach will have a disaster story at hand about delays, cancelled trains, trains stuck on the track over night etc. They measure the service of the trains by high quality standards, globally known as &ldquo;Made in Germany&rdquo;. Therefore, most Germans will have an emotional attachment to failures on trains and will find themselves in one of the stories brought into the game through event cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Sword and Skull team card decks from the base game are replaced with the decks from this expansion. Each card has two shot sequences: a primary shot sequence that can be played immediately and a secondary shot sequence that must be activated by matching a &quot;star sign&quot; symbol. Each player has a set of five Leader cards that start the game face-up in front of them. Players then build their deck by choosing two sets of cards to play with from their team (fighters, spell casters, hunters, creatures, or explorers). Players must play a card from their hand (or flip over one of their Leader cards) to perform the card's primary sequence and may choose to play another card to activate the primary card's secondary shot sequence (a Leader card can also be used for this purpose). Anytime a player cannot draw a card, their discarded cards are reshuffled. The expansion adds the leech shot and new rules for the fireball, missile, and wave ranged shots. It also introduces the new &quot;Dot&quot; connector which enables *both* Character discs to perform a shot.

        "description": "Field Commander - Robert E. Lee builds on the design and gameplay of Field Commander - Napoleon to put the player firmly in control of the Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War, with the Union forces controlled by an AI.<br/><br/>Fight in 5 Campaigns<br/><br/><br/>     Seven Days Battles<br/>     Second Manassas<br/>     Antietam<br/>     Chancellorsville<br/>     Gettysburg<br/><br/><br/>Field Commander - Robert E. Lee is based on the Field Commander - Napoleon design, with some important differences and developments.<br/><br/>Difficulty Levels: The player may choose to tailor his experience of Field Commander Robert E. Lee by modifying the Difficulty Level between Regular, Hard and Veteran. There are various ways the difficulty level can affect the game and the player can choose one or more effects, or mix different Difficulty Levels to produce different effects. For example, the player could choose to use the Regular Fog of War table, combined with the Hard Command Points option and the Veteran Special Rules of a particular campaign.<br/><br/>Scout Counters: Greater availability and use of Scout counters to create decision-heavy gameplay and the manner in which cavalry were employed on the battlefield during the American Civil War as compared to the Napoleonic era.<br/><br/>Command Points: Command Points replace Supply Points. Command Points are used in a similar manner however, but represent reforming broken Forces or calling to arms odd Brigades and Regiments that are marching on different roads. Command Points can also be accumulated when a Force reaches certain Regions on the Battlefield Sheet and reflect greater morale.<br/><br/>Union Orders: Each Campaign map includes a Battle Area, which is distinct from the rest of the game board (you can see it described with red borders on the sample map art). Union Forces follow Campaign Map Orders until they enter the Battle Area, at which point the Battle Area Orders table is followed. This simulates more carefully the Union actions once battle commenced properly.<br/><br/>Union Tactics: Aggressive vs Defensive. No more sitting at the back of the Battlefield sheet blasting the advancing enemy. The Union AI will only attack when the odds are in its favor.<br/><br/>Special Battle Plans: An expanded range of Special Battle Plans for the Union AI to use that simulate combat in the ACW. The Union AI will now only charge en masse, while Flanking Fire and Hidden March threaten the rear of the Confederate army. No place on the battlefield is safe!<br/><br/>Capturing Artillery: Rather than Destroy artillery, both the Confederate player and the Union AI will instead capture 'abandoned' artillery and use the cannon to their own advantage. Historically this was especially important to the Confederates who suffered at the hands of superior Union guns and ammunition.<br/><br/>Artillery Range Attenuation: The further away the target, the less effective the artillery!<br/><br/>Each Campaign introduces detailed Special Rules that highlight the key events, features and commander personalities of each battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game engine uses a combination of team and individual player qualities to rate teams on scoring ability, home run hitting power, pitching, run prevention and defense.<br/><br/>With FIB, each game will take 10 minutes or less to play and will produce a basic line score including runs, hits, and errors. Pitcher decisions and key AB&rsquo;s including home runs can also be tracked. Some run scoring events will be automatic, but many will be dependent on pitcher grades, or a pitcher vs. batter matchup. The game was designed to play fast, but provide compelling gameplay and narrative drama.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players can choose to split their resource draws between the 'rare' and 'common' resource decks, and will need cards from both decks to make upgrades and purchase cards.  Trading is permitted, and the game encourages creative trades.  The game ends wither when a player hits 12 VP.  However, when players draw Artifacts from the resource decks (which serve as wild cards), the 'discovery dawning track' advances; if it completed, the game ends and the victor is determined by counting a different sort of VP.<br/><br/>The game includes basic and advanced rules, so that beginners are not overwhelmed by the special powers available to them.  There are several viable paths to victory, and the game supports different play styles depending on your chosen path to victory (isolationist, interactive, aggressive).<br/><br/>From the beginning of the rules:<br/>Welcome to a mysterious island in the Bermuda Triangle, where you and your opponents represent freshly-arrived teams in search of incredible power and money.  In order to be victorious, you must manage resourced wisely, plan coordinated attacks, and accomplish cunning trades.  Multiple routes exist to the finish line - will you be the one who best analyzes the given situation an emerges victorious?

The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.<br/><br/>The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the British Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the British Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).<br/><br/>The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.<br/><br/>The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.<br/><br/>Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. <br/>Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.<br/>Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.<br/><br/>Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points. These can be used to force the enemy to re-roll a dice against one of your Infantry Counters, but should you loose you will have less Bravery Points for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Solitaire Game<br/>The Solitaire takes the key gameplay from the two player game such as Combat Resolution and Movement etc and layers in specific Solitaire rules, AI for the opposing German forces and special Solitaire scenarios.<br/><br/>The Solitaire game features a full and simple AI to handle the opposing force, that will take you step-by-step to which order the enemy counters should be activated and their actions.<br/><br/>",

The first is party creation.  A party consists of four characters and any followers a player chooses to add.  Each character is created based on one of the hero miniatures the player chose to use.  Heroes are built much like characters in a role-playing game, with attributes, skills, traits and gear.  Among the most often used traits are the follower traits.  Depending on how many trait choices a hero is given a follower can be an assistant or a powerful beast.<br/><br/>A game begins by players rolling for which of the eight scenarios they will be playing.  Depending on the scenario each player is given a number of terrain points with which they can customize the table.  A game has at least five rounds, at the end of round 5, and each turn after, one of the players will roll to see if the game ends.  At the beginning of each round players roll for initiative.  The player that wins initiative takes his or her turn. During a player's turn each member of his or her party may take one action.  Examples of actions include Sprint, Charge, Cast a Spell, and Searching Terrain. Searching, combat and some hero traits give a party victory points, the party with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Finally, once a game has come to an end players roll to determine the treasure they have picked up, if any of their miniatures take permanent injuries, and collect experience for their heroes.  Once all that is settled players take turns having a miniature in their party take an out of game action.  Examples of out of game action include selling unwanted items, creating items, ritual spells and completing quests found during game play.  Completing quests, winning games, hoarding treasure and a few other actions adds to a party's legacy.<br/>Legacy is the ultimate determining factor in winning a campaign.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A historical module scenario pack for Advanced Squad Leader from Lone-Canuck Publishing.<br/><br/>In the early morning hours of 10 May 1940, a single code-word &ldquo;Danzig&rdquo; was transmitted to German forces and at 04:30 hours, German panzers rumbled westward across the border into the Low Countries, heralding the start of the Blitzkrieg in the West. Without encountering significant obstacles, the reconnaissance elements of the 1.Panzerdivision raced across Luxembourg, crossing the 50 kilometres, even before the inhabitants were awake, and reaching the Belgian frontier at Martelange at 07.45 hours. The German plan foresaw an attack on Martelange by Marschgruppe Voraus &ndash; a motorcycle company supported by armoured cars - then an attack on Bodange by the entire Advance Guard.<br/><br/>This tactical mission (TM) revolves around the efforts of the Belgian 5th Company, 1er Regiment de Chasseurs Ardennais'  valiant attempt to slow the Germans' Race for the Meuse River. This TM is compatible with MMP's ASL System and modifiable to be used with other miniature Wargaming systems.<br/><br/>The Tactical Mission Pack comes with 1x Tactical Mission (a.k.a. Campaign Game) + 5 Scenario played on a historically based (24&frac12;&quot;x 35&quot; with standard ASL 7/8&quot; hexes) map of the Sure River Valley; between the villages of Wisembach and Bodange, located 3-kilometres west of the Belgian-Luxembourg border.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ancient Pub Battles is a Military Strategy Game where you can fight the battles from the 2nd Punic Wars virtually anywhere.  It pits Rome vs Carthage.  Scipio Africanus vs Hannibal.<br/><br/>The game is played with blocks marking infantry and cavalry on an open field with no terrain. Movement is measured with distance marker sticks, and combat is resolved with a simple dice pool mechanism.<br/><br/>Games last for up to 8 turns, and movement order is determined through a chit pull mechanism. When a general&rsquo;s chit is pulled, he may command armies in range or contact. Players may defer or jump in the turn order by rolling against a command rating for their generals on the field.<br/><br/>Players may choose from four included historical scenarios, or build armies with a point system which also determines the winner of a battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RULES<br/>2-4 Players. Age +6 years<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>At first sight, memm appears to be a simple game as it is composed by only 36 geometric cubes of different colours. However, memm goes far beyond this apparent simplicity. memm is a dynamic, visually entertaining and aesthetically attractive  game, but above all, memm  is game full of possibilities and lots of game play. These characteristics makes memm the ideal cognitive development game to play with the whole family.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/>The 36 coloured cubes are placed on the table, mixed and shared equally amongst the participants. Then a cube with all the six colours is rolled. The player having the cube with the resulting colour on all its 6 sides will start the game by placing this cube in the centre of the table.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Clockwise, the following players will place one cube so that joining sides match colours.  A cube can be placed on top of the starting cube. However, this move will be subject to a special rule that will be discussed in the SPECIAL RULE section.<br/><br/>ABILITY TO REPEAT TURN<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn if he joins a cube by two sides. Please note this is only physically possible as from the fourth turn.<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of one of his cubes by handing it to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by three sides.<br/>A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of two of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by four sides.<br/><br/>If a player joins a cube by five sides, gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of three of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice.<br/><br/>SPECIAL RULE<br/>No more than three cubes will be placed in the same direction in a row of turns. This rule prevents the formation of continuous lines of cubes and is not to be confused with a limitation of the central structure being developed during the game. When a player places a cube on top of another, the player will have, on his next turn, the possibility of you can also put it in one of the free sides of any of the cubes that are in the same vertical.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The first player who gets rid of all his cubes wins the game. However, unless this player is the last to play in the round, the remaining players will be placing their cubes until the full round of turns is completed. At that point, the player left with more cubes loses. In a tie in number of cubes , you will lose more different colours have. If they have the same number of colours , the result will be a tie.<br/><br/>VARIATIONS OF THE GAME<br/>This is the basic and general form of the game. Nevertheless, a number of variants were also explored to create a series of dimensional figures that would condition the placement of cubes. Some examples are detailed in the photo section. <br/>A rotating circular table can be added to the game to facilitate players with the different angles and spatial perspective of the figure being created and gain fluency and aesthetics in the game.<br/>Specification (Components, forms, materials, sizes):<br/>Components : game box , instructions , manual with different figures to make and 36 cubes with the following distribution of coloured sides :<br/>6 cubes with all sides the same colour.<br/>6 cubes with 5 sides of the same colour and with a different side.<br/>6 cubes with 4 sides of the same colour and with 2 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with 3 sides of the same colour and with 3 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with 2 sides of the same colour and with 4 different sides.<br/>6 cubes with all sides of different colour.<br/><br/>In principle, the chosen colours are red , yellow , orange , violet, blue and green.<br/><br/>Each cube will have on each side a roman number that determines the number of sides with that colour. For example, a &quot;V&quot; on the a red face of a cube means that there are 5 red sides on that cube.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1 Descripci&oacute;n de memm: Jugadores: de 2 a 4. Edad: +6 a&ntilde;os.<br/>memm aparenta ser un juego sencillo por tratarse s&oacute;lo de 36 cubos geom&eacute;tricos de diferentes colores, pero va m&aacute;s all&aacute; de esa aparente sencillez. memm es un juego con multitud de posibilidades, din&aacute;mico, muy est&eacute;tico (al quedar figuras de colores incre&iacute;bles), entretenido y, sobre todo, con much&iacute;sima jugabilidad.<br/><br/>2 Instrucciones<br/>Se colocan los 36 cubos de colores en la mesa, se remueven y se reparten equitativamente entre los jugadores participantes. Se lanza un cubo con un color diferente en cada cara y empieza el que tenga el cubo con las 6 caras del color que haya salido. Se comienza la partida situando el cubo en el centro de la mesa. El siguiente jugador (los turnos se realizan en orden del sentido de las agujas del reloj) tendr&aacute; que colocar una de las caras de los cubos que le ha tocado en una de las caras libres del &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto en la mesa. Esta uni&oacute;n de caras s&oacute;lo se podr&aacute; realizar si coinciden en su color. Los jugadores podr&aacute;n situar el cubo en la cara superior, pero esta acci&oacute;n estar&aacute; sujeta a una regla especial de la secci&oacute;n 3. Se proceder&aacute; de la misma manera en turnos siguientes con las siguientes condiciones:<br/> 3 Posibilidad de repetici&oacute;n de turno<br/><br/>Cubo toca una sola cara con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: no coloca ning&uacute;n cubo m&aacute;s y pasa a siguiente jugador seg&uacute;n turno.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca dos caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca tres caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de un cubo suyo, entreg&aacute;ndoselo al jugador que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca cuatro caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de dos cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>Cubo en la mesa toca cinco caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de tres cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores  que crea conveniente.<br/><br/>4 Reglas especiales<br/>No se podr&aacute; colocar m&aacute;s de tres cubos en turnos seguidos en la misma direcci&oacute;n. Esta regla evita la formaci&oacute;n de una l&iacute;nea interminable de cubos y no debe ser confundida con una limitaci&oacute;n de las dimensiones de la estructura a formar durante el juego.<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador coloca un cubo sobre otro cubo en cualquier nivel de la estructura, el mismo jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de 2 o m&aacute;s caras) o el siguiente jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de una sola cara) deber&aacute; colocar su cubo de tal manera que haga contacto con la vertical sobre la que descansa ese cubo, incluyendo &eacute;ste.<br/><br/>5 Objetivo final<br/>Un jugador ganar&aacute; la partida cuando sea el primero en deshacerse de todos sus cubos, aunque deber&aacute; esperar a que el &uacute;ltimo jugador de esa ronda haya completado su turno. Es decir, el resto de jugadores  podr&aacute;n colocar sus cubos e incluso entregar sus cubos a cualquier contrincante hasta la finalizaci&oacute;n esa ronda.. En ese momento, perder&aacute; el que se haya quedado con m&aacute;s cubos. Si hay empate en n&uacute;mero de cubos, perder&aacute; el que m&aacute;s colores diferentes posea. Si tienen el mismo n&uacute;mero de colores, habr&aacute; empate en dicho jugadores.<br/><br/>Esta es la modalidad b&aacute;sica y general del juego. Pero se pens&oacute; en las miles de posibilidades de unas piezas tan vers&aacute;tiles. Por lo que se empez&oacute; a crear una serie de figuras ficticias para delimitar la colocaci&oacute;n de los cubos. Se detallar&aacute; alg&uacute;n ejemplo en la secci&oacute;n de fotos. Tambi&eacute;n se puede incorporar al juego una <br/>tabla circular giratoria para as&iacute; facilitar la visi&oacute;n espacial de la figura desde cualquier perspectiva y de paso agilizar el juego.<br/><br/>Memoria descriptiva (Componentes, formas, materiales, medidas):<br/><br/>6 Componentes<br/>Caja de juego, instrucciones, manual con las diferentes figuras a realizar y 36 cubos con la siguiente distribuci&oacute;n de caras de colores:<br/><br/>6 cubos con todas las caras de un mismo color.<br/>6 cubos con 5 caras de un mismo color y con una cara de color diferente.<br/>6 cubos con 4 caras de un mismo color y con 2 caras de color diferente.<br/>6 cubos con 3 caras de un mismo color y con 3 caras de color diferente.<br/>6 cubos con 2 caras de un mismo color y con 4 caras de color diferente.<br/>6 cubos con todas sus caras de color diferente.<br/>En principio, los colores elegidos son el rojo, amarillo, naranja, violeta, azul y  verde.<br/><br/>Cada cubo tendr&aacute; en cada cara un n&uacute;mero en romano que determina el n&uacute;mero de caras que tiene ese color en el cubo. Por ejemplo, si en una cara roja de un cubo se encuentra una &ldquo;V&rdquo;, significar&aacute; que en ese cubo hay 5 caras rojas.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like all members of the 18xx family, this game is played in alternating stock rounds, where players buy and sell shares in multiple corporations, and sets of operating rounds, where the corporations operate on the map and possibly pay dividends to their shareholders. At the end of the game the player with the greatest net worth in stock value and cash holdings wins.<br/><br/>This is 18xx on a large scale - 40 railroad companies, two oversize map sheets, 825 tiles, 480 cards (stock shares, trains, private corporations), and a play time to match.<br/><br/>This game takes the &quot;D&quot; variant of 18C2C: Manifest Destiny and reimplements it on an even larger map (the US, Canada, and Mexico) with a variety of rule changes to provide play variability and balance, most notably player-driven upgrade paths for cities (so that cities will grow to different values in different games) providing new sources of tension in the stock rounds.<br/><br/>Game features taken from 18C2C: Manifest Destiny include a reservation auction for private companies (similar to 1830), full capitalization, company destinations (somewhat similar to the destinations in 1870: Railroading Across the Trans Mississippi from 1870), corporate share redemption, and two types of mergers (voluntary mergers between pairs of companies, and two involuntary mergers of failed railroads into government railroads). High-level &quot;D&quot; trains run short routes (3 to 6 cities) and double the values, simplifying route building and calculation.<br/><br/>Intended publication is set for 2015 as a full commercial production similar to 18OE, and possibly a conversion kit to include only those components different from 18C2C: Manifest Destiny.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every tribe on Apsyntion has the same origin story - the same apocrypha retold for generations. That once, our people came from the stars. That their homeworld was lost, swallowed by Wormwood, and the ancestors built the arks in a last desperate gasp, releasing them to the sky like so many seeds in the wind. That the people of the ark, so roughly deposited on the soil of an alien Eden, fought for the right to rule this new world and remake it in their own image.<br/><br/>Sovereign is an expandable card game where each player controls a burgeoning far-future civilization at the brink of war. You will build an empire from the ground up, managing civilians and military units, along with facilities unique to your faction's way of life.<br/><br/>Each player controls one of ten factions, with a personal ideology represented by a prebuilt deck. A deck has 30 unique cards specific to that faction, and 20 cards called Echoes- remnants of the ark that brought humanity to this world.  Score ten Echoes and you win the game, but an Echo is always vulnerable in the meantime, whether it's in your hand or on the table. You'll defend your own Echoes with units and facilities you build, or steal them from opponents by attacking where you think the Echoes are hiding. Forge them yourself or steal them from other players- build or conquer, it's up to you.<br/><br/>The game is designed so that the backs of the cards are used as much as the front, since each card back is used to track construction progress from turn to turn, without revealing the card underneath. Citizens are represented by double-sided tokens used initially for building cards, but when flipped become lower class workers, who might power facilities, or become soldiers to fuel your dominance.<br/><br/>Sovereign is great as a 2 player game, but optimized for 3-4, with an array of cards that can be used to hinder or help opponents - encouraging fragile, temporary alliances. The game combines the best elements from worker placement games and CCGs, to create a dynamic hybrid experience where a society can rise and fall in under 2 hours, with over 300 unique cards.<br/><br/>",

You saw father&rsquo;s instructions. We were to be alone when you open the box. We&rsquo;ve been lieutenants in this company for long enough. Himori-san groomed us well to take over in his stead. Now, open it and read the will.&rdquo; Akihiko&rsquo;s voice was firm but he touched his brother&rsquo;s wrist reassuringly.<br/><br/>Isamu gasped as he looked into the box. An antique tanto, stained with blood lay upon a handwritten page. This was clearly not the legal volume they were expecting to help them divide their father&rsquo;s multinational.<br/><br/>Isamu gingerly extracted the page and began to read, &ldquo;Sons, you have honored me, but I have misled you. I have hidden the story of my ancestors and you think your martial arts training was to give you discipline and honor in the boardroom. If I am not here to tell you the story myself, you will find this hard to believe. Now that Night has come, Tori is worthless compared to your true legacy...<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>Rai put down her pen and wondered how Osamu Himori&rsquo;s children would react to the change. Like the rest of the world, they thought of her as Himori-san&rsquo;s secretary. Would the truth be too much for them? Not all of Himori-san&rsquo;s business dealings were above board, especially in the early days. Now there was more espionage than bone breaking, but no one suspected the woman taking notes at Himori-san&rsquo;s side also managed Tori&rsquo;s seedy underbelly. Forever Osamu&rsquo;s confidante, she knew one day she might have to lead the boys on a much darker path than she had ever travelled. The Night ... who could believe those stories? And how could she keep poor Kukiko in the dark? She must never know what took her father and was bound to take her brothers.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>Kukiko tapped her earpiece and put it on her dresser. Too strong to be pushed aside because she was a woman, she had taken her future into her own hands long ago. Some may call it spying, she preferred to think of it as preparation for her role in the family. She did not need to hear the rest of the will, she had discovered her father&rsquo;s secrets long ago.<br/><br/>Mechanically, she applied her white face paint, a simple disguise she took from her name. She picked up her tessen and began her kata.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DNGN is a solitaire print and play euro-inspired dungeon crawler with a minimalist style and a branching campaign.<br/><br/>The player assigns cubes to Action Slots on Skill and Equipment cards each turn, determining the Actions they want to take. Each card has three Action Slots, but they must be filled from left to right on each card. Some Action Slots are Exhausting, and will make the cube assigned to them unavailable next turn, and others can only be activated by special Mana Cubes which must first be gained with another Action. Once cubes have been assigned, a Behaviour card is drawn, describing what Monsters will do turn. Only once this is revealed does the Player take her Actions, which may not now be the most efficient choices.<br/><br/>After the Player has performed her Actions, Monsters resolve their Behaviours according to fixed rules, with four different AI types for different types of Monsters, and unique monster behaviours leading to them behaving in very varied ways.<br/><br/>Monsters are represented on the map by tokens with minimalist shapes, and a Mission Card shows which shape represents which Monster. The details of each Monster are on a Monster Card, which shows their attributes and special behaviours.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, a timer ticks down, and when it hits zero it resets, but the Player must lose one Stamina cube for the rest of the Mission, a constant fatigue effect that pushes you on and makes Missions harder as they go on.<br/><br/>At the end of each Mission, the reverse of the Mission card will branch the story depending on whether you succeeded or failed, and sometimes a decision you have to make. There are 18 Mission Cards, but in any one campaign you'll play about 10, so there is high replay value. Every time you succeed in a Mission you'll get a chance to upgrade your Character in a way of your choice, allowing you to customise as you improve.<br/><br/>DNGN was first released in the BGG 2020 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The series featured 'Number 6' a former secret agent of the British Government during the Cold War, who is never identified by name. After resigning his position he is abducted and held prisoner in a small, isolated eccentric sea-side resort known only as 'The Village'.<br/><br/>'Card- Board Games' is a new and exciting concept in tabletop adventure games play. From a simple pack of cards you are able to build up a unique playing area from the centre of your dining table. Since the cards are laid strategically then each game you play will be different and pose new challenges for you.<br/><br/>A playing piece and a few counters are all you need to start the game. Its your job to move your playing piece along the paths to the outer limits of the board without other players getting in your way. As the game develops you collect additional cards which will either help you on your way or impede the progress of the other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Honour web site:<br/><br/>&quot;Rommel is a tabletop game of great battles in the European and Mediterranean theatres of the Second World War. The player takes the role of a general commanding an entire division, or elements of several divisions, or an entire corps or even an army. Units represent companies and battalions. Tens of thousands of men and machines clash for control of miles of territory. Make decisions about the application of air power, engineering, the use of reconnaissance, the commitment of mobile reserves, and many other things.<br/><br/>Rommel can be played with miniature figures and terrain -OR- with &ldquo;unit cards&rdquo; on any flat surface. You may in fact use both in the same game, since the cards can act as labels and play-aids for your bases of miniatures. The basic game introduces players to the operational decisions of a second world war general. Two players can complete a game in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>The full advanced game features:<br/><br/>- Large battles and multi-player games.<br/>- A complete army and battlefield creation system for fictional scenarios, including thirteen army lists for six major powers.<br/>- Guidelines for players who want to create their own historical scenarios from famous battles.<br/>- Detailed rules for things like amphibious and airborne operations, cavalry, minefields, pioneer and special assault units, and much more.<br/><br/>Use Rommel to recreate your favorite historical battles, or use its army-building system to create fictional armies from six major nationalities during all periods of the war. The &ldquo;Open Architecture&rdquo; system allows you to modify the game&rsquo;s points and units to create any other nationalities and armies, or interesting What-Ifs. (For example, what if Fascist Spain had joined the war in 1941? What if the Americans had entered before Pearl Harbor?)<br/><br/>A unique scenario creation system allows players to &ldquo;bid&rdquo; for the resources with which to create their armies and then automatically adjusts scenario conditions and choices accordingly. There is no scripted &ldquo;attacker and defender.&rdquo; Instead, a player who chose to fight at a disadvantage in points has many advantages in the creation of the scenario.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Night Market, you are a business owner who is trying to construct stalls to sell food to customers with distinctive tastes. These customers will move through your night market looking for their cravings to be fulfilled. To capitalize, you must acquire different foods from the city and strategically place them in your night market to accommodate your customers. Furthermore, your customers are also seeking and are willing to pay more for specialty dishes. The challenge is you only have so much time to shop for ingredients and prepare for the market&rsquo;s opening. Customers that are satiated, will become loyal customers and come back for another visit. Customers that are disappointed, will leave. Night Market couples a spatial worker placement mechanism with challenging resource management to maintain customer loyalty resulting in sales. At the end of the game, the player who has earned the most reputation will be regarded as the &ldquo;Best Night Market&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>A Note from the Designer:<br/>When I moved to Taiwan in 2010, it did not take long to fall in love with night markets&mdash;the vibrant colors, the bustling alleyways, and of course, the food. I quickly realized that the night market was a microcosm of Taiwanese culture. So, like many travelers, I made a point to visit the major night market in each city I visited to sample the regional dish that made each market &ldquo;famous.&rdquo; What I did not realize until after a few years of living in Taiwan is that night markets are ubiquitous. Every neighborhood has one. You could walk through a seemingly quiet alleyway and stumble across an absolute gem of a night market that features the city&rsquo;s best beef noodles. This is what I wanted to capture in the design of this game: that the food of any small night market can easily compete with that of the major ones.<br/><br/>While I could not possibly include all the famous dishes that Taiwan has to offer, I chose a few iconic ones mixed with my personal favorites. I hope this game gives you a glimpse of an aspect of Taiwanese culture that I fell in love with in my time living there, and more so, I hope that you will be able to experience a Taiwanese night market yourself one day.<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!<br/>-Adam Zwain<br/><br/>",

Players receive three demand cards which each have three possible deliveries.  To complete a delivery a player must connect the demanding city with the city that supplies the good it needs.  Building track costs money, and the payout for each load is always going to be slightly less than the cost to build the track to make the connection.  This pricing mechanism forces players to coordinate the deliveries on all three cards to maximize the use of their track in order to turn a profit.  Once one of the three deliveries on a card is made, a new card is drawn to take its place.  Play continues until a player reaches $250 million and has connected all but one of the major cities.<br/><br/>This print and play game is free to download.  It requires a copy of another crayon rails game for the money and trains.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>&quot;When the Civil War of 3014 was over, Captain-General Janos Marik emerged triumphant.<br/><br/>But at what a cost...<br/><br/>Marik has lost his brother, his wife, and his confidence. The realm he rules, the Free Worlds League, weakened by over two centuries of warfare with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Capellan Confederation, is being torn apart by the diversity that was once its greatest strength.<br/><br/>Yet the winds of change blow throughout the Inner Sphere. Marik has entered into an alliance with the Draconis Combine and his former enemies the Capellans, an alliance that may tip the balance of power for centuries to come.<br/><br/>This ComStar report on House Marik and the Free Worlds League includes dozens of full-color illustrations depicting League personalities, daily life, and military regalia. Classified documents on League and various League factions' armed forces, military structure, and political intrigues are also provided. In addition, the large history chapter stretches from the initial unification of the Marik Commonwealth, the Principality of Regulus, and the Duchy of Oriente to form the League through House Marik's consolidation of power and its position today as leader of the now divided Free Worlds League.&quot;<br/><br/>User Comment:<br/><br/>This early expansion produced by FASA gives a wealth of detail on House Marik for use in campaigns under the then-current BattleTech 2nd Edition, BattleForce and MechWarrior rules. This House book doesn't give as much detail as the others in the series on the military units and their distribution, but was current up until 3025.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After winning the war against Athens, Minosse ordered that each year, 9 young men and 9 young women were to be sent as sacrifice to the Minotaur. Teseo departed to end this foul doing. In Creta met Arianna, Minosse' daughter, that fell in love with him and reveled him the greatest labyrinth secret: the strength of the Minotaur came from 4 magic Talismans created by Minosse, infusing the creature's soul in them. The only way to kill the Minotaur was to divide the Talisman. Teseo did it, after avoiding the maze traps, than fought the man-bull, killing it after a fierce battle. <br/>Hundreds of years later, a greedy hand was going to get the last of the four mighty artifacts, not caring about the warning Teseo carved on the maze wall &ldquo;Never gather what has been divided&rdquo;. A tremor shook the walls and with a loud roar the central labyrinth section collapsed, filling the air with a cloud of hundreds years old dust. A scary and inhuman scream echoed through the stone corridors and while the dust fell down, a huge shape with pointed horns and a large, sharp axe in hand slowly appeared.<br/><br/>Minosse is a labyrinth game in which four player compete to collect talismans and to get out before the Minotaur catches them.<br/><br/>The board is created by randomly placing tiles in a 8&times;8 square, with the four goal squares in the center, and with adventurers' starting tiles in the four corners.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 phases:<br/><br/>     In the first phases the adventurers run toward the center of the labyrinth to get the first talisman. First one to arrive chooses first. To do this, each player gets 3 action points that can be used to rotate tiles, creating a free path to the center, to move from one tile to the next one (as long as you have a connected hallway. Note: these AP (action points) can rotate any tile, so you can use them to slow opponents, disrupting their path. With he first talisman, you also earn a God favor. Talisman power recharges with time, after you use it; God favor is a one shoot power to help you win.<br/>     The second phase starts after everyone gets one talisman. Adventurers must collect the other 3 talismans to complete the ancient artifact. The rules are the same as the first phase, 3 AP for rotating tiles, moving, and activating Talismans where needed.<br/>     When the first adventurer collects the fourth talisman phase 3 begins. The labyrinth center crumbles, and the exit appears. The exit is guarded by the Minotaur, who'll try to catch everyone that got all the four talismans. After each adventurer's turn, the Minotaur moves. Each player secretly lays down a card with a direction and they reveal them all together. The Minotaur moves according to cards. If the Minotaur hits an adventurer with 4 talismans, he badly slows him down. The winner is first adventurer to reach the exit carrying four talismans.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ancient times long gone by, when the veil between the world of the humans and the realm of magic was thinner, almighty wizards battled each other in epic duels to determine who was the master of sorcery and arcane wisdom. Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent's card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he puts the top card of his or her deck on his Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player is unable to draw a card, he loses immediately.<br/><br/>Elemental Clash: Legendary Legacy will be the first of hopefully many Expansion to Elemental Clash: The Master Set, featuring state-of-the-art illustrations done by professional artists (as opposed to the pre-Master Set versions of the game). This exciting new expansion will contain over 90 different Creatures, Spells and Element Stones as well as 10 brand-new, powerful Spellcaster cards and introduce Neutral cards (cards that belong to no particular Element) and a new sub-type of Spells: Equip-Spells as well as the Familiar Spirit Creature Subtype among other things. Furthermore, the set will feature lots of powerful &quot;Unique&quot; cards, Dragon Lords and might Kings and Queens, making it literally a &quot;royal&quot; expansion to Elemental Clash: The Master Set!<br/><br/>The expansion will not contain Basic Element Stones which are included in the base game and needed to build decks and play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SETTING<br/>In this Dieselpunk universe, after the first Global War the world experienced several advances in technology but was still in a state of distrust, with a second Global War all but guaranteed to happen.<br/>However, an unexpected alien invasion forced the world's nations to cooperate, as the threat seemed impossible to be dealt individualy. The comanders enlisted to lead the First Response Initiative are capable and will fight fiercely to defend humanity, but they are still a product of their era and therefore are very interested in their own agenda as well: after the invasion ends, they want a place of power for themselves.<br/><br/>THE MENACE<br/>In First Response, you know very little about your enemy. You only know that they are stronger, have incredible technology and are very aggressive.<br/>Where are they from? What are their objectives? You will probably never know.<br/>They invaded without warning and never attempted to communicate. It is impossible to interrogate them as most of their soldiers dissolve in a pile of goo seconds after dying and the corpses of their leaders are also of little help (you can&rsquo;t keep them alive  for more than a few hours).<br/>You don&rsquo;t even know how they talk among themselves as they emit almost no sound (and some don&rsquo;t even have a mouth).<br/>Your soldiers are prone to panic when confronting them and you do not have enough resources to build and research what you need, let alone what you want.<br/>What can you possibly do to change that?<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>In First Response, whenever you prepare to fight or actually fight the alien menace you might gain Victory Points.<br/>Each game round has two phases: Scanning for Activity and Action.<br/>In the scanning for Activity Phase, players will &ldquo;seed&rdquo; the world, dictating the rhythm of the game and setting everything up for the next Phase.<br/>In the Action Phase, players can do one of two things: manage their bases or go into a mission.<br/>While managing your base you will spend resources to recruit personnel, build facilities, research new technologies and so on.<br/>Missions can be on the air or on the ground and they are the best opportunity to acquire VP and put your hands in precious loot (like parts from alien ships). It is also an opportunity to promote your rookies to veterans (if they survive) an gain medals for acts of bravery (or stupidity).<br/>The game is played in this manner until the Response Marker reaches the Game Over, Man space or until the Terror Marker reaches  a certain point in the Terror Track.<br/>Both conditions trigger the final phase of the game: the Assault on the Alien Base, a very difficult mission with special conditions for  acquiring Victory Points.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>As the commander of one of First Response Initiative (FRI) bases in a secret location in the world, your personal objective is to be recognized as the best one to lead us against the alien menace.<br/>The winner of First Response is the one with most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game.<br/>If you manage to destroy the Alien Base at the end, the winner will be chosen as the new leader of the FRI.<br/>If you fail, the winner will  be the leader of the underground resistance against the new master race on the planet.<br/>In that case, the game will be over, but the fight will continue...<br/><br/>THE STANDARD AND ADVANCED RULES<br/>The first part of the rulebook comprises the standard set of rules of the game, with more complicated cards and interactions available in the Advanced Rules.<br/>The standard rules are enough for a great experience and veteran gamers should not skip it, as at least one play with this more straightforward approach can significantly enhance further plays as you have the opportunity to get acquainted with the game flow and to get a firm grasp of the rules.<br/>The advanced rules will add variety and complexity. Timing will be much more important. Negotiations will be much more important. Knowing what your opponents are planning will be much more important. And the aliens will also be tougher.<br/>You will also have more tools to deal with the aliens and to change the game environment. You also can, if you want, add just some elements of the Advanced Rules and introduce them to your game group in small doses.<br/>Keep in mind, though that some of the advanced rules complement each other and work better with the full set of rules.<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS<br/>The standard rules are for games of 3 to 5 players. However, the 5-player game requires some minor alterations that are highlighted in the rulebook when necessary.<br/><br/>OPTIONAL DIFICULTIES AND MODULES<br/>First Response also comes with some optional stuff. Those includes difficulty settings for the game (including the sadistic IRONMAN MODE), a customizable way to taylor how the game advances and a cooperative variant. The cooperative variant supports 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mighty family and a righteous name. It is but a stepping stone to your true calling. Your rightful dominion&hellip; over all the world!  Reign of Man is an empire management and territory control war game, for 2-5 players, that takes around an hour from start to finish.<br/><br/>Summary: <br/>Reign of Man is a fast paced new take on the strategy war game that tips its hat to classics of the past while presenting a fresh and approachable combination of territory control, engine building and rapid dice driven battle resolution. Reign of Man moves along at a clip, as each player can only choose one action to take each turn, and it doesn&rsquo;t take all afternoon to play to resolution, unlike many of its predecessors. Players are all equally effected by global events, which everyone sees coming several turns in advance. This helps guide you to knew strategies and lend replayability without being punishingly random. Winning comes down to engine development and not just having all the land. Exactly how you win depends on how you rule your kingdom. The Legendfolk and March of the Damned expansion introduce a host of high fantasy themes and, like the core game, are brought to life by the incredible artwork of Erwin Arozza.<br/><br/>Reign of Man - Legendfolk (included expansion)<br/><br/>Legendfolk introduces a set of fantastical ancient races that exist in the world but aren&rsquo;t widespread enough for a grab at controlling it. They fear for their people and will offer their skills in return for protection. Players may contact them and dedicate armies from their available army pools to bolster their defenses, through a bidding process, in order to take advantage of their special abilities and units. This expansion can be played with 2 - 5 players in conjunction with the Reign of Man rules and components.<br/><br/>Reign of Man &ndash; March of the Damned (included expansion)<br/><br/>The world shudders as your people watch the dead rise under the command of great and powerful Lich Queens. Wicked beasts, they wield otherworldly powers and lay waste to our lands. Who will save us? Who will command our armies? The people await your mercy and your might. This variant can be played by itself or along with the Legendfolk. The Reign of Man rules apply to March of the Damned.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/><br/>Players begin the game with an empire mat that is somewhat developed and get right into the action of taking a single action each turn, in clockwise order.<br/><br/>Basic actions are to:<br/><br/>Develop your empire, building your engine by making improvements to your empire mat  <br/>Mobilize armies by moving them to adjacent territories, and in some cases trigger battles, resolved by the rolling of dice  <br/>Raise more armies by placing them on territories you control.  <br/>Starting in the third turn players will be effected by a World Event card each turn. You can always see these cards two turns in advance of their taking place, so they will drive dynamic strategic decisions. Each development category on your mat has a high rank ability that grants you victory points. As soon as one emperor reaches three victory points, the game is over and they win! The rightful ruler of all the world!<br/><br/>Attributes<br/><br/>Reign of Man rounds move lightning-quick because you can only &quot;do one thing&quot; on your turn. Even battle resolution moves quickly. There is no money. While player elimination is possible, it is very much not common.<br/><br/>Designer Notes<br/><br/>This game is a territory control war game and definitely tips its hat to some such classics of the past, but it doesn't play like most of those games. It's a much shorter overall play time and is more approachable. Turns are fast-paced and battles are resolved in no time. You won't suffer a slow grind to attrition. You won't have to sit at the table and finish a long grind to the inevitable, wherein you feel like you've already lost and there's no coming back. Victories are rarely won by player elimination, but are a race to prominence. We wanted to preserve the best parts of those classic games in the genre and fix the problems we saw germane to their most common mechanics. We love this game and sincerely hope you will too!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pondemonium is a free print'n'play fantasy wargame for two players, where frogs and turtles fight over the control of a Pond.<br/>The game Pondemonium is based on the Eureka Miniatures &quot;Pond Wars&quot; range.<br/>This ruleset adds various components (all free to download to print'n'play) that make the game similiar to classic boardgames, the player can either use the fantastic miniatures from Eureka or the print'n'play version of them.<br/>The gameplay revolves around the turtles and frogs armies: the first must defend the pond with its better defensive ability, while the second must surround the enemies and conquer the pond with its major number of troops and its mobility.<br/>The main mechanics of this game are: action points represented as cards, movement based on how much terrain is<br/>crossed, and d6 rolling for battling.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/>Since the beginning of time, the Dark Frond Swamp has been a theater for battles between Frogs and Turtles. While Turtles live in an empire based on manpower and industrial development, Frogs are ruled by an Evil King that assures the wellness of his reign through war and conquests. For ages Turtles were forced to rise the level of their military tactics to defend the borders from the brute force of the Frog army. Battle after battle, Turtle defenses weakened, giving Frogs a great opportunity. Now the Frog King is coming, with new technological warfare machines. The next assault could create a direct passage to the Turtle land. The time is right, and unexpected: Turtles are not warned about the Frogs arrival. Will the heroic captain Cracked Shell prevail even in this desperate battle?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press Website:<br/><br/>Between 1767 and 1846, war and intrigue dominated the Indian sub-continent. War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.<br/><br/>Indian Empires is a complete game, using the same game engine as Soldier Emperor, our strategic game of the Napoleonic Wars. It can be played separately, or together with Soldier Emperor; our Dreams of Empire book includes a linking map and the rules and pieces for its use.<br/><br/>Indian Empires is a new edition of our long out-of print Soldier Raj. It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are decadently thick tiles; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are original works of art by Terry Moore Strickland. As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.<br/><br/>",

Instead, it just expanded upon core game concepts and used them for many powerful ideas. The most intreaging idea that has been a large concept was that of &quot;draw and discard a card, noting its last digit.&quot;  Because of this, an element of randomness was taken from a feature intended to help collectors.  Other than that, all that this set did was expand upon past ideas and bring more power.  Landmark Cards: Tarrasque (#1); Caer Allison (#3); The Coral Kingdom (#10); Creeping Doom (#28); Limited Wish (#43); Wish (#46); Vorpal Sword (#56); Ring of Winter (#61); Flaming Fist (#65); Ambassador Carrague (#88); Helm (#89); Cyric (#92); Time of Troubles (#99); Cold Cup of Calamity (c#2); Unusually Good Fortunes (c#11); and Bell of Might (c#18).<br/><br/>",

The scenarios all include German units from the 1st SS Panzerdivision Leibstandarte Division Normandie<br/><br/>These scenarios tend to be a mix of medium and large numbers of troops. Here is a summary of each scenario as provided by Lone Canuck Publishing:<br/><br/>     LSSAH 41 - Mouen, France, 28 June 1944: British spearheads of the 15th Scottish Division have advanced south, seizing bridges over the Orne River. The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is ordered to launch an immediately counterattack to cut-off the penetration before the British can get a foothold. Map Boards: 2, Turns: 8<br/>     LSSAH 42 - Hubert-Folie, France, 18 July 1944: The British launch Operation GOODWOOD in the hopes to break into open tank country, southeast of Caen. The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is rushed into a blocking position unseen by Allied observers and waits in ambush, directly in the path of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment.Map Boards: 2, Overlays: 3, Turns: 7<br/>     LSSAH 43 - Solders, France, 18 July 1944: Despite heavy losses, Operation GOODWOOD continued to grind its way forward, the battlefield littered with burning hulls of the British 11th Armoured Division. Shortly after midday, the 2/Fife and Forfar Yeomanry is ordered to capture the Bourg&eacute;bus Ridge; simultaneously, the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is ordered to counterattack. Map Boards: 3, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&frac12;<br/>     LSSAH 44 - Tilly-la-Campagne, France, 25 July 1944: The Americans had launched Operation COBRA, at the same the Canadians had launched Operation SPRING; its objective to capture Point 122. On route the Canadians had to first clear Tilly-la-Campagne, where hidden among the smoulder ruins were the Pioniers, Panzergrenadiers, and Panzers the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte. Map Boards: 2, Turns: 7<br/>     LSSAH 45 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 7 August 1944: The Germans launched Operation L&Uuml;TTICH, its objective to recapture Avranches and cut-off Patton's 3rd Army spilling into Brittiany. In the foggy morning hours, 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte drove into Saint Barthelemy fully expecting the village to be cleared earlier by 2.Panzerdivision; but as the fog lifted, the lead elements found themselves fighting in close quarters with GIs of the 117th Infantry Regiment. Map Boards: 4, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&frac12; <br/>     LSSAH 46 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 9 August 1944: The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte attack ground to a halt. Overhead Allied Fighter-Bombers circled waiting to pounce. The US 117th Regiment, having received reinforcements that morning, launched a counterattack looking to retake ground earlier given up. Map Boards: 4, Turns: 7&frac12;<br/>     LSSAH 47 - Joue-du-Bois, France, 13 August 1944: Field Marshal Montgomery ordered the gap  between Falaise and Alen&ccedil;on shut, hoping to trap a large portion of the German 7th Army within it. The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte received orders to hold open the narrowing corridor to allow the what was left of the 7th Army to withdraw out of the collapsing pocket. Map Boards: 4, Turns: 7&frac12;<br/>     LSSAH 48 - Saint-Lambert, France, 20 August 1944: The Allies' noose was tightening about the neck of the Falaise Pocket.

Typical gameplay is 20 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Players are private detectives on the trail of a serial killer. They&rsquo;re also sabotaging each other&rsquo;s investigations. One person has offered to help you &ndash; Dr. Xyko (aka Dr. Xyko the Psycho). He&rsquo;s a brilliant criminal psychologist but he&rsquo;s also a serial killer. He&rsquo;s in jail right now so you can consult with him. But the rumor is he want to drive all of you insane.<br/><br/>On a typical turn, the current player moves by putting down a movement card. All cards are played face down so you can lie about your card to try to go even farther.  The other players can call your bluff or can put down counter-cards. Of course, they can be bluffing, too. And the current player can call them on it.  Players can use certain cards to also see Dr. Xyko. He&rsquo;ll give you a big boost on the evidence track. But you also must take two Dr. Xyko cards. But you can&rsquo;t look at them until the end of the game.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, everyone reveals their Dr. Xyko cards. Anyone who has 3 or more Insanity icons has been driven insane by Dr. Xyko and is out of the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the player furthest along the track at the end of the game who hasn&rsquo;t been driven insane.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each tile is unique and all possible combinations of coloured corners are represented once.

There is also a custom 'action die' that comes into play once a player has generated a die.<br/><br/>DiTiC plays a bit like chess for 2-4 players.

        "description": "Mers-el-Kebir, 1940 is a solitaire game based on the Royal Navy's attack on part of the French fleet along the coast of North Africa, at Mers-el-Kebir, in 1940.  <br/>The game is among that rare lot of simulations that may be played equally well by two-players or solitaire, and if solitaire, by either side.  <br/>The game uses the Advanced Salvo! system to handle WW2 naval combat.<br/><br/>It is the summer of 1940.  <br/>France has just signed an armistice with Germany.  <br/>What will happen to the French navy?  <br/>If Germany got its hands on the fleet, it would tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean.  <br/>The French have vowed never to surrender the fleet to the Germans... but what if?  <br/>Britain cannot risk this possibility, and so sailed a fleet down to the coast demanding that the French ships sail as a British ally (in violation of the armistice), intern their ships in a neutral port, or be scuttled.  <br/>The British said they would destroy the French ships at Mers-el-Kebir if these terms were rejected.  <br/>The French rejected the terms... which brings us to the battle, late afternoon, July 3, 1940.<br/><br/>What will happen?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You decide to compete in building the chambers of their Majesty&rsquo;s perfect castle. You are driven by one goal: To become the most famous master-builder of all time.<br/><br/>Everyone is always active. This game has literally no downtime for players. In your turn, you set out to build the castle and increase your fame. You either do this certified using your limited resources or chaotically in an unplanned matter. When not on your turn, you endeavor to bring your adversaries down when they attempt the latter. Use the unique skills of your guild that have been mastered over generations. At any time, everyone is able to force a turn of events to a certain degree with the help of allies who are sprawling in the vicinity of the epic construction site.<br/><br/>A good memory and reading opponents are as helpful as a good poker face.

Additionally, it captures your bluffing behavior and responds to it.

        "description": "A group of nomadic sea travelers were forced to inhabit two islands in the cold and distant northern hemisphere centuries ago. These rugged people somehow survived the tidal apocalypse when a comet damaged the planet&rsquo;s moon, however they did not escape the wrath of the comet completely. Dust-like particles from the comet penetrated the atmosphere affecting only their small area of the arctic world. It would be decades before the true nature of this unknown infectivity would be realized.<br/><br/>On the island of Svalrland, the conditions of life were harsh. Living in a frozen tundra, in constant low light and darkness required a hardiness not known to most. But the contamination of the comet&rsquo;s dust took form in strange and haunting ways in this environment. Children were disappearing, blood stains in the snow were consistently found and inhuman sounds could be heard almost every night. Things not seen before in this world had arrived. The truth was that some of the inhabitants had transformed into what many might describe as monsters. Some became ravenous and bloodthirsty, but most had a moderate level of control over both their appearance and habits. These people became the powers of their conclaves and once each recognized that they were not alone, they formed a more cohesive ideology.<br/><br/>The other island was called Annarr and the conditions were not as harsh. There was a healthy population of animals and just enough warmth to have a limited food supply. People developed a strong bond with the animals living around them. At first it seemed innocent, like loving a family pet. However, many began experiencing a cerebral link to the beasts. All who formed a bond would experience a distinct variation of the connection. Sight, smell, sound, power and even thoughts could be found through these links. These people were seen by the collective as remarkable and they became tribal leaders, gaining influence through the relationship with the different species.<br/><br/>As the resources on both islands became exhausted, leadership decided it was time to search for new lands. They took to the seas once more and in time arrived one foggy day at the shores of Novus. There was a particularly uninhabited area of harsh cliffs and rough terrain which these wanderers took for themselves. The leadership of both islands were aware that there was a potential darkness hiding amongst them, so they decided to use their skills and knowledge of the waters to disguise their true nature and power. They found Factions controlling the city and chose to join the ranks by declaring themselves a new Faction named Waterborne.<br/>The secrets of Waterborne are real. Their powers are stranger than fiction. Can they take advantage of these powers or will the other Factions discover how much of a threat they pose and align against them? Waterborne is coming and they will explore an entirely new mechanic to bring to the field of battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player can accept the initial card draw, or push their luck by spending precious influence hoping to draw a card the empire needs more.<br/><br/>After determining the action, the player allocates funds (talents) and determines the result via random draw of a result counter. But in the case of invasion, a more elaborate sequence plays out on the Battle Board using a brand new combat resolution system.<br/><br/>Based on how well the turn went, the emperor gains or loses an unknown number of popularity points, the player keeps or loses influence points, and gains or loses an advisor.<br/><br/>Finally, players draw one of the momentous Fate cards, which can even lead to the death of the emperor.

And from the ashes of war a dreadful disease spread out, a plague which affects both men and machines: it is called the RUST.<br/><br/>In this rotten, shattered world, humanity has been decimated... and the survivors have gathered into 4 factions, to the four corners of the Earth, fighting each others for survival.<br/><br/>Among the survivors, there are some chosen ones, a few special individuals who seem to be immune to the plague and who soon become heroes for their peoples.<br/><br/>They are called: the Masters.

        "description": "There is little life in the area and every species wants to acquire as much land as possible for itself.  Add dinosaurs to create as many gangs as possible and block other species.  Toss your opponents with hot lava or vegetable treats to thwart their plans.  Get an island just for your DinoGang.  At the beginning of the game, we secretly call the dinosaur species to watch out for.  During the game we will take turns placing dominoes with similar cards, different dinosaurs as the common play area.  We obtain the cards, which we place based on a sketch.  The object of the game is to add cards in such a way that we finally sort out the largest group of our students.  The rules for adding cards are very similar to classic dominoes.  In addition to the dinusia, there are also special fields on the cards that make it easier for us to play or spoil other players &rsquo;lines.  Whoever creates the biggest dinosaur gang from their charges at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s 60 BC, and the three most powerful men in Rome form a loose alliance based on marriage, self-interest, and a thirst for power. In Triumvir, you take the role of one of these Roman power brokers as you vie for power and position that inevitably leads to Civil War.<br/><br/>Triumvir builds on Versailles 1919 where players use influence to gain control over issues and the path that history will take going forward. In Triumvir, you will use your three-dimensional influence in popularity, money, and legions to vie for the Consulship, Pontifex Maximus, and Governorships as you try to outmaneuver your erstwhile friends on the floor of the Senate. The game can be played with 1 &ndash; 3 players.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will perform one of three actions: Place influence (popularity, money, or legions) on issues that are being debated in the Senate, Recover exhausted influence, or Settle an issue. These actions are punctuated by elections, revolts in the provinces, and domestic unrest. As one of the Triumvirs, you will have to balance your tempo of activities to ensure that you are not caught short on your ability to influence how events evolve and progress.<br/><br/>Although Triumvir uses many of the basic mechanics from Versailles 1919, the design is thematically aligned to its subject. When an issue settles, your choices will alter your popularity and resources where the Consul often gets his cut. Each player has a unique personality card that asymmetrically captures your personality&rsquo;s strengths in how they gain and recover influence. These characteristics are enhanced by your growing tableau of patrons&mdash;some of whom bring additional resources.<br/><br/>Revolts are intense events where the Governor of the affected province has to re-establish Roman rule. Failure to do so carries tough popularity penalties whereas success raises your stature. If you put down a particularly epic revolt in a grand fashion you can be awarded a Triumph with extra legions, but remember&mdash;sic transit gloria. The tides of fate can often turn against you in the next election or foreign war.<br/><br/>This political danse macabre continues until the &lsquo;Crossing the Rubicon&rsquo; issue ends the Roman Republic and brings on a Civil War or one player dominates faction standing. Can you prevail against your political rivals as you try to dominate Rome? Your seat at the table awaits you in Triumvir.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1793 a great calamity hit the world. The Rent in the Sky tore apart the heavens, destroying most of Italy and flooding Europe. Only one place survived mysteriously unscathed: Venice. In the years since, the Floating City has become a beacon of hope and trade, even as the Rent gazes balefully down, putting the city into a permanent twilight. The residents have changed and adapted to a new world, a world of magic and monsters.<br/><br/>Creatures live deep in the canals, brought through the great tear in reality. These Rashaar are masked by the Church of Dagon, an openly benevolent sect whose home is in the flooded district of San Canciano, among the crumbling buildings and dirty canals.<br/><br/>But there are others in the city that suspect more is afoot. The Guild -- a shadowy organisation of thieves and murderers -- orders the citizens around. The Guild protect them from evils of the city, but the cost is their loyalty and servitude. The King of Thieves has sent a small gang into San Canciano to discover its secrets, but once they do, the Rashaar will try as hard as they can to make sure no one makes it out alive.<br/><br/>This box contains everything that two players will need to dip their toes into the foetid canals of Carnevale. Get ready to swim, row, climb, and jump your way across the city in a game that places movement at its core. Whether you're skulking the winding streets, assassinating foes from the rooftops, or drowning them under the water, Carnevale offers fully three-dimensional gameplay in a narrative skirmish game.<br/><br/>Contained within are 2 small gangs -- the Guild and the Rashaar. There is a full 48-page rulebook explaining the lore and rules of the game, as well as a campaign to play through. Everything in this set is designed to get you playing quickly: from the single-piece models, through to the push-together cardboard scenery, fold-out play mat, dice, and even quick reference cards for characters, rules, and two scenarios to help teach the basics of the game.<br/><br/><br/>     8 Resin Characters: Both the Guild and Rashaar have four characters unique to this box. From the Gondolier with her bladed oar to the tentacled mouth of the Lesser Rhyll, all are covered in beautiful detail, and are all single-piece so you can get gaming quickly.<br/>     Cardboard Scenery: Terrain is important in Carnevale, so we're providing you with loads! 3 buildings, 7 obstacles, a bridge, and even a gondola! There's also a double-sided 2'x2' fold-out paper mat to set up your game easily.<br/>     48-Page Rulebook, Dice, Range Ruler, &amp; Quick Reference Cards: This gorgeously presented book has the full rules for the game, accompanied with stunning artwork and background for all factions. With all the gaming aids you need, you&rsquo;ll be playing in no time!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These commandments make the game different every time you play, and make the players do or don&rsquo;t do various things to avoid getting penalty points.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Each player at their turn must play a card first, and then take a card from the draw pile. The main rule is: You can never play a one-digit card on another one-digit card, and a two-digit card on another two-digit card.<br/><br/>Commandments:<br/>Two commandments always govern the game: 1. Sneezing is forbidden! 2. Saying &lsquo;I&rsquo; or &lsquo;Me&rsquo; or &lsquo;Myself&rsquo; is forbidden! Eight more commandments will be added to the game randomly during the play. Commandment Cards add different rules to each game, making it very competitive and fun. So, all you need to do is to obey the commandments, or delude others into disobeying them!<br/><br/>All players must obey the in-play commandments. Failing to do so must be penalized by one Penalty Token. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The winner of the game is the player who wins two of the three wars. In history, three wars were fought, but Rome won the first and second Punic Wars, so in game terms, the Roman player is the winner at the end of the second Punic War.<br/><br/>The core of the game is resource points, which represent the ability of both Rome and Carthage to continue the war, and the mobilization of soldiers; as well as card play, which recreates strategy and tactics. The aim is not only to win the war, but also to fight for the next war.<br/><br/>",

Finally completed, the AstroTank will be required in the early twenty third century when first contact is made with an aggressive Alien species who want nothing more than to colonise as many planets as possible for their own consumption. Despite some attempt at a peaceful settlement, the Aliens will breach a preliminary agreement and construct a base on our own Moon. As one of Earth&rsquo;s non-negotiables, it will result in all-out war between the two species. The Earth&rsquo;s newly formed Astro Defence Force (ADF) will be ordered into combat for the first time.<br/><br/>Lone AstroTank is a hex and counter wargame that puts you in charge of a single AstroTank and its three Crew members as it is dropped onto different planets to assist with the removal of the Alien presence. You will need to manage the Crew to enable them to operate the AstroTank in the most effective way possible, whilst facing dangerous, aggressive and terrifying Aliens in a selection of varied and challenging Missions. Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player generally has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their AstroTank and its Crew to these Events.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is a dawn of aviation warfare, the Great War of 1914-18.You are one of the freshly pilots, just came from the flight<br/>school. Your expected lifespan on the front is 14 days. Will you be just another name on the tombstone, or will you<br/>became an Ace?<br/><br/>14 Days is a solo wargame, simplified and abstracted to the core, with low number of components, perfect for a<br/>campaign play on the run.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>- 6 white d6 dice<br/>- 1 red d6 die<br/>- 5 red wooden cubes<br/>- 4 white wooden cubes<br/>- 3 yellow wooden cubes<br/>- 2 blue wooden cubes<br/>- 2 black wooden cubes<br/>- one meeple in the shape of an airplane<br/>- one bag for the wooden cubes<br/>9 Cards:<br/>- 1 double-sided Aircraft card (Allied/German)<br/>- 1 double-sided Map card<br/>- 1 Dogfight / Events card<br/>- 1 Tables and Charts card<br/>- 5 Terrain cards with randomized DRMs on the back<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>Fly and survive all 14 missions of a campaign. Score points for every mission and check how well did you do on the European battlefield. You are encouraged to give some narrative to your achievements, so keeping a diary in a style of an airman on the front line is preferable.<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/>Basic setup is simple &ndash; shuffle all terrain cards in a face down deck. Place all wooden cubes in the bag, except white ones, and set you dice nearby. Choose the Allied or German side of the Aircraft and Map card (following the emblem on the card) and place Tables &amp; Charts and Dogfight/Events cards close by.<br/>Use the Mission log on the back of this rulebook and a pen to write down your mission results.<br/><br/>Mission types and mission end:<br/>There are three types of missions: Patrol, Reconnaissance and Bombing run.<br/>For Patrol and Bombing run you just need to finish with all encounters on the last card and return to base for mission to be successful.<br/><br/>For Reconnaissance is the same, but both you and wingman must return to be base for mission to be successful.<br/><br/>Mission can end in three ways, by returning to base on your accord before reaching the last terrain card in the column (failed mission), by getting shot down from the skies (failed mission), or in case of Reconnaissance your wingman gets shot down (failed mission), or you can finish with the last terrain card and return home (successful mission).<br/><br/>In any case, when returning to base you need to roll on the Landing table, applying all DRMs accordingly. You need 4+ to land successfully.<br/><br/>Remove any white cubes from the bag together with any other used or unused white cubes to have a new supply that will be placed back into the bag during an Aircraft prep stage.<br/><br/>Mission scoring:<br/>If mission is successful &ndash; gain number of points as stated on the Map card.<br/>-1 point if wingman has died.<br/>-1 point if your Landing was unsuccessful.<br/>1 point for each enemy plane destroyed.<br/>Points for each special target destroyed (based on the type)*<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>&bull; Reconnaissance plane = 1 point<br/>&bull; Reconnaissance balloon = 1 point<br/>&bull; Bomber = 2 points<br/>&bull; Zeppelin = 2 points<br/><br/>If mission is unsuccessful &ndash; you lose double the amount of points you would get by succeeding the mission. Example: if<br/>you would score 2 points and mission ended in a failure, you wold gain -4 points instead.<br/>Write everything down in your Mission log. If you survive the campaign, final amount of your points will give you a short summary how well you did as an airman in Great War.<br/><br/>Leveling up and Ace status:<br/>It is possible to level up through the campaign.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

To get rid of these fanged fiends faster than the neighboring villages, use your residents' special abilities and your powerful secret weapon: a silver fang.<br/><br/>Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...<br/><br/>Silver Fang is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.<br/><br/>Silver Fang can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by B&eacute;zier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.<br/><br/>Silver Fang is unique because it includes team rules and cards that while they work for individual player games, can be leveraged for team play. The Silver Fang token creates a personal discard pile that can only be accessed by the Fang owner, providing a place for them and their teammate to play cards that only the Fang owner can choose from.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Here an atmospheric description:<br/><br/>The overlooked, unsuccessful and completely-forgotten-by-the-underworld Doctor F, nephew of a certain Frankenstein, has fruitlessly tried his entire life to follow in the footsteps of his famous uncle. Lonesome and bitter, he writes his last will and testament out one stormy night. He demands from his inheritors that they solve the task that he himself couldn&rsquo;t: the creation of an artificial human being, often labeled a monster by more ignorant folk. Only he who solves this puzzle will be considered worthy of being awarded the enormous castle and the lands surrounding it. To assist them in their quest, each potential inheritor gets a corpse, a laboratory and the help of Igor.<br/><br/>Setting up the laboratory, finding organs, waking up the monster &ndash; it&rsquo;s as easy as that. You only need to keep a hairsbreadth in front of the competition. Whoever wants to be the inheritor of Doctor F needs skill with trading and auctioning, a little luck with digging, bad weather, and naturally a brain &ndash; even better would be two or three.<br/><br/>The players try &ndash; with the help of Igor &ndash; to find the necessary vital organs as quickly as possible in the graveyard. But a lightning rod and a big switch are required. <br/>And naturally tons and tons of green goo. The most important part is the brain, though. There&rsquo;s quite a selection: Beethoven, Newton, Marx or maybe Jack the Ripper? <br/>For protection, you can always hang a couple of shrunken heads and a stuffed crocodile in your lab. But what&rsquo;s the use of all that if the weather&rsquo;s sunny and devoid of lightning? <br/>Then only James Watt&rsquo;s mysterious atmospheric steam machine will help.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&mdash;you may see that road darken&hellip; and then darken again.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.<br/><br/>Even after they recover Celebrimbor's ring mould, your heroes must continue along their quest, for they have many miles to travel before they can return the mould to Saruman in Orthanc. However, their journey is interrupted in The Antlered Crown when they come upon the battles between warring clans of Dunlendings. In order to successfully complete their task, then, your heroes must battle through waves of hostile Dunland enemies before they can establish a lasting alliance with the Dunlendings who swear their loyalty to Chief Turch.<br/><br/>As the conclusion of The Ring-maker cycle, The Antlered Crown focused heavily on the cycle's Time X keyword, using it to trigger a number of effects, including the reveal of enemy cards from the Raven deck that you create at the beginning of the scenario. The Antlered Crown Nightmare Deck reinforces this focus on the Time X keyword and the Raven deck, so that both of the scenario's signature elements are more challenging and impactful than ever.<br/><br/>",

By creating large Rooms of the same type, players will increase their chances to find clues about the Artifact position. Placing or not, particular game Rooms, from Library to Trap Rooms, or Treasure, Healing, Monster Rooms, will determine their chance of survival.<br/>Activating the Tombs Rooms, players will be able to fight mighty Bosses and find Clues. Combining Clues, they will discover the Artefact position, and if they will able to take it and escape from the Temple in time, they will win.<br/>Escape? Not so easy! After entering the Temple, the Entrance collapsed. So players must find a secondary exit. Different in each game, an ancient Map will reveal the path they have to take to find it. <br/>The game can last up to 14 rounds. In every round, the opponents will be stronger and more challenging to win.<br/><br/>You can play the game also in PvP mode. In this case, one or more hidden players will try secretly to win alone, distract the rest of the party on a false path, and grab the Artifact. This kind of game adds a lot of RPG aspects to the game.<br/><br/>Each Hero has their powers and abilities and can improve them during the game, gaining experience points, choosing how: by this way, each Hero is different in every game. Magic Items, potions, weapons will improve and differentiate each character more.<br/><br/>The Lost Artifact is one of the 100 different Adventures of the game! Each Adventure is playable multiple times by players, and each play will always be different!<br/><br/>Are you ready for the challenge?<br/><br/>&ldquo;This game is my tribute to my wonderful Dungeons and Dragons game sessions.

The game covers warships produced in the pre-dreadnought (1890-1906), dreadnought (1906-1919), and World War II (1920-1945) eras, providing gamers the chance to replay a virtually unlimited number of historical or hypothetical scenarios occurring during the six decade &quot;golden age&quot; of the battleship.<br/>    What's Included:  Over ONE THOUSAND individually rated warships (light cruiser size and larger) from over twenty of the world's navies, from the three eras represented in the game, on twenty-two counter sheets; 150 generic destroyer and merchant ship counters; 56-page comprehensive rulebook containing standard instructions applicable to each major period, plus separate chapters with &quot;era specific&quot; rules, Ship Rating Index, designer's notes, over thirty scenarios; scenario guidelines folder; over 300 color game markers and playing gauges; and three Reference Cards.  This is a full, complete game... nothing else is  needed to recreate surface combat over the entire period!<br/>   Battleship Captain is a &quot;miniatures&quot; game system with scenarios played on the tabletop or floor, using the rules and ship counters provided.  (You may freely substitute metal miniatures if you wish.)   The game emphasized playability, as players maneuver their ships and try to defeat the enemy.  The counters (measuring 2.5&quot; x 5/8ths inch) are printed in black ink on different colored cardstock, and need to be mounted and separated prior to play.  Game scale is seven turns per hour, and 1000 yards per inch.  Ships are rated, right on their counter, in the following categories:  name, nationality, ship type, year, flotation, stern-broadside-bow fire ratings, movement, armor, and nine &quot;special characteristics&quot; ratings, plus an overhead scale view of the ship's deck.<br/><br/>",

The sudden onslaught stunned the Poles, who offered little resistance to the Germans' panzer divisions. The invaders quickly penetrated into the into the interior, reaching Warsaw in just over a week. The rapidity of the German troops advance was in large part due to support from the Luftwaffe. Under attack by both air and armor, the Polish army and air force slowly collapsed. On September 17th, 1939, the USSR attacked Poland, shattering the country's morale.

        "description": "GAME OVERVIEW<br/><br/>DeepWars is a 28mm scale tabletop wargame set in an alternate history of Earth in the late 17th century, where fortune seekers and conquerors have discovered a lost land with an underground sea miles beneath the frozen surface of the southernmost continent.<br/><br/>DeepWars is set in the world of ShadowSea, but is meant to be a stand-alone product and is focused on adventure and battle scenarios on the bottom of the Sunless Sea. The game will have multiple types of scenarios, including exploration of wrecks on the seafloor, adventures in ancient cities of cyclopean structures, battles among fields of geothermal chimneys, submarine boardings among others. Adventures within flooded tunnels inside wrecked ships or crumbing cities may be played with &ldquo;tiles&rdquo; to represent stretches of passage and chambers, while games in open environments are played with scenic terrain pieces on the tabletop.<br/><br/>OPPOSING FORCES<br/><br/>This shadowy sea holds powerful artifacts from a long disappeared civilization, and the Fortune Hunters' have staked their claim to these treasures, modifying some of the technology they have already recovered to design advanced diving suits and weapons for underwater defense. They are not alone in their quest though, as other forces compete for the same artifacts.<br/><br/>The enigmatic 'Dark Mariners', remnants of the noble lost civilization, have completely devolved, mixing their bloodline with the foulest of undersea life and twisted ether technology to create vicious biomechanical creatures. These forces cruise the depths, carried within monstrous vessels that resemble gigantic sea creatures, gathering artifacts to help them prepare for an assault on the surface lands.<br/><br/>The 'Ancients of Atal&aacute;n' are the most advanced of all of the forces, for they are the last of the pure relatives of the lost civilization of the Ancients of the Shadow Sea. They are a small group, with a hidden undersea city many leagues away to the North, and have traveled under the ice to recover the technology of their lost kin follow them into the dimensional void.<br/><br/>Other forces will be included in the game, but the three main forces will be the focus of this Kickstarter project and will be the first ones to get miniatures.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/><br/>     Intense combat in the abyssal depths of the Sea. Breach submarines, uncover undersea temples, and dodge torpedoes while recovering artifacts that hold the secrets of the ethereal void.<br/>     Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. Players may customize their warband with different weapons and ether technology items as they become more experienced in battle.<br/>     Miniature starter sets for each of three main forces, Fortune Hunters, Dark Mariners, and Ancients of Atal&aacute;n will be produced. Sets will include five miniatures with stat cards and quickstart rules. Other forces are included in the rules and will be made into miniatures as funds permit.<br/>     Rulebooks will be available printed in full color or as downloadable PDFs, and will include multiple game scenarios and a painting guide. There will be a softcover version of the printed book, meant for retail store sale, and a hardcover version with some additional content for direct sale. If project goals are exceeded, we will produce additional miniatures, terrain and supplements and continue growing the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This third expansion to the popular Table Battles series focuses its attention on a single day: 2 July 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Famous engagements from throughout the attack each get their own scenario - Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill - while a final scenario zooms out for a &quot;big picture&quot; view of the whole thing. These battles were hard-fought, stubborn, and bloody affairs, often without any decisive result, ending only when both sides were too exhausted to fight any further. That's reflected here, and so it's significantly harder to get a decisive result, and you're more likely to see epic slugfests in which you win only because the other side collapsed an eye-blink sooner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to trade with the loot achieved in your adventures. You must use object cards, action, along with your character's ability to be the one who gets the most gold coins (represented on the object cards) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>During each round, players draw 2 cards and can play any number of Object cards, but only one of Action cards, if an Event card is drawn at the time of drawing cards, it is resolved immediately.<br/><br/>The object cards have different values of gold coins, but it is necessary to discard some of these during the game in order to make moves that grant more Object cards, hence more gold coins. So you should save some of these to score at the end of the game. The Action cards modify the dynamics of the player who plays them in favor of him. Event cards must be played before the start of the turn, they never remain in the player's hand, they modify the game of all the players involved. The players also have a character card with a respective ability in favor of these, In addition there is a card from The Market has Closed that is put into play after the third round and being stolen ends the game, then the points represented in gold coins that each player has in his hand.<br/><br/>",

Take command of the famous Templar and Hospitaller Knights, the loyal Ghulams and fierce Turcoman Horsemen, the agile Nubian Archers or the notorious Varangian Guardsmen of Byzantium. Fight on the high seas for the Oriental trade with Venetian Galletas, Byzantine Dromons or Egyptian Dhaus. Supply your castles, lay or break sieges or find traitors in the walls. Subjugate the infamous Assassins, convince the Pope or Khalif to support your cause, or bribe greedy tribes to raid your enemies.<br/><br/>Saladin is a game for 2 to 5 players - but best played with 5 - roughly recreating the course of events in the Holy Land and its neighboring areas between the death of the great Zangid ruler Nur-al-Din in 1174 heralding Saladin&rsquo;s further rise to power and the battle of Hattin in 1187, which resulted in the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin. Even though prompting the popular 3rd Crusade (1190) - with such prominent figures as the English King Richard I &laquo;The Lionheart&raquo;, the French King Phillip II &laquo;Auguste&raquo; and the German Emperor Friedrich I &laquo;Barbarossa&raquo; taking the stage - the preceding events culminating in the Crusader&rsquo;s loss of Jerusalem were arguably the effective begin of the final decline of the Crusader States.<br/><br/>The graphic design is by Jordi Roca and almost all the artwork by Esteve Polls.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lexicons of Dueling is fast to learn, fast to play, and has hundreds of possible variations to the outcome of a battle! The cards are very easy to understand. The tactics are not just in the cards, it involves you learning your opponent&rsquo;s style, the way they are thinking, and trying to figure out their next move! While they do the same to you! Each card has defense/attack/body positioning and weapon flow represented in such a way that you could even imagine the actions you are performing as you play.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>     NOT a collectible card game. There are no perfect combos other than the ones your opponent didn't block. There are no super rare cards that will imbalance the game to those who can afford them. Every player has an equal chance to win, if they keep their wits about them, or get the opponent to lose theirs.<br/>     Status cards that can increase your chance of victory, but not to the degree that a peasant cannot still best a king, if he plays his cards right. Anybody can win against anybody.<br/>     Simple! Addition and subtraction rules; no tokens, no paper, no life counter, no phases, no arguing rules. The deck is all you need to play..... and an opponent. That will help a lot. You can practice with a single deck random solitaire if you want, but it is much more challenging with a thinking opponent.<br/>     Tournament Play. They all have them, but not all of them will have the flavor of ours. You fight to gain status, from peasant, squire to knight, and so on. As you win you can fight well in higher status tournaments, and one day, maybe fight for the title of King! There are several characters that you can collect during the tournaments, and each of them can become royalty if you succeed!<br/><br/><br/>As a fighter learns he gets better, as they win they gain status in the society they live in. Each status upgrade gives the player an extra skill to survive battles at higher ranks. They can always fight higher ranks than they are, but they can expect to have more of a challenge. They can fight lesser ranks, but they will receive a lesser reward for fighting below their station. The skills fit the rank: a Squire learns to move quickly so gains a dodge. A Knight learns the use of armor for a time, etc. Status cards represent goals and bragging rights you can prove you earned, and skills learned from battle.<br/><br/>This game includes the following expansions; <br/>- French Rapier<br/>- Two handed Scottish Claymore<br/>- (Introducing) Japanese Katana<br/><br/>",

Loses the one who has the cards on hand.<br/><br/>Game Setup: Shuffle your deck thoroughly and deal three face-down cards in a row to each player. Then deal the same number of cards face up to cover each card that is laying face-down. Now you have six cards before each player: three face-down and three face-up covering them.<br/><br/>You shouldn&rsquo;t pick that cards up until you shed all the cards from your hand.<br/><br/>Deal each player three cards one more time, that will be player's hands. Place the deck of cards on the table within reach of every player.<br/><br/>Gameplay: the starting player is the one who attended a party recently, closer to the day of the game then other players. Then players are taking turns clockwise. The player lays any card on the table (to start a pick up pile) and then draws card from the deck so they have at least three cards in their hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or they already have three or more cards in their hand). The next player must lay a card equal to or higher in value than the one at the top of the pick up pile. For example: the first player lays 5, the next player can lay 5, or 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. On top of 10 player can lay 10 or 0 (the Poop) or any of the special cards. If a player has no card to cover the the previous card, they must pick up the pick-up pile (put it in their hand) and end their turn, and the next player starts a new round with any card.<br/><br/>A player can lay some cards of the same value in one turn. If a player is able to complete a set in turn (like four-of-a-kind 8*8*8*8) they can do so clearing (burning) and removing the entire pile from play. The player who clears may play another card after.<br/>Special cards (could be placed over any other card):<br/><br/>MegaPug - when played, clears the pick up pile instantly. The player who plays it starts the next round with any card, game is played to increase (the next card may have same or higher value)<br/><br/>BreakDancer - changes the rules from increase to decrease (so the next card may have same or lower value). When played the second time, rules changes back from decrease to increase, and so on.<br/><br/>Poop (0) - resets the game. The next player can lay a card of any value from 0 to 10, game is played to increase.<br/><br/>Game Ending: when the deck runs out, you must play all cards from your hand. When there&rsquo;s no cards in your hand, you have to play those cards that are laying the face-up in front of you, one by one. Then you play your &ldquo;Blind&rdquo; cards, that are laying face-down, one by one - no peeking!<br/>If you have no suitable card - take the pick-up pile in your hand and only when you shed them all you can return to play your cards on the table.<br/><br/>When you have discarded all your cards - congratulations! You banished all your Pug-party animals! So you can chill out watching yours less lucky playmates.<br/><br/>The Pug Party is an entertaining game designed for players from 6 years old. Duration: 10-30 minutes. Simple rules, a dynamic game process, illustrations of a talented artist of Ukraine &ndash; this is the formula for the success of the game Pug Party. The first edition of the game was sold out for six months. Because everyone loves funny parties and everyone loves pugs: children, youth and adults are just delighted with these funny little animals. We take an incendiary party, add cute pugs, and get the most explosive and cutest Ukrainian game!<br/><br/>",

Better yet, the rules allow alternative Iraqi strategies that may have theoretically disrupted the Coalition invasion, but similarly allows for alternative Coalition strategies..which includes the possibility of a Coalition advance to Baghdad to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Highly researched and accurate, this game is a complete presentation of the Persian Gulf War on the land, in the air, and sea.<br/><br/>The victory conditions are to achieve a military, political, and diplomatic victory, which is recorded on a map track called the Event Track. Players accomplish this by capturing and/or bombing map objectives, defeating enemy forces, and the skillful play of various event cards throughout the game. The Coalition player can either attempt the historic victory, or even attempt to drive straight to Baghdad and win that way, but fraught with all the difficulties of a longer war.<br/><br/>Game play information:<br/>A two-player game<br/>Easy to learn rules<br/>2 to 4 hours to play<br/>Moderately solitaire<br/>Division scale units<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In just a few years, the world will be plunged into turmoil. Countries around the world will panic, widespread chaos will ensue, and civilized society will change virtually overnight as citizens cope with the loss of a modern-day vital resource. A resource needed for commerce. A resource needed for communication. A resource needed for life-sustaining technology. A resource needed for even simple comfort. The resource&hellip; is energy.<br/><br/>But that time is not here yet! Thankfully, you and a handful of other enterprising individuals have seen the writing on the wall, and you know it is up to you to save the world from the upcoming energy crisis! Of course, the recent United Nations Contract request for a global energy provider worth BILLIONS of dollars doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either&hellip;<br/><br/>Compete with other players to win the contract and ensure that your company will become the #1 global energy power for decades to come! Obtain government industry permits by using energy credits allotted by the United Nations Council for aligning yourself to their objectives. Industries you own constantly increase the energy credits you are allotted, but they also increase the terawatt-hours (energy) generated by your company! And it is ultimately out-performing your opponents in this area and hitting the optimal level of terawatt-hours that will win you the U.N. contract, and win you the game!<br/><br/><br/>Each player must make optimum use of their resources and the available hexagonal areas on the board to not only achieve a victory with generating enough terawatt-hours (TWh), but must also generate more TWh than their fellow players. In every round of play, each player will take a single turn. During this turn, you will draw a card, be &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in energy credits, allowed to roll the territory die, and either permit industries or take an investment beforehand. If you ever wish to end your turn early, you may draw another grid card. This will end your turn without taking further action. Your choices in actions determine your odds of victory here!<br/><br/>When drawing a grid card, keep it secret, as it can be your secret weapon against your fellow players! Place them face-down in front of you to play later, or play them immediately.<br/><br/>Because you get paid every turn, try to maximize your energy credit return early on in the game so that you can permit multiple, higher TWh industries quicker by amassing enough energy credits. Of course, as you&rsquo;ll see when you play the game, this plan can be easier said than done!<br/><br/>For an added twist, each player has a unique and special ability with which they can use during the course of the game.

The first western tournament was in August 2006 at the Mindsports Olympiad (MSO) in London, England. It was won by Aidos Seitzhanov from Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Toğızqumalaq is played board made of two rows of nine holes, plus two kazans (&quot;boilers&quot;), either in the middle of the board or one at each end of it. The players own the kazan at their right, if at the ends, or the one on the other half of their board, if in the middle. <br/>As captures are made by pairs, the holes are usually made in a way so it is evident whether the contents are odd or even. <br/>To begin the game, there must be nine balls per hole, except the kazans, which are empty. That is, 162 balls are needed.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player takes all the balls of a hole on his side of the board, and distribute them anticlockwise, one per hole, on the following holes, starting from the very same hole he has taken them. If the movement is done from a hole containing just a single ball, it is moved to the next hole, leaving the starting hole empty.<br/><br/>If the last ball falls into a hole on the opponent's side&hellip;<br/><br/>     &hellip;and this hole afterward contains an even number of balls, these are captured and stored on the player's kazan.<br/>     &hellip;and this hole afterward contains precisely three balls, the hole becomes your тұздық, tuzdyq (or түз үй according to Maksat Shotayev, t&uuml;z &uuml;y, i.e. &quot;sacred place&quot; in Kazakh; or tuz in Kyrgyz which means &quot;salt&quot;), and it is marked as such. ** Each player can only make one tuzdyq in a game. <br/>         A tuzdyq cannot be made on the opponent's last hole (ninth, the one on his right). <br/>         A tuzdyq cannot be made if it is symmetrical to the opponent's one (if the opponent has his tuzdyq in our first hole, we can not make ours on his first hole). <br/>         In the cases a tuzdyq cannot be done, we can finish a movement there, but the hole simply does not become a tuzdyq. <br/>         A movement cannot begin from a tuzdyq. <br/>         The balls that fall into a tuzdyq are captured by its owner. If it is overcharged, we can take the balls and store them in the kazan. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot move on his turn, because all the holes on his side (except a possible tuzdyq) are empty. <br/>When the game is over, the player who still has balls on his side (except in a possible tuzdyq) gets them and adds them to his kazan. <br/>Both players add the contents of their tuzdyq (the one on their opponent's side) to their kazan.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with more balls in his kazan at the end of the game. If both players have captured 81 balls, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "District Commander: Kandahar simulates the problems facing insurgent and counterinsurgent commanders in southern Afghanistan circa 2009-2010. This is not Brian Train's first or even second game about this conflict, and you might be wondering, what does this one have to offer? We think that the District Commander system - with its emphasis on bluff and deception, scarce resources and shifting operational goals - is an especially good fit for capturing the pace and nature of operations in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.<br/><br/>Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.<br/><br/>All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rainbow Wars is the first expansion for the card game Schnapp die M&ouml;pse and consists of 54 Game Cards of which 39 are beautifully illustrated.<br/><br/>This expansion you not only get well known action cards but a lot of new aggressor and defense cards along with new &quot;No&quot;-Cards, which help to save your hand against attackers.<br/>You get new &quot;addional cards&quot; which help to play two cards oder make a normal card impenetrable against deactivation.<br/><br/>Really helpful is a new reaction card which allows you to tell a player to play a no-card for you.<br/><br/>In Rainbow Wars we get a common enemy in form of a rainbow cat which is able to steal the unicorm pugs. Distract it with laser pointers or defeat it with the unicorn pug.<br/><br/>Play with up to 7 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Rainbow Wars ist die erste Erweiterung f&uuml;r das Kartenspiel Schnapp die M&ouml;pse und besteht aus 54 Spielkarten, wovon 39 Spielkarten mit sch&ouml;nen neuen Illustrationen ausgeschm&uuml;ckt wurden.<br/><br/>Die Erweiterung zum Grund-Kartenspiel bietet neben einigen wenigen bekannten, eine Menge toller neuer Aktionskarten, mit denen man noch mehr Angriffs-, sowie Verteidigungsm&ouml;glichkeiten erh&auml;lt.<br/>Neben einer neuen &quot;Nein-Karte&quot;, gibt es auch diverse Zusatzkarten mit denen man unter anderem gleich 2 Aktionskarten spielen darf, einen Mops mit einem weiteren Mopspunkt ausstatten oder sogar eine Aktionskarte durchboxen kann, damit sie gar nicht erst mit einer Nein-Karte aufgehoben werden darf.<br/><br/>Sehr hilfreich ist eine neue Reaktionskarte mit der man einen beliebigen M&ouml;psemopser dazu zwingen kann eine Nein-Karte zu spielen. Nat&uuml;rlich geht dies nur, wenn er eine zum Ausspielen besitzt.<br/><br/>In Rainbow Wars kommt ein gemeinsamer Gegner ins Spiel: Die Regenbogen Katze. Lenke sie mit Laserpointern ab oder besiege sie mit dem Einhornmops.<br/><br/>Nun kann auch mit bis zu 7 Spielern gespielt werden.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Union desperately fights to stop Robert E Lee in this tense board game on the pivotal battle of the Civil War at Gettysburg.<br/><br/>Patterned and modeled on Kriegsspiel, this game is unprecedented in accuracy and realism in its portrayal of command.<br/><br/>Units realistically sprawl out in road column, resulting in delays, snaking and traffic snarls.  Baggage Trains add to the traffic and congestion problems. They have to be protected but also need to be kept close to the action to properly supply the troops.  Realistic, chaotic move sequence. Your troops don&rsquo;t move when you want them to. You don&rsquo;t know when exactly when your troops or the enemy will move. As the commander, you can only try to speed them up or slow them down. If that fails, you have to react quickly with contingency planning.  Realistic Fog of War: blocks hide exact unit strength and type. You can also hide your reserves off board. This forces players to realistically screen and probe. You can never be certain as to how close you are to breaking the enemy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game will include six civilizations, which will slightly tweaked from their digital versions. Game play requires the capture of fertile land or minerals to fund your expansion and building program. There are 7 different building types in the game each helps you to expand in different ways, however there are a limited number of each building in the game so choosing when and where to build is critical. Each player is randomly allocated one of the 6 civilizations to play and each civilizations has a different selection of buildings available to them and at differing costs. Each civilization will require a different strategy to be successful. The game also includes tiles for different terrain types so each game can be played on new map, sometimes minerals are plentiful, at other times all you see is endless desert.<br/><br/>The computer game is a tile strategy game of area control set in ancient Mesopotamia. Controlling one of twelve historically accurate civilizations of the era &ndash; Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites, Ebla, Egyptians, Gutians, Hittites, Kassites, Mitanni, Nomads or Sumerians &ndash; players attempt to dominate the game board by creating farms, towns, embassies, ziggurats, and even armies. Each civilization has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the game has no luck elements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>In the early morning darkness of 6 June 1944, the largest armada of ships the world has ever seen heaves to off the Normandy coastline. Aboard, thousands of Allied soldiers wait in readiness for their date with destiny. Months of planning, training and preparation are now behind them. On this day they will undertake the greatest amphibious assault in history, and on their success or failure hangs the very fate of the liberation of Europe from the jackboot of Nazi domination. D-Day is finally here! Normandy Battles contains the best scenarios from the original D‑Day series of books, as well as the Battlefront Studio's favourite web scenarios, and updates them for the third edition of Flames Of War, and the two D‑Day compilations: Turning Tide and Earth &amp; Steel. Normandy Battles also includes rules for airborne landings and amphibious assaults, allowing your forces to wage war from the land, sea and sky. The revised Total War rules put a new twist on larger games, giving your battalions additional abilities, and allowing you to field entire support companies. Inside You Will Find: History of the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the subsequent battles to liberate France. Airborne assault mission and rules. Amphibious assault mission and rules. 13 of the best Flames of War scenarios covering the Normandy Campaign. Total War rules allowing you to put bigger forces on larger tables, with two Total War missions.<br/><br/>",

The division would eventually be dismounted and sent to the Pacific without its horses, but in the war's early days some of the cavalry generals hoped that their horsemen might ride into action.<br/><br/>An Army at Dawn covers the battles of the other two First Divisions - the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division. The 1st Cavalry Division did not accompany them to North Africa; the U.S. Army had prepared itself to provide fuel and maintenance for thousands of vehicles, but not the fodder and care for large numbers of horses.<br/><br/>We're not limited by that harsh reality; in Horse Soldiers the American cavalry rides one more time. Horse Soldiers includes two dozen new, laser-cut playing pieces showing the 1st Cavalry Division troopers in their own special livery, plus a couple of scenarios for their use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;This ruleset, Sword &amp; Spear Fantasy, is based on the Sword &amp; Spear ancient and medieval wargames rules which are designed for playing out large battles of the period from about 3000BC to 1500AD.  They are an evolution of that ruleset, with rules added to cover all of the required fantasy elements, but at its heart it is the same core mechanisms.<br/><br/>My intention was to make this mainly a game about units of infantry and cavalry (of whatever size and race and type) manoeuvring and  fighting on the battlefield. All of the extra features such as magic, heroes, monsters, flying creatures and other exotic troop types add extra  flavour and interest, and can impact the battle, but should not dominate it.<br/><br/>My aim with magic (matching the overall philosophy of the rules) was for the outcome to matter, but not the detail. So there are no long lists of named spells to choose from. Instead, just a few main effects are catered for (which on the whole are the same effects that would be covered by a list of lots of different spells) &ndash; increasing the effectiveness of friendly units, attacking the enemy and healing or rallying friendly units.&quot;<br/><br/>Excerpt from the Appendix<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a deity; a god&mdash;one among many, perhaps&mdash;looking down upon the earth, upon this curious species called humans, and upon their still more curious behaviors. They&rsquo;re very proud of themselves and their advancements, these humans, and they take themselves very seriously, what with their empire-building and their silly and relentless wars with one another. They have no clue how tiny they seem to you, like clever insects&mdash;how thousands of years of their civilization pass for you in a matter of minutes, and how completely subject they are to your whims.  But, like them, you&rsquo;re proud, too, ye god, and you do so very much delight when these humans notice you and praise you and create all these wonderful and diverse religions about you. And your very favorite thing of all is when they marshall their greatest talents, and the earth&rsquo;s most precious resources, and they build monuments to you and all your glory. After all, where would they be at all if not for your influence and magnanimity?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score as many points as possible, at the end of five progressive game ages (game phases) by influencing human activities (arranging card tableaus) and encouraging the construction of monuments (collecting suited sets).<br/><br/>The five nations of the game evolve through progressive game ages and through individual technology levels (tech levels). Different ages and tech levels dictate different circumstances and game rules. The five tech levels loosely correspond to the five game ages, but it is important to remember that the tech level of any individual nation might not be the same as the current game age (one or more nations can be &ldquo;behind the times&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Any time a nation&rsquo;s individual tech level advances beyond the current game age, it will cause the game age to advance by one increment. Depending on other circumstances, other nations may or may not advance their own tech levels at the same time. When any nation advances beyond the steel age (V) and into the atomic age (the sixth, unmarked age card), the game ends, and you proceed to scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players are given plenty of vocabulary, then use their creativity to connect them to one another to create new words or phrases. However, they should always be aware of what other players are thinking, trying to get the same answers as them to win the game. This may sound easy, but Ideastorm is not really that simple!<br/><br/>To play the game, players use the three words writen on each of the two cards in the middle pile to figure out a different word or phrase, then write it down on their own whiteboard. If any player writes the same answer as another, both of them score points. The two cards with words change every turn, so the playing experience is full of surprises and never repeats. Once a player has 25 points or more, the game is over. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

With the Campaign Chapter included, your heroes will be able to infiltrate the dwarf mines, at the borders of the Kingdom of Istarra, and get precious artifacts. But be careful, the expedition will not be easy, and our heroes risk losing some blood there.<br/><br/>The dwarves are a hard-working, meticulous and greedy people. They never stop digging galleries to exploit as many deposits as possible, to trade what they extract from them or to create the best crafts in the world. It is in one of these mines, northeast of the border of the kingdom, called the Royal Mine of Skatten, that legends tell a powerful weapon is hidden.<br/><br/>The mines are heavily guarded. Patrols circulate regularly, because dwarves can never be careful enough. The alert level can rise very quickly, and the mission can fail at the slightest mistake. The mines are real labyrinths where it is easy to get lost. The access is forbidden to slowpokes and it will be important to be like the dwarves: methodical and effective.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And although half of the successes (rounded up) are considered, there's is still a fair chance that she will leave a fight barely wounded. Not to mention that choosing the right Upgrades may grant her even more defense dice.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, Sherry is not insane (ahm... not clinically insane at least). She is brave, strong, and impulsive. Which makes her throw herself into a fight without measuring the consequences, taking the opponent by surprise but also giving her a few battle scars.

They remember only dim echoes of their past, fragments of the person they were, and half-faded memories of the events that led to their current predicament. This is enough to keep them in a state of perpetual torment, which pleases cruel Nagash. On occasion the Great Necromancer will assemble smaller groups of Nighthaunts in order to achieve a particularly delicate task. Their incorporeal nature and resistance to most physical damage makes the gheists particularly suited to such missions.<br/><br/>Want to play Warcry with a Nighthaunt warband? This is the perfect place to start! This specially-designed warband set contains a variety of Nighthaunt fighters, giving you a versatile and diverse warband out of the box. Fighter cards for every kind of Nighthaunt warrior make expanding your warband simple, while the Abilities card lets you master the sinister powers of the Nighthaunt.<br/><br/>This set contains 13 Citadel Miniatures, including 4 Myrnmourn Banshees, 4 Glaivewraith Stalkers and 5 Grimghast Reapers (with the option to build one as an Extoller of Shyish). It also includes an ability card that provides reference imagery for your fighters and powers they can use on the battlefield, fighter cards for 7 different types of fighter, including the Dreadwarden, Grimghast Reaper, Chainrasp, Spirit Host, Glaivewraith Stalker, Extoller of Shyish and the Myrmourn Banshee.

This powerful Cryo technology allows the Architects to enter a state of suspended animation for vast periods of time while traveling the solar system in search of new tech, loyal operatives, and answers to the problems devastating the system.<br/>Against the backdrop of a slowly dying sun, a series of events known as the Helionox, Influence is the path to victory and can be gained in many ways. Starting deck builds can be customized at the beginning of the game and used with unique Architects for a vast array of combinations and asymmetric game play offering massive replayability. Travel the solar system placing a multitude of buildings types for strategic infrastructure.

MAGNA ACIES! is therefore designed to remain simple and to immediately put you players in a position to really lead an army of the Antiquity, making you relive the situations that in those days could make the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>You impersonate the commander of the army, who gives orders to the various corps from which the army is constituted: at the beginning of the battle, assign orders to your large units deployed in the field, depending on whether your plan provides that each of them must attack the enemy, or maneuver to reach a more favorable position, or even stand still waiting for the opposing charge or the development of events. Units that receive orders must act accordingly, until they clash with the enemy or until you deem it necessary to change the order for any reason.<br/><br/>In short, you are reproposed for the problems that the leader had to face on the ground and only those; this perspective (which can be defined as &quot;great - tactical&quot;) involves simplifying (or automatically managing) certain aspects of detail that are not considered here as they are supposedly left to the initiative of subordinate officers, but allows you to play great battles in limited spaces and in a short time.<br/><br/>MAGNA ACIES! can simulate the battles of Antiquity until the advent of firearms; it was designed with classic age clashes in particular in thought, but works well as long as squares of men and horses predominantly confronted with close combat weapons.<br/><br/>I thought &quot;MAGNA ACIES!&quot; to be practical, fast and playable: in 15mm you can play even on tables less than one meter, the rules are round 25 pages including examples, illustrations and various chatter, the game tables and the &quot;army lists&quot; are included in a single A4 sheet, a 150 point game - army on each side can last an average of a couple of hours , once you learned the rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Born in Siberia, Piotr Rasputin is a mutant with a skin of steel and a heart of gold. He can transform his entire body into organic metal, granting him superhuman strength, durability, and stamina. Colossus is a gentle giant, however. He is sometimes reluctant to use his physical strength in combat, feeling a responsibility to use his powers to improve the lives of mutants and humankind.<br/><br/>Illyana Rasputin is the younger sister of Colossus. Abducted at a young age by Belasco, the sorcerer and master of the realm known as The Otherplace, Illyana trained in the art of magic and overthrew her captor to become Magik, the Sorceress Supreme of Otherplace! Her mutant ability to teleport herself and others through space and time by using stepping discs, pieces of Limbo that act as a midway point between locations and points in time, allows her to be anywhere and anywhen her mystic power is needed.<br/><br/>This pack gives players the chance to round out their X-Men teams with these powerful characters, beginning with beautifully-detailed, dynamic Colossus and Magik miniatures for them to paint and customize. Already featuring a combination of powerful mutant and mystical abilities, players can unlock even more power from this pair with three Team Tactic cards that allow them to tap into the power of Limbo or throw Wolverine with the famous Fastball Special.<br/><br/>",

His experiences with the Force Dynamic &ndash; the arcano-electric force he believes animates all things &ndash; led to his self-imposed exile from Shyish, where his brand of necromancy is taboo. In Harrowdeep, Deintalos found an ideal place to hide his grisly experiments, aided by his mortal apprentice in necromancy, Marcov. Deintalos animates recovered cadavers with arcane machinery and the Force Dynamic. These Arcwalkers, as Deintalos dubs them, act in eerie unison to tear apart their foes. With their mindless assistance, Deintalos means to dissect every secret of the abyssal labyrinth in which he dwells.<br/><br/>The Exiled Dead are aggressive, but flexible enough to keep your opponents on their toes and play for objectives. Once you get your shambling fighters into a good position, they&rsquo;ll be tough to tackle. To this end, Deintalos has an ability that will keep them all moving, activating multiple Arcwalkers at once. This box includes a complete Rivals deck, plus loads of extra cards allowing you to try out a few tricks, as well as universal cards and Grand Alliance cards to use with your other warbands.<br/><br/>This set contains:<br/><br/>- 7x push-fit Exiled Dead miniatures &ndash; no glue required to assemble, cast in a cadaverous grey to stand out even when unpainted<br/>- 7x fighter cards, one for each warrior in the warband &ndash; Deintalos the Exile, the Prentice Markov, the Deadwalker Regulus, and the Arcwalkers Vlash, Bault, Coyl, and Ione.<br/>- 65 cards to enhance your fighters and provide new tactics and challenges for your games of Warhammer Underworlds: Harrowdeep, including:<br/>&ndash; 12x Exiled Dead objective cards<br/>&ndash; 10x Exiled Dead upgrade cards<br/>&ndash; 10x Exiled Dead gambit spell and ploy cards<br/>&ndash; 6x Universal objective cards, usable by any warband<br/>&ndash; 7x Universal upgrade cards, usable by any warband<br/>&ndash; 7x Universal gambit cards, usable by any warband<br/>&ndash; 12x Grand Alliance cards, usable by any warband belonging to the specified Grand Alliance<br/>&ndash; 1x Exiled Dead Warband Background / Rivals Deck Card<br/><br/>",

Doing this is a bit of a spatial puzzle, moving your frog into a position with lots of options for future turns while still keeping safe from the pike. The game is suitable for everyone, a simple and fun mechanic kids easily master and a depth of strategy that gives the game another dimension.<br/><br/>The pond is not a static playing field. As you and your opponents move your frogs around, chasing fireflies, the pond will change. As a frog hops across the pond the lily pads, they will first be submerged and if pushed off of once more sink completely. This makes the pond harder and harder to navigate as the game progresses.<br/><br/>",

A rival Alchemist seeks to abuse this ability for their own gain. Push your skill to the limits and defeat them before they reach their full power.<br/><br/>FantasyForm is a solo-only game where the player must defeat a rival Alchemist.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player resolves two Encounters (one from the top Outlands row and one from the lower Forge row). These Encounters may earn or cost the player valuable Shards or Essences that can be spent later to acquire helpful Upgrades. They may instead be forced to make a difficult choice or even take damage as they pursue their quarry.<br/><br/>Next the player may buy and sell any Essences from the Ethereal row and spend whatever wealth they have on Upgrades. Artifacts and Companions add powerful abilities and increased damage against the Rival. Forms offer a bit of both, and are necessary to face the Rival.<br/><br/>Each turn advances the clock, bringing the player into direct conflict with their Rival. Once the Ethereal Row begins to run out of cards, the Rival acts either by gaining an elemental Form or by dealing damage. If the player&rsquo;s character survives this initial strike, they may spend Shards to deal damage in return. Damage inflicted persists if the Rival is not defeated, but there are only so many chances to win: each time the Rival acts, they tick down the number of actions they have remaining. The player must deal sufficient damage to the Rival before they use their last action to secure victory!<br/><br/><br/>A fantasy-themed spiritual successor for SpaceShipped, set in the Earthshine universe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;La b&acirc;tarde&quot; (the bastard) is a French card game in the same style as Tarot, Coinche, Belote, a kind of traditional, trick-taking, card games.<br/>Each player plays one card, either following suit of the same color if possible, playing a trump, or otherwise any other card - the card with the highest value scores the point. The unique gameplay is that players don't win by scoring points, you win by announcing how many points you will score, and it can be 0 !<br/><br/>An extract from the beginning of the rulebook : <br/>The Bastard one is a thrilling and mysterious card game.<br/>Some  claim  that  a  primitive  version  originated  in  the  North  of India and arrived in Venice via Asia Minor, from where it spread through Europe. It is also told that it owes its name to the illegitimate  daughter  of  a  Syldavian  prince  who  introduced it to  his father&rsquo;s court.<br/>Others  maintain  that  three  Portuguese  sailors  brought  it  back from much further afield. <br/>But nothing is less sure...<br/><br/>In this game, there are no teams, it is every person for themselves. <br/>3 to 8 players can play.<br/><br/>Draw  to  designate  the  dealer  (highest  card).  Next  round  the  dealer  shifts clockwise.<br/><br/>Deal the cards face down, one by one.<br/>A  &ldquo;rubber&rdquo;  is  a  set  of  games  made  up  of  several  &ldquo;hands&rdquo;  all  dealt  in  the same way.<br/><br/>After  each  hand  is  dealt,  the  players  look  at  their  cards  and  announce in advance the number of &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; that they think they will win. This is called &ldquo;bidding&rdquo;.<br/>In this game you never pass. Each player bids on each round. <br/>The  bidding  system  leads  all  the  players  to  agree  on  which  &ldquo;suit&rdquo;  is  the &ldquo;trump&rdquo;, if any. <br/>There  are  6  possibilities:  all  cards  are  trump,  spades  are  trump,  hearts are  trump,  diamonds  are  trump,  clubs  are  trump  &ndash;  or  there  is  no trump.<br/>When playing with trump, the order of the cards is different.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Earl Simon Montfort had gathered an army of dissatisfied rebel barons and, by stealing a march, had surprised the royal forces under King Henry III at the small East Sussex town of Lewes. The Battle of Lewes was the first on English soil in nearly fifty years and was the last &quot;gentlemanly&quot; conflict.<br/><br/>&quot;In the NAME of JUSTICE: The Battle of Lewes, 1264&quot; is a grand tactical wargame simulation of low complexity about this 13th century battle in the &quot;Second Baron&rsquo;s War&quot;. It is regarded as a hallmark in the political evolution of the English monarchy and part of the struggle to limit royal power in England.<br/><br/>Extensive research was done to provide an accurate and historical account of the battle. Unit types include cavalry, infantry, archers and even staff slingers.<br/><br/>Players represent either King Henry III or Earl Simon Montfort and their subordinate leaders. The battle takes place during the hours of May 14th and concludes when King Henry III or Simon Montfort is captured, or a moral victory is declared if Simon evades capture.<br/><br/>The game uses a chit-pull mechanism, which makes for increased replayability and helps simulate the chaos and drama of medieval combat. Many historical and what-if optional rules are included so replay value is enhanced, allowing the battle to be explored in greater detail.<br/><br/>&quot;For what is more right than law, whereby all things are ruled? And what is more true than justice, whereby matters are decided?&quot;<br/>-- The Song of Lewes, 1264 --<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Citizens of Gotham, pay close attention! Things may never be the same again&hellip;<br/>Since the release of the Batman Miniature Game five years ago, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of changes here at Knight Models. The games has gone from strength-to-strength, with a hardback core rulebook, two expansions, and the successful launch of the Batmatch organized play rules, helping to grow our amazing community around the world.<br/> We are delighted to announce the arrival of the 2nd Edition Batman Miniature Game rules. <br/>This free downloadable PDF rulebook is the culmination of thousands of games, and feedback from our customers. <br/>Fear not: it is still the game you know and love, with its street-level strategic action in Gotham&rsquo;s darkened alleyways, but we&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to streamline the mechanics, making the rules more intuitive and even more fun, and we&rsquo;ve consolidated a lot of hard-to- find rules and Traits into one mighty tome. We think players new and old will love it!<br/> But that&rsquo;s not all &ndash; far from it! The launch of the new edition is spearheaded by brand new miniatures, representing the pinnacle of our studio&rsquo;s output. The new models are produced in high-quality, coloured resin. Knight Models was founded on a love of display-quality models, and we think painters and modelers will agree that these new miniatures are the best we&rsquo;ve ever produced.<br/><br/>The Batman Miniature Game is a skirmish game based on the broad Batman universe. You can command one of the most famous criminal bands in Gotham City to expand your territory and control the underworld, or stop their evil plans with the Dark Knight and his allies.<br/><br/>The game includes the most important characters created by Bob Kane, like Batman himself, Robin, Nightwing, etc. aided by the Gotham City Police trying to stop the gangs led by the most infamous criminals and psychopaths of the DC Comics universe, like The Joker, Penguin, Two-Face and many others.<br/><br/>Knight Models team has created incredibly detailed miniatures to accurately portray these characters and their sidekicks in 35mm scale ready to assemble and paint. This is a licensed and official DC Comics product.<br/><br/>Here are just a few changes to the game for the new 2nd Edition:<br/> Bat Cape (1SC, Passive)<br/>As long as it is able to spend a Special Counter, the model will not take Damage, be Knocked Down, nor become a Casualty as a result of Falling or Jumping. In addition, the model may Leap Down without spending the MC, and without using any of its total movement allowance.<br/> Mixed Combat Style (2SC)<br/>The model may perform a close combat attack action and a free ranged attack action in the same activation this round (no Action Counters are required for the ranged attack).<br/><br/>The actions Run and Spring into the Air are disappearing. This was a difficult decision, because we wanted to limit the number of Movement Actions <br/>and enhance the ones without changes, giving us a set of Movement Actions solid as concrete.<br/> We also bring forward changes that affect Speedsters.<br/>In 2nd Edition, with the new changes shown on older teasers, we believe that more Speedsters will appear in the game board, and will have to manage their Speed Force Counters more accurately.<br/>With this new rule, Action Counters will be determinant in their game:<br/> Fatigue<br/>When a model with the Speedster trait has not any Action Counter, it suffers -1 to Movement and Defense Basic Skills.<br/> With all of this, we thought that Speed Force Master needed a little update:<br/> Speed Force Master<br/>This model can spend up to 2 Speed Power Counters during the round like Action Counters.<br/><br/>These are just a few of the traits that have been improved for the 2nd edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knights is a Chess-style boardgame for two players, black and white. There are three types of playing pieces: soldiers, knights and one &quot;knight the first&quot;, soldiers are pieces dual color like the pieces of Othello.  The board is hexagonal and it has triangular spaces.<br/><br/>Knights and &quot;Knights the first&quot; are placed on triangular squares, soldiers are placed at vertices of triangular spaces (intersections of the lines bounding triangular squares). Knights and &quot;Knights the first&quot; must be always completely surrounded by its own soldiers. Knights and &quot;K.t.f&quot; move from square to square, soldiers move from intersection to intersection. Players use a 4-side dice to move Knights and &quot;K.t.f&quot;and a 6-side dice to move soldiers. Players can move more Knights to run out the score of a dice and so for soldiers.<br/><br/>Important:<br/><br/>     players must fully deplete the score of the 4-sided dice but do not necessarily of the 6-sided dice <br/>     players at the end of their turn must have all his/her own knights completely surrounded by their own soldiers.<br/><br/><br/>Attack and capture of a knights (or &quot; k.t.f&quot;):<br/><br/>     player must bring his/her knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;) on a triangular square with a common vertex with a triangular square occupied by an enemy knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;), then player turns the soldier placed on the common vertex, Soldier thus changes its color and owner.<br/>     the attacked knight now has only two soldiers of its color in the two vertex of its triangular square and the third soldier of the opposite color, so it must run away.<br/>     a player must use the 4-side dice to escape his/her knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;) and must use all of the score of the dice to move that knight.<br/>     a knight on the run must finish the move in a triangular square where are three soldiers of its color on the vertices or two soldiers of its color on vertices and a soldier of the opposite color on the third vertex, otherwise the knight is captured.   <br/><br/><br/>&quot;Knight the first&quot; can attack two knights at the same time.<br/><br/>Objective of the game is to conquer opponent's home-base. Another way to victory is to defeat all opponent's Knights.<br/><br/>",

In a 4 player game it can be used to change the landscape a bit.<br/>     Giza: The Great Pyramid: Fast Sleds - This gives players the opportunity to potentially push two sleds on their turn.<br/>     Lords of Vegas: Sky Bridge / Building Boom  - adds the option to use the 2 provided skybridge tokens.<br/>     Atlantis: Boat expansion - A mayfair version of the small expansion which was a free give-away at Essen 2009. This one has cardboard chits instead of wooden ships. The boats function more or less like the bridges in the base game, but you can use other people ships to cross, by paying the correct amount to the bank or half the amount to the player whose ship you use.<br/>     Rocket Jockey: Space Port  - adds variants to mid game scoring and alternatives when drawing cards.<br/>     Urbania: Subsidy Contracts  - Adds tokens that can be used either in hiring or as extra workers. Also adds &quot;Italian Politics Variant&quot;.<br/>     CATAN: Victory Point markers  - Victory point chits.<br/>     Steam: Five Way Town  - This tile adds five track access into one town.<br/>     Whitewater:  Cranky Beavers  - This expansion adds a movable obstacle into play, the Cranky Beaver, and gives options for a Sudden Death Ending and a Rough Rapids variant.<br/>     Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant:  Charters  - This expansion adds ways to enter a city without being closed out.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each Extraordinaire is a larger-than-life character with extraordinary needs. They live in a unique environment, have different physical needs or have an unusual job. It's your job to design the ultimate objects to fit their worlds.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/><br/><br/>     Pick three Extraordinaire from a shuffled deck. There are a range of Extraordinaires available, from a Merman to an Astronaut. Each card has a picture of the Extraordinaire on the front and, when you turn it over, a little more insight into their world.<br/>     Pick three Object cards from the deck - this is what your Extraordinaire needs you to create for them. Assign one Object to each character. These Objects could be something to sit on, something to wear and much more.<br/>     You also have Think cards in three categories - Research, Design, Improve. You sort these into three facedown piles.<br/>     Now choose which Design job you are going to do - pick an Extraordinaire and their Object from the three option.<br/>     It is now your challenge to design this object for this Extraordinaire.<br/>     Use your Idea Pad and Pen to design the ultimate Object to suit the needs of the Extraordinaire. Describe your ideas using doodles and words. You don't have to be a good artist - good design is about good ideas!<br/>     Use Think cards to help you with your design. Good designers ask questions and this is where your Think cards help you. <br/><br/><br/>- The Research cards prompt you to take a closer look at the       Extraordinaire's world e.g. What is different about where the Extraordinaire lives or works?                                           -  The Design cards introduce different aspects of design like materials, shapes and colours e.g. How will your design be put away when not in use?<br/>- The Improve cards push you to think about your design and make it even better e.g. How can you make your design more friendly to the environment?<br/><br/>     Once you're happy with your design, give it a catchy name!<br/>     Now it's time to share your ideas - present your idea to a parent or friend. Start with the name of your design and explain why the Extraordinaire needs your product. Describe your concept, your research and what makes your design great! This gives you a chance to rationalise your idea and tie all the aspects of the design together, as well as building up some really great presentation skills.<br/><br/><br/>You can also download an accompanying app that allows you to upload your designs and create a &quot;portfolio&quot;.<br/><br/>You can play alone or in multiplayer mode. In multiplayer, each player takes a design job. You can set a time limit on the game allowing the designs to be casual or serious. The designs are named and presented just like single player mode, however there is now the addition of Award cards. After the presentations, each player is dealt an award card e.g. Best Presentation, the player then awards the player they think gave the best presentation and explains why. If you want a more competitive game, play multiple rounds. The person who wins the greatest variety of awards is the winner.<br/><br/>The Extraordinaires gives your imagination and creativity a workout, challenging you to think in new ways.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every player produces farm products and tries to sell them as well as possible. The more products of a kind a player has on his player table, the higher is the reward from the 'harvest'. Unfortunately, however, a player is often forced to sell his product at dump prices too early. And sometimes a harvest yields nothing at all. The aim of the game is to earn the most coins from the trade in farm products.<br/><br/>During the game, you grow vegetables and farm animals on your fields to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random produce cards. Each card has a picture of the product, cow, sheep, cabbage, sunflower etc, and numbers showing how many cards of that type you need to harvest at a time to get that amount of coins. You are not allowed to change the order of the cards in your hand. You play them in that order &ndash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is an essential part of the game.<br/>During your turn you place one or two cards on your two fields in front of you, indicated on your personal play board. During the game you can buy a third field for your use. Each field can produce only one product &ndash; sheep, pumpkins etc. If you do not have space to do the required action of placing a product on your fields, you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. More cards on the field, more coins while harvesting.<br/>Next, you take two cards from the deck and place them open on the table. You can take these cards for your own fields, or you can trade them or give them away &ndash; if anyone takes them. You can also trade cards from your hand, but all trading has to be done with the player in turn. No traded cards go back to hand. They all must be played to the fields after trading phase.<br/>Finally, you take three and place them in the back of your hand. In the order you draw them.<br/>The game ends when the draw pile has been used up for the third time. Who ever has the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rushin' Roulette is a high-stakes card game of strategy and luck.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a posse of 3 characters that line up in a hidden order. One-by-one, they&rsquo;ll take turns &ldquo;pulling a trigger&rdquo; hoping nothing is in the chamber. But your partners aren&rsquo;t completely at the mercy of lady luck because YOU control what&rsquo;s loaded into the revolver!<br/><br/>In this simplified game of poker, you can load Blanks to save your own team or Bullets to take out your opponents. But be careful! If your strategies are too obvious, your friends might use them against you. The last one standing wins, riding off into the sunset with the rest of their (most likely unconscious) crew.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of Ammo Cards (Like Blanks or Bullets). They load one of these cards in front of them each turn and try to figure out what opponents loaded. Flip your opponents' cards when you think they're playing it safe (blank) and load dangerous cards (bullets) when your friends trust you too much and think you're playing it safe.<br/><br/>Rushin' Roulette is a bluffing game. You can load safe cards to keep your own characters safe, but if your strategy is obvious, your friends will flip your card to save themselves. So if you think they'll take your card, load a bullet instead. Each character has a Safe and Shot ability that activates depending on the cards you flip. Generally, shot characters go to the grave while safe characters stay in your lineup. The last player with characters in their lineup wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

War Stories will mostly be playable with just the core box, and the content of a War Stories issue itself, obviously.<br/><br/>Each issue will focus on a War Hero and will include a biography, his exploits, a dedicated scenario and one or two punchboards to integrate it into your game.<br/><br/>The first issue will be for Heroes of Stalingrad, and focuses on Otto Carius, a German Tiger tank commander who destroyed a total of 150 enemy tanks. This issue will also include a section of T34s for the Russian forces as well as the errata of the Frontoviks from the Heroes of Stalingrad game base box.<br/><br/>Featuring new artwork from Nicola Angius.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The purpose of this is to create a 'fog of war' so that a player is not only uncertain of the enemy's actual strength and effectiveness but also his own as well. The time required to play the game varies from the quick single turn Blitzkrieg scenario to the lengthy 48 turn Great Patriotic War. The game consists of a rulebook, counters, map, playsheet, 6 six-sided dice (3 white, 2 blue and 1 red) and a box. 2 opaque cups are also required. The Axis forces are represented by German, SS and allied units (Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and other sympathisers) and the Soviet Union by Soviet and Guard units.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

That seems fairly easy but since your opponent has the same task there are some things that will most likely make it a bit more intricate to forfill.<br/>- - -<br/>How to play<br/>Choose a color and arrange all your tiles facing down before you. That's your stock.<br/>Take 2 random tiles from your stock and place them in the nearest left and right corner of the playing field.<br/>Draw 2 new tiles. You can place the tiles behind, next to or in front of one of your own tiles (you can not place them diagonally).<br/>The symbol on the tile must have at least share one attribute with all tiles that are adjacent to it horizontally and vertically (same symbol and/or same number of dots). These rules also apply to the tiles of your opponent that you encounter and therefor becomes a bit more difficult to place your tiles.<br/><br/>Each turn you can place one tile from your hands onto the game board according to the rules of placement. After that you take a new tile from your supply to replenish your hand to 2, your turn is over.<br/><br/>If you do not have a matching tile in your hand you put the tile beside the bord creating a discard pile and you take a new tile from your supply to replenish your hand to 2, your turn is over (you do not place a tile on the board in this turn).<br/><br/>If you have a tile in your hands that matches exactly (symbol and amount of dots) to one of the tiles of your opponent that is adjacent to one of yours you have the opportunity to take over that position.<br/><br/>You can place your tile on top of the already present tile and make a dabul!<br/><br/>From that moment on only the tile on top of the pile decides who can place tiles adjacent to the pile.<br/><br/>Your opponent can do the same thing again if he also has (or draws) that exact match too. This can end up in a pile as big as 8 tiles! This option is literally a game changer! Within seconds you can interfere in the strategic plans of your opponent and force him to change his offensive playing to defensive, take a detour or even force him to concentrate on another segment of the game board.<br/>- - -<br/>When do you win?<br/>The rule is very simple: if you reach the opposite side, you win. <br/> The tiles do not have to form a continuous path, you just have to reach the opposite side of the playing board first to win. But do not let this simplicity fool you, be careful!<br/><br/>Defending your territory is just as important as crossing over to the other side.<br/><br/>Create barricades to avoid that your opponent has an easy crossing. Take over positions to thwart your opponent and force him to change his plans.<br/><br/>Act quick, keep track of all sides and try to combine your strategy with the (bad) luck you might encounter!<br/>- - -<br/>Expert mode<br/>Whoever reaches the other side first and has a continuous path of tiles in his/her color wins.<br/>It is therefore possible that you are already on the other side, but you still have to reclaim fields in your path that your opponent has taken over.<br/><br/>Tip: there are 4 tiles of each symbol in the game for each player. Sharpen your tactics so that you will have enough pieces left at the end to repair your path.<br/><br/>",

Anytime a Special Hero card is played for its special power, or an &quot;All Is Quiet Darkness Spreads&quot; card appears, it is placed on the tracking board. As soon as the third card is placed, then a Winds of War card is drawn and must be followed. In most cases a negative effect occurs unless the team decides to prevent it by following the demands of the prevention on the card.<br/><br/>The contents of this expansion are included in the second edition of The Dragon Expansion, and the rules for this expansion are contained in the second edition Dragon Expansion rulebook.<br/><br/>",

Cards are used to drive the action and for rebounding, but shots are taken using dice. A glaring omission is assist ratings for guards, who instead are an integral cog of the offense (without a well-rated guard in the lineup, the team will perform significantly worse).<br/><br/>",

Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.<br/><br/>Red Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.<br/><br/>The game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: Not Listed<br/>Hex: 9.3 miles / 15 kilometers<br/>Units: Division to Army<br/><br/><br/>Updated and translated in English as Red Typhoon: The Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive, 1942.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood on the Blade is a micro set of rules for solitaire or co-op skirmish game, set on a fantasy background, but can also be used for non-fantasy games (planned expansions will cover Middle-Ages and Dark Ages, possibly Samurai era).<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; refers to the small set of rules, the small time required to complete one game session and the small number of miniatures required (4-10 figures being a common range). Many micro-details are left to the player, only the &ldquo;important&rdquo; rules are included in the twelve pages of the game.<br/><br/>The game includes nine Scenarios, covering classical wargame scenes like searching for loot, attacking an enemy base, defending your territory, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot!<br/><br/>Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Scout&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Warband, your enemies will also become stronger.<br/><br/>Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Two teams with 10 players each, where you can choose your &quot;starting lineup&quot; on the court:<br/><br/><br/>    point guards<br/>    shooting guards<br/>    small forwards<br/>    power forwards<br/>    centers<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>Each player has 5 different skills: Passing - action points - play skill - height -  scoring %.<br/> You have full control of the whole team, which will allow you to perform any individual action with any player on the court. A joint action between two players like a screen or a &quot;pick&amp; roll&quot;, a team tactic like playing in the zone or a man-to-man defense, faithfully recreating what happens in a basketball game. Thanks to its mechanic, mixes a great realism in the actions with high simplicity. Players move one by one alternating between attacker and defender, not the entire team at once, making play faster. This makes the duration of a turn variable, so you play four quarters like in a real game but not a predetermined number of turns in each quarter.<br/><br/>Passes, rebounds, fouls, two-point shots, lay ups, three-pointers, dunks, freethrows, blocks, pick&amp; roll, steals... any basketball action is possible in this game!<br/><br/>",

Once achieved they can elect a leader.<br/><br/>Each population gives players one of 4 resources: Military Strength, Equality, Espionage, and Production.<br/><br/>They then use these resources to obtain Advancements such as &quot;Man on Mars&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Submarine&quot; etc. (worth one Victory Point).

When a competition is played, players compete to have the most resource of a given type by the end of the turn.<br/><br/>The road to victory will not be easy, as players will use Action cards to disrupt each other's rise to power.<br/><br/>The first player to 7 Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

And the same hills were the theater of two fierce battles between the rising Italian Kingdom and the Austrian Empire.<br/><br/>In July 1848, the battle between the Piedmomtese Army under King Carlo Alberto and the Austrian Imperial Army under Field Marshall Joseph Radetzky signed the turning point of the First Independence War, and the defeat of the Piedmontese dream of an Italian Crusade against Austria.<br/><br/>In 1866, on 24th of June (the recurrence of the Battle of Solferino), a far bigger, but inconclusive, battle was fought between the new Italian Kingdom Army under Vittorio Emanuele II, son of Carlo Alberto, and the Austrian Imperial Army of South led by Archduke Albrecht. The battle started as a meeting engagement, ending in a massive fighting. It  was a crushing defeat of the Italian colours, but the Third Independence War still finally gave Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy, because of its alliance with Prussia, who was winning the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.<br/><br/>﻿﻿<br/><br/>",

Even a new type of poisonous damage.<br/><br/>Adds:<br/>- 2 new terrain types: Acid Pools corrupt your equipment, requiring you to discard a card at random. Snow requires an additional point of movement to move into.<br/>- 2 new races: the unbreakable Orcs who require 4 damage to take down, and the Fallen Valkyrie who are experts in blocking both melee weapons and spells.<br/>- 50+ new sets of battle cards, with new spells, weapons, shields, and abilities that can completely change the game.<br/>- Hex cards which will clog up your deck unless you're lucky enough to pass them on to an opponent.<br/>- Poison damage tokens: These green daggers replace the standard damage daggers and will continuously cause your unit damage unless you're able to heal it.<br/>- War machines are now available for purchase, taking time to build but dealing death instantly to those naive enough to be within range once complete.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Banners is a tactical game that utilizes hand-management, tile-placement, area-control, and a intriguing scoring system. Players will be placing cards from their hands to the table in an attempt to secure location cards at the end of the game. There are five factions vying for power of these locations and each faction consists of six cards ranging in value from 1-6. Player will not know what factions their opponents are making secret alliances with until the big reveal at the end of the game. Each player will end the game with 3 cards remaining in their hand and these will indicate which factions they have made alliances with. All locations are then scored and given to each faction. The player with the most valuable cards for each faction will gain all the victory points for the corresponding locations!<br/><br/>Players will also be attempting to place cards in clever ways as to grab shiny bronze coins, which are also worth victory points. Placing a Hag card allows the player to move the Hag from location to location and then move previously placed cards to a new position on the table, potentially messing up an opponent's plan or bolstering their own. Lastly, the sneaky Troll card can be played to steal a coin from any location and then allow that player to immediately take another turn.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Having driven the Hitlerite invaders out of Soviet Ukraine, the Red Army turned its sights on Axis-allied Romania in the spring of 1944. Powerful mechanized armies were met by German and Romanian forces along carefully-prepared defensive lines, which initially held off the attacks. But by late summer the Red Army had broken through, and Romania left the Axis to join the Allies in the liberation of Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>Broken Axis is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 50 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of our Kursk: Burning Tigers game. You can play those scenarios individually, or in one of four &quot;battle games&quot; that link them together for an intense campaign experience.<br/><br/>The Germans bring strong armored forces to the party, including Tiger and Panther tanks, Panzer IV medium tanks and the usual array of assault guns. At least that's what they have when they show up instead of leaving the fighting to the Romanians. The Romanian Army has been rebuilt from its 1941 and 1942 disasters, with German-made tanks and modern Romanian-made anti-tank guns. The Germans do provide the elite Grossdeutschland Division, and its epic stand at Tirgu Frumos is a centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s scenario set.<br/><br/>The Red Army is powerful: the new JS-2 heavy tanks are in action, along with the first examples of the T34/85. These are the first large-scale battles fought outside the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union, and the Red Army is eager to take the fight to the Romanian &ldquo;mush eaters.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: silky-smooth and die-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 50 scenarios with four battle games.<br/><br/>",

It wasn&rsquo;t just a root cellar. There were many rough hewn exits and the room was huge, maybe 10 feet high. I felt the earth shake before I heard or saw it. Turning, the great beast was already upon me. My instincts took over and I had my sword deep in its belly before I realized I was fighting the legendary Elder, Brith. I killed him with the first blow, or so I thought. Then it screamed, more like joy than pain and its skin tore open with a sickening wet ripping sound. Three massive tentacles snaked out, fatter than my thighs, and clawed at my wrist.<br/><br/>All I remember is that I ran. I don&rsquo;t know how I got out. Or what became of Brith. The Den was empty when I went back the next day. Cold and quiet like a grave.<br/><br/>",

Grab your gun and wisely choose your allies as you compete in this deck building adventure game. 2-4 players will go on adventures, hunt in the veldt, and trade for new additions to their decks. Try to amass the most wealth, but beware, your allies will determine how many wealth cards you can score at game end.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of four steps:<br/>- Upkeep, if applicable<br/>- Play up to one adventure card<br/>- Go hunting in the veldt<br/>- Make up to one trade for new cards<br/><br/>As you gain new adventure cards, they will open up additional actions, plus you can get upgraded guns to aid in hunting, and allies which remain in play. During Upkeep you select one gun and one ally to journey with you that turn. The game continues until the veldt runs out of animals, at which time whoever can score the most wealth wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game is a boardgame that explores the interagency cooperation needed to address the emergency and early recovery phase of a complex humanitarian crisis. It is intended both for hobby play and for use in professional education about humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.<br/><br/>The game is set in the fictional country of Carana, but is loosely modeled on disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It explores approximately three months of humanitarian operations, including both the initial emergency and a later period of early recovery. Because Carana is a fragile, conflict- affected country, relief and reconstruction efforts may also involve issues of social unrest and political instability, especially during the early recovery stage once the initial shock of the crisis has worn off.<br/><br/>The primary objective of all players is to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the local population (thereby scoring &quot;relief points&quot;). However, players also need to maintain public and political support for their organizations (&quot;operations points&quot;), whether to govern (Carana), sustain the relief mission (HADR-TF), or secure financial support (UN and NGOs).<br/><br/>&quot;At-Risk&quot; cards indicate the current emergency needs for food, water/sanitation, medical, or shelter supplies in each district of the capital. Players must bring the necessary supplies into the country, and allocate aid teams to deliver them in time. Aid teams might also be engaged in rescue operations, aid coordination, needs assessment, infrastructure repair, public relations or other key tasks. Event cards inject many of the numerous challenges associated with relief operations into game play, but also indicate the self-help efforts of the local population as they struggle to survive and recover.<br/><br/>Game play is cooperative, but it is possible for some, all, or no player to win.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the war, statistics showed that, regardless of whether the German ground forces won a battle or lost it, whether they outnumbered their enemy or even if they, themselves, were outnumbered, the German Army inflicted fifty percent more casualties on the enemy than they suffered. The Waffen-SS units were even deadlier by doubling what their Army counterparts achieved.

This time, in July, from the 13th to 23rd, the German front at the Koltov area shattered from the weight of the Russian 3rd and 4th Tank armies breaking through a narrow 3-4 km gap in the German lines. As the 8th and 1st Panzer Divisions counterattacked, Russian aircraft filled the skies and wreaked carnage upon the 8th Panzer. Further north, a large German pocket had been created, which attempted to breakout. As German forces were tossed into the relief effort, the front shattered like glass. The 16th Pz and 20th PG Divisions but could barely hold their positions as the two massive Russian tank armies streaked for the Vistula River!<br/><br/>This unique game has both players secretly issuing orders (five to select from) to each one of their formations. When revealed, a player's plan may be enhanced or wrecked depending on the orders issued to the opposing formation! It captures the reality of war quite well. Combat losses are in strength points. The German has a hard road to hold in this game as the Russian tank armies exploit the Koltov gap that is always created. The Russian also has some hefty victory conditions that require most objectives on the map to be in their control.

        "description": "From Wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Kiela\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Kiela</a><br/><br/>Kiela is a mancala game played by Kimbundu (sometimes called Mbundu, Loanda or Luanda) speaking people in northern Angola. The game plays an important role in the oral literature and it is said to be a game of peace because &quot;it can turn enemies into friends&quot;. On the 5th of January, 1999, the Government of Angola instituted the Pr&eacute;mio Kiela, a tournament which now offers prizes up to 1,500 US$ for the winner. <br/>The most important source on the game is a book by Bernardo Campos. Although he uses the name kiela (&quot;puzzle&quot;, &quot;mind game&quot;) both for the game itself and also for the kind of game (i.e., mancala) in a rather confusing manner, it was possible to extract the rules from it.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Kiela is played on a board made by four rows of ten holes. Each player controls the two rows closest to him. <br/>At the beginning there are two stones in each hole of the outer rows and two stones in each of the four right holes of the inner row of each player. <br/>For a beginners game it is suggested to start playing with just one seed per hole, instead of two, in the same holes.<br/><br/>At your turn you take all the stones from a hole belonging to your side of the board, which contains two or more seeds, and sow them anti-clockwise (i.e., you put one on each of the following holes, without skipping one, all around your two rows). For a beginners game, it is suggested that they can move even if there is a single stone. <br/>If the last stone lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. <br/>If the last stone lands in an occupied hole all these stones (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are picked up and you keep on sowing. <br/>     If this occupied hole is in the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent is occupied, the stones of this hole are captured and you keep on sowing with them starting in the hole following the one that allowed you to capture. <br/>     If the outer hole of the opponent is also occupied, you capture also its stones, and sow with the stones from both opponent's holes. <br/>When a player cannot move (i.e., all his holes are empty or contain single stones), he has lost. For a beginners game, only if all his holes are empty, as they are allowed to move singletons. <br/>Expert players may, at their first turn, rearrange the stones on their side. &quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lone Canuck's first of three ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own Advanced Squad Leader and several modules to make use of these scenarios.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from from Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>15 July 1943... The British Eighth Army's drive stalled in the face of the stubborn and skilful German defence, Montgomery had to turn to the US 7th Army for help, only to discover that most of the Americans had gone off in the opposite direction. This forced the Eighth Army into a gruelling campaign in adverse conditions against a determined and resourceful enemy in easily defended terrain. His only chance to salvage success lay with the one formation of his army that had not fought in the desert, the First Canadian Division. Moreover, he was pinning the Eighth Army's hopes on the efforts of a single untried division of Canadians. Outside Vizzini, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (Hasty P's) passed through the Royal Canadian Regiment as the First Brigade led the way to the paved Route 124, the infantry riding in lorries or on tanks of the Three River Regiment. The next major town was Grammichele, ten miles from Vizzini. The Hasty P's and the Three River tanks ran right into the German ambush.....<br/><br/><br/>16 July 1943... The British Eighth Army advanced had stalled on the edge of the Catania plain and General Montgomery had instructed General Leese of XXX Corps to &quot;Drive the Canadians on Hard!&quot;. The First Canadian Division began their eastward advance on Caltagirone with the 48th Highlanders proceeding cross-country. Lt-Colonel Jefferson's Loyal Edmonton Regiment and a Squadron of tanks from the Three Rivers Regiment formed the vanguard, headed for the next large town, Piazza Armerina. Just beyond San Michele di Ganzeria, Route 124 joined the Gela-Enna highway; Route 117, the highway had been hijacked from the Americans. The Loyal Eddies had smooth sailing until noon when three miles south of Piazza Armerina they ran into elements of the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division.....<br/><br/><br/>18 July 1943... While RCR clung tenaciously to the roadside a mere half-mile south of the town, Brigadier Graham had committed his remaining battalion. He sent the 48th Highlanders to take Valguarnera by making a long right hook. The Toronto regiment was to launch its final approach on Valguarnera from a ridge two-miles south of the town, but when the Highlanders arrived they found the ridge to be strongly held by the Germans. Enemy snipers and machine-gunners pinned down the Toronto infantrymen for long minutes, until an English-born corporal took matters into his own hands.....<br/><br/><br/>22 July 1943... Unlike Assoro, there was no unguarded backdoor, Leonforte had to be attacked frontally. And the town was held in strength by tanks and troops from the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. A savage street battle ensued and all four Edmonton rifle companies were soon involved. With neither artillery support nor anti-tank guns, the Eddies were faced with the choice of remaining in Leonforte and being wiped out, or withdrawing to safety. The battalion commander Jim Jefferson made up his mind quickly ordering his embattled companies to pull out of Leonforte under small arms covering fire provided by the Seaforth Highlanders. At Second Brigade HQ, a despondent Brigadier-General Chris Vokes received a ten-year-old Italian boy named Antonio Guiseppe, who dodging bullets, shells and German patrols made his way to the Canadian lines to pass a message from Jefferson. Vokes acted decisively, organizing a flying column of troops from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, four Shermans from the Three Rivers Regiment and four 6-pounders from the 90th AT-Battery and led by a PPCLI Company commander, Captain Rowan Coleman.....<br/><br/><br/>24 July 1943... The Second Brigade, which was to support the First Brigade had difficulty moving into position around Assoro and when patrols from the divisional reconnaissance unit, the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards encountered heavy fire on Route 117 near Nissoria. At noon, he signalled a 24-hour postponement in favour of a set-piece attack, supported by every available artillery piece. Under Simmonds' plan, The Royal Canadian Regiment would attack at 1500 hours advancing behind a barrage which would advance at a rate of a hundred yards every two minutes. Half-mile ahead, a smoke screen 2,000 yards long would precede the attackers and guided Kittyhawk fighter-bombers assigned to bomb and strafe targets along the road, while six squadrons of medium bombers plastered Agria and environs. A total of 5 field regiments and 2 medium regiments, over 150 guns would support one battalion.....<br/><br/><br/>2 August 1943... It fell to the Canadian troops to launch the beginning of the end of the Sicilian campaign. Temporarily attached to the British 78th Division, the Canadian Third Infantry Brigade was to mount a preliminary operation near the village of Catenanuova. The West Nova Scotia Regiment played a key role in the capture of Catenanuova. After the Royal 22nd Regiment captured Monte Scalpello, a razorback ridge towering 3,000 feet over the valley of the dry Dittaino. The 3rd Brigade had done its job, giving the 78th Division a springboard for its attack towards Centuripe. And while casualties had been light tougher times were in store for the brigade and particularly for the West Novas. While the 78th struck out for Centuripe northwest of Catenanuova, the 3rd Brigade moved cross-country to fill the narrowing gap between the 78th and the First Canadian Division further north. German prisoners warned that the paratroopers of the 3rd Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment held the hill.....<br/><br/><br/>4 August 1943... With the fall of Regalbuto, the Canadians had unknowingly entered the final phase of operations in Sicilian campaign. Three notable features had to seized along the way to Adrano, Hill 736, Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio. The Loyal Eddies loaded up their ammunition, food and water as well as the 3-inch mortars and medium machine-guns of the supporting Saskatoon Light Infantry on to pack mules and headed into dry river valley. The battalion spent the nex t four days moving into position for the assault on Hill 736, clashing several times with German outposts cleverly concealed in the wilderness terrain. Major Archie Donald led the Loyal Edmontons, supported by 25-pounders from the 3rd Canadian Field Regiment, up the hill under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire.....<br/><br/><br/>5 August 1943... The loss of Agria, Regalbuto and Centruipe to XXX Corps had convinced the Germans to abandon their endangered defences in front of Catania and to withdraw into the main defensive position around the foot of Etna. Montgomery urged XXX Corps to step up its efforts to capture Adrano, the loss of which would disrupt the German defence. 4 August, the 78th Division continued its push northwards across the Salso and Simeto rivers via Route 121, while the Canadians were to capture Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio, then force their way through the valley of the Salso. Major-General Guy Simmonds saw one of the rare opportunities to properly utilize tanks.....<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "1861 - Wilson&rsquo;s Creek (American Civil War in 3D)<br/><br/>The second battle in our series of the American Civil War games in 3D sees the Union army under General Nathanial Lyon make a daring dawn raid on the Confederate forces.  The Union are outnumbered more than two to one, but Lyon is banking on his more skilled men being able to win the day.  Can the Confederates commanded by General Benjamin McCulloch stop this bold Union action?<br/><br/>The game is quick to play in less than 1 hour, but it is very tactical and can be played again and again.  It has a time limit of 18 bounds in which the Union must achieve their objective.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game that gives a flavour of the American Civil War period.  A simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two quadrants, the Wilson&rsquo;s Creek five page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory?  Play North or South in this the second of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.<br/><br/>&gt;Source: wargamesdownload.com<br/><br/>",

Each military unit represents a company or platoon.

These modules will be divided into a number of scenarios. Each scenario presents a challenge to both sides, with clear objectives which must be achieved in a limited number of turns.<br/><br/>The first module, Gathering Storm, focuses on the opening battles of the Kokoda Track Campaign.<br/><br/>",

In the second round the roles reverse.<br/><br/>The 5 seekers are moved across the playing field (an assembled area of connected Nestortiles). Then the referee counts the score of the currently occupied locations (1 point for a color and/or number match) and announces the sum of the scored points. As they get more information, the seekers can deduce where the secret is hidden.<br/><br/>Topologic is abstract, but players are encouraged to come up with a thematic background they like. This even includes renaming the game for each session.<br/><br/>",

The Federated Suns have carved a prominent swath through history: the Davions formed a military that rewrote modern warfare; created the New Avalon Institute of Science, giving the Inner Sphere its first technological renaissance in three centuries; and united the military might of the Federated Suns with the economic power of House Steiner, creating the vast star empire known as the Federated Commonwealth. But with such power comes corruption -- and civil war is looming on the horizon.<br/><br/>BattleTech Field Manual: Federated Suns provides profiles on every Federated Suns regiment, including their loyalties, and provides special rules, new equipment and 'Mechs unique to this powerful House.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This sequel to the earlier House Davion (The Federated Suns) takes the same format as the other BattleTech Field Manuals in that it focuses largely on the military structure of the Federated Suns before introducing a scattering of new equipment, 'Mech variants, an OmniMech, a Warship and some Battle Armour. In this case, the new technology consists of the Rotary Autocannon, new Autocannon ammunition (although some is reprinted from earlier sourcebooks) and Inner Sphere Targetting Computers.<br/><br/>While this sourcebook is out of print, it has been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, Catalyst Game Labs, making it much easier to get hold of than some of the other Field Manuals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;Snooker Champion is an attempt to capture the essence of professional snooker in a replay simulation, where the strengths and weaknesses of the players become subtly apparent from continual playing of the game.<br/>The game is designed in two parts, the basic game (taking about 10-12 minutes to complete a single frame) with a wealth of in-built data reflecting the players&rsquo; differing styles of play, and the short game (about 2-3 minutes per frame) to enable &lsquo;best of 31-frame&rsquo; matches to be replayed in a reasonable short time.&quot;<br/><br/>To play a snooker match, you have to select two player cards and agree on the version you want to play: basic or short.<br/><br/>Depending on your choice, you simulate the snooker game by &quot;potting&quot; balls, or in this case: simulate potting attempts by rolling the dice.<br/><br/>In the short game, a match is decided by a couple of die rolls on various tables.<br/><br/>In the basic game, much more dice will be rolled before a winner is crowned. You may choose the the level of risk you want to take, roll two dice and look up the appropriate table, which tells you the outcome of your attempt. Table results will also enable you to try snooker attempts and escaping from snookers. A special display card will tell you how many red balls are left in play.<br/><br/>For both versions, knowledge of the real snooker rules are helpful to understand the game and the various tables.<br/><br/>",

What they do not understand is that power and glory need not rest in the same hands. Let the kings have their glory, if that's what they call it. Let their names be written down and passed from father to son for years to come. We care not for such things... for now.<br/><br/>We are happy to stand above the stage in quiet darkness, pulling the strings and shaping the world as we see fit. We are the rulers of kings, and this is our land and in the end, we'll see where the true glory lies.<br/><br/>Of Power &amp; Glory is played in several rounds. Each player has several pawns that represent nobles in a Western Europe that is ruled by eight Kings. Each Nobel may take one action per round. These actions may place the Nobles in the court of one of the Kings to garner the favor of that King, in a particular territory to postpone war in the area or perhaps hidden in the shadows to bring sabotage upon a King.<br/><br/>After all player actions have been taken, the territories represented by the three leftmost, uncovered territory cards are battled over by the kings in order. Immediately after each battle, the winning King will hand out favors to the nobles that are in his court. Nobles my choose the form of their favors. They may choice, among other options, Power to aid them in the future or Glory to advance them into the lead. Once all Battles have been fought and the end of round actions are completed, the next round begins with players taking actions again.<br/><br/>In Of Power &amp; Glory, each player represents a noble family in Western Europe during a period of war. The war is being fought among Eight Kings in the area. Players will need to aid the Kings in order to gain power and then use this power to help themselves, perhaps at the cost of the very Kings that gave them power in the first place.<br/><br/>Of Power &amp; Glory is a Machiavellian strategy game that rewards foresight, deceptive sleight of hand, and investing your influence strategically to better your position amongst the other noble families.<br/><br/>",

Grab your teammates and take on your fiercest rivals to decide once and for all who really rules the ice.  Or go head-to-head against a fellow curler to determine who will be King of the Rings.<br/><br/>Playable by two, four, six or even eight players, Hurry Hard! recreates all the action on the ice in a fun, easy to learn card game.  Players take turns throwing guards, draws, or takeouts.  Your teammates can then improve the impact of your throw, including through the play of the powerful Hurry Hard! sweeping card to help get your rock a little closer to the button. Watch out though!  Your opponents can also affect your throw.  The timely play of a Miss the Broom card can ruin an end, unless you have a Plan B card in reserve.  After the player with The Hammer throws the last rock, the score for the end is calculated the same as in real curling, based on whose rocks are closest to the button.  Then a new end begins.<br/><br/>For non-curlers, the rules explain not just how to play the card game, but also the basic terminology to help you understand the game of curling itself.<br/><br/>For curlers, the game has been well balanced to reward real curling strategy.  Deciding when to throw a guard or when to come into the rings can make the difference between scoring a big end or giving up a steal.  Just as with real curling, though, no matter how good your strategy, you still need to make your throws.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "[From back of the box]<br/>The 1st Marine and 81st Infantry Divisions were assigned to take the islands of Pelelieu and Angaur. One would be fairly easy and the other extremely hard. Pelelieu became a vortex that took way more Marines lives than it was worth. The Japanese had dug themselves into the Umurbrogal Mountain and forced the battle to be drawn out for 2 months, instead of 2 weeks.<br/><br/>[From the publishers website]<br/>This is the fourth in the PIC series of games that simulate island battles in the Pacific Ocean Area during WWII. The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the taking of the islands of Pelelieu and Angaur from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that the Marines are stymied for much longer than planned and need to be releived by US Army troops from the 81st Division after they took Angaur.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.<br/><br/>The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.<br/><br/>The are a number of scenarios that simulate the battle on a smaller scale and allow for play for either island or both.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines.<br/><br/>Game Design and Production by:    Chris Fasulo<br/><br/>Map Artwork:    Kyle Gebhardt<br/><br/>",

On the count of three, each player starts rolling their die as fast as they can (d8 for gladiators, d10 for clowns). On a roll of 1, your character succeeded to Hit. You then have to swing your hand in order to contact your opponent's hand, if successful you Wound, if unsuccessful you Miss. Most characters die when wounded twice, then another character enters the battle.<br/><br/>When you kill all three of your opponent's gladiators/clowns you are victorious!<br/><br/>Bitch Slap is an official entry to the 3rd annual Greek board game design contest scheduled for Spring 2012<br/><br/>",

The armies are made up of 12 different types of unit including infantry, cavalry, chariots and war elephants. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses so a careful balance of strategy is required to be a successful general.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to out maneuver your opponent and capture their general.<br/><br/>The game-play is historically realistic, players can use maneuvers from classic battles directly in the game to improve their chances of victory. This level of realism makes the game both easy to learn yet deceptively difficult to master.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to move all their pieces, moving and attacking. Play then passes to their opponent. The winner of each attack is decided by the combat pot. The game finishes when one player captures the opponents general.<br/><br/>As with all Total Strategy Games the game is designed to be customisable by the players once they become proficient.<br/><br/>",

Buy advertising, win over clients, and put your company on the map!<br/><br/>This solitaire game uses a single deck of custom cards and can be played while standing in line.  It is mechanically inspired by such brilliant push-your-luck games as Zed Deck and Lord of the Rings: The Adventure Deck Game.  Each turn, you flip the top card of the deck and select one of the three aspects of the card on which to bid: advertising, money, or clients.  You then bid as little or as much money as you like.<br/><br/>The card then tells you how many cards to reveal from the top of the deck for the game's counter bid.  You add up the money scores from those revealed cards.  If you bid higher, you win the flipped card!  All revealed cards are placed face-up on the bottom of the deck.  The flipped card is also place face-up, but may be turned sideways to expose the advertising ability if you won the card, or turned upside-down to indicate that you won the clients.<br/><br/>Advertisements give you abilities that allow you to win certain kinds of bids more easily or otherwise manipulate the game rules.  Clients count as Victory Points at the end of the game.  You only gain $2 at the beginning of each turn, so keep an eye on your cash flow, or you'll lose out on important clients or key advertising abilities!<br/><br/>When you have gone through the entire deck (all cards are face-up), simply count up the client values of all the upside-down cards.  This is your score for the game.  Then try to beat that score next game!<br/><br/>Designed for the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

The game begins as the Ocius comes under unexpected fire.<br/><br/>Having just exited orbit around Planet Kalos, the Ocius is caught off-guard and badly damaged.  The much larger and more powerful Zophosian ship will not stop firing until the Ocius is reduced to space debris.  Your only hope is to keep the ship intact and then boost to light speed.<br/><br/>The repairs and light speed calculations will take time, during which you, the Officers, must coordinate repairs, medical operations, defenses and return fire.  You will have crew at your disposal, but will also need to operate ship Modules yourselves.  If you can hold the ship together, and keep enough Crew alive, you just may make it out!<br/><br/>The USS Ocius is a cooperative game that combines role-playing, worker placement, and timed themes.  Players will need to coordinate as a team, and prioritize activities.  Event cards are drawn at the beginning of each round, indicating the challenges faced by the players.  The game has ramping stress in the forms of both time pressure and board collapse.  In addition, each Officer has a special ability that encourages them to stay put, while the problems that arise on the ship encourage otherwise.  Players must tactically Move, Command, and Use Expertise to accomplish their mission.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Don't let the quick play time and low bits count fool you, this is a strategy game.  It may be light at higher timer settings, but when going for low times, every action matters!<br/><br/><br/>This game is unlike any game you are likely to have played:<br/><br/>Global Timer - actually race the clock<br/><br/>Coop - race the clock while deciding who does what.<br/><br/>Worker Placement - accomplish tasks in multiple ways - makes for some intricate tactics.<br/><br/>RPG Elements - Officers have specialties.  Roles &quot;feel&quot; right and are each crucial.  However, no one combination is better than the next.<br/><br/>Mechanical Blend - While dice are used, and Events are random, over the course of a game, choices still determine success.

The French army under General Dupont is trying to evacuate a huge treasure train from the sack of Cordoba back to Madrid when a Spanish army under Castanos appears on the scene.<br/><br/>Using a system that lets armies and units behave in historical fashion but makes it possible to play multi-day battles in a few hours, this is an army commander's view of how to conduct a campaign. Fatigue, morale, supply and command are as important as fighting prowess and sheer numbers. Units not just take physical losses but will become ineffective from fatigue and disorder long before they run out of men - unless you, in command, can manage them effectively and maintain their edge over days of marching and fighting.  Formations are normally activated by chitpulls, but for PBEM play a less interactive version is provided that still provides a significant advantage to the side that grabs the initiative in the battle.<br/><br/>Map scale: 1km per hex<br/>Unit scale: divisions, 1000 men per strength point<br/>Time scale: 3.5 hours per daylight turn, 8 hours per night turn<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:&quot;<br/>In the early days of &lsquo;modern&rsquo; wargaming, Napoleonic games were tremendously popular. They allowed the new, not necessarily young, wargamer to fight the glorious actions they had heard about in their school history lessons. Often starting with the Battle of Waterloo as their first action, the general would deploy his hastily painted soldiers from Airfix&rsquo;s Napoleonic range. Airfix offered British and French infantry, as well as cavalry and guns for both sides.<br/><br/>Napoleonic tactics were simple in principle, but were hard to master in practice; for example infantry in a line maximized its firepower, but was vulnerable to cavalry. Changing to a square kept the infantry safe from the cavalry, but made them vulnerable to artillery and reduced their musketry to &frac14; of the unit&rsquo;s strength2. The games, just like the battles of history, were all about combining the efforts of the infantry, cavalry and artillery using &lsquo;combined arms tactics&rsquo; to sweep the enemy away. The key problem with these games was the &lsquo;helicopter overview&rsquo; of the action the players had of their largely divisional sized games. While representing the battles of the Napoleonic Wars in some ways, they did not recreate experience of the commanders of the time.<br/><br/>Paddy Griffith&rsquo;s excellent book aimed to fill the gap and offer no less than seven different sets of rules to simulate the experience of command at different levels. Just as the early wargamers took the Airfix Napoleonic&rsquo;s and converted them for use in a wide range of periods, the ideas offered by Paddy in these rules have equal potential to transform any wargamer&rsquo;s tabletop experience. I am very pleased for the opportunity to reprint this classic work.<br/><br/>This book contains no less than seven sets of rules:<br/><br/>Skirmish level<br/><br/>Divisional game<br/><br/>Brigade game<br/><br/>Army level game<br/><br/>Generalship game<br/><br/>Map Kriegsspiel<br/><br/>Tactic Exercises Without Troops<br/>&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the end of the first century AD, the Roman Empire was the greatest military power the world had ever seen. All of Western Europe south of the Rhine and the Danube, southern Britain, North Africa, Egypt, the Balkans and most of the Levant was under its control. The mighty Roman army and its legions had rarely known defeat in living memory &ndash; and never for very long.<br/><br/>One upstart state and its wily, aggressive leader refused to bend the knee. For almost twenty years, and against all odds, King Decebalus of Dacia defied Rome from his fortress capital deep within the Carpathian Mountains. Composed of thousands of savage tribesmen, heavily armoured Sarmatian lancers and even captured Roman weapons, Dacia&rsquo;s armies proved to be powerful enough to keep the legions at bay. All this was to change with the ascension of the soldier-emperor Trajan, leading to one of antiquity&rsquo;s greatest conflicts &ndash; the Dacian Wars.<br/><br/>This supplement for Hail Caesar focuses on Rome&rsquo;s wars under Trajan against the Dacians and their Sarmatian allies. Featured battles include the Battle of Adamclisi, the Battle of Tapae and the Siege of Sarmizegetusa Regia. Also included are rules for playing skirmish games, fighting sieges and using warships, as well as campaign and hobby ideas.<br/><br/>A copy of the Hail Caesar rulebook is required to use this supplement.<br/><br/>",

Additionally, the game contains a color die, two building bases and some scoring chips.<br/><br/>The bases are placed on the table and a handful of pieces are stacked onto them. However, the bases aren't straight, so the pieces have to interlock to avoid falling. Players take turns to roll a die, take a piece in the corresponding color and adding it to either of the two structures. For each row of cubes that is added, the player scores a point. An additional point is scored for adding to the higher of the two towers. Points are deducted when a tower collapses.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last piece has been added to the tower. The player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The content is available below as a PDF file, which includes rules, board, and pieces.<br/><br/>A professional version will be available on Game Crafter in the near future, link to follow.<br/><br/>Fight as Government of Afghanistan or the Taliban to control Panjwayi.<br/><br/>Panjwayi: Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan is a wargame unlike any you have ever played.<br/><br/>Panjwayi (pronounced PANZH-uh-way or panzh-way-EE) is a district of Kandahar Province, famous as the birthplace of the Taliban during the 1990s.&nbsp;<br/><br/>After serious military defeats at the hands of NATO in 2006 and 2007, the Taliban are steadily reinforcing Panjwayi in the summer of 2008. No longer willing to stand up to NATO in set-piece battles which they know they will lose, the Taliban insurgents disguise themselves among the population, use Improvised Explosive Devices, and draw upon large numbers of expendable recruits arriving from Pakistan and elsewhere. Can the Taliban defeat the enormous technological edge held by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and their NATO Allies? Or can the GoA convince the wavering population to have faith in the new government, and set the conditions in Panjwayi for stability to take hold for the first time in a generation?<br/><br/>Choose either side, and use your unique strengths against your opponent's weaknesses to determine who will win control of the symbolic home of the Taliban.<br/><br/>Designed by a soldier who fought there, Panjwayi is easy to learn, quick to play, and hard to master. Using elegant abstraction to simplify complex military operations, Panjwayi captures the frustration and feel of the deadly summer of 2008.<br/>As the Taliban say of their enemies, &quot;You have the watches, we have the time.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each player also has a unique Character card and starts with two Item cards, both of which can be used to change the flow of the gamw.<br/><br/>There is a total of 126 cards in the game.<br/><br/>35 of them are Character Cards featuring characters from both Dangan Ronpa and Dangan Ronpa 2, there are also 7 types of Role Cards (19 cards total), <br/>1. Alter Ego (Hope): Select 1 person each night, and you will be told if the person is Hope Side or Despair Side. Reveal your Role Card when you are killed. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)<br/>2. White (Hope): Similar to villager, no special characteristics. You win if the Blackened dies. (10 cards)<br/>3. Despair Disease Patient (Hope): Appears to others as being on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. (1 card)<br/>4. Monomi (Hope): Select 1 player to guard each night. If the Blackened targets the same player, you die in an explosion and they live on (effect similar to &quot;Knight&quot; role). You appear to be on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)<br/>5. Traitor (Despair): Can see who the Blackened (and other Traitors) are on the first night but the Blackened doesn't know who they are. They win if the Blackened wins. (1 card)<br/>6. Blackened (Despair): Select 1 player each night to attack (like a Werewolf). Reveal your role card when you are killed. You win if you commit a set number of murders and then survive until the next night. (1 card)<br/>7. Ultimate Despair (Despair?): Appears to be on Hope Side until somebody dies and appears to be on Despair Side thereafter. This role has a solo victory objective to be punished during the Class Trial. (1 card)<br/>19 types of item cards (49 total), 2 target cards (for use by black to indicate who to kill off) 16 Summary cards (explaining the game)<br/>3 blank character cards, 1 blank role card and 1 blank item card for your own creations.<br/>Inside would also contain a rule book explaining all the different modes and explanation of all the characters.<br/>There is also a template for you to record down your plays for the gamemasters usage.<br/><br/>",

Hiding in plain sight the boogeymen wake each night to drag a child into their realm under the bed to fears upon their fear. During the day they hide themselves behind the masks of their previous victims.<br/><br/>The children have to find out who these monsters are, but they are not entirely alone. In desperation the children can take comfort with what toys the orphanage has, and may draw abilities from the toys themselves. They can shine the light of the magic projector to discover the true identity of the target, shield themselves during the night with their teddy bear, save themselves from the monster in the closet by feeding it their limberjack or hide under the blanket to shield them from all danger, but beware not all toys were placed there for the benefit of the children. The boogeymen can bring their own sackcloth doll to throw off the magic projector and make others perceive an innocent child as a boogeyman.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the children can&rsquo;t always rely on toys being there. The orphanage is short, even with many children now missing, and so every round the kindly, but out of his depth, caretaker sees to it that what toys are available are taken back and then given out at random.<br/><br/>Orphanage of Fear uses the traditional day night cycle of Werewolf. During the night the Boogeymen choose a child to drag into their realm of existence, along with the toy they are holding, to feed, and during the day the entire group debates and argues about who the impostors are before nominating a child or children. If only one child is nominated they can drag another child with them to the closet door. The player with the most votes is sent into the closet and gets eaten, along with their toy, by the monster inside. The game continues until either all the boogeymen are eaten by the closet monster at which point the children win or there are an equal amount of children and boogeymen at which point the boogeymen win.<br/><br/>",

The aircraft entered service in smaller numbers with the air forces of Belgium, Sweden and Hungary. The Fiat CR.42 was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service as a fighter, and represented the epitome of the type. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft were Luigi Gorrini, Vito Rinaldi and Horst Gressler.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

Drink! brings all the fun of a game without slowing down the party.<br/><br/>The rules of Drink! are simple. Every player draws a card from the game box. On that card is an action or phrase they should watch for. Whenever someone does what the card says, the card holder commands that person to &ldquo;drink&rdquo; (take a sip of their beverage). They can wait a few seconds or trick people into performing their action, if they want to be cunning. If anyone can guess what the card says, they keep that card for the rest of the night and can still call out that rule. If they guess wrong, they must drink. If you lose a card, you get a new one. The winner is whoever has the most cards at the end of the party.<br/><br/>",

The D4Y was very fast, greatly appreciated quality for a dive&ndash;bomber, but some reliability problems with the engine slowed its use. The D4Y was also used with success as a reconnaissance aircraft and for kamikaze missions.<br/><br/>Yokosuka D4Y1 (Yokosuka Kokutai)<br/>Belonging to the famous Yokosuka Kokutai, this airplane led the defense of its homeland during the last months of war.<br/><br/>Yokosuka D4Y1 Suisei (Kokutai 121)<br/>Kokutai 121 fought during Battles of the Marianas, showing pride and courage, yet suffered great losses during the Battle for Peleliu.<br/><br/>Yokosuka D4Y3 Suisei (Kokutai 601)<br/>Kokutai 601 fought aggressively in the Battles for the Philippines, the largest carrier&ndash;to&ndash;carrier battle in WW2 and a turning point of the war.<br/><br/>Each WW2 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA crosscut is a 2x2 pattern of stones consisting of two diagonally adjacent black stones and two diagonally adjacent white stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you will face one of these situations:<br/><br/>a) There are no crosscuts on the board. In this case, you must place a stone of your color on an empty point such that it forms no crosscuts containing a stone that was placed or moved by the opponent on their latest turn. If there is no such placement available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. A passed turn is still a turn.<br/><br/>b) There are one or more crosscuts on the board. In this case, you must take a friendly stone from one of those crosscuts and place it on a different empty point where it doesn't create any other crosscuts. If no such point exists, the stone is simply removed from the board.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on their first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

The cards play well, but there were many mechanical problems that litter the set.  For instance, all realms in this booster have the back printed upside down, being very reminicent of many 1st edition realms.  Another key mistake they made is that all the wizards in the set had the wizard spell icon.  The other big thing this set gave Spellfire was Unarmed Combat Cards, in this case, only useable by heroes.  Also, we had the first artifacts that were attached not by world, but by champion type.  Overall, one of the better sets, with a fairly strong chase set.  Landmark Cards: Isle of the Ape (#1); Barrier Peaks (#7); The Lost City (#16); Bigby (#28); Vecna the Arch-lich (#34); The Keeper (#43); Intercession (#48); Tyranthraxus, the Possessing Spirit (#55); Volcanic Eruption (#64); Star Gems on Martek (#74-78); The Rahasia (#83); Haymaker (#92); Dream Team (c#1); Manshoon of the Zhentarim (c#6); Undead Regeneration (c#7); Runes of the Future (c#13); Gib Kcir (c#16); Dispel Psionics (c#17); and Boots of Fharanghn (c#21).<br/><br/>",

Each team earns revenue by launching games that match the preferences of active users in the market. The team with the most profit at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Team members draw cards that determine the progress of their products. Some cards provide the deliverables needed to develop a product. Other cards affect users and stakeholders, and have direct consequences on the progress of the products under development and the subsequent profits.<br/><br/>Teams take alternating turns over the course of the game. A turn consists of three steps:<br/><br/>1)    Take any three of the following possible actions:<br/><br/>     play a card<br/>     draw a set of tokens<br/>     move to a new tile<br/>     manage a stakeholder<br/>     conduct user research<br/>     give a card to a teammate<br/>     launch products<br/><br/><br/>As in real life, each action has dependencies and consequences.<br/><br/>2)    Draw two Design cards, which provide deliverables required for developing a Game. But beware: the Design card deck also contains &ldquo;End of the Month!&rdquo; cards that make time pass even faster!<br/><br/>3)    Draw one Change card, which might alter user preferences, displease project stakeholders, or throw other obstacles in your way!<br/><br/>To launch a Game (and cash in), a team must satisfy all of the required design specifications, complete the program code (by drawing Development Tokens), and obtain the CEO&rsquo;s endorsement.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard game designed for 4&ndash;6 players divided into 2 competing teams, the rulebook also includes an official 2&ndash;3 player variant.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a jungle out there!

Players assume the role of squad commanders, leading powerful mechs and drones into 1v1 battles and multiplayer skirmishes. All mech components are modular, granting players unparalleled flexibility in designing the perfect squad for the mission at hand. Thanks to an innovative initiative system, combat in Obsidian Protocol is fast-paced and brutal, and every turn offers new tactical choices on the path to victory.<br/>Obsidian Protocol has four different modular sectors. For instance, mecha (as the biggest and core modular sector, it has three kinds of mechas itself. you have different ways to control them.),hive mind, ship and army. Each modular sector can be a unique game. Players can also choose two or more modular sectors to play, which brings better game experience. The core parts of Obsidian Protocol are assembling and fighting. Different modular sectors have different ways of assembling. For example, players can use different parts to assemble a mecha or choose different types of arms, vehicles to form different armies to fight. After assembling, with the attribute the parts provide, players can create their own strategies, brings more fun to the game. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery.<br/>Different from most war-games, you can make only one action such as movement, melee combat, ranged combat not a series of actions in a round. We will use inch rulers to decide movement range, weapon range. Dices will be used to determine the damage.<br/>One game usually last 45-90 mins. To win, the players need to act as commanders and accomplish quests under the obstruction of the enemies with your squad or just kill them all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Talos Collapse is a strategy role playing board game that takes place in the fantasy world of Talos. The world is on the verge of collapse and the only safe place is its capital &ndash; Talos City. You are the leader bearing the noble mission of saving your people from perishing. You levy an army and advance towards Talos. Travelling through different realms you will meet hordes of hostile creatures and slay each and every enemy standing in the way of your cherished goal. In Talos, you will find an immense stronghold and will have to face an army of guards that surely won&rsquo;t  let you in. What should you do to them? You will have to defeat them, of course. Finally, drained by the numerous bloody battles, having most of your loyal troops you take over Talos City to only find another three conquerors and understand that only one will survive&hellip;<br/><br/>At the start, each player creates a hero by selecting one of 7 available classes and a set of basic skills. As the game progresses, you will learn new advanced skills. To do that, your hero will need to develop a certain type of a character and gain a required number of character points by choosing corresponding options when playing an Event Cards. At the same time, limited by a selected type of character, the player might have to face some very tough choices. For instance, choosing the &ldquo;Evil&rdquo; option in an Event Card obliges you to make an assault upon a fortress (which is a very uneasy task). This is where players might start asking themselves if they really are that evil? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be in their benefit to choose the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; option to avoid danger?  The choice is up to the player&hellip;<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s signature feature is the combat system. In the beginning of the battle, the player arranges his troops in his part of the battlefield. After that, the same arrangement is implemented by the creatures of the realm in which the combat is taking place. The player to the left plays for the creatures&rsquo; army. Striving towards their own victory, the players&rsquo; key task in such action will be to play for time and inflict maximal losses to the opponent. The battle process is a turn-by-turn attacks of the opponents&rsquo; units until a complete defeat or retreat of one of the armies. Smart tactics, clever manoeuvring and right order of actions is the key to winning the battle. After the battle is over, the player will have to restore and heal the troops injured in combat. Smart battle timing is also very important: if the fight takes too much time, it delays the players reaching Talos City, entering which sooner than other players is one of the games&rsquo; priorities.<br/><br/>The player needs to be well prepared to fight the Guards of Talos. The long way you have to make through the realms of the game is designed to prepare for victory by collecting and improving your skills, army, spells and artefacts. If you fail to develop your assets to a sufficient level there is a major risk that taking over Talos City will become an overwhelming task. Having a strong army but lacking resources to cast spells, the player will suffer too many casualties which will further lead to losing to other, better prepared, players. This diversity makes the game both complex and very interesting to play again and again.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Into the Dead is a competitive game (or can be played cooperatively) of strategy and risk-taking in which players take the roles of survivors and their loyal canine companions to navigate a landscape teeming with hordes of the undead. By gathering supplies, killing zombies, and reaching safety, players show their aptitude for surviving the apocalypse through the completion of missions and collection of survival points.<br/><br/>In more detail, players take turns acting as both the zombie horde and the survivors of the apocalypse. The winner is the player with the most survival points, and these are acquired by completing survivor missions, reaching safety, and increasing their zombie kill count. Once per round, a zombie master rolls dice to spawn and move the dead toward any survivors nearby. Then each survivor must weigh the choices of completing missions at personal risk, running toward safety, gathering supplies, and more. By using the cards from their starting hand and those acquired at the various supply drops on the board, they can increase their movement speed, lob grenades and fire weapons, and direct their trusty canine companion to attack the threats facing them. Dice rolls determine whether a nearby zombie will bite and the level of damage a weapon will deal, making the game a balance of risk and strategy.<br/><br/>Cooperative Play allows 2-4 Players to make the the run to the farm in the same way they would in the normal competitive mode but with the exception of working together with the other Survivors as opposed to against them. In Solo Play, a single Player can control from 1-4 Survivors during the run, taking on the run with a solo Survivor being the greatest challenge.<br/><br/>Survivors will be able to work together, planning strategies for Missions and trading Supply Cards with each other along the way. Additionally there might be a few other special ways Survivors will be able to aid each other during Co-Op that aren&rsquo;t normally available in the core version of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wan Wan Touch is a dexterity soccer game from Nigeria. The game is a version of a popular street soccer game where players can only touch/play the ball once. The game can be played by 2-4 players and takes between 30-60 minutes to play. The game is suitable for anyone from the age of 7 years and above.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>Any player who has last seen a soccer game begins the game by attacking any player; except when the game is in play. To begin any rounds, players must make sure the ball is on the Service Spot in front of their own post to attack. Then turn goes clockwise<br/><br/>In the boardgame, each of the up to 4 players defends their own cardboard goal as well as try to score other player. On a turn, a player flips the ball token forward by pressing a stick onto it (player MUST only touch/play the ball once at their turn)<br/><br/>Defending:<br/><br/>To defend, players place their playing stick in front of their own post to stop other players shot from entering the post. However, this can only be done when the ball is in their own &lsquo;Threat zone&rsquo; (This is marked by a box). If the ball is not in the threat zone, players cannot block their post.<br/><br/>Beginning a round:<br/><br/>1.    Once the game has begun, when a ball goes out of play/pitch, the player whose side it is that the ball went out of the pitch begins the round. <br/>2.    Any player who is scored begins the next round.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Players score by shooting the ball into any player&rsquo;s goal post.<br/><br/>Counting Scores:<br/>Each players has 5 score point to reach in other to win the game. When a player scores any other player, they move their token on Point 1. They continue to move their token as they score. They aim to score 5 points to win.<br/><br/>Point deduction/Conceding<br/><br/>Players loose a point if they are scored when their token are on the RED point mark (3,4,5). If they are on the WHITE point mark (1,2), they are not affected when they concede a goal.<br/><br/>Winner: <br/>The first player to successfully reach the Point 5 mark wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is both a collectible vinyl miniatures series and physical manipulation wargame. Each player builds his army (Green or Blue) based on a points limits, with each figures' points value based on the unit's rarity and value to the game. Each players' &quot;Prized Possession&quot; is placed on the gaming area, this represents the enemy's objective in the battle, traditionally this is a bowl of Kale (for the Blue player) and a bowl of Cheeseballs (for the Green player). Players then take turns placing their figures, with no figure being more than 2&quot; forward of the protected objective. Obstacles are then placed and the game can begin. Each player has a total of for actions per turn, with the first player taking all 4 actions, then the 2nd player goes. Actions consist of Marching and Shooting. To March the player places a move token next to the figure intended to move and flicks the token forward, after that the figure is moved up to the token. Shooting is similar, the Shoot token is placed and flicked toward the intended enemy target. Figures are captured or wounded based on these their characteristics and the characteristics of the shooing figure. Many of the rarer figures in this game have special skills and rules. Some of the figures are: Generals, Tankers, Flyers, Snipers, Privates and Paratroopers. The physical manipulation mechanism is reminiscent of Subbuteo.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players use multi-suited cards to win tricks, but winning too much too quickly can make one vulnerable to being purged when the regime changes. Players must anticipate purges to retain influence (won cards) and end on top. Each round takes about 15 minutes, with multiple rounds for optional extended play.<br/><br/>Based around the political turmoil of the French Revolution, Talleyrand is named after Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord, an incorrigible gambler and political schemer who managed to ride out the manifold purges and executions of the revolution, while maintaining multiple positions in many of the successive governments and lining his pockets. Always able to escape with his head and reputation (mostly) intact just prior to everything falling apart, Talleyrand held key roles during the reign of Louis XVI and the Revolutionary Government; he was at Napoleon's side when he toppled the Directorate and later when he declared himself Emperor, and even managed to survive Napoleon's downfall thereafter with a career intact in the restoration of the Monarchy &mdash; twice. Talleyrand was, above all, a survivor, and this game celebrates that trait.<br/> &mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

(Soundtracks are available on the publisher's website.)<br/><br/>Your goal is to co-operate to achieve a high score. On the beat, you play one of your four cards in hand to the end of the line, then draw a new card. If you miss playing on the beat, you'll play one fewer card total and probably miss out on points. Each card has five lines on it, so when placed together, they look like a music score. Sometimes a line is blank, sometimes it has 1-2 colored symbols on it, sometimes it has an X over the colored symbol, and sometimes the symbol has a scoring halo around it.<br/><br/>Once the music ends, you advance from the first card onward with a pawn, stopping whenever you hit a scoring halo. You then count backwards to see how many symbols of that color (shape) there are before you hit an X, with the symbol inside the halo also counting. Sometimes a halo has an &quot;x2&quot; mark to indicate that you double the score for that halo. Some cards consist of nothing more than a &quot;cancel&quot; symbol, which tells you to ignore Xs on either side of that card. Combine your cards to score lots of points, with anything higher than 100 being excellent!<br/><br/>",

For this purpose, a camera lens hole was cut in the fuselage under the observer&rsquo;s position. The airplane was also fitted to carry 100kg/220lbs of light bombs on the wings, giving it a wide range of missions. Released in early 1917, its usefulness meant the airplane was still in the front&ndash;line use at the end of the war, both on the Western Front and the Middle East. About 1150 were built by war&rsquo;s end<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand (4 different altitudes), and a specific deck of maneuver cards, and special cards depending of the model.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The civil war in Yemen has been going on since 2015; fought between the government, a rebellious faction, and their respective allies. Each group claims to be the legitimate government of Yemen. The fighting uses everything from World War 2 leftovers to modern ballistic missiles, with Saudi Arabian troops and US drone strikes helping the government and Iranian arms aiding the rebels.<br/><br/>Aden is a 2-player (but very solitaire friendly) hypothetical campaign for control of this southern Yemen port city, a combined company- and platoon-level game where each battle takes place over the course of one or more days. Difficult terrain splits the east and west of the city, combatants often retreat to avoid taking losses before surging back, and making the most of your scattered leadership is the key to resupplying your people and sustaining an offensive. Units activate with a unique dice system, and combat is centered on an add-or-subtract dice method reminiscent of Greg's Armageddon War.<br/><br/>The game remembers that Aden is a functioning city, with key points that will be strategic objectives in scenarios or have special combat effects. Destroy an enemy in sight of the international hotel where the media are staying? Extra victory points. Enemy is holed up near a major mosque? You cannot call artillery on them.<br/><br/>Aden includes:<br/>- an 11 x 17 inch map of the city.<br/>- seventy, LARGE 1 inch counters for the government, rebels, allies and status markers, <br/>- a 32-page rulebook with a six scenario campaign for control of the city, each player playing both sides to see who does it best.<br/><br/>",

Typically you need to move through the entire dungeon to finally face one of the Order of No Quarter, but not these wandering vagabonds! They'll attack you mid dungeon, depending on whether or not they are spawned from the Spawn Card Deck. Once they are spawned onto the board, you start drawing their cards like you would during a normal boss fight, once after every boss...the difference is that you'll also have to contend with the stage and enemies themselves as well! They will also be usable as end-of-the-dungeon Bosses.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's Kind of a Fun Story is a getting-to-know-you storytelling game for acquaintances or a revealing party game for friends you thought you already knew everything about. Players tell stories, compete to best fit card descriptions, and sometimes steal cards from one another, in a bid to get to know each other and win!<br/><br/>To begin, each player takes one 'Nope' card and two 'Hear Me Out' cards. The deck is then shuffled, placed in the center of the table, and ten 'Take a Chance' cards are placed beside it.<br/><br/>On your turn you draw a card and follow its instructions. There are four types of cards. The Story Cards are worth two points, while the others are all worth one.<br/><br/>When you draw a Story Card, you must answer the question on the card, such as 'what was your least favorite job?' or 'who was your arch-nemesis growing up?'. If for some reason you do not wish or do not have a story for the card, you may skip it and draw a new card. Another player may take a skipped card to answer on his turn rather than drawing a new one if he wishes.<br/><br/>If you are the only one who answered the Story Card, you place it in your score pile. However, a player may discard a 'Hear Me Out' card if she also wishes to tell a story for the prompt. Players then vote on who should win the card. If you have already used your 'Hear Me Out' cards, you may place a 'Take a Chance' card into your score pile instead, in order to answer another player's Story Card. These are worth negative one point.<br/><br/>The 'Left or Right' cards require you to decide which player on either side of you best fits the description on the card. The 'Point a Finger' card requires everyone to vote on who best fits the description. Finally, for the 'Everybody Answers' card, each player gives a brief answer to the prompt or question and then votes on who wins the card.<br/><br/>If, during a story, the topic ever veers into territory you are not comfortable with, you simply hold up your Nope Card, and the story immediately ends. There is no penalty and the current player simply draws a new card. Nope Cards are not meant to be used in any competitive fashion, and are simply there to keep everyone comfortable with the game content.<br/><br/>When a player wins a card they place it in their scoring pile. The first player to 7 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, are YOU ready to lay all your cards on the table?<br/><br/>The game contains 320 cards and an endless amount of stories to be shared.<br/><br/>Trying to keep this PG? All our decks are customizable with Rated-R cards that can be removed if your mom wants in on the fun. (Or keep them, your call).<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The stains are trying to increase by moving from one cloth to another. They have to compete with each other while trying to fight the washing machine and its washing order. In this story, each time the washing machine starts to rotate, the stains also create a competition to make a higher impact on the clothes. However, sometimes the washing machine and its detergent succeeds and can stop the stains.<br/>you play as a stain and your aim is to try to occupy more space in the washing machine and heavily penetrate into the clothes.<br/>In this game there are a series of rounds that is played in two phases:<br/><br/>     Players phase (Stains Phase)# Washing machine phase<br/><br/><br/>in phase one players can do one of these actions: <br/><br/>     importing a stain on clothes<br/>     moving existing stains on  clothes<br/>     play an Enzyme card<br/><br/><br/>and in phase two, one of the players roll the dice as the washing machine.<br/><br/>Besides competing with each other, each player should resist the washing machine and its tendency to clean the clothes.

In September 1946 the National Air Races were back, now under the leadership of the Cleveland Air Foundation. The Thompson Trophy races, however, were changed from those of the pre-war era. Gone were the racers built by private aircraft corporations or made by designer pilot craftsmen. In their places were war surplus fighter planes stripped of their armaments and modified for even more horsepower. The modified Corsairs, Air Cobras, Mustangs and Lightnings were flown almost exclusively by a younger generation of pilots groomed by wartime training and experience. With no limits and few rules, the post war Thompson Trophy races portended for those who sat in a brand new purpose-built grandstand even greater thrilling aerial spectacles than those witnessed seven years before.<br/><br/>Each copy of September&rsquo;s Corsairs is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    17x pilot cards<br/>&bull;    14x plane cards<br/>&bull;    14x die cut aircraft units<br/>&bull;    1x die cut 1946-1949 &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; unit<br/>&bull;    6x course balloon markers<br/>&bull;    One 8 page rules and scenario booklet<br/><br/>Please note that September' Eagles is required to play September's Corsairs.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

They took this gift and created the Z-Ball games, a tournament that shows the world of Dunion who the greatest team and winning glory and also retaining the cosmic Z-Ball until the next games.<br/><br/>Z-Ball is a 1 to 4 Player lightweight super fast-paced, competitive, deck constructor game with a quick dice chucking mechanic.<br/><br/>Captain your an Animal team in 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 Co-op and 3 player games. Racing to win the best of 3 games, with each game decided by scoring 5 Strikes before the opposing team.<br/><br/>Z-Ball also includes intelligent mechanical solo decks that provide a formidible challenge to the solo player. Each AI Deck having its own flavour and built-in strategy. AI Decks can also be used as a fellow player to create dynamic 3 player games.<br/><br/>The Season 1 Z-Ball boxed game contains 4 playable teams, the Blue Coast Raiders, Jade Forest Swayers, Goldskin Chargers and the Grey Lake Predators, as well as 3 AI Deck teams.<br/><br/>Players can construct their 25 card team decks from adding 5 characters from any of the Z-Ball teams or keeping the pre-set Z-Ball teams.  Each team is constructed from 5 Z-Ball characters, each elemental animal character brings 5 action cards each containing / showcasing elemental moves and tactics, some common and other more special action cards considered rare.<br/><br/>On your turn you simply draw 1 action card to your hand and play 1 action card onto the table / field.  Each action card could bring some Earthy Defence, slowing and stopping your opponent's Strikes, or it could Strategically be like Water allowing you to draw from your team deck - adding more avaiable actions to your team.<br/><br/>To win a Z-Ball game you need to Strike 5 times before your opponent or if one player runs out of cards the game ends, the one with the highest Strikes wins the game.  Each match of Z-Ball is played over the best of three games, with the potential of the Golden Strike game (if both players end on a draw after three games).<br/><br/>Striking is made by playing an action card that showcases the Strike / Fire icon symbol.  This allows the player to throw the Strike Dice into the custom Z-Ball Stadium (the beautifully illustrated inside of the top lid of the core game) and rolling a total result of a 6+.  To reinforce and increase the chances of Striking the player can add Electrical Focus by stacking it on the table before Striking - each icon adding +1 to the result, the your opponent could of been stacking a large amount of Defence which reduces the result by -1 for each icon. So are you feeling lucky rolling a 'Cheeky Six' or play it cool and have +5 Focus (roll a 1, I think I can do that!!).<br/><br/>One of the most unique aspects to Z-Ball is the 2 vs 2 co-op team games.  Playing and creating a flow with your team partner, adding Focus and passing through the Air to your team partner to smash in a powerful Strike!  With the AI decks you can even add in a 'quieter' partner allowing Z-Ball to be played even with 3 human players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These are the double boxes.<br/><br/>When you have a double box, you can choose the result of two dice thrown by any player and score it in your sheet.<br/><br/>The first player who mark his 5 double boxes first will be the winner, and the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Torch &amp; Blade is a pen and paper, solitaire, dungeon delving game set in a sword and sorcery world. You control intrepid adventurers braving dark and perilous dungeons in an attempt to bring back precious loot and complete arduous quests. The game can be played as a chronicle, an endless chronicle, or a short play campaign. No matter what game mode you choose, you will play several individual sessions, called acts.<br/><br/>During each act you will guide an adventurer through a randomly generated dungeon. The playing time for a single act, once you are familiar with the rules, should be between 60 and 120 minutes.<br/><br/>During a chronicle you will control several characters, alternating among them. At any point you will only have 2 to 4 active characters to pick from, and they will all either succumb or successfully retire and get replaced by new adventurers. A full chronicle can last anywhere between 24 and 192 acts, mostly falling around the middle of those extremes.<br/><br/>A short play campaign lets you complete a full campaign in a shorter time frame. You will control a single character until they either succumb or successfully retire. In this game mode there are no overarching legacy elements, apart from the progress made by your character. A short campaign lasts between 1 and 8 acts.<br/><br/>An endless chronicle lets you keep the legacy element of the standard chronicle, but it doesn't have a fixed end. You can keep creating new characters without end and keep playing until you get bored!<br/><br/>Designed for the 2021 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Buffalo Wings Expansion Kit expands coverage of the &quot;Winter War&quot; and &quot;Continuation War&quot; between Finland and the USSR, sometimes independent and then as part of WW2. The title comes from a plane -- the Brewster Buffalo -- which was woefully unsuccessful when used by US and British forces, but which the Finns adapted into a very useful fighter, which they nicknamed the &quot;Sky Pearl.&quot; (Yeah, they liked it a lot!)<br/><br/>The original Buffalo Wings issue game is popular because it serves as an 'intro' game to the entire &quot;Fighting Wings&quot; series -- games from J.D. Webster that are among the most popular air battle board games of all time. This expansion kit allows folks who want to get deeper and into more complexity with their games to do so while still using the intro rules found in the base Buffalo Wings game itself.<br/><br/>To that end, we've included more &quot;Aircraft Data Cards&quot; (the handy charts which capture everything that makes one plane different from another), plus the bombers in the expansion game now perform as individual planes (they are rather generic in the base game).<br/><br/>Best of all, the new map and ADC cards are still fully compatible with the entire Fighting Wings series of games!<br/><br/>",

Can they remove the pumpkins before Halloween ends?<br/><br/>(Washington, D.C.) The Capital Beltway is a fast way to transport goods around the U.S. capital... until the highway traffic gets out of control!<br/><br/>Halloween and Washington DC are another pair of Age of Steam maps created by the highly regarded Age of Steam expansion designer Alban Viard. Together with a new edition of The Giant Maps, this pair of maps was released as part of his annual Age of Steam map set in 2021, available for purchase directly from the website of his publication firm: AVStudioGames.com.<br/><br/>The Washington DC map (3-4 players), a revision of the expansion previously released on the reverse side of the Berlin Wall map in 2008, focuses on the Capital Beltway, I-495. While the interstate can allow for quick goods transportation, it also becomes increasingly clogged as the game progresses and eventually becomes nearly impassable. The rules are modified slightly from the original design, increasing the likelihood of &quot;Gridlocked&quot; interstate hexes earlier in the game.<br/><br/>The Halloween map (1 player), a new entry for the Age of Steam system, is a solitaire-only puzzle wherein the player wins if they can remove all pumpkins from the map. Pumpkins are delivered only with the help of witches. The rules provide for three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, and Difficult. In addition to the map, the player must supply 12 orange cubes (pumpkins) to play.<br/><br/>",

All combat is resolved by rolling a D6 per unit.  Units that move first receive fire first.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios and optional rules and advanced rules.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to create a border with pieces by combination of placement and movement so that your territory occupies more than half of the board. <br/>This game was inspired by Dale Walton&rsquo;s Make Muster (2019).<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>・Regular hexagonal board (91 hexes) 6hexes per side<br/>・Sufficient number of stones in two colors<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>A border is an unbroken group of same-colored pieces that connect non-adjacent sides of the board.<br/><br/>When the board is divided into two or more areas by the creation of your border, all but the area containing the most opponent pieces becomes your territory.<br/><br/>The player who has more than half of the board as his/her territory wins.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>First, one player places one piece of each of the two colors in the desired position. Next, the other player decides which color to play (Pie Rule). White is the first player.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The turn player can perform up to two actions that are consist of any combination and order of these actions: placing one of your pieces and moving one of your piece.<br/><br/>However, placement cannot be done twice in one turn. Also, a player cannot move a placed piece or move the same piece twice in the same turn.<br/><br/>When placing a piece, it must be at least one step away from all of your pieces and at least two steps away from all of your opponents' pieces.<br/><br/>You may skip one of the actions, but you may not pass an entire turn.<br/><br/>EMERGENCY FHASE<br/>If one player makes a border but fails to achieve the win condition, the game moves to the Emergency Phase. In this phase, players can place their pieces one step away from the opponent's stones and can move the same piece twice in the same turn player.<br/><br/>The Emergency Phase is canceled when there are no more borders on the board by moving a piece that forms a border.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Holland: Alternate Battles of the Bulge is a two-player alternative history wargame intended to investigate the operational parameters that would have been in place during the first eight days of fighting across northern Belgium and southeast Netherlands had Hitler decided to launch his massive counteroffensive toward Antwerp from there instead of the Ardennes. Such a German effort, if maximally successful, would likely have caused a three-to-four-month delay in the historic timeline of the Anglo-American advance into Germany.<br/><br/>In turn, that would have allowed Hitler to concentrate greater forces in Poland to seriously slow or defeat the Soviet offensive there in January, causing a similar delay in the Red Army&rsquo;s seizure of Berlin.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents 12 hours. Each hexagon on the map is three km (1.86 miles) from side to opposite side. The maneuver units for both sides are primarily divisions, but also include some separate brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. Allied air supremacy is (just as it was historically) hampered by the winter weather prevalent across the fighting front for most of the period covered by the game, and it is therefore represented only abstractly regarding those effects. This game is the second volume of a series of four games, the Alternative Battles of the Bulge Series. Each game uses a situationally adapted version of the same overall system to collectively cover all the various plans Hitler considered historically for his winter counteroffensive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(Multiple meeples cannot be in the same column.) <br/><br/><br/>If you select load and create words that are same as the previous player, only the person who originally created the word will be recognized and you will not be able to move your meeples.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>The game ends when three meeples arrive at the final destination point of 10 points, and the person with the most points win by adding up the points written in the space where each meeple is placed.<br/><br/><br/>         Contact Publisher<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)<br/>e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players select a tribe ( Humans, Elfs, Orks, Gnomes, Dwarves, Undead, Fire and Ice ) and assemble an army using different dice ( d4,d6,d8,d10 and d12 ). Dices will be the units that the player activates to move&nbsp;on the square grid board or attack the opponent's units. You start the game with all your dice set to it's highest value ( e.g a d6 starts on 6 ).<br/>During a standard game you have an army of 100 points - each die in your army uses points equal to its highest value - so 5 pieces of d10 will use 50 points.Each tribe consists of 5 cards, one for each type of dice - these cards define what actions you can take.<br/><br/>On a player's turn he/she activates one group of dice ( by tapping the related card ), and performs 2 actions with each dice: Move, Attack, Rest and Special Action paying the cost of activation by reducing the dice's value. Whenever a dice's value reaches zero it is removed from the board. You can not activate a group again until you have activated all of your groups.<br/>Some of the abilities will place status effects on a unit ( Bless, Curse, Burning, Shield, etc. ) - these are marked by putting colored discs under the dice.<br/><br/>You win the game by eliminating all of your opponents dice.<br/><br/>",

One by one Mythical Beings arose from the depths, created from one of the four Elements of Fire, Air, Earth or Water. The Mythical Beings prospered, in harmony with the Elements and each other. After eons, the Elements themselves became restless and chaotic, breaking the fine balance of the Island as each Element tried to conquer the others. The Mythical Beings were forced into hiding and elemental chaos reigned.<br/><br/>You are one of the Protectors, your task is to establish the balance of nature so the Mythical beings can return and thrive in harmony. In the end, only the most successful Protector can become the ultimate Guardian of the Island.<br/><br/>Sagnir is a tile laying game for 2 - 4 players, ages 14 and up. It can be played with younger players.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will draw Mythical Being cards that show a certain arrangement of the five different Landscape tiles.<br/><br/>The players&rsquo; aim is to arrange the Landscape tiles on the table to create the pattern shown on the Mythical Beings&rsquo; card. Then players need to move their pawn onto a tile of this pattern to activate the Mythical Being card, scoring poi9nts that are counted at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player has activated a certain number of Mythical Beings, according to the number of players. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>All Mythical Beings in the game are based on Icelandic &amp; Nordic folklore.

        "description": "Playing as a local stable boy who works in the Caravanserai, you have the privilege of being allowed into the restricted inner courtyard. This opens up a unique opportunity for you to make some money by doing your own business with the travellers, and acquiring the merchandise much sought after by local traders outside, who have no access to the area. Your starting resources are modest and you should use them wisely. Sometimes you will need to borrow money to carry out your actions, but supplying the local traders with the goods they want, you should earn enough to invest more, in addition to paying off your debt. The first player to accumulate 32 dirhams triggers the final round of the game, but the player with the most savings wins.<br/><br/>You have two optional actions per turn, and each must be preceded by a mandatory move along the courtyard path. A move can cover 1-3 spaces, and once in a turn you can chose to roll in the hope of making a longer move &ndash; but never longer than what you have rolled. Each space offers an action: you can borrow money from the money changers; buy, sell or exchange goods at the pavilions and merchants&rsquo; stalls; or trade goods directly with the travellers. However, there is a unique fountain in the centre of the courtyard, which rotates each time when certain transactions are made, and this can affect your income!<br/><br/>The local traders will give you minor or major orders for the goods they need; completing these orders will not only earn you money, but also help you pay off your debts, increase your savings and obtain ability cards that will give you additional benefits during or at the end of the game. It is worth completing as many major orders as you can, as the order cards are collectible and the sets are worth additional points.<br/><br/>Caravanserai is an easy-to-learn trading and resource management game that is fun for the whole family. It involves sufficient luck factor to help beginners catch up, but it is also a fairly strong strategic and tactical challenge.<br/><br/>Hungarian description:<br/><br/>A karav&aacute;nszer&aacute;j z&aacute;rt ter&uuml;let, oda nem juthatnak be k&iacute;v&uuml;lről a helyi kereskedők, pedig sz&iacute;vesen v&aacute;s&aacute;roln&aacute;nak a karav&aacute;nok &aacute;ltal sz&aacute;ll&iacute;tott mes&eacute;s port&eacute;k&aacute;b&oacute;l!

How do you keep everyone happy?<br/><br/>In Balconia, two players build an apartment complex, block by block, by filling a 5х5 grid. Each building block has four sides with different faces, and on a turn one player draws a token to determine which block to place, then chooses which two sides of the building block they might get and which two sides will be left to the opponent &mdash; then the other player decides where to place that block. They then swap roles for the next turn. Try your best to fulfill the conditions on the balconies facing you. Who will gain more points by game's end?<br/><br/>",

Players will take on the role of either Stalin or Trotsky, playing cards from a common display (plus one hidden card each) to gain control of &ldquo;issues,&rdquo; such as the NKVD, Politburo, and personal access to Lenin. Cards can also be played for specific historical events, and additional Region and Politician cards may enter play each round, favoring whichever player was able to control the relevant issue in the previous round. Victory can be achieved in three different ways: control of the Army, domination of the Party, or lasting Fame after Lenin&rsquo;s death. Players must therefore balance short-term gains towards each of these conditions with long-term bonuses from Regions and Politicians, while also ensuring that their opponent is not able to play the cards that will most benefit them. The result is a tense, fast-paced game where every card counts and you always have to stay one step ahead of your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ALLEGRA Grande, based on the traditional card game &bdquo;Golf&ldquo;, you want to keep the score in your display as low as possible.<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards numbered from -2 to 13. <br/>In each round, each player starts with 16 unknown cards facing down. The cards are placed in a grid of 4x4.<br/>Before the game starts, each player randomly turns around two cards. <br/>The left player from the dealer starts the game.<br/>In each turn, we draw 2 cards (either both from the drawing pile or both from the discard pile, or one from the discard pile and one from the drawing pile; here, the order mentioned is binding&mdash;first from the discard pile than from the drawing pile) and play them one after another. <br/>But if one player has just one closed card left in the display, he can just draw one card.<br/>We want to reduce the score in the display and/or clear rows or columns.<br/><br/>In ALLEGRA Grande, with its 4x4 (or even 4x5 with 2 players) display, one can clear 4 (or even 5) of the same cards in a row or in a column. Here, you must be careful how to place the cards because you must immediately clear a set of three cards as soon as they are next to each other in a row or column&mdash;even if you wanted to collect four cards and clear them later. <br/>To clear four cards, there first must be a gap between them, for example: &bdquo;3, 4, 3, 3&ldquo;. <br/>As soon as the 4 in this row is replaced with another 3, all four threes can (must) be immediately cleared. <br/>With 5 cards, it could look like this: &bdquo;3, 3, 4, 3, 3&ldquo;. Here it's the same; as soon as the 4 in this row is replaced with another 3, the complete row can (must) be cleared.<br/><br/>This makes chain reactions possible (as seen in the images). It is possible to clear all 16 cards through one chain reaction, but trying it is risky.<br/><br/>We have 3 action cards. The cards could be used as a normal card with just their value or can be activated to use their ability. <br/>The activation just works when the action card is drawn from the drawing pile and is immediately discarded in the same turn to the discard pile. (no activation when drawn from the discard pile or opened in the display!).<br/>After the action, one must open one closed card from the display; it could be any closed card.<br/><br/>The -2:<br/>It's the lowest card, and it's just 4 times in the deck. The -2 allows you to look secretly at all the closed cards in one row or column. Clearly, the next player can now draw this -2 from the discard pile, and he probably will.<br/><br/>The 5:<br/>It is the most common card; it is played 16 times in the deck. Here, one is allowed to look at one closed card secretly.<br/><br/>The 13: <br/>It's a little bit more special than the others. It is the highest card and 10 times in the deck. The action is to discard one open card from the display and replace it with one card from the drawing pile, and this card must stay closed. After that action, no closed card is allowed to be turned open. This is the only possible way to get one more closed card than before. For example in the end of the game when one player has just one closed card left and is just allowed to draw one card out of this reason he can with the 13 get back one more closed card and is allowed to draw 2 cards again.<br/><br/>The Joker:<br/>This card simply stands for every card, but not their actions. If the Joker is next to two identical cards, he immediately mimics them, and one must clear that set. For example &bdquo;6, J, 6, 1&ldquo; the Joker mimics the sixes next to him and you must clear the three cards. So be careful where to place the Joker.<br/><br/>The Swap: Swap 2 cards in your display: <br/>Instead of drawing two cards, one can also swap two cards in their own display. After that, one must open a closed card. Do it before it's too late.<br/><br/>The swap is also perfectly suitable to swap the Joker to the perfect place.<br/><br/>Sometimes one needs to do the so-called &bdquo;dodging&ldquo;. <br/>This allows you to replace a card two times at the same place on the display. This also allows you to &bdquo;defuse&ldquo; the action of an action card (especially the 13) when you place the action card first in the display and then again replace the action card with the other card. That means you are allowed to indirectly discard an action card and of course it just works as long as you can draw two cards.<br/><br/>Contrary to the first &bdquo;ALLEGRA&ldquo;, we play just in our own display (no column that belongs to a neighbor, and no knocking to switch a card with a player).<br/><br/>",

The vibrant setting draws inspiration from comic books, pulp books and all sorts of nostalgic sentiments while using a very modern and fast gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/>After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014, Pulp City: The Supreme Edition upgraded the game experience even more.<br/><br/>- Choose your team from 100+ unique Supremes (characters), there is very few restrictions standing in the way of building the team you love,<br/>- Recruit spandex vigilantes, aliens, robots, undead or dozens of other unlikely heroes and villains,<br/>- Test them in a Plot &amp; Agenda driven games!<br/><br/>Pulp City uses a couple of unique mechanics that make the games blockbuster:<br/><br/>- Roles: A lot like in the video games, each Supreme covers one (or more) battlefield role: from crucial Supports through Leaders, Blasters, Brawlers, Tanks and Infiltrators to mighty Powerhouses. Right composition of the team is the key to winning the games.<br/><br/>- Action Points management - a team shares the pool but the pool is rebuild each round based on the number of surviving Supremes and modified through presence of Support characters,<br/><br/>- Supremes stack dice thanks to the simple system of combat bonuses - winning the Opposed Roll is just a first step, the more high rolls you have, the more FX (think Special Effects in the movies) you cause. From simple extra Damage to hurling your opponent 15 inches back through the battlefield.<br/><br/>- Smart cards system: front of a card is used to recruit a Supreme, back is used during the game and has all of the information requiered - so you will never have to flip the rulebook.<br/><br/>Quickstart rules are available as a free download (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://pulp-city.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/QSGQRS_digitallyreadable.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://pulp-city.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/QSGQRS_digit...</a>), each miniature comes with a card that has all of the gameplay information (online store has all cards as pdfs for you to try out for free).<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pulp-city.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pulp-city.com</a><br/><br/>",

Be careful not to be the one to bring down the structure. This game requires reflection, concentration and skill.<br/><br/>In competition, the player who knocks down the structure loses.<br/>In co-operation, the goal is to go as far as possible.<br/><br/>The Collector's Edition include the base game, a wooden box and contains several expansions from the Kickstarter campaign as:<br/><br/>Torii Extension:<br/>Obviously, nothing should touch the Torii, neither the cables, nor the poles, nor the cats.<br/><br/>The Lazy Cats: <br/>Cats will land on the poles and prevent you from piling up<br/><br/>Tsunami expansion:<br/>Hanging cats must face dangerous waves that disturb their tranquility. When a red flag is raised, it means the neighborhood is ravaged and the cats must seek refuge in another safe district.<br/><br/>More Cats:<br/>Introduces new and more capricious cats: the calico cat, the red cat and the tabby cat.<br/><br/>",

The good spirits want to help the kid navigate the ever shifting rooms of the old house, where as the more sinister spirits are trying to sneakily lure them into the basement to never return...<br/><br/>Spirits of Carter Mansion is an 18 card game, where players navigate through the different rooms of the mansion, and use their unique effects to inch closer or further from their goal. In order to enter a room, you must convince the other players that your room is the best choice, and convince that you are in fact a good spirit. Beware of the treachery of the evil spirits trying to convert other players to their sinister ways, or their deceptive words, as they try and steer the neighbours child towards the basement.<br/><br/>Each turn players will play a card from their hand which represents a room for the child to travel into, each player then makes a case for why their room should be picked, and the chosen room is then navigated into. Evil Spirits will try and trick the group into journeying into the basement, whilst good spirits must try and maintain justice and level-headed thinking through the rooms.<br/><br/>The game ends once either victory condition is met, the Good players must travel, and retrieve the Soccer Ball, and return to the entrance, whilst the Evil team must journey into the Basement (however if the basement is entered with the Soccer Ball, the ball is lost in another room, and good gets another chance to continue!). If either Victory condition is met, all the players of that alignment win!<br/><br/>Spirits of Carter Mansion relies on clever bluffs, subtle team work, social deception and Luck for players to successfully navigate the perils of the haunted estate!<br/><br/>",

This expansion game, like all complete games and expansion games in the Advanced Tobruk System, uses the same ruleset from the system rulebook.  Gameplay is the same for all games and expansions.  It also comes with a Battlefield Walkaround booklet that points out landscape and terrain features specific to the game&rsquo;s maps, and a few game-specific rules to reflect the unique circumstances the title portrays.  Rules additions and changes are kept to a minimum allowing players to get started right away!<br/><br/>In ATS, players alternate using impulses to move and fire infantry squads, armored vehicles and Heavy Weapons, to fulfill or deny completion of a scenario&rsquo;s Victory Conditions.  Each scenario sets the victory conditions that one side must complete to be victorious, and the opposing player must prevent.  Draws are sometimes possible.  The counters have the overhead view of AFVs and vehicles debuted in wargaming with Avalon Hill&rsquo;s TOBRUK. Vehicles and guns come on 3/4&quot; counters, infantry on a 5/8&quot; counters, and status markers remain on 1/2&quot; counters.<br/><br/>Each new game or expansion in ATS drops you into a historical theater, and a specific locale within to give you an up close, and sometimes eyeball to eyeball perspective, with scenarios based or inspired by historical actions, all at 50 yards per hex.<br/><br/>This Expansion comes with 2 large historical linking maps covering the firefights near Ponyri Station, during the Battle of Kursk, 1943. Includes 18 scenarios on the 18th Panzer Division's assault against Soviet fortified positions.  Most scenarios play on one map.

With their superior technology and OmniMechs, they almost proved unstoppable, before their defeat at Tukayyid and its fifteen year truce. The year is 3070, and while the Truce of Tukayyid has expired, the Jihad rages. The Inner Sphere 'Mechs hastily upgraded with field modifications to counter the Clans are proving their worth, as notable pilots rise to become heroes and new, more time tested variants - sporting weapons right out of R&amp;D labs - make their presence felt, while the Clan OmniMechs continue to prove they are still the cutting edge of military technology.<br/><br/>Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrades fully updates this venerable product, fleshing out the history of each design, including notable MechWarriors/pilots, as well as providing fresh illustrations.

Spain declared war two days later, sending an ill-equipped fleet to the Caribbean to back up its four-centuries-old claim.<br/><br/>The fighting lasted less than four months, with Spain suffering a smashing defeat. It would take three-quarters of a century for Spanish democracy and constitutionalism to recover from the &quot;Disaster of '98.&quot; The United States, meanwhile, had entered the world stage as a Great Power, completely changing the outlook of Americans both at home and abroad.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Remember the Maine is a complete boxed game in the Great War at Sea game series, based on the Spanish-American naval war in the Caribbean Sea. There are 45 scenarios covering all the battles and operations that took place, and many that could have taken place. There are also battle scenarios for the actions in the Philippines. All of the pieces necessary to play the game are present: a 34 x 22-inch map of the central Caribbean basin, a 24 x 24-inch tactical map, 100 &quot;long&quot; double-sized ship pieces and 80 standard-sized pieces, all of them laser-cut and mounted.<br/><br/>",

Each turn players receive a variable number of cards, which can be historical events, troops or response cards, and they play them in alternate rounds until all pass or run out of cards.<br/>The cards are divided into two decks, one for the Christian kingdoms, and one for the Muslims &ldquo;Taifas&rdquo;, and each deck has a different style of play. The whole game revolves around the cards, there is no economy or armies on the map, it is a fast game with the complexity level of a eurogame, but at the same time with a lot of historical flavor. <br/>At the beginning of the game all players start with the same number of controlled areas, and at the end the one who controls more areas than the others wins.<br/>The game is based on &ldquo;Taifa: El juego de la reconquista&rdquo; (1998, Ludic and Diset) and has been developed by its same creators, although their game mechanisms, card-play and graphic design have been changed to the point that it is practically a different game.<br/>This game has a print &amp; play version at printandplay.games  and a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; version at The Game Crafter, both in English and Spanish.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The flashes of light from the explosions on Mars could be seen clearly in the night sky. Terror reigned on Earth as it became obvious that the solar system was under attack by an alien menace. If the general populace knew the true nature of the threat, their fears would have become almost incapacitating. Mars was under assault from alien beings who apparently have existed in the universe for trillions of years and have evolved over that period to become technologically superior to humans &ndash; as well as every other lifeform in the galaxy. This alien race had become known as the &ldquo;Fermitians&rdquo;, named after the astronomer Enrico Fermi and author of the Fermi Paradox. And that&rsquo;s because these beings were essentially the answer to the paradox. They brazenly demonstrated that the reason we have been unaware of other alien species for so long is simply because the Fermitians have been exterminating them! And next on their &ldquo;hit list&rdquo; is humanity and its entire solar system. Their initial target was the newly populated planet of Mars, but there are also rumors that a secondary alien invasion fleet has been secretly deployed to seize a celestial body much nearer and dearer to Earthlings &hellip; the Moon.<br/><br/>The only force capable of dealing with this threat is the famed 324th Volter Regiment, an elite fighting formation that was created just for this kind of mission. With the support of the Starcruiser &ldquo;Skybreach&rdquo;, the Volters have been sent to Mars and the Moon to stop the Fermitians from destroying these critically important places with their Doomsday Devices. Can you put an end to this threat, Commander? It&rsquo;s up to you&hellip;<br/><br/>Volters Lead the Way! is an exciting solitaire/cooperative game in which you, as the Commander of the 324th Volter Regiment, must lead your troops across the map board, defeat defending alien forces and stop the countdown that has been set in motion. If the Doomsday Device goes off, Mars and its colony settlements, or the Moon and its research stations, will be destroyed. Godspeed and good luck!<br/><br/>Volters Lead the Way! uses a unique &quot;push-your-luck&quot; game mechanic that drives the action and challenges you to balance risk and reward. The game is highly re-playable with two maps (Mars and the Moon), variable alien and terrain setups, nine types of alien units, four types of Volter units, customized Volter Companies and random events. The game includes three Scenarios each with three Difficulty Level options (Easy, Standard and Brutal). Though primarily a solitaire game, there are also 2-player and 3-player cooperative play options.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BATTLESWORN - BID FOR VICTORY FANTASY RULES<br/><br/>Bid for Victory!<br/><br/>BattleSworn is a simple set of rules for fantasy skirmish actions. Using a handful of miniatures in any scale and six-sided dice, two players can bring a game to a conclusion in around one hour. Table size is irrelevant. Distances are determined by terrain and by the position of enemies: no inches, no centimetres, no measuring sticks.<br/><br/>BattleSworn is not your typical &quot;I go, you go&quot; system. The ebb-and-flow of initiative is represented by a bidding mechanic. Players bid for initiative and reveal their bids at the same time. The lowest bidder acts first, with as many characters as the number of his bid. The highest bidder reacts with as many characters as the difference between bids.<br/><br/>Combat uses the same mechanic. Combatants roll a number of dice equal to the amount bid. Lower bids are resolved before higher bids. This forces players to take decisions: do I attack fast, sacrificing accuracy and power for speed, or do I let my opponent go first to hit him later with a harder blow?<br/><br/>Character profiles are not encumbered with detailed statistics.  They are defined by 14 classes (Fighter, Shooter, Sniper, Tank, Brute, Leader, Rogue, Warmage, Sorcerer, Healer, Cavalry, Flyer, Arquebusier, Rabble) each with its special traits. This allows you to play with minimal preparation.<br/><br/>BattleSworn includes two sample scenarios, a mini-bestiary, 28 sample forces, 15 spells, guidelines to adapt the rules to other genres, and 11 pages of play examples and FAQs.<br/><br/>This is a stand-alone game. No other purchases are necessary.<br/><br/>44 full-color pages, including table of contents, cover, play sheet and a one-page play summary.<br/><br/>",

The players take command of the armies of Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Louis XIV, Charles XII of Sweden, Tsar Peter the Great etc. <br/>The game is focused on command and control (or the lack of it in this period). The commander in chief and the wing commanders of the armies have a fixed number of opportunities per turn to try to give orders to units, depending on their abilities. Units without orders act with a kind of artificial intelligence depending on unit type and troop quality. For example, heavy cavalry with good morale will generally charge nearest enemy unit within sight. The presence of retreating or fleeing friendly units increase the chances that a given unit also will retreat/flee etc. Battlefield visibility decrease as the battle proceeds, so commanders and units will have an increasingly harder time to see each other.<br/>Optional figure scales and basing. Each battle have two sides, but several players can easily take the role of a wing commander each.<br/><br/>The rules provide army lists and optional rules that may be used to provide greater detail and a more tactical feel, as desired by the players. A separate, 98-page book on Armies of the War of the Spanish Succession and the Great Northern Wars has been published by the designers giving greatly detailed army lists along with additional new and optional rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Charlie's Year Redux (CYR) is the second of a set of four games covering the War of the Austrian Succession. From 1741 to 1748 this relatively unknown conflict raged on the continent of Europe. The primary land actions took place in three theatres: the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Charlie's Year covers the famous Jacobite Rising of 1745-46, which was instigated by the French, partly as a plot to topple the Georgian regime and partly as a ploy to divert the British Army from its operations in Flanders.<br/><br/>From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.<br/><br/>Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.<br/>The Game<br/><br/>Charlie's Year Redux is a remake. Like its predecessors, it is a two player strategy game. You play one of the royal contenders, with all of Scotland and England as your battleground. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike. But you also have command of any immediate battlefield, and must array your forces for battle, deciding when to employ the cavalry, when to release your reserves, or whether to launch a fearsome 'highland charge'. Technically CYR can be rated as an operational game for scale, but at that time there was no operational theory of war: individual regiments were temporarily banded into armies for a single campaign (often with no clear purpose beyond the seeking of glory by an aristocratic officer corps), and the army commander, or even the King himself, would be in charge on a battlefield still small enough to see his entire command.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of turns, each representing one month, and broken into a series of discrete 'operations' by your mobile forces, using garrisoned fortifications as bases and pivot-points. As the seasons change, a variety of weather conditions will plague your decision making. You have many sources of assistance, but their employment in this 'sideshow' may ruin your chances of victory elsewhere and thus lose you the game. The primary focus is on the campaign game, but there are also shorter historical scenarios covering portions of the Rising and even individual battles. The campaign game is quite flexible in its victory conditions, allowing you to experiment with different ideas for victory. There are also variant campaign rules.<br/><br/>",

The road to victory lies straight through the Lorraine, a stretch of land perfectly suited to mobile tank warfare. The American army and its allies have been steamrolling through France and the Low Countries. The end of the war seems so near with the Germans barely able to put up a fight. But the Allied advance has slowed as supplies and fuel become scarce. Furthermore, the Allied strategic and logistical focus has shifted to the north as Montgomery pushes for a bold attack to Arnhem. However, Patton won't play second fiddle to Monty's offensive and has stored up enough supplies to launch a small attack of his own along the Moselle River in the Lorraine. As an American company commander you are part of this offensive when you take your force from Blood, Guts, &amp; Glory into combat!<br/><br/>",

Finally, Agent Kallus is deadly up close and with a blaster and you can choose whether he appears with his signature J-19 Bo-Rifle in its blaster or staff forms.<br/><br/>While these features project Kallus' status as a relentless ISB agent, his unit card clearly outlines all of his abilities and his three signature command cards reflect his capacity to shape your strategy. Despite all of his skills, Kallus is still susceptible to sympathizing with his enemies, a weakness that is reflected in Flaw card included with this expansion.

        "description": "Today we have for you a wonderful gift &ndash; a free quest map for your adventure-hungry heroes crafted by our very own Doug Hopkins, designer on the HeroQuest Game System. This quest map will allow you to expand the HeroQuest experience while adding a few wrinkles that all you Zargons out there might enjoy.<br/><br/>We asked Doug about his inspiration for this map, and here is what he had to say:<br/><br/>&ldquo;We wanted to provide an opportunity for experienced heroes (who completed the core system quest book) to connect to our Kellar&rsquo;s Keep quest pack. Allowing them to tell the story of their journey to the Great Gate seemed like it could be a lot of fun. If our heroes want to pass through the World&rsquo;s End Mountains they will need to enter the Forsaken Tunnels of Xor-Xel in this dangerous quest. Are you up to the challenge? The quest is calling!&rdquo;<br/><br/>That means this mission is intended to be played after the core quest book. The heroes have braved Mentor&rsquo;s various tasks and have been awarded the title of &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; by the King, but new dangers have emerged! Mentor has informed the heroes that the King and what remains of his army have been trapped in the ancient dwarven stronghold of Kaba Karn, under siege by Zargon&rsquo;s forces. Time is of the essence if the heroes hope to save the King, and the only available entrance into Kaba Karn is the Forsaken Tunnels of Xor-Xel.<br/><br/>If the heroes are brave enough to face this challenge and are successful, then the story may naturally progress into the quests provided in the Kellar&rsquo;s Keep expansion! But keep in mind this is no easy feat, as the dark tunnels hold many Dread secrets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Further, a Global Administrative Map is also included that allows you to manage off-map movement.<br/><br/>AOI also includes a full counter sheet (280 units) that features the Ethiopian order-of-battle, all the Italian and British forces that operated in East Africa, as well as a complete AETO upgrade that includes 40 new types of aircraft, such as the Me-163 Comet, the Mig-3, the PBY Catalina, and the Gloster Meteor. AOI also includes new rules specifically for AETO, such as: combat veterans, naval night movement, mountain pass movement, fire bombing, German Flak, Manstein and more.<br/><br/>AOI also includes a map of Spain that adds additional Atlantic Ocean sea areas to AETO, and incorporates an entire Spanish Civil War scenario with a complete order-of-battle of Nationalist and Republican land, air and naval units. With AOI, AETO and APTO players can experience all of World War II. AOI has been designed to link with the AETO and APTO maps, or to be set-up alone as a scenario of the Ethiopian campaign.<br/><br/>This is an expansion kit for Advanced European Theater of Operations and requires that game for play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>To maintain their monopoly on the flow of information and technology across the vast reaches of space, the powerful organization known as ComStar waged a hidden war of assassination, sabotage and terrorism for more than two hundred years. Now, the Star League has been resurrected and ComStar will play a pivotal role in its continued survival... or its ultimate downfall.<br/><br/>BattleTech Field Manual: ComStar describes the military doctrine, traditions, tactics and battle histories of ComStar's military division, the Com Guards, and the Word of Blake splinter group. This book also provides complete information on the Free Rasalhague Republic and units of the new Star League, including the Eridani Light Horse and Clan Nova Cat, plus new equipment and 'Mechs unique to ComStar.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>In common with the rest of the BattleTech Field Manual series, this sourcebook provides an military-focussed overview of the entity on the cover - ComStar, in this case - as well as some new rules, equipment and 'Mechs associated with that fasion.<br/><br/>What makes the ComStar Field Manual unusual in comparison to the House and Clan Field Manuals is that it includes a lot of details on both the second Star League, and a number of entities associated with it, in addition to the Word of Blake schismatics. This allowed FASA to fold in the general updates for the Free Rasalhague Republic along with a couple of famous units associated with the old and new Star League as well as Clan Novacat, which had joined the new Star League. That makes this Field Manual more wide-ranging than the others that had published at the time.<br/><br/>This sourcebook is out of print, and unlike the older BattleTech: ComStar sourcebook, it hasn't been released in an electronic form by the current license holder.<br/><br/>",

The Klingon player must prevent at least half of the freighters from reaching their destination or else the Federation player wins.<br/><br/>This game also includes rules for tabletop play with miniatures on a hexless surface. This is provided as an alternative to the traditional hex-and-counter rules for those who prefer free-form movement.<br/><br/>",

Additional scenarios to augment the 16 included in the base game will be forthcoming later in the year.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>- 3 fully-mounted game boards (2 land, 1 coastal).<br/><br/>- 44 double-sided terrain hexes, illustrated to provide depth and dimension to the battlefield.<br/><br/>- 250 military units, including Native Warriors British, Canadian and American infantry, militia, artillery, naval units, and specialized unit markers.<br/><br/>- 100 card stands, allowing all units to &lsquo;stand to&rsquo;.

Players go through eight ages, from the ancient to medieval ages, to the modern age, and finally to the near future, until the player with most fame wins. The game features more than 300 unique cards with more than 200 distinct illustrations showcasing historical inventions, buildings, and wonders. Your goal is to acquire the most advantageous cards to advance different aspects of your civilization, like research, military, population, prosperity, and culture.<br/><br/>Millennia utilizes a mix of drafting, engine building, and set collection mechanisms, all while introducing a unique twist with the concept of obsolescence. As time progresses, acquired technology and building cards will become obsolete, lasting only one to four ages before they must be discarded. This feature allows for the pursuit of various strategies during gameplay and, combined with the vast array of buildings and wonders, variable setup, and rich thematic elements, creates an incredibly replayable experience.<br/><br/>Each age has several phases during which the players:<br/><br/><br/>     draft new technology cards from that specific era<br/>     acquire important buildings and famous wonders<br/>     simultaneously use their technologies and buildings to increase various aspects of their civilization<br/>     compare their military strength with that of their opponents to determine the strongest force<br/><br/><br/>After 8 ages, the player with most victory points is crowned the winner!<br/><br/>",

In this dice version of Quartz, the bet remains the same: Everyone must explore the mine and sell the mined crystals in the city at the end of the day. The dwarf who manages to collect the most money will have the mine all to himself.<br/><br/>The game is divided into six rounds. On their turn each player must:<br/>1. Mine a crystal:<br/>The player draws a crystal from the bag and places it on his cart.<br/>If the mined crystal is an unstable crystal, the player receives a<br/>reroll marker. There is no limit to the number of reroll tokens a player can have.<br/>2. Roll the dice:<br/>Each player has up to three dice rolls per turn. In the first, all 5 dice must be rolled. In the second and third they can reroll as many dice as they want. If it has a Reroll Marker, the player can discard it to perform an extra reroll.<br/>3. Perform actions:<br/>According to the result of the dice the player will be able to perform one or more actions. The more faces of the same action are available, the more efficient that action will be. Actions allow the player to mine more crystals, steal crystals, store crystals in the chest, or transfer unstable crystals to opponents.<br/><br/>At the end of the game everyone receives points according to the value of the crystals they have, being entitled to bonus points for collections of equal crystals. Each unstable crystal will penalize its owner 3 points less and the player with the fewest crystals in the chest loses 5 points.<br/><br/>",

Two players can play a side if desired. Players attempt to conquer locations on the game map. Each location has a corresponding tile which has information on what dice need to be rolled to conquer the tile somewhat similar to Age of Wars. Event cards are played for each player each turn which provide benefits and detriments to the player. There is also a strategic phase where the player can muster some garrisons for key locations making them harder to take. Although there are automatic victory conditions for capture of specified locations, victory is generally achieved by conquering a certain number of locations.<br/><br/>While the sides are somewhat evenly matched, as the game progresses the British player generally gains in strength and the French player must make defensive attacks and play for position. A special naval die for each side allows for potential naval moves each turn.<br/><br/>The game contains a 11 x 17 strategic map, 32 Location Tiles, 20 event cards, 32 game counters and 17 icon dice. The game allows  you to re-fight the struggle for North America between the British and the French.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each hex is 330 meters.&nbsp; Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night. &nbsp;The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.&nbsp; Unlike other games at this level the rules will not be massive.&nbsp;<br/><br/>This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement. &nbsp;These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.&nbsp; Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.&nbsp; Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.&nbsp; Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.&nbsp; Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).&nbsp;These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.&nbsp; They also effect targets differently. &nbsp; Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.&nbsp; Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.&nbsp; Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.&nbsp; The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle. &nbsp;<br/><br/>The amount of armor in this game is astonishing.&nbsp;Added to the other 2 games and it's tremendous. 11th Panzer has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.&nbsp; The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply (expressed in a different way than the other games). Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.&nbsp; Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.&nbsp; Lots of these casualties are minor in nature and both sides worked hard to get these wounded back to the front quickly.&nbsp; Air-Ground Attack can have a significant effect on the battle and both sides have a capability in the air to affect the battle.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The Germans were eventually bled white and forced to suspend Citadel.<br/>The German attack starts facing only the soft crust and outposts the Red Army put in place to alert them of the assault's start.&nbsp; The Germans have overwhelming numbers for this first phase of the battle and must utilize this advantage to make every kilometer of progress they can.  As the attack develops the Germans must generate fast movement through this area and break free into the tactical second echelon quickly to keep from getting bogged down.&nbsp; The Soviets must use terrain and their considerable obstacles to slow down and stop the Germans in their tracks.&nbsp; Stopping the Germans is going to be very hard. &nbsp; The Germans will find their force attrited slowly but surely over time and the Red Army will be slaughtered in the first few days and then settle down to the grind that was the battle.<br/><br/>11th Panzer - comes with (in Full Color):<br/><br/>        (2) Map Sections of the Pena River Area of Operations (maps N3 &amp; N4)<br/>        Supplemental Rules Specific to 11th Panzer<br/>        Order of Battle Cards<br/>        Task Organization Charts for Each Major German and Red Army Formation<br/>        Approximately 2000 Unit Counters and Markers<br/><br/><br/>",

After taking the full brunt of House Kurita's wrath, Jaime Wolf turned to Natasha Kerensky, the notorious Black Widow, for help in rebuilding his devastated mercenary unit. Under her ruthless command, the Dragoon's Black Widows returned to deadly form.<br/><br/>Now the entire Inner Sphere is locked in a life or death struggle against a seemingly invincible invader known as the Clans. Some say that only the Black Widow and her men could triumph against these invaders. But Natasha Kerensky no longer fights for the Inner Sphere. Now she fights for the glory of the Clans!<br/><br/>More Tales Of The Black Widow chronicles Natasha Kerensky's unit's service during the Marik Civil War, the War of '39, and her latest role with Clan Wolf. This scenario pack describes 16 of the Widow's most critical battles. Also included are detailed unit rosters, personnel files, and BattleMech readouts that give the truest picture yet of the Inner Sphere's most feared mercenary commander.&quot;<br/><br/>This scenario pack follows on from Tales Of The Black Widow Company and provides 19 assorted pre-prepared BattleTech scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Surrounded, the squad must work together in order to survive the onslaught and defeat the enemy forces' powerful general.<br/><br/>Each game round, enemy Minions will randomly enter the board, surrounding the heroes. The heroes will then have the opportunity to retaliate from within their enclosed squad spaces.  Using a limited number of actions each round, the heroes must balance properly positioning themselves within the squad, and utilizing their unique, damaging character skills to take down their foes.  As the game progresses, powerful Lieutenants will join the fray, bolstering the enemy ranks with deadly abilities. If the heroes can hold out long enough and defeat all of the Lieutenants, the General will have no choice but to confront the heroes for a final showdown!  If the players can defeat the General before time runs out, victory will be theirs!<br/> With 6 different heroes to choose from, players will have many options at their disposal when dealing with each encounter. Should the Combat Medic blast an enemy into your Demolitionist's well-placed mine?  Maybe your Sharpshooter should use their 'Eagle Eye' skill to spot an enemy right in front of your close-quarters Brawler?  With dice driven combat, Last Stand is sure to challenge your inner tactician and keep you on the edge of your seat with every roll!<br/><br/>Along with over a dozen different Minions and Lieutenants, Last Stand includes several powerful Generals to test your wits against:  The Watcher, The Beast, and The Firestarter. Each General possesses special mechanics that will force you to alter your strategy and change the way you approach each game.<br/><br/>Grab your friends, assemble the team, and take a stand!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cuba, January 1959. Fidel Castro&rsquo;s 26 July Movement rolls into Havana. Castro&rsquo;s fledgling government now aims to consolidate power and reform the country. But wealthy landowners&mdash;Terratenientes&mdash;are determined to maintain their grip on Cuba&rsquo;s agriculture. Former Directorio Revolucionario rebels and ousted members of Batista&rsquo;s regime regroup and unite as Bandidos in the Escambray Mountains. The DR&rsquo;s urban students relocate to Miami, where they plan subversive strikes against their homeland. Meanwhile, other Cuban exiles prepare a CIA-sponsored invasion....<br/><br/>Invierno Cubano is a 1-4 player expansion for Cuba Libre, Volume II in GMT&rsquo;s award-winning COIN Series. Picking up the action after the toppling of the Batista regime, Invierno Cubano offers four new asymmetrical factions vying for control of the island, a new deck, and a host of new options.<br/><br/>Invierno Cubano employs the core game system of Cuba Libre. More than a sequel, it adds exciting concepts to the COIN Series:<br/><br/>Leaders that facilitate Government actions.<br/>Soviet aid shipments to the Cold War hotbed.<br/>Competition among insurgent factions for US backing. <br/>Cross-faction recruitment to bolster the insurgency. <br/>Directorio ships for covert attacks and rescues. <br/>Amphibious invasion of the island by Brigade 2506 guerrillas. <br/>Reform events that alter conditions for each campaign. <br/>Masking cards that foster uncertainty.<br/>Structured negotiation for an additional path to victory.<br/>Invierno Cubano features an array of new Operations and Special Activities to explore: Deploy, Inform, Shakedown, Harvest, Unite, Campaign, Disobedience, Govern, Homestead, Rescue, and more. Like Cuba Libre, it includes a full solitaire system&mdash;a new suite of challenging Non-player opponents.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Until the Bitter End - US Airborne, a World War 2 wargame. This is the second game in the series and a print and play game for solitaire and two-players. This is a standalone game in my series of WW2 print and play games. You don't need to have played the first game - everything is included (you simply need to print it all out and need a regular six sided dice and a pencil).<br/><br/>The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and requires very little space.<br/><br/>A print and play WW2 wargame for two players and solitaire that takes around half an hour to setup and play.<br/><br/>The game sets a small squad of US Airborne against their German enemies in a series of small skirmish scenarios. The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.<br/><br/>The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the US Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the US Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).<br/><br/>The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.<br/><br/>The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.<br/><br/>Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. <br/>Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.<br/>Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.<br/><br/>Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points. These can be used to force the enemy to re-roll a dice against one of your Infantry Counters, but should you loose you will have less Bravery Points for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Solitaire Game<br/>The Solitaire takes the key gameplay from the two player game such as Combat Resolution and Movement etc and layers in specific Solitaire rules, AI for the opposing German forces and special Solitaire scenarios.<br/><br/>The Solitaire game features a full and simple AI to handle the opposing force, that will take you step-by-step to which order the enemy counters should be activated and their actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Big Band is a Vinyl expansion that continues to build on the base game of Vinyl and introduces the Window Display, Hits Chart, and a new way to form collections. Historically, 78s and 33s were competing formats and available to purchase in the record store. In BB, players will focus on collecting albums from two genres -- Swing and Jazz. Players will acquire albums in two different speeds from up to 8 different band leaders. With respect to speeds, there are benefits in collecting 78s since they are worth slightly more than the 33s. However, the 33s offer collection powers to entice players to collect them instead. Furthermore, the rules for collecting albums are stripped down to just matching the genres. However, players must visit the front counter in order to earn collection rewards. To turn in a collection, the player must represent each of the four instruments in one genre. Depending on how many matches there are in the attributes will dictate what type of collection reward they will earn. Play continues until all the albums have been placed into the store. The player with the most points, in the end, is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Outnumbered more than five to one, and with nowhere to run, the SNLF fought, nearly to the last man. Of the 2600 Naval Infantry sailors there, only 17 left the island alive, and all as prisoners of war. The Americans were destined to win&mdash;they had the numbers, the naval advantage, and the air advantage, and despite the heavy fortifications of the Japanese defenders, the outcome was never really in doubt.<br/><br/>Take command of IJN SNLF Sailors, and do your best to honor the Emperor as you fight to the last man. If you can&rsquo;t stop the American advance, you can at least make them pay in blood for every inch of Tarawa.

You have two of these under your control and share each one with a rival. You also have a secondary goal trying to bring &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; to the world. Working with and against your rivals you must prove to be the most powerful secret society in the world before the Era of Atlantis ends either in glory or in cataclysm.<br/><br/>This is an area-control and worker placement game with a unique twist. You control two nations with the lower-valued one counting for your score at game end. This means you will usually try to balance the two. You also share control of each one with another player, who has the same interest in the success of that nation as you do. Switching control of a nation is also possible, but difficult.<br/><br/>There are ways to score a few additional points for yourself only, such as with your remaining mystical energy or by fulfilling secret objectives.<br/><br/>The game is played over a variable number of rounds, with each player taking a turn per round. There are two main ways to gain new areas for your nation: militarily or politically. You can also expand your abilities by constructing buildings or acquiring powerful special actions. A nation will grow more successfully the better its two controlling players can cooperate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Avec Infini Regret III - French Wars of Religion, 1562 - 1598<br/>The battle of Moncontour, 1569<br/><br/>The Peace of Longjumeau, signed on 23 March 1568, ended the second Wars of Religion but was fragile. The royal power no longer trusted the prince of Cond&eacute;, leader of the Protestant party.  A few months after the signing, the Catholics attempted to capture the prince of Cond&eacute; and Admiral Coligny by surprise. The plot failed and the Protestant commanders reassembled with their armies and took refuge at La Rochelle.<br/>Thus began the campaign constituting the third War of Religion at the end of the summer of 1568. The objective of the Royal Army, commanded by the Duc of Anjou, future king Henry III, was to seize the Protestant towns between Charente and Dordogne. After a winter campaign marked by desertions on both sides, the Duc of Anjou claimed victory on 13 March 1569 at Jarnac when the prince of Cond&eacute; was cut down in cold blood while surrendering to a Catholic nobleman. Coligny succeeded him as commander of the Huguenot army. Despite this victory, Anjou was unsuccessful in capturing the city of Cognac. Furthermore, he didn&rsquo;t have enough troops to supply a garrison in the cities seized from the Protestants.<br/>On 25 June 1569, Admiral de Coligny took his revenge and defeated the Catholics at La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille where Strozzi, colonel general of the royal infantry, was taken prisoner. He then lay siege to Poitiers but was forced to abandon it after several weeks in order to confront the Catholic troops preparing to him from his rear bases.<br/><br/>On 3 October 1569, the two armies faced off near Moncontour.Gaspard de Coligny did not want to engage in battle, knowing he was outnumbered. However, German mercenaries among his troops were unhappy at not being paid and precipitated the movement. The Catholic troops were better prepared, greater in number and more heavily armed and easily pushed back the assault of the Protestants who were forced into a disorderly retreat.<br/>Although it barely lasted two hours, this battle resulted in between 6000 and 10.000 men dead or taken prisoner on the side of the Protestants compared to 1000 for the Catholics. The Swiss soldiers of the Royal Army spared no lansquenet in retaliation for La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>&bull; Two 59 x 41 cm maps  (one printed front and back)<br/>&bull; 216 die-cut counters and markers<br/>&bull; 1 rule book including scenarios<br/>&bull; 1 color player aid<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CO-OPS was imagined by three graduates of the special military school of Saint-Cyr (General Saint-Hillier class, 2015-2018). Designed as part of the simulation courses to provide a training tool for future section leaders, the game emphasizes cooperation between players against an enemy played by the game itself. Each player takes the lead of an infantry platoon, a tank platoon or a helicopter squadron of the French Army and you will all need to cooperate to win the battle against armed terrorist groups; close coordination between the different arms is the key to victory.<br/><br/>CO-OPS is based on simple mechanisms that can be explained in a few minutes, the depth of the game lies in the interactions between players. All players will have to get along and coordinate to conduct a complex joint operation, first to overcome the inevitable friction of battle and penetrate the fog of war... and then to triumph over the enemy.<br/><br/>Start by choosing one of the 10 scenarios, which can be played alone or as part of the campaigns, but you may as well invent one from scratch thanks to the wide variety of units provided in the game box and the modular terrain tiles that allow you to compose an infinite number of geographical situations. Then, each player chooses the section they will command (infantry, cavalry, helicopters) and composes it at their convenience, thanks to a very simple budget system. Time for action, now!<br/><br/>Every turn (about 15 minutes of real time), enemy units leave their bases and move automatically, via the squares of the game board (about 100 meters of real terrain), towards their objectives... or towards your closest units. When combat occurs, and it will, several parameters determine the chances of success for each side: detection capacity, weapon range, firepower, ability to take fire and of course the nature of the terrain. A simple dice roll determines the outcome of the battle, with fortune often smiling to the player who has given themselves the best chances. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by smartly combining them, you can increase the former while reducing the latter. The battle lasts for a long time, as a scenario can last up to 15 turns. Also, each player will have to regularly resupply their units, reinforce them to make up for losses, while keeping an eye on their morale level.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It allows the simulation of amphibious assaults, helicopter borne troops, precision weapons, modern MBTs and is current till 2010 with the current expansion.<br/><br/>The system emphasize tactics and terrain command and control. They pay attention to troop psychology, what is possible to do with the men who control the weapons, and how these men can be efficiently commanded. Infantry are essential and their tactics more varied. With the attached points values, this system can be used in conventions and competitions where players expect to have similarly-capable forces, even though their opponents may never have fought historically. A 1950's army, using the system's clever victory conditions, can take on the latest Western army.<br/><br/>",

Many of the longer conflicts are split into periods for more accuracy as units and tactics evolve.<br/>     Each conflict has a tailor-made aircraft and ordnance list for each faction, as well as accurate options for ground assets like SAM sites and AAA.<br/>     Flight plan &quot;bidding&quot; system: Players must write a flight plan before the game starts, indicating when aircraft will enter and leave the game. Will you try to get your ground attack aircraft in before the enemy fighters arrive? or wait until later? Will you send your fighters in early because you know the enemy will try to get their bombing done early?<br/>     Complete air environment: Ground assets like AAA, SAM sites and various radars are an important aspect of the game, allowing weapons like the AGM-88 HARM to have a use and for SEAD flights to have a purpose.<br/>     Pilots can be shot down, wounded, captured by enemy ground forces, picked up by on-call SAR helicopters, or make their way back to friendly lines on foot. Rescuing downed pilots is important for victory.<br/>     4 Mission types to fly: Combat Air Patrol, Strike, Combat Search and Rescue, and Close Air Support. CAS missions will see an active land battle being fought while you attempt to support friendlies.<br/>     Detailed yet simple rules for Naval Vessels and Submarines. Naval Vessels can launch and recover helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and could potentially be caught unprepared for combat...<br/>     Forward Air Controllers, Recon, AWACS, AEW and Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft all have a purpose in-game Campaign System provided so each game can have an effect on the next: Wiped out all the enemy SAM sites? I guess you won't need to focus on SEAD as much any more!<br/><br/><br/>Missile Threat is the culmination of 8 months of research and play-testing. Markers are provided for the various missiles, ground assets and ground forces, as well as naval vessel markers for the Falklands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But think carefully because Recruits will give you more choices to upgrade to but is then placed in your discard pile. Where Commandos give you only one choice they are placed on top of your draw deck.<br/><br/>",

Who shows the most valuable property wins the turn, earn the points on the cards and activate a special ability of the card category (vehicle, real estate, stuff, food). Every player tries to earn as many points as he can, but everybody has an own line of limit, and if he passes that point, he lives like a bourgeois, the men of state are arriving and he is kicked out of the game.

Deal the playing card deck evenly to each player; cards come in four suits, with values 2-5. In the first round, players discard two cards in their hand face down, then choose a card as their scoring suit and place it face down on the table. (In the second round, players each discard only one card, and in round three they discard no cards.)<br/><br/>Players then take turns playing a single card from their hand face up in one of the areas. Each area can hold at most five cards, and twice during a round a player can place a spotlight card under their played card to change this card to their secret scoring suit at the end of the round. Once all 18 cards have been played, players reveal their scoring suit. If these suits are identical, then each player scores only this single card, and cards played to areas are ignored. If these suits differ, then you calculate the strength of each suit in an area to determine which suit wins that area's points. Unless the area specifies otherwise, the suit with the highest sum wins the area &mdash; and if a player chose this suit, then they score the area card. All scored cards are placed to the side, out of play.<br/><br/>For rounds two and three, reshuffle all non-scored playing cards, lay out new area cards, then deal new hands to players. Whoever has scored the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>Spotlight includes a solo mode in which you play against the AI &quot;Light&quot;, attempting to win areas as Light plays down twice as many cards. How well will you be able to beat the automated system?<br/><br/>",

The initial scenarios supplied are between 3 and 5 turns (each turn is a game session).<br/><br/>During these sessions, in consecutive impulses and in a card driven system, the players take action with their powers to obtain victory points (which are the objectives that each power pursues).<br/><br/>Although there are economic and diplomatic actions, Ultima Ratio Regis is a military campaign game, so it is focused on the different naval or land campaigns that the powers carried out in the modern age to achieve their objectives.<br/><br/>The military system is very original (it covers half of the rules), and with it, we not only fight great land and naval battles, but also sieges and long land campaigns of erosion of the enemy.  The scale of play varies depending on where we have our military units, but to give us an idea, a western land unit represents approximately a whole regiment, and a naval squadron about 10 ships of line or between 30 and 50 galleys in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The game include a new system that prevents great uchronies, without over-directing the players.  In this way, the player with the most victory points accumulated between all his powers wins, that is, the one who has come closest to the objectives of the set of powers he is carrying.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&mdash;you may see that road darken&hellip; and then darken again.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.<br/><br/>The N&icirc;n-in-Eilph emphasizes the difficulties of making swift passage through the marsh with a series of quest stages featuring the Time X keyword that shuffle back into the quest deck if you can't fully complete them in time. Accordingly, it's vital to make swift progress through each Stage 2 and Stage 3, lest you find yourself in danger of threating out as your heroes begin to sink in the mire.<br/><br/>Rather than alter the quest structure in any significant way, The N&icirc;n-in-Eilph Nightmare Deck ratchets up the tension by introducing a number of effects that reinforce its central concept&mdash;your repeated cycling of quest stages. In Nightmare Mode, you don't just have to move from quest stage to quest stage, you have to do so while your staging area fills up with Creatures and locations that trigger disruptive Forced effects.<br/><br/>",

They also get a random chit specifying a particular racer as first or last place.<br/><br/>During the race itself, players influence the outcome of the races by playing from hands of ordinary playing cards to move raptors, and/or attack other raptors until the race is won.  Then players collect rewards according to their wagers.<br/><br/>Three races are run, and the overall winner is the bettor with the most money at the end.<br/><br/>The game is available either as rules only, in a kit with 6 velociraptor racers, or as a kit with the racers and a molded rubber track and winners' stand.  The rules contain all you need if you wish to make your own components, but the components themselves are excellent.<br/><br/>",

A cryptic clue for the phrase is then read to the players. (Sample from the box lid &ndash; Clue: Why did the tailor quit his job? Solution: Because it was habit forming.)<br/><br/>Each player or team, in turn, will choose two letters. The first letter chosen will give the opposing team a chance to guess if it appears anywhere in the solution, while the second will benefit the team who guessed it.<br/><br/>The team that solves the puzzle gets a prize card and plays the bonus game. In the bonus game, the letters are revealed by the game master in alphabetical order, and if the team gives the correct answer they win $10 for each unrevealed letter.<br/><br/>Most of the parts were recycled from Milton Bradley's 1975 adaptations of Wheel of Fortune.

Normally, each player controls one ship, but experienced players should be able to fly three or four ships without too much difficulty.<br/><br/>Astromachia is distinguished from other games in this genre by three features: fast, highly interactive play; realistic Newtonian movement; and a strong sense of three-dimensionality.<br/><br/>Players alternate taking very simple actions, such as maneuvering, angling shields, or firing a weapon. This prevents long waits for a chance to do something.<br/><br/>Movement follows Newton's laws of motion. A ship doesn't always move in the direction it is facing. Furthermore, if a ship gets going too fast in one direction, it has to turn around and fire its engines to slow down.<br/><br/>Astromachia is fully three-dimensional. Ships can fly at different altitudes, and can move up or down as easily as moving north, south, east, or west. (These directions are with reference to the local star system, not to a planet.) A ship can have any of 24 different orientations, and is damaged differently depending on whether the damage is coming from the fore, aft, port, starboard, dorsal, or ventral side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forgotten Heroes provides a complete package to allow you to recreate the Vietnam War.  The rules will work equally well for those who want to depict the early Search and Destroy days of the war against the VC and for those who want to recreate the desperate days of the 1975 collapse.  In general, the Vietnam War was fought at the company level, with the platoon of 2 - 4 squads (representing anywhere from 20 to over 40 men) being the basic maneuver element.  Previously, this scale has been neglect by most miniatures rules dealing with the Vietnam War, which have focused on the individual's perspective.  Forgotten Heroes enables the you to command a full infantry company (of 3 - 4 platoons) or more, and the accompanying assets, in a way no other Vietnam War era rules set has done before.  It is only in this Scale that the gamer can really recreate the village sweeps, helicopter insertions into hot LZs, assaults on bunker complexes, VC convoy ambushes, riverine actions, and fire base assaults, that typified the major actions of this conflict.<br/><br/>Forgotten Heroes includes rules for the unique aspects of the Vietnam War.  These rules include the following: VC/NVA tunnel systems, riverine craft, civilians, caches and stores, rules of engagement, booby traps, ground surveillance radar, command detonated mines, night combat effects, and many more.  Forgotten Heroes also includes special event cards that can be added to the normal sequence decks, such as Chieu Hoi, DiDi Mau, General Visits Front, Hearts and Minds, Media Circus, the dreaded FUBAR, and more.<br/><br/>Forgotten Heroes bas been designed to be as accessible as possible to both a newcomer to the Vietnam War and he gaming veteran.  The rules include information on the varied equipment used in the war and full TO&amp;Es for the US Army, US Marine Crops, ARVN, Australians, Viet Cong, and NVA.  Two introductory scenarios are included, as a bonus supplement, rules are provided for the First Indochina War including sequence decks, equipment and weapon lists, and TO&amp; Es for the French and Viet Minh.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",

However, these Mighty Midgets performed invaluable services, venturing out night after night to attack enemy naval, air and ground forces.  They operated in every major theater of the war, from the warm waters of the Pacific and the Mediterranean, to the frigid fjords of the Barents Sea.  This module contains 31 historical scenarios featuring small craft (American PT, German S boats, etc.), including interdependent scenarios in a campaign setting.  A special role-playing section has been included that allows players to take on the role of a squadron commander, creating battle plans that depend on the skill and morale levels of his crews for victory or defeat.<br/>    New data and modifications to the Command at Sea (CaS) game system (small craft damage, impulse movement, etc.) are introduced in this module.  To scale down the CaS system to a level that covers damage by light weapons as small as .30 and .50 caliber machine guns took some tinkering, but the scenario design team of Dave Schueler and Bill Madison, along with the rules/data team of Chris Carlson and Larry Bond were up to the challenge.  This module is a great addition to the CaS library and significantly expands the engagements that players can now re-create.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>-New rules for operating small ships<br/>-Thirty-one new scenarios<br/>-A Motor Torpedo Boat campaign<br/>-New data for small ships<br/>-Data for ships not presented in earlier modules<br/><br/>Note: This module is not a complete game in itself.

Then in June of 3057, growing political tensions among the fearsome invaders erupted in a bloody war of attrition. From the mountains of Colmar to the icy wastelands of Morges, the armies of these ancient enemies clashed in a dramatic duel to the death.<br/><br/>The Falcon and the Wolf is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the epic Trial of Refusal between the Wolf and Jade Falcon Clans described in the BattleTech novel Bred for War. Filled with historical notes and personal accounts of the Trial, game scenarios, and special Clan rules, The Falcon and the Wolf provides everything the BattleTech player needs to recreate the battles of this major intraClan conflict.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Although there are only 12 scenarios in this scenario pack, it was the first strictly Clan vs Clan scenario pack produced by FASA. While it doesn't add any new equipment or 'Mechs to the game, it does function as an update on the strengths and locations of the various units from the two Clans, which adds some utility to this sourcebook beyond the scenarios themselves.<br/><br/>This scenario pack is currently out of print, and isn't available from the current licence holder.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Perdition to King George! (PKG) is a study of two hypothetical events in the history of the Jacobite Movement: the plots to overthrow the Georgian regime of Britain by landing Swedish, or alternatively, Spanish troops in Britain.<br/><br/>The famous Swedish monarch, Charles XII, was sympathetic to the Jacobite Cause, and in the years 1717-1719 was not that far away, fighting the Danes in Norway. Rumours have it he was preparing a base of operations for an invasion of England or Scotland with 12,000 men; James Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, would be set up as a puppet king. In the event, Charles XII was killed in 1718 and the plots came to nothing, but what if he had not died?<br/><br/>With the death of the Last Viking, the Jacobites were forced to look for another backer, and found it in Spain, where the shifty Cardinal Alberoni was engineering a war against France that would ultimatey drag in the Empire and the English. (It should be noted that the Jacobites' traditional supporter, France, now under an insecure and anglophilic Regent, the Duc d'Orleans, was uninterested in helping them. Indeed, d'Orleans offered a brigade of French troops to help England stave off the threat of a new Spanish Armada!) In the event, the Armada was wrecked, but a small independent party of Jacobites and Spanish soldiers did land on Scotland's rugged west coast, even fighting a battle with loyalist troops before surrendering.<br/><br/>Either invasion could have succeeded. King George I of England took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. Furthermore, Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, and many in that country were unhappy. The Swedes and or the Spanish would be seen as liberators (the Swedes with the advantage of their Protestant faith, the Spanish with the advantage of closer ties to James Stuart, Scotland's &quot;true&quot; king).<br/><br/>",

Human raider bands created shell corporations to, at one and the same time, conceal and support their activities. Within the League, these methods were sometimes adapted to the local politics. The Vree Guild of Salvage, once a respectable institution, has become a front for several pirate groups. Several Brakiri corporations, seeing the value in having a small military force whose activities they could plausibly deny, are believed to have created whole dummy divisions supporting the activity of raiders in exchange for occasional &ldquo;favors&rdquo; from those raiders. In contrast, raiders operating out of Drazi and Centauri space continue to follow their centuries old traditions of working on the fringes of society where they have long been accepted, if disreputable, institutions.<br/><br/>",

Each round a random terrain card is revealed, such as mountains, winding roads, or cobbles.  These cause riders in play to fall behind based on their strength on that terrain, and also enable special cards to be played.  A player's turn each round consists of drawing cards into their hand and then playing cards to deploy riders, make breakaway attempts, attempt to chase down the breakaway, or impose mishaps like flat tires on opponents.  Within the simple and fast playing mechanics, the game enables players to deploy strategies familiar to cycling fans:  Climbers make valiant breakaway attempts in the mountains, sprinters attempt to hold on for the finish line dash, and domestiques attempt to support them both as their director sportifs shepherd the team toward victory.<br/><br/>The first edition of First to the Line is produced as a full-color deck of standard sized playing cards featuring hand drawn art.  It does not ship with a box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murder in the Dark is a parlor game played with 6 or more people.<br/><br/>Played in the dark, a randomly selected &quot;murderer&quot; attempts to commit at least one murder without being noticed.  For, if he's noticed, the (also randomly selected) detective may have enough clues to lead to a proper accusation.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>First, establish the play area. Usually this is played in a house, but it can be played anywhere that is dark enough.  You will want to establish areas that are off limits if any.<br/><br/>Prepare a deck of cards, one per player.  The player who secretly, and randomly, selects the ace of spades is the murderer.  The one that selects the King is the detective. All others are civilians.<br/><br/>Once these cards are secretly looked at, and replaced, a countdown is done, and the lights are turned out.<br/><br/>At this point all players may wonder about freely. Some may hide, some may go out looking for evidence.  As the murderer, you may walk up to someone and say &quot;You're dead&quot;.  Once they've heard this they're dead, but they may also scream before they've been killed.  A &quot;dead body&quot; can be lead wherever the murderer would like to place them, and they must stay there until the end of this phase.<br/><br/>One may also, regardless of the role, touch someone and ask &quot;are you dead?&quot;.  This is the only time a dead person may speak, &quot;yes&quot; they would say.  At this point &quot;body body body!&quot; is yelled.  Someone turns on the lights, and now we try to discover who the murderer was.<br/><br/>All gather in a common area. Those who are dead indicate as such, and where they were found is established.  It is best for the dead to sit away from the main area.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the dead not speak at all, or give any indication who killed them.<br/><br/>If the detective has been killed, then the murderer has won.  Otherwise, the detective will start asking questions of the living.  Some play that the detective may only ask &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions.  The murderer may lie about anything, and also make false accusations.  Once the detective has an idea who the murderer is, they formally accuse them, the murderer may not lie at this point.<br/><br/>If they're wrong, the lights go back out, and play continues.  The dead are still dead. But, of course, now the murderer knows the detective's identity.<br/><br/>If they're right, the murderer has lost.<br/><br/>ALTERNATE PLAY: Some play with more than one detective, which is a good idea if the group gets above 8.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 43AD Aulus Plautius led the Roman legions to the edge of the known world: to the mysterious land of the Britons. TheEmperor Claudius demanded a victory, and what better way of doing it than to bring this savage nation under the Roman yoke.<br/><br/>Rome commanded huge armies of professional soldiers with the infrastructure needed to feed, transport, equip and command them. Opposing this mighty military machine was a mere patchwork of tribes and wild barbarian warriors. Refusing to yield to the conquerors, one man emerged as the champion of the Britons: Caractacus! Defeated in open battle, Caractacus turned to guerilla warfare: raiding and ambushing enemy troops on the march. No Roman could defeat him; in the end it was treachery that overcame the Briton&rsquo;s greatest champion: the treachery of Queen Cartimadua of the Brigantes.<br/><br/>It was another Queen of the Britons who, ten years later, led the greatest rebellion of all against Roman rule: Boudica, Queen of the Iceni. Years of resentment and oppression boiled over into a war that almost drove the Romans from Britain altogether, burning London and humbling even the mighty legions.<br/><br/>This then is the story of the Roman invasion of Britain, from the Claudian Conquest and wars of Caractacus until the defeat of Boudica and the destruction of the druids upon Mona. Included in this supplement is a map-based campaign game recreating the invasion, as well as historical scenarios covering the wars of Caractacus and the Boudican revolt.<br/><br/>A copy of the Hail Caesar rulebook is required to use this supplement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take the role of a god in a friendly competition to reach the Glory goal set by the crowd, directing their champion in a wide array of arena-style games: Classics like King of the Hill, new modes like Shrine of the Wind, all played out via a simple rock-paper scissors mechanic with direct conflict resolved by a simple die roll without player elimination and the arenas sorted into easy-to-grasp zones.<br/><br/>The game features three different modes: Basic, designed for new or young players and quicker, simpler gameplay; Advanced, a more strategic mode where each player truly takes on the role of a God with resource management and asymmetric powers to twist the fates of their pawns in the arena; and Intermediate, which introduces the Advanced mode concepts and the active role of the player as one of the all-new pantheon of Gods in the Cauldron!<br/><br/>As part of the mission of Civilized Animal Productions to emphasize the role of games not just as a way to build relationships, relax, and have fun but also to teach the young, Cauldron of the Gods offers plenty of opportunity to discuss history and culture in the form of the Gods, emphasize sportsmanship by eliminating the other players as 'enemies' by using a system of proxy conflict and painting the game as a competition, and help curb cheating or disengagement by using a directly personal approach to conflicts between players and adopting a story-like, cinematic expression of the actual fighting. The game has frequent moments of tension between peaceable moments, which can be used to defuse negative behaviors and infuse positive approaches without interrupting the flow of the game. The Advanced and Intermediate modes of play are more complicated and this may be daunting to the younger range of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In May of 1940 the German army invaded Holland, Belgium and France.  In a matter of a few weeks they rolled up the combined armies of Belgium, France and Great Britain.  The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) and other nearby Allied forces were forced to retreat toward the French coast, resulting in about 400,000 men being surrounded near the town of Dunkirk. Rescue operations commenced to evacuate these forces to England and Winston Churchill, the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, was hopeful that perhaps 30,000 men could be rescued from the trap.  Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay was put in charge of &ldquo;Operation Dynamo&rdquo;, the goal of which was to send ships of all sizes and shapes to evacuate these beleaguered soldiers from the beaches of France and Belgium.  Through skill, efficient planning and poor German coordination (along with some fortuitous luck), the operation was able to rescue an incredible 330,000 men from the pocket. A true military miracle had been performed and by doing so, the future of the Second World War was forever altered.<br/><br/>Miracle at Dunkerque is essentially a solitaire game, but also includes a two-player option. It is meant to recreate the tense situation within the Dunkirk perimeter during those last eight days in May and June 1940.  The game design aims to capture the spirit of the difficult decision-making challenges faced by Allied commanders as they attempted to extricate the remnants of Britain&rsquo;s last field army from certain capture or death. Historically-based Event Cards drive the action and create varying circumstances each turn. The besieging German forces (army, air and naval units) are controlled by these cards, which are specifically designed to place constant pressure on the player. Allied Player Actions must be allocated each turn for the defense of the perimeter, the creation of evacuee units and the loading of these evacuees from the beaches and moles to available ships and then sailed onward to the safety of England.  You obviously cannot save all the Allied units, so you must choose who stays to fight and who shall attempt to escape in order to continue the struggle against the Nazis another day.<br/><br/>Miracle at Dunkerque is designed by Hermann Luttmann and developed by Paul Fish. Chris Hansen provides additional development and playtesting support. This is the same team that put together the popular game, A Spoiled Victory. However, Miracle at Dunkerque represents a significant enhancement and expansion of that original design concept. The map is more extensive, the player now controls actual naval units that travel back and forth across the English Channel (hopefully loaded with evacuees), more combat units are provided to both sides and the air campaign is now represented. And of course there is the priceless added value of the incredible Legion Wargames production team. But just as importantly, the game system has been honed and polished so that despite the extra detail and chrome, this larger, deluxe edition of the game will play just as quickly as the original did.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the Miracle at Dunkerque game design is to provide a different kind of gaming experience for the player &ndash; one that is both an evacuation management game and a tough, nail-biting perimeter defense and fighting withdrawal wargame. In any case, we hope that you find it a challenging, unique and fun game that gives you the feel for the nearly impossible position in which the Allied troops found themselves and the true extent of the miracle that occurred on the beaches of France that spring of 1940.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Darkness looms and your master is the only one who can banish it. It will take him 4 days. You, his apprentices, must defend him till he has finished casting his spell or be forever plunged into darkness. Your only hope is to build the powerful arcane defenses handed down to you by your master; Powerful towers. Time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Real Time Tower Defense is a real time co-operative boardgame for 2-4 players that plays in under 60 minutes. In what is a true tower defense game, players (the Apprentices) build towers to defend their base from the hordes of mindless monsters besieging them and survive 4 &ldquo;Days&rdquo; (Having at least 1 Team Health left without going below 1 at any point during the game). The game is played in real time, increasing the tension, giving players just enough time to do what they need to without overwhelming them. The game is run to a sound track which prompts players through the game (much like Space Alert or Escape but somewhere in between). There is a break between each &ldquo;Day&rdquo; giving players time to plan for the next while the difficulty of the game increases. Players also gather resources and build their towers in real time using a sand timer, meaning there are two aspects of the game competing for attention. Forget about one of these aspects and you will lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Players play the role of gold miners that have arrived in Coloma, Montana in 1848 upon hearing of the chance discovery of gold in the surrounding area. As one of the first prospectors to arrive you have a head start on the swarm of fortune seekers heading west and a great opportunity to become some of the biggest Gold Mining Tycoons in America!<br/><br/>During the early stages of the game the players have no workers and must Placer Mine the rivers by themselves, panning for small deposits of gold. By the end of the game the players may have built a street of buildings in the town of Coloma funded by a successful gold mining operation in the mountains, employing a team of hopeful workers to produce dozens of gold bars and amassing a fortune!<br/><br/>What makes the game unique is the mechanic that allows players to simulate gold panning using the game box and the double sided 'Alluvium' chits.<br/><br/>",

Navy: Plan Blue, Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Gray looks at naval operations in the Second War of the Rebellion as the outnumbered Confederate States Navy along with its British, Canadian and Imperial Mexican allies battles the much larger Union fleet.<br/><br/>In Plan Blue, we covered the early months of the war that followed the Confederacy&rsquo;s surprising declaration of war against the United States.  U.S. Navy Plan Gray sees action taking place in both the North Atlantic theater (on the map from U.S. Navy Plan Red) and in the Caribbean (on the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold). The Confederates have managed to keep their communications to Britain open, but now the North threatens the economically-vulnerable southern flank of the Confederate Empire in places like Cuba, Santo Domingo and Panama.<br/><br/>The Union fleet adds powerful new warships: additional members of the New York, Nevada and Pennsylvania classes, fast battle cruisers, torpedo battleships (actually proposed in the real world!), some obsolete torpedo rams (the proposed improved version of the useless Katahdin), and the &quot;small battleship&quot; alternative armed with four 16-inch guns (also a real proposal).<br/><br/>The economically-weaker Confederacy tries to even things up with deadly but fragile torpedo cruisers and some small coast defense ships. The Imperial Mexican Navy is there to help out, with a dreadnought and some other foreign-built ships. And there are small contingents from the minor Caribbean powers, Denmark and the Netherlands.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Gray is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened. It is not a complete game: Ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Red, U.S. Navy Plan Gold, Jutland, C.S. Navy: Plan Blue and Confederate States Navy is necessary to play all of the ten scenarios included.<br/><br/>Plan Gray includes 80 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 60 &quot;long&quot; pieces representing major warships and 20 square ones representing smaller craft.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In late July of 1985, two months before the dramatic events depicted in America Conquered, a brief but bloody and consequential war was fought: The Texan War of Independence. It marked the first time in 120 years, since the Civil War, that Americans took up arms against each other.<br/><br/>The circumstances were desperate. The United States had been struck by nuclear weapons. Many cities&mdash;Washington, D.C., New York, Los Angeles and others&mdash;had been annihilated, but none in Texas. Texas stood strong. Initially, Governor White of Texas sent convoys of relief supplies to the imperiled areas of the country, but soon learned that the convoys had been intercepted by a skilled and tactful, but unknown, enemy. President Saunders, upset that Texas would withhold aid to the rest of the country, sent military forces to Texas to intimidate its single-minded Governor in to resuming the flow of aid. Governor White responded by sending the Texas National Guard to the border, to meet and stop them.<br/><br/>As these unnatural enemies fought against one another, like brother against brother, a new threat loomed. Both Texas and the United States itself needed to confront the post-nuclear world. They could do it independently or together.<br/><br/>The Texan War of Independence contains four gripping scenarios. Forty new counters bring four formations of Texans to the front lines. The fearless Texans ride toward all enemies in Abrams and M60-A3 tanks, and their well-armed infantry are highly mobile, with plenty of M-113s and Dragon support weapons at hand. Texas had once been its own republic. In the Texan War of Independence you&rsquo;ll find out if it happens again.<br/><br/>The Texan War of Independence is a World at War series expansion module; to play it, you will need to own America Conquered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nuna Aranway is a board game for 2-4 people where each player controls an 'ayllu' (quechua for 'family') of the ancient Andes, in the context of the Chav&iacute;n culture. The ayllu of a player is represented by tokens, which are his or her character tokens.<br/><br/>The game consists of 10 rounds, which stage the four seasons of one year: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In each round, players designate one action for each character token of his or her ayllu. The actions available for a character of a given ayllu are indicated in the general board (a board shared by all players) and in its player's personal board (a board for that ayllu only).<br/><br/>Through the actions decided by each player, an 'ayllu' obtains enough food for each season, plays the cards in its player's hand -which develop technologies and new traditions-, and specializes artisans, warriors or holy priests of Wari, the god-demon of Chav&iacute;n. Specializing a character token improves and unlocks certain actions. Players may attack one another -warriors are good at this-, or even force others into hunger through a time manipulation known as Intihuatana (to tie the Sun), which is available to priests only. Artisans are the only characters able to build advanced structures and draw new cards, while regular characters are the only that can fish or plant new crops.<br/><br/>When the four seasons of the game end, the player with the highest &quot;Development Score&quot; wins. This score is increased by cultural (construction and tradition cards), spiritual (nuna points) and military development (control points) of each ayllu, and is decreased due to hunger.<br/><br/>",

All the tiles are common and the information is always in view of all players.<br/><br/>The rest is cunning, collaboration, debate, ... and a lot more head-scratching than you might think.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Inspirado en series como &ldquo;Dexter&rdquo; o &ldquo;Mentes Criminales&rdquo;, Sequens118 es un juego de detectives y asesinos que te sumerge en una trama de suspense policial, propia del cine negro.<br/>Buscando crear el ambiente de este tipo de series, la tensi&oacute;n aumenta a medida que el cerco policial va acorralando a los asesinos.<br/><br/>El juego consiste en capturar el mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas, siempre que &eacute;stas tengan relaci&oacute;n con el personaje que haya elegido cada jugador, cuidando de no dar demasiadas pistas para que el resto de jugadores no puedan descubrirlo.<br/><br/>Pudiendo alternar entre el rol de asesino y el de detective en todo momento, la tensi&oacute;n est&aacute; asegurada hasta el final, incluso habiendo sido descubierto.<br/><br/>Permite partidas desde 2 a 8 jugadores. Todas las fichas son comunes y la informaci&oacute;n siempre se encuentra a vista de todos los jugadores.<br/><br/>El resto es picaresca, colaboraci&oacute;n, debates,&hellip; y es mucho m&aacute;s de darle a la cabeza de lo que aparenta.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Home Designers is a competitive game that trains memory, insight and imagination. Experience the role of designers who build dream houses for demanding clients. The one who is best able to meet their wishes and at the same time meet the general requirements for the quality of housing will become the winner.<br/><br/>Each player receives their land on which they try to build the best house. The first phase of the game consists in drafting (selecting) rooms (1 room = 1 building). The second phase in assembling the rooms together. Everything is shown in a top view, as a ground plan. The client is always a family member common to all players. 1 family member = 1 card. Each member of the family has three different requirements that players will earn points for.<br/><br/>Home Designers is a family game of medium difficulty. Rules are not complicated, but building a good living can be challenging.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The maps should be printed on 12 x 18 inch paper to produce an 11 x 17 inch map.***<br/><br/>&quot;Mind the Gap&quot; depicts a never fought 1979 engagement in the Fulda Gap using Jim Day's and GMT&rsquo;s MBT Game pitting a reinforced US Armored Cavalry Troop from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment &ldquo;The Black Horse&rdquo; against a reinforced Motorized Rifle Battalion equipped with BMP-2 and T-64BV Tanks.<br/><br/>The scenario reflects my experience as a Platoon Leader in the gap as a tank and armored cavalry platoon leader and troop XO  in the 1st Squadron, 11th ACR stationed in Fulda from January 1977 &ndash; December 1979.  The game is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit.  The actual fight was not; we had a healthy respect for the quantity, if not the quality, of the enemy.<br/><br/>To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game.  The expansion includes a new map of four 11 x 17 inch map sheets scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game).  The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.<br/><br/>The Scenario Briefing, a B Troop and Soviet Battle Books with deployment instructions, and alternate order of battle listings, a planning map and terrain key are downloadable from the files section.<br/><br/>Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders.  A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.<br/><br/>Mind the Gap can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 6 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 6 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.<br/><br/>The gamer can also simulate a 1978 engagement by downloading a Vehicle Card for the M60A1 tank from <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146576/official-bonus-data-card-um-13b-m60a1-aos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146576/official-bonus-dat...</a> and by deleting the M901 Improved TOW vehicles from the US Order of Battle<br/><br/>Mind the Gap&copy; 2018 StrongPoint Simulations and Modeling, LLC.  &bull;    MBT&trade; is arbitrable to James M.

It may be played on its own or may be combined with The War: Europe 1939-1945 (&ldquo;TWE&rdquo;) to recreate the entire Second World War. In conjunction with The War&rsquo;s Expansion Kit, gamers can now enjoy the complete TW franchise. The game includes TW: Global rules linking the Asia/Pacific and European theaters.<br/><br/>The War: The Pacific, 1941-1945 borrows many concepts from TWE, so experienced TWE gamers will readily adapt to TWP&rsquo;s game system. However, TWP doesn&rsquo;t just port European Theater rules to the Pacific and hope for the best. The game features sophisticated carrier-warfare rules that capture the unique features of the Allied naval struggle against Japan. Further, TWP isn&rsquo;t just a naval strategy contest. Unlike some WWII strategy games, Nationalist China plays an active role in TWP, and a player&rsquo;s diplomatic strategy in China may be as important as his military strategy.<br/><br/>As in TWE, there are numerous optional rules and variants, from the Doolittle raid to Japanese Fleet suicide missions. Scenarios include Changsha (Nationalist China vs. Japan, Fall 1939); Guadalcanal; Coral Sea; Midway; the Eastern Solomons; Leyte; Okinawa, 1941-1945 Pacific War Campaign; 1942-1943 Turning Point; and TW-Global, combining TWP and TWE into one monster campaign game.<br/><br/>Playing times range from less an hour for the smallest scenarios up to 40-50 hours for the full campaign. For those who want to run the full Europe-Pacific campaign, joining both games together, you&rsquo;ll need about 80 hours to recreate all of World War Two.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: Good<br/>    Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months<br/>    Map Scale: 1 hex = 46 miles or 75 km<br/>    Unit Scale: Fleets and Task-Forces; Air: Wings; Land: Divisions, Corps and Army<br/>    Players: two<br/>    Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game features a dynamic play area that changes with each player interaction. Your goal is to harvest ingredients and work with the magical animal gardeners to make the most fantastic table of recipes!<br/><br/>Players all start the game with two recipe cards, two skill cards and a unique menu card. Additional recipes and skill cards can be acquired during play. However, your menu card stays with you throughout play, giving you a special end-of-game scoring multiplier if you achieve certain combinations. Up to three recipe cards can be placed in your kitchen area while you collect ingredients. Once you've gathered the necessary ingredients for a recipe, you can present it to a gardener (more about that below). Skill cards are played directly from your hand, giving you extra actions, bonus ingredients or can add to your points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Four (or five) garden patch tiles make up the board. Each garden patch grows different ingredients, vegetables, fruit, fungus and grains/nuts. Each turn ingredients randomly grow in these garden patches dictated by a roll of the garden dice. Four (or five) magical gardener animals tend the garden, though each has one particular patch that they are partial to. These animal figures are placed on the board in their preferred garden patch to start the game. Players take turns moving their token to different garden patches, harvesting the ingredients and interacting with the gardeners. You can present your completed recipe to the gardener on your patch or call a different gardener to your patch to use their special ability. You can't do both.<br/><br/>As the gardener animals are called to different patches and different ingredients grow or are harvested, players have unique options every turn! You'll constantly be guessing where the gardeners will land and hoping there will be enough ingredients available to complete another recipe. Strategy, clever resource management and a bit of luck is needed to ensure you maximize each turn!<br/><br/>Recipe cards, toppings, combos and your unique menu card all contribute to your victory points! After one player finishes their sixth recipe, the other players have one last turn to create a final masterpiece. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Concept by Ruthie Jones. Mechanisms and art by Darryl T. Jones.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>",

You must place the cards you take face up on the table in front of you, clearly arranged by letters, so your opponent can always see what you have taken so far. The game ends when the row of cards is exhausted. Then the players do the scoring.<br/><br/>The scoring combinations are either sets of three such as; three of the same letter &ldquo;b&rdquo; or &ldquo;e&rdquo;...etc or sequences of letters that spells either &ldquo;bug&rdquo; or &ldquo;bedbug&rdquo;. Each card can only be counted once in a set or sequence. Your score for the deal consists of two parts. First, for combinations, score as follows:<br/><br/>sets:<br/><br/>three &ldquo;b&rdquo; for 3 points<br/>three &ldquo;e&rdquo; for 6 points<br/>three &ldquo;d&rdquo; for 9 points<br/>three &ldquo;u&rdquo; for 6 points<br/>three &ldquo;g&rdquo; for 9 points<br/><br/>letter sequences:<br/><br/>&ldquo;bug&rdquo; for 12 points<br/>&ldquo;bedbug&rdquo; for 18 points<br/><br/>Next, take your total score and multiply it by the total number of cards drawn by your opponent to have your final score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Game components make up the rest of the package, with Scenario Cards, Reference Card, Sea Display, and eight warship counter sheets (sections #1-8), including ships from Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, 144 ship counters in all, drawn to scale. Using historically rated warships (BB, BC, PB, CA, CL, AMC types), rated in a variety of offensive and defensive categories, players can assess at a glance the relative strengths and weaknesses of each ship.<br/><br/>Advanced Salvo! European Theater is primarily a ship vs ship solitaire game, but rules are included for two-players as well, with one or multiple ships on a side.  All the major warships from each country are provided (see list below), allowing players to recreate any number of actual and hypothetical Second World War encounters.<br/><br/>The game may be played with counters, or your own ship miniatures.  The game is adaptable to miniatures on the table top, with scales of one turn equaling several minutes of real time, and each range band representing approximately 5000 yards (2.5 nautical miles).<br/><br/>Originally published in 2015, Advanced Salvo! European Theater is now available in PDF format.<br/><br/>LIST OF INDIVIDUALLY RATED SHIP COUNTERS INCLUDED<br/><br/>GERMANY:  BB: Bismarck, Tirpitz.  BC: Scharnhorst, Gneisenau.  PB: Graf Spee, Adm.

In each round of the duel, a magical category is randomly rolled which is used to judge the spells used in that round. Players use the best spells they have available - or mix things up with Wizard cards, allowing them to change categories at will, or Randomizer cards, which force a random change. In addition to the spell cards they use through the round, players also have a few extra tricks up their sleeve - action cards that can be played at almost any point of the game.<br/><br/>Quick to learn and stuffed with 79 unique and wacky spells, WizBang! is a light, fun game of reckless magic.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Linear Progress around the lodge is achieved by dice roll (D12), Using the &quot;On The Square&quot; step Officers may choose to enter the checker Board and take a more direct route. To aid progress through the lodge, Officers collect Gavels (An important Freemasonry device). These can be used to change the result of a dice roll by 1 step each - 1 more or 1 less, up to 3 Gavels can be used each turn, but Officers must have 3 Gavels at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Officers also collect the Tools of each degree, 3 in each degree. Completing a Toolset allows Officers to progress to higher or lower degrees throughout the game. Officers also need to sit in each of the Principal Officers seats, in turn: Inner Guard, Junior Deacon, Senior Deacon, Junior Warden, Senior Warden &amp; Worshipful Master. Achieving each seat also creates more opportunities to move between degrees. Landing on the Worshipful Master at any time also allows for movement between the 3 degrees. Throughout the Officers journey around the Lodge, there are several steps which provide additional help, or sometimes hindrances to progress. The Secretaries, Charity Stewards and Treasures issue summonses, by way of card selection. All of which must be obeyed. Grand Lodge also offers advice by card selection which must be obeyed.<br/><br/>Special moves: During gameplay, landing on the Junior or Senior Deacons steps allows officers to swap corners, from one step to the other. Landing on the Immediate Past Master step (IPM) Officers, not on the step are able to double their collections of Gavels or Tools while the IPM step is occupied. As a thank, you for the IPM's help, the officer on this step can forgo their dice roll and choose any step to Progress to instead. Land on either of the Visitors steps and officers can get further instruction by rolling the Visitors dice (D20) and referring to the Visitors book for the corresponding instruction. When landing &quot;on the Square&quot; Officers can elect (Before rolling the dice) to enter the checkerboard and move directly towards any step they wish. There is also an opportunity to aid a Candidate throughout their journey if an Officer lands on the Candidate step, you collect your Candidate and each of your dice rolls can be repeated with your Candidates steps. You lose your Candidate when passing the Tyler step. Combining &quot;On The Square&quot; with a Candidate allows you to potentially keep your Candidate much longer.<br/><br/>When an Officer has progressed through each degree, collected all 9 tools and has sat in each Officer's seat, collecting all 6 along with having a minimum of 3 gavels, that Officer can win the game by being the first to sit in their own seat. They can then win the game and claim to be Master of their Lodge.<br/><br/>",
