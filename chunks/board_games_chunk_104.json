If you land on any colour other than white, you must draw a card from the deck of that colour. The cards either tell you something positive or something negative. Examples:<br/>Blue card - Bad choice of meal, hamburger with Pommes Frites. This is 'not good' so you have to go back three spaces.<br/>Orange card - various breakfasts you might have. A healthy one illustrated, might move you forward two spaces.<br/>Yellow card - Cleaning your teeth after a meal - very good, go forward two spaces<br/><br/>In addition, some cards show an activity that must also be obeyed. This will be one of four instructions:<br/>3 x three jumps on the spot.<br/>1 x run round the table<br/>1 x hop round the table<br/>1 x stand on one leg and count to 10<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to reach the end of the track and a crown is included for the victor to wear.<br/><br/>The game was published for the Zentralverband des Deutschen B&auml;ckerhandwerks, a kind of organisation to promote different German bakeries.<br/><br/>",

The item tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. A turn starts when the player reveals the top tile. If he thinks he needs it, he pays to the bank the cost (in Deutschmarks). If he doesn't want to buy it, the next player can, and at a saving of 50 Pfennigs (half a Deutschmark). If not wanted it is offered to all the other players, knocking off 50 Pfennigs each time. If it gets down to zero, that player will get it for free.<br/><br/>The object is to buy goods that will form four boxes in a row on your board, so four across, four down and four corner-to-corner are all acceptable choices. The first to do so, wins.<br/><br/>A few tiles are what you might call Event tiles. If one of these is drawn, it is read out and takes place if the drawer wants to make use of it. Example: You may take one item off the board of the player to your left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sea Chess is a board game, like Chess, or Checkers.  Chess, however, is a game that interprets Medieval land warfare while Sea Chess interprets a modern Naval Battle.  Every Sea Chess game piece represents a warship.  Both players get 24 game pieces representing 3 battleships, 4 cruisers, 8 destroyers and 9 escorts.  Each type of &quot;ship&quot; moves freely about the board with its own characteristic motion, speed and direction.  The &quot;ships&quot; are engaged in dynamic moving action until sunk and you can watch all of the action.<br/><br/>In Sea Chess there is a gradual &quot;sinking&quot; instead of &quot;jumping&quot; or &quot;taking&quot; pieces.  A game piece moves into range and &quot;fires&quot;.  A roll of the dice determines a successful hit.  Each type of &quot;ship&quot; has its own characteristic striking force and range.  Pegs are placed in the pieces to record successful hits.  When the holes are full, the piece has been &quot;sunk&quot;.  Since a peg marks each successful hit, you can keep track of how much damage you are doing to your opponent's ships.<br/><br/>READY REFERENCE CARDS included with the game give you a neat summary to keep by your side as you play so you do not have to keep looking into the rule book for speed, direction, striking force, etc.<br/><br/>RANGE GAUGES are provided to help you determine what ships are in range and which are not.  Soon you will be able to tell just by looking which ships are in range.<br/><br/>You develop the strategy!  You make the plans!  You decide whether to make the first attack or prepare a devastating counter-attack!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The aim of TOTEM is for your chief to build their totem pole before the other chiefs do, but it's not as easy as it sounds!<br/><br/>Players first decide how high totem poles need to be to win, between one and four totems, with higher poles meaning longer games.  Cards in TOTEM come in three colours, representing the spirit power associated with them - red = power of destruction, yellow = power of protection, green = power of creation.  Players are dealt at random a card representing their chief, and a spirit card (which is not looked at), which can be used as a risky last resort to destroy other player's totems, but can backfire and destroy yours (if the spirit card doesn't match the colour of the chief using it).<br/><br/>Players then take turns to turn over and collect totem part cards.  To build a totem, players need to collect three cards, a wood, tools and paint card, in the same colour as their chief.  Once they do this they discard those cards and choose a totem in their colour to add to their pole.  There are several totem designs for each colour, so players can customize the way their totem pole looks.<br/><br/>Some cards in the totem parts deck are Magic Items - if a player picks one of these up and it is in their chief's colour, they can use it to do various things, from destroying other players' hands of cards (the Tomahawk), to preventing other players using magic items (the Teepee), or allowing them to look at other player's cards and swap any they want to (Pipe of Peace).<br/><br/>Once a player has created the set number of totems, they need to finish off by creating a Totem Topper (collect a wood, tools and paint card in each of the three colours in any order), and then they win!  But play can continue to determine other placings.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Totem Parts (42 cards - wood, tools, paint, plus 6 Magic Items)<br/>Totems (24 cards - 8 destruction, 8 protection, 8 creation, all double sided)<br/>Chiefs (6 cards - 2 destruction, 2 protection, 2 creation)<br/>Spirits (6 cards - 2 destruction, 2 protection, 2 creation)<br/>Totem Toppers (3 cards, double sided)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game for two to four pet aficionados.<br/><br/>Goal: - End the game with cats. Lots of cats. Cats that match your personal quirks (youʼre not crazy &mdash; just different) are especially nice to have. Donʼt let the feral cat population get to high or youʼll attract the attention of the ASPCA, and you donʼt want that.<br/><br/>You need:<br/>A six-sided die. One die per player is good.<br/>A City deck - this where the cats come from (available on the game's website)<br/>A Thumb-Servants deck - This is where food-bringing servants with opposable thumbs find gifts to bring as offerings to their feline masters (available on the game's website)<br/>Cat Fancier cards - These cards describe the cat fancier youʼre playing in the game(available on the game's website)<br/>Crazy cards - These you what kind of crazy you are. You may have a thing for psycho kitties, lazy fuzzlewumps, or whatever.(available on the game's website)<br/><br/>Each turn begins by determining turn order &mdash; the player with the fewest cats goes first in each phase. The players then check to see how hungry the cats are (cats can either be sated, hungry, or famished). Cards from the City deck are then dealt out to the middle of the table. Each player, starting with the first player, then has the opportunity to feed cats, including cats on the table, cats in the Wild that were allowed to go feral in previous turns, cats that are in their household, or other people's cats (which gives them the opportunity to steal those cats). Each player then draws from the Thumb-Servants deck, drawing and keeping cards based on each player's Cat Fancier card. Then the players check to see which cats are hungry, deciding whether to call the ASPCA to pick up the hungry cats (which also may cause the player to lose other cats) or allow the cats to go feral, placing them in the Wild on the table.<br/><br/>The game ends when one or more players has 10 or more cats or if the City deck runs out of cards.<br/><br/>Points are then scored based on the number of cats each player has and any bonuses they may have received from Crazy Cat cards and Cat Fancier cards. However, if the City deck runs out, the ASPCA may come and get everyone's cats - if this happens, everyone loses!<br/><br/>",

The dealer in the first game is chosen by lot, and thereafter the deal goes in turn to the left. Shuffle the cards and deal one at a time beginning at the left until ten have been dealt to each player. The remainder are placed in a pile face down on the table. The player at the left of the dealer commences the game by making as many &quot;books&quot; as he can from his hand. Three cards of the same day constitute a book. These books are laid aside to be counted at the end of the game. The player now calls upon any player he wishes for any card (any day of the week) he, the caller, may need to complete a book. If successful, he may continue to call for and receive the needed cards from any of the players, until he calls for a card from a person who has not that card; he then draws three cards from the pile and the next player plays.<br/>   <br/>The players follow in turn at the left from the first player. At the end the player having secured the greatest number of books wins. <br/><br/>",

Each year a grand championship is held where teams from all over the realms come to put their skills to the test.  The race begins with each team (player) receiving an old airfoil frame that will form the basis for their airship in the race.<br/><br/>The teams get four hours (turns) to fix up and prepare their ship for the race.  When the time is up the teams must roll out their ship no matter the condition.. The race is on!  The teams will race around the designated track, trying to stay ahead of the pack as they face challenges along the way.  The airfoil that is the first to successfully cross the finish line, after the designated number of laps, wins.  This is a rough race and you never know which racer, if any, will pull through in the end!<br/><br/>",

The expansive board is built up as a three-dimensional play space representing the various chambers of the cursed temple from the TV show.<br/><br/>In this board game version, the players move together through five of the popular rooms of the TORE! Temple.  First they try to avoid being eaten by the stone monster in the &quot;Stone Idol Chamber&quot; then they must race to avoid being crushed by the closing walls in the &quot;Wall Chamber&quot;.  After that, their task is to not get wrapped up in the &quot;Mummy Chamber&quot; before next trying to escape from the &quot;Floor Chamber&quot; where the ground slowly rises until the hapless player slides off to the their doom.  Finally, in the &quot;Cliff Chamber&quot;, the players must use their wits as they are quizzed one-by-one while portions of the walls begin to protrude, threatening to push them over into the bottomless abyss.<br/><br/>Interspersed between these five rooms are additional challenges including quizzes, gambling to win more Golden Pharaohs, and even the ultra-popular &quot;Spring of the Goddess&quot; metal-ball challenge of trying to control and drop a ball into a goal using two ramp-like bars.<br/><br/>TORE! is a game of both chance and skill as your brain and ability to stay cool under pressure will help you as much as a lucky die roll. All the while the game maintains the same light-hearted humor from the TV show.<br/><br/>From the game rules (translated):<br/>This game is a three-dimensional board game of trying to find the &quot;Golden Pharaoh Statues&quot; hidden in the cursed temple! Try to escape from the Pharaoh's many challenges while collecting more Pharaoh Statues than your opponents!<br/><br/>",

Each player has two turtles and a peg in the same colour (so they don't forget what colour they are). The aim of the game is to get one's turtles to the end of the track first. Players take turns rolling the colour die. Turtles are moved according to the die roll. If blue is rolled, a blue turtle is moved - even if it isn't one's own turtle. Green allows the active player to put one of his/her turtles on the next salad space, red on the next tomato field. If a turtle lands on the same space as another, it is put on that turtle's back. If a turtle in a stack gets to move, the others that are on its back ride along. Turtles can only leave the track at the end if the player rolls red, green or his/her own colour. If there is another turtle on its back, they also reach the finish.<br/>The first player who manages to get both his/her turtles to the finish wins the game.<br/><br/>",

By answering questions about animals, drawing animals or mimicing animal behaviour correctly players score points and progress on a scoringpath. In the end one of the participants will reach the finish first and can claim victory.<br/><br/>With questions in 3 categories, children learn a lot about the animals around them and build beautiful animals themselves.<br/><br/>This is not a standard game as winning is not the goal, but the game-play progresses until one person passes the end of the scoring track first.<br/><br/><br/>Dierenvrienden is geen standaard bordspel: in dit bordspel draait het namelijk niet om winnen, maar om proberen.

        "description": "Card game with 52 cards. There are 10 of each colour, numbered 1 to 10. Plus there are 4 multiplication cards, 4 subtraction cards and 4 dividing cards. The latter three groups are called #Sign' cards.<br/><br/>The rules suggest you may play lots of traditional games with the cards (but I doubt it). The publisher does include the rules to three different games;<br/><br/>Fives<br/>Players must build up a row of five cards that total a number multiplied by five. The normal cards must be of of the same colour but not the sign cards. You do not have to use a sign card if you don't want to. You add and discard cards from your hand as in Rummy games. The first player to reveal a correct hand of five cards, wins that round. The score is one point for each five generated by the total i.e. 20 would score 4, 45 would score 9, and so on. The rules helpfully suggest that the maximum number that could be achieved with five cards is 2,560, and that total would generate 512 points.<br/><br/>Auction Maths<br/>This is a trick taking game and the only game where the colours are ranked; Black, Blue, Green, Red. Black is the lowest ranked colour and Red is the highest.The game is for four players, playing as partners. Both partnerships bid to claim a number of trick (5 being the minimum, 13 the most). Your partner can overcall your bid if he wants to. The player with the winning bid can choose a colour to be the 'Double' suit. This means that every card in that colour counts as if it was doubled (A 4 card would be an 8 card, a x4 card would be a x8 card, and so on). One thing to note, players do not have to follow suit. Any card can be played to any trick. When the calling side wins a trick, it only scores if the four cards played (and in the order the cards were laid) total 25 or more. If not, the trick is laid to one side and doesn't count. You score for each trick made plus a bonus for making your game. The opposition score for every trick by which you fail to make your contract.<br/><br/>Number Building<br/>Players agree before the start of a hand, the total that five cards laid out must achieve. The rules suggest a number under 50 is the wisest choice. Once agreed (before you see your cards), all players will work towards that total. Every player gets 6 cards and must lay a normal number card in front of themselves in the first round. In subsequent rounds a player may draw a card of the deck or a card of the discard pile or can lay a card next to his cards on the table. Once a player has met the total successfully, the hand ends and scoring is based on the small number in the corners of the cards. If you make the total with 5 cards of the same colour, an extra 150 is scored. This bonus reduces if two colours were involved. After an agreed number of hands, the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trifecta Poker is based on a Trifecta of winning Horse Cards as Win, Place, and Show.<br/><br/>A blend of Horse Racing, Classic Poker games and all original Artwork.<br/><br/>This set of Race Horse Playing cards is a real game changer. For instance every card is a Face Card and there are no Kings or Queens, Jacks nor Aces. The Royalty here or the Ace of the Race is represented by what horse is the Winner of the Race. These cards wear Silks not Suits.<br/><br/>This is the only game that tells you the Winners before you Start. The only question is who holds the Winning hand. The objective of the Play is to determine if You hold a Winning hand and have a chance to take home the Cash. The Rules are Simple but you can't Win if you don't Try and it's obviously better if you Trifecta!<br/><br/>The rules are simple in the basic form of play however, all sorts of other cards games can be played with this new game.<br/>Here are the rules:<br/><br/>The Rules<br/>Trifecta Poker Hand Rankings<br/><br/>Trifecta Poker can be played using almost any variation of common Poker Play rules. The Key to Trifecta Poker is that the winning hand is based on a Trifecta of winning Horse Cards.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Dealer shuffles the 52 Cards and draws 3 different Horse Cards in a vertical display outward from the POT known as the&nbsp;Trifecta Flop.&nbsp;After each play the cards are shuffled and a new Trifecta Flop is drawn. The First Horse drawn is the Winning Horse, the 2nd is the Place and the 3rd is the Show - aka WPS. or a Superfecta game a 4th Horse is drawn.&nbsp;Duplicate Horse cards if they appear in the Flop are returned to the deck. Dealer then re-shuffles the remaining deck and deals 5 cards to each player. Players may now hold pat their original cards or draw from one to four new cards from the deck. The Player with the highest combinations of Trifecta, Quinella, or WPS card combinations wins. A Trifecta is all three winning horses, a Quinella is the Win and Place horses, and the WPS are any horses in the money. WPS combinations are ranked by the highest number of Horse cards in the money without a Trifecta or Quinella.<br/><br/>All Trifecta Poker hand rankings can be improved by also holding typical Poker combinations as shown below:<br/><br/>    For instance no. 1 : A Trifecta with a pair of any horses beats a Trifecta with no pair.<br/>    For instance no. 2: A Win horse with three of a kind beats a Win horse with a pair.<br/>    If NO players hold WPS Cards typical Poker Hand rankings are won as follows:<br/>    Four of a Kind - Four of the same Horse cards.<br/>    Full House- Three of a kind and a pair. The player with the higher value three of a kind, wins in the event of a tie. If both players have the same three of a kind then the player with the highest pair wins.<br/>    Straight -Five cards of any horses in ascending order with the higher straight wins the tie.<br/>    Three of a Kind- Simply three cards of the same horse.<br/>    Two Pairs of Horses - The player holding the highest pair takes the pot in the event that more than one player is holding two pairs. If two players are both holding the same two pair then the player with the highest fifth horse (i.e. the kicker) takes the pot.<br/>    One Pair of Horses-Two cards of the same horse.<br/>    HIGH Horse -Highest card takes all in the event there is a complete absence of the above hands.<br/><br/><br/>",

If a player rolls the rose symbol, he gets to move the rose piece. The rose can only be plucked once all the other flowers have been taken. In this phase of the game, there are no more die rolls.

The Trumptus is their only hope of chasing away evil Panthea and her Munculus warriors. But where to look for the pieces? They are all over Centopia, and behind every corner there might be an evil Munculus warrior. Cautiously, the players search for the pieces. Will they be able to find all the pieces before Panthea manages to mobilise her troops?<br/><br/>Gameplay: The Trumptus and Munculus chits are randomised and placed into the slits in the game board. Each player gets an elf board. The Panthea board is placed in the middle of the table, next to the game board. Players take turns rolling the die. If a number from 1-3 is rolled, the corresponding number of chits is taken from the game board and placed in front of the active player's elf board. Then he/she can decide if they want to roll again or end their turn. They may repeat this step as often as they want, as long as they don't draw a Munculus chit from the board or roll the Munculus symbol.<br/>If a player decides to end their turn, they place all the Trumptus chits of their own colour on their elf board. They return the Trumptus chits of other players' colours to the game board (putting them into slits of their choice). Then it's the next player's turn.<br/>If a Munculus chit is drawn, the player's turn is over immediately. The Munculus chit is placed on the Panthea board. Previously drawn Trumptus chits are returned to the board and the die is handed over to the next player. If the Munculus symbol is rolled, the player's turn is over too. All previously drawn Trumptus chits are given to the players they belong to, and they place them on their elf boards.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has placed all 8 Trumptus chits of their colour on their elf board. That player wins the game. The game also ends when the Panthea board has been completely filled with Munculus chits. In this case, Panthea wins. Second place goes to the player who has collected the most Trumptus chits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aristoocrazy is a game about the Middle Ages which deals not with the clich&eacute;s of that period &ndash; such as religious fanaticism or cruelty &ndash; but rather with slightly exaggerated relationships within the noble families. It offers deep strategic choices, but spices them with fun, humor, and player communication. Relive this comedy about the Middle Ages and have fun with Aristoocrazy!<br/><br/>Each player has ten unique characters from his family at his disposal &ndash; five noblemen and five noblewomen &ndash; but he starts with only one pair of aristrocrats. Throughout the game, characters will struggle to conquer neutral regions or those controlled by an opponent, in addition to using the benefits of their abilities. Each character has three abilities, which are helpful for gaining victory points (VPs) or attacking other characters. The game has nine different abilities, which are represented by cardboard tokens. When a male and female character marry, new characters are born into play, with the newborn children inheriting its parents' abilities.<br/><br/>If two characters with a close family relationship meet, however, there is a risk that their child will be &quot;different&quot;. When such a child grows up, naturally you'll need him to take care of your domain or a military campaign that you're running &ndash; but if his wits aren't in the right place, he won't be of much help. (And who would want to marry such a dud in the first place?)<br/><br/>Aristoocrazy lasts twelve rounds, and at the end of each round the victory conditions for the current round are evaluated. The players try to optimize their actions &ndash; moves on the board, attacks, the use of abilities &ndash; in order to fulfill the victory conditions defined on the event card in place for that round. The players who best fulfill the victory conditions are rewarded with VPs or special action cards, which can help them in certain situations in future rounds. The player with the most VPs after the final round wins!<br/><br/>",

Players try to locate the ears in their colour (the colour markings are at the bottom, face-down side) and to move them onto the target spaces of the same colour. At the start of the game, the ears are randomly (and without knowing the colour) distributed on the starting spaces.<br/>Players take turns rolling the die. A die roll can be used to move one ear the corresponding number of spaces vertically or horizontally, or the roll can be split among several ears. If a player rolls a six, he/she has several options:<br/>- He/she can move ears as in a normal roll.<br/>- He/she can roll again and look at the colour markings of a number of ears corresponding to the die roll.<br/>- He/she can place an ear of which he/she knows it is his/her colour directly onto a target space.<br/>A player can decide not to move on his/her turn and use a joker card instead. The active player then rolls the die to determine how many ears he/she may inspect.<br/>When players have found out which ears are theirs, they try to move them to their target spaces as secretly as possible. When an ear has reached a target space, it is turned over and the colour is shown to all players. If it is the wrong colour, it goes to one of the target spaces of the player it belongs to.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of one player's ears have reached their target spaces. Each ear that has reached its target space is worth 5 points, each joker card that hasn't been used up is worth two points. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

All cards have number from 0-50.<br/>At the start of every game mix whole package properly, so you don&acute;t have too much of the same numbers together. Lower numbers are usual in the package than the high ones. Each player gets seven cards in hand, which is required to discard as soon as possible. Who do it first, is the winner of the lot.<br/>Players must combine the numbers in hands with the results in any row or column of the table. For example, if you are over twelve and four, you play sixteen (12 4 = 16), eight (12-4 = 8) threesome (12:4 = 3) or osmačtyřic&iacute;tku (12x4 = 48).<br/>---<br/>Mathable Quattro je speci&aacute;ln&iacute; poč&iacute;tac&iacute; hra, kter&aacute; kombinuje hern&iacute; syst&eacute;my her Mathable a klasick&eacute;ho přeb&iacute;jen&iacute; karet.<br/>Quattro je nejmen&scaron;&iacute;m bratř&iacute;čkem ze čtveřice a ukr&yacute;v&aacute; se v mal&eacute; krabičce pro karetn&iacute; hry, ve dvou sloupečc&iacute;ch po 53 kart&aacute;ch.

        "description": "A simple trivia game played on a map of the German State of Schleswig-Holstein.<br/><br/>A long track winds around the State, starting in Hamburg and ending on the Isle of Sylt. Movement is decided by a die. There are four categories of questions:<br/>A = General knowledge<br/>K = Culture<br/>W = Economic<br/>P = Politics and History<br/>Obviously, all the 500 questions in the game have some connection to Schleswig Holstein.<br/><br/>There is an interesting shortcut that may be taken where no questions are asked. Instead you roll the die and if you get a number from 1 to 5, you move two spaces. But if you roll a 6, you must go back 15 spaces.<br/><br/>First to reach the end (Ziel) wins.<br/><br/>On a little bit of extra trivia, the board shows clearly that the Eastern neighbour to Schleswig-Holstein is, in fact, the DDR (East Germany). As the game was published in 1989 and the wall came down that year, then this might be the last non-historical game to feature the DDR as a neighbouring country.<br/><br/>",

Now they want to dig them up again but not any old bones, it has to be specific ones. The bone has to be the right shape and size. And the dogs are chasing away each other too!<br/><br/>Aim of the game: To find the correct wooden bone by touch as quickly as possible in order to collect the most bone cards.<br/><br/>How it is played: The board shows a circular path consisting of single-colour spaces and multi-coloured dog-house spaces. Arrows next to the spaces show the direction in which the dogs move. Each player has a dog-shaped player piece. A colour die determines movement. The active player puts his/her dog on the next empty space of that colour. If he/she lands on a dog-house space, he/she is allowed to search for bones. This means that he/she puts his/her hand into the bag with the wooden bones and tries to find the bone that is shown on the top bone card. While he/she is trying to identify the correct bone by touch, the other players continue taking turns rolling the die and moving their dogs. As soon as the active player thinks he/she has found the correct bone, he/she shouts &quot;Stop!&quot; and the other players stop rolling. The chosen bone is compared to the one on the card. If they match, the active player gets to keep the card. The wooden bone is returned to the bag. Then the active player starts searching for the next bone. His/her turn ends as soon as either one of the other players lands on a dog-house space, or he/she chooses the wrong bone.<br/><br/>End of game: The game ends when all the bone cards have been used up. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>- game board<br/>- 4 dog-shaped wooden player pieces<br/>- 9 wooden bones (different lengths, round piece on one end, or on both, or none)<br/>- 18 bone cards (showing the different lengths and shapes)<br/>- color die<br/>- cloth bag<br/><br/>",

To take an action a player takes one of their own workers from their supply and places it in an empty space on the action board and resolve the action accordingly.  Instead of taking an action they may they may pass on one of their available actions - if they do so they must remove one of their workers from the action board (if they have any).<br/><br/>The three types of action on the action boards are:<br/>Place: Place one of the activating workers in the Network board.  Take the worker from either the General Supply or the &quot;Place&quot; Space just activated.<br/>Move: Move either player's worker on the Network Board to an adjacent vertice or move either player's worker on the Action board to an adjacent space (do not activate the action under the moved worker).<br/>Remove: Remove either player's worker from either the Network Board or the Action Board.  The worker is returned to the player's general supply.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when a player has three workers in a row on the Network Board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A domino variant that uses dice as well as the domino cards. Of course, the cards can be used for a standard game of dominoes except that they feature an image on half the card and letters on the other half. You match a correct initial letter to an image (M next to Moon for example or vice versa). The game is housed in an attractive tin box.<br/><br/>Other games are included that bring in to play the special dice. One dice is what wargamers would call a Fire Die. It has 1 x two on it, 2 x two on it and 3 times two.The other die has letters on each face, four letters or five letters. And sometimes they use the wooden Wizard figure that is included with the game.<br/><br/>In game 1,2,3 - Magic! each player gets a hand of five cards and 12 cards are laid out in a circle, like a clock. However, a clock with 24 divisions because the cards are laid end-on thus forming a chequered track, picture, letter, picture, and so on. The Wizard is placed on one of them. The number die is used in this game. In your turn, you roll the die and advance the Wizard that number of spaces. When he has moved and lands on a picture space, the player looks at the picture and sees if he can think of a word that describes the picture. If he can then he must check his hand and see if the word he wants to use begins with one of the letters in his hand. If he does have such a card he can return that card to the box. If the Wizard lands on a letter space the reverse applies. The player looks to see if he has a picture card that begins with the letter. The first to use up all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>In Enchanting Fairy, the letter die is used. Each gets a hand of cards. The Wizard is placed in the centre of the table comfortably in reach of all the players. The die is roilled and all the players look to see if they have a picture beginning with one of the letters face-up on the die. If they do think they have the right answer, they can grab for the Wizard. Whoever gets it first (several players might grab for it at the same time), announces his answer and, if correct, returns his card to the box. If he is wrong he must draw another card from the shuffled deck.The first to use all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>Interesting additional fact. HABA add the usual disclaimer that the game is not suitable for under threes as some components could be swallowed. Nothing unusual in that except they write it in 40 languages!!<br/><br/>",

The starting player chooses one of their cards and places it face up onto the discard pile. Each card shows a Dandy or Beano character inside a coloured border. The chosen card must show either the same character or the same coloured border as the one below it in the pile. Play then passes to the next player.<br/>4.    Any player who is unable to play a card on their turn must take the top card from the draw pile and add it to their hand. Play then passes to the next player.<br/>5.    When a Roger the Dodger cord is played, the following player must pick up two cards from the draw pile and add them to their hand. Play then passes to the next player. However, a player does not have to pick up two cards if they can also play a Roger the Dodger card on top. In this case, the next player must pick up two cards instead.

With enough numbers they can consume even human-sized targets with notable ease, making them very dangerous. While they are Graverobbers they are selfish with the corpse counters they collect. Indeed Gaki can consume their own allies to act faster. While employable by any Resurectionist Master, they very much enjoy the company and commands of Kirai who lets them enjoy the corpses she ignores as she enslaves the escaping souls of her victims. Under the command and within the close presence of Kirai, Gaki become even more savage then when ripping their foes apart with their sizable maw<br/><br/>While a Gaki will eat near anything, they love living flesh over anything else and will frequently move with more passion to consume a beating heart.<br/><br/>Gaki work well with most Resurrectionist masters, provided they come as a group (as mentioned, 4 Gaki will only cost you 12-stones). With Kirai however they get a few extra perks.<br/><br/>Kirai can cast &quot;Spirit Food&quot; on living or undead enemy models. If the model affected is killed, a new Gaki will be summoned (with Slow for that turn). This can add to the Gaki's growing numbers and increase their pack-size. However the model MUST be killed and not sacrificed (i.e.: not Devoured or Absorbed by the Gaki) for a new Gaki to appear.<br/><br/>Gaki within 6&quot; of Kirai increase their damage potential to 3/3/5 (two successful Gorges from a Feeding Frenzy will do anywhere between 6-10 damage in Kirai's presence!)<br/><br/>Gaki killed within 8&quot; of Kirai produce Seishin, which Kirai can evolve back into Gaki by spending (1) AP and losing -1 Wound (or -2 Wounds with her trigger if she would like to Summon the Gaki 12&quot; away from herself - possibly beside an enemy who is already in Melee with another Gaki; creating potential for a retaliatory Feeding Frenzy).<br/><br/>As Spirits, Gaki offer Kirai a place to teleport to. As Gaki can move 10&quot; each turn (14&quot; if they can see a living model in the Start Closing Phase), they are quite swift and can offer escape locations for Kirai to teleport to.<br/><br/>",

The round ends when one player has all the cards.<br/><br/>There is a Big Bad Wolf card and if this is revealed, the player must give four cards to any other that shouts &quot;Wolf!&quot; first.<br/><br/>At the end of each round of play, the player winning the round gets 1 point for every other player in the game. First to get 12 points or more, wins.<br/><br/>List of cards:<br/>Value 3 = Elmar Elephant, Pluto<br/>Value 2 = Three Little Pigs, Dopey Horace Horsecollar<br/>Value 1 = Snow White, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck<br/>No value cards <br/>Ambrose Kitten, Max Hare, Clara Cluck, Goofy<br/>Tilly Tiger, Minnie Mouse, The Twins, Toby Tortoise<br/>Dirty Bill, Clarabelle, Pied Piper, Donna Duck<br/>Country Cousin, 3 Little Wolves<br/>Special Penalty card<br/>Big Bad Wolf<br/>There are two of each card except the only Big Bad Wolf card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A memory game based on the children's book and animated TV series &quot;Charlie and Lola&quot;.<br/><br/>The game board shows a bedroom on one side and a living room on the other side. The players decide which side they want to use. There is also a smaller board that is divided into four sections (blue, red, green and yellow). Each of these sections shows 4 different objects - mostly toys but also a hairbrush, pencils and a telephone. There are 16 cardboard chips that show the same 16 objects.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1: Players take turns &quot;hiding&quot; the objects on the board: they take a chip, say where they are hiding it (e.g. &quot;I'm hiding the football under the bed) and place it in the corresponding section of the board. Once all objects have been placed on the board, the players try to memorise which object is where. Then the chips are turned face-down.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Players then take turns rolling the colour die. If you roll red, you have to find one of the four objects from the red section of the smaller board. If you find a correct object, you get to keep the chip.<br/>The game ends when all objects have been found. The player with the most chips wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The first one determines which color worm to move (half of the dice sides permit you to choose a color) the second shows how many spaces to move. If you manage to completely surround an apple on the board you keep it. Play continues until all 19 apples are gone and the player with the most apples wins.<br/><br/>This is not a simple roll and move game. Children will enjoy moving the worms to get apples but there are always a few decisions regarding what path to take each turn. At a somewhat more advanced level there are decisions to make to limit your opponents choices and scoring opportunities each turn and potentially maximize your own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica wiki site:<br/><br/>These Rare spirits are very deadly. Seldom alone, often hunting in pairs, and never found it great numbers (Rare 2), they are monsters to be feared. Once they have chosen their prey, they are relentless and single-minded in agenda to slay their prey. Incredibly fast, and viciously savage, they are frequently found in the forces commanded by Kirai.<br/><br/>Shikome are pretty straight forward. If on the board, their first priority is to kill their Prey! This can be any enemy model that is in play, and indeed a pair of Shikome may opt to hunt the same target.<br/><br/>&quot;(0) Hunting Partner&quot; only affects friendly Beasts, but it does give them the advantage of fast, and a plus flip to hit and damage against the Shikomes prey. Within the resurrectionist faction this only applies to Rogue Necromancy, Night Terrors and another Shikome. It is worth using on another shikome with the same prey as it adds another positive modifier to the attack and damage flips.<br/>The bonus from the Hunting Partner will last until the closing phase.<br/>Don't assume that Shikome need to kill their prey. They don't necessarily want the kill - they just want their chosen victim dead (by their hand or another). If your other forces can remove the target, go for it. There won't be a penalty and by doing this your Shikome will be free to attack whomever they want.<br/><br/>Don't assume Shikome must go towards their prey. While they may only be able to attack that specified model, they don't have to make it a priority (although while the victim lives the Shikome is limited in what it can do). You can choose to take a long route to get to the foe if you want, as it may be safer for the Shikome to do so (they are hardy, but not indestructible).<br/><br/>&quot;(1) Stalk Prey&quot; only works if you activate it prior to the Prey's activation and only occurs if they take a move action.<br/><br/>Once the Shikome has killed their Prey (or have just be summoned) they can skip their turn to declare themselves hunting &quot;(all) New Prey&quot;. It depends on your style of play, but its usually not that recommended as giving up a turn to just say &quot;I'm coming for you and only you&quot; can be quite wasteful as in that same turn you could have your Shikome move to attack any model in charge range. However, this taunt can be useful - especially if you want to get rid of a target that is on the opposite side of the board (using &quot;(1) Stalk Prey&quot; can quickly make up for the turn you used up selecting &quot;(all) New Prey&quot;)<br/><br/>",

One sides shows just a picture, the other shows a picture plus the corresponding word. The picture-only side is used when playing with younger players who can't read that well yet. With other players both sides can be used.<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and divided into three stacks. Players turn over the top card from each of the stacks. Players then simultaneously search for a characteristic that two of the three items shown on the cards share. A player who thinks to have found such a characteristic slaps the stop card and tells the other players his/her idea. If they accept it as correct, he/she wins the pair of cards and two new cards are turned over. If his/her idea isn't accepted, the game continues with the same three cards as before.<br/>The shared characteristic has to be something both items have (not something they both don't have), and it has to something that hasn't been mentioned in a previous round, otherwise the first player to use that characteristic wins this pair too.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards have been used.

Or, if the game is played in multiple rounds, being the one with the most point (one point for each time the egg lands in our own nest).<br/><br/>Setup: Each player gets a crocodile and the nest of the same colour. The crocodiles are placed about 50 cm apart. The egg is placed in the middle, at equal distances from each of the nests.<br/><br/>Gamplay: The starting player places his/her crocodile next to the egg, so that the tail is very close to the egg. He/she then touches the crocodile's head and turns it so that the tail hits the egg and the egg starts rolling. If the egg stops moving with the same player's colour up, he/she gets another turn and flicks again. Otherwise it's the other player's turn now.<br/><br/>The game ends when the egg ends up in one of the nests. This player wins the game. (If players have agreed on playing multiple rounds, the game ends after the agreed-on number of rounds.)<br/><br/>Difficulty can be adjusted by putting the nests closer together.<br/>The instructions also include suggestions for a few variants/other activities with the game materials:<br/>- Which player needs the fewest attempts to get the egg into his/her nest?<br/>- Which player can kick the egg more often with his/her own colour ending up on top?<br/>- Which player can kick the egg the furthest in one go?<br/>- Threads can be used to set a racing course. Which player gets the egg to the finish line with the fewest kicks without the egg leaving the racing course?<br/><br/>",

Each is worth a certain amount of points. These are collected at each of the game's 10 turns.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into four phases (Ascetic, Eremitical, Cenobitic, Salvation). The first is drawing a card, the second is the action phase, the third is the scoring, and the fourth is discarding all cards and starting fresh for the next turn. The actions of the second phase (Eremitical Phase) are determined by playing one card from your hand. Depending on the suit, you'll be able to draw new cards into your hand, trade cards with other players, or bid on cards drawn from the deck.<br/><br/>After ten turns the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>",

In the aftermath of the apocalypse, survivors were forced to make decisions about how to rebuild our society.  After Time: Survival follows the adventures of Kai, one of the lucky few who escaped from the crumbling civilization.  But Kai's journey was not without its struggles, as he finds himself without a family, caring for a little girl who had lost hers as well, and is expected to lead a group of survivors in the rebuilding process.  Faced with widespread hunger, dangerous weather conditions, and the dark temptations of personal greed, Kai's wits will be tested as he leads his group to a better life.<br/><br/>The board has a simple roll and move mechanic but when the players land on a &quot;running Kai&quot; space they draw a &quot;Survival&quot; card. On the card is a piece of the story that has an encounter that has two choices. The Player reads the card and then must choose an option and then turn the card over to see if they have earned community points or resource points. As they move around the board they might be hit by storms. The storms will set them back if they have no shelter token. Shelter tokens are earned when the player builds a community house.<br/><br/>Players compete as they race to amass resource points to build their own houses; but then the game takes a turn when they have to cooperate and negotiate with each other to spend and/or pool their community points to build community houses.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the person who has been helpful enough to get all of the community houses built but has also balanced their own needs and has completed building their own five individual houses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A set of skirmish rules for 15-28mm.<br/><br/>From althistory alternative history wiki-<br/>      In May 1937, King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom married Wallis Simpson. The marriage to Wallis was not recommended by Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister; and Edward refused to abdicate. This marriage left the British government, and most of the people, alienated; and hatred for King Edward and Queen Wallis rose. In January 1938, a protest by Dockyard workers in Liverpool was brutally crushed by the army; and violent clashes began across the country; between the Kings troops and those of several other factions. The British Civil War had begun!<br/> Factions: The outbreak of conflict led several groups to attempt to seize the country or their own personal goals. Major factions included:<br/> ■ The Edwardian Army - Led by King Edward VIII <br/>■ British Union of Fascists - Led by Oswald Mosley, the British Fascisti were aligned with the Edwardian Army<br/> ■ The Georgian Army - Led by Edward's younger brother, George, Duke of Kent. <br/>■ The Anglican League - A large army led by a group of bishops and archbishops, they were aligned with the Georgian Army<br/> ■ The Red Field Army - Made up of disgruntled workers and Spanish Civil War veterans, they sought to turn Britain into a Socialist state based upon Lenin's Russia.<br/> ■ The Scottish, Welsh and Cornish Independence Movements - Groups in Scotland, Wales and even Cornwall who sought to form their own independent nations, they were supported at various times by The Red Field Army and The Anglican League.<br/> ■ The British Empire Independence Movements - Groups of people accross the Empire fought for autonomy and independence.<br/> ■ Foreign Volunteer Units fighting for the major factions. Examples included the AVAC (American Volunteer Army Corps) formed by Joseph Kennedy and the Hanoverian Legion formed by Hermann G&ouml;ring fighting for the Edwardians; the ANZAC Volunteers and the Imperial Volunteers fighting for the Georgians; and the International Revolutionary Corps formed by Leon Trotsky and the People's Soviet Volunteer Army formed by Vyacheslav Molotov fighting for the Socialists.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website -  <br/>     1938 A Very British Civil War has built a considerable fan base dedicated to researching and gaming this world of an alternative 1930's For the first time we have produced a specific set of rules for the period. These are aimed at creating large multi- player battles while retaining the charm and character that has made this project endearing to many wargamers Now with a group of friends, a good curry and a few pints, you have a fast play set of rules that will allow you to storm the defences of Liverpool, raid over the border or lead gallant cavalry charges in the Severn valley. Brigadier 38 as the name implies gives each commander a brigade, where a company is 10 figures, and a battalion of 30-60.<br/><br/>The rules cover- <br/>   orders, movement, firing, morale and melee, along with a points guide to provide suitable forces for battles and scenarios<br/><br/>",

The game board is set up inside the box. Trees with various items which could be used for tails are inserted into holes in the board (without looking at which tree has which item). A card is flipped over, and all players now look for the tail that is depicted on that card. They do that by rolling and moving along the trees; at the end of their move, they pull out the tree and check if it is the right one. When finding Owl, the active player may secretly switch two trees; finding other characters from the book cause other effects. <br/>When all tails are found, players have to find Owl who has the original tail which is worth two other tails. <br/>The player with most tails collected is the winner.<br/><br/>",

When your appeal fails, the next player plays. Completed matches are set aside.<br/><br/>The obvious end is that the winner is the one who collected the most pairs but the rules suggest that you could create 'oddballs', i.e. the wrong lower half with the wrong upper half.

Taking turns, players draw a card, play cards on the table in front of them in three camps, and play camp wreckers and game changer cards to the discard. At the end of a player's turn, they must discard one card from their hand (if they have any cards left) and replenish their hand. Play continues counter-clockwise. Discards are shuffled to replenish the deck when it runs out.<br/><br/>Campsites consist of two comfort cards, two food cards, and are completed with a campfire card that must be the last card played on a campsite. Cards are stacked in the order they are played and only the top card of any campsite is vulnerable to camp wrecking attacks.<br/><br/>The first player to complete three camps wins the game.<br/><br/>",

At the end of his turn, the player draws new tiles to replace the ones he has played. The game ends when all tiles have been drawn.

        "description": "Emperor is a climbing card game (in the mold of President, Tien Len, The Big Two, Tichu, The Great Dalmuti, etc.) that is playable with two regular card decks shuffled together.  It was designed as a climbing game primarily for 6+ people (though rule variants permit 4-5 people to play as well).<br/><br/>The game allows singletons, sets (pairs, three of a kind, etc.), runs, and multi-runs (consecutive pairs, consecutive triples, etc.) as legal plays, which must then be followed by a play of that same type and of the same length, except in the case of special combinations known as &quot;bombs.&quot;  Several jokers are used as wild cards.  Between rounds there is a unique redistribution phase in which all players discard a card face down; these are shuffled and dealt randomly back, one to each player.<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow for &quot;calling a coup&quot; in which one player names a calling card; the first person to play this calling card is the coup caller's partner.  The coup succeeds if either player goes out first. A coup partnership receives a bonus or penalty depending on whether the coup succeeds or fails.<br/><br/>Other advanced rules allow for &quot;class division&quot; rounds in which face cards (&quot;noble cards&quot;) cannot appear in combination with number cards (&quot;commoner cards&quot;), and in which there is &quot;taxation&quot; between rounds  instead of redistribution (during taxation losers give winners their highest card).  Further successful coups cause the game to toggle back and forth between such a class division round and the initial &quot;class harmony&quot; style of round, in which there are no restrictions on the play of face cards and there is &quot;redistribution&quot; between rounds.<br/><br/>",

The plastic board represents an American Football field with a scoreboard, 10 yard marker, football, and has identical player charts on each side of the field. There is an Action deck of cards (52 in 4 suits) and two scrimmage decks (52 in 4 suits each). The suits represent different offensive and defensive play options, long pass (heart), short pass (diamond), running play (spade), or line play (club). The Action deck is used for non-scrimmage and special plays. Each player uses one of the scrimmage decks for plays from scrimmage. The scrimmage decks have a number 2-14 inclusive and a suit on the front. The back also has the suit. This allows the player to decide what type of play to run from the back of the cards without knowing how strong the play will be.<br/><br/>For an example of a scrimmage play, assume the offensive player looks at the back of his deck and chooses long pass (heart). The defensive player chooses running defense (spade). Both players turn over their cards and show 10 of heart and 7 of spade for a +3.

With a hand of 10 cards, players try to score the most points per round by constructing the longest, grammatically correct, and sensible sentence. Each card used in a sentence is worth 5 points, but using some of the more difficult conjugations on the card can earn you bonus points. Any player can object to another players sentence, on either grammatical grounds, or the fact that the sentence just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The defending player and the objecting player get to argue their points to the rest of the players, who form a jury. The jury gets to vote on whether or not the sentence is acceptable. Half the fun is trying to defend, explain, and justify a completely ridiculous sentence to the other players. Accepted sentences score points, rejected sentences get you zip. First player to reach 200 points wins.<br/><br/>",

A king (called basileus) making a capturing move must leap over one or several of the opponent's chessmen but cannot jump over the opponent's king.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to eliminate the king (basileus) from the board.<br/>Each player has 4 pawns, 4 pieces and a king at the beginning of the game<br/>The capturing is obligatory<br/><br/>1. A chessman making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square in all allowed directions.<br/>2. A chessman making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's chessman. Only one chessman may be captured in a single jump; however, when possible the player must perform multiple jumps in one move in all allowed directions.<br/>Pawns<br/>1. The pawns can only move diagonally, one square at a time.<br/>2. The pawns capture the opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they can move to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, but not diagonally.<br/>3. Pawns can only move on squares of one colour, so if they start on a white square they must always stay on white squares.<br/>4. Pawns may only capture the Basileus or other pawns, they may not capture other pieces.<br/>5. The game ends when one player captures the opponent&rsquo;s Basileus by jumping over it to the next empty square.<br/>Pieces<br/>1. The pieces can only move diagonally, one square at a time.<br/>2. The pieces capture opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour, diagonally in  four directions, not to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, Pieces can only move on squares of one colour, so if they start on a black square they must always stay on black squares.<br/>3. Pieces may only capture the opponent&rsquo;s pawns or Basileus, they may not capture other pieces.<br/>4. The game ends when one player captures the opponent&rsquo;s Basileus by jumping over it to the next empty square.<br/><br/>Basileus<br/>1. The Basileus can move one square at a time in all directions, also diagonally.<br/>2. The Basileus can capture opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they can move to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, or diagonally.<br/>3. The Basileus cannot jump over the opponent&rsquo;s Basileus, so if it finally stops on a square next to the opponent&rsquo;s Basileus, the opponent can replace it with his own Basileus, thus winning the game.<br/><br/>",

Visit the BoneGames website at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.bonegames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.bonegames.com</a> for information about Queen Victoria's Navy, Admiral on Deck, and other games by BoneGames.<br/><br/>Historical Background<br/><br/>Early in 1882 the Egyptian Army forced the Khedive, Tewfik Pasha, to appoint Colonel Said Ahmed Arabi AKA Arabi Pasha as the new Minister of War. In this position, and with the backing of the army, Arabi was the de facto ruler of the country. Arabi was viewed with distrust in both Britain and France. This distrust was not without reason as he and his followers viewed the Khedive as a puppet of the Europeans, attacked Europeans in the streets, and threatened to nationalize the Suez Canal leaving the stockholders without a cent, and to repudiate Egypt's foreign loans.<br/><br/>A combination of fear for the Canal, the shortest route to India after all, the outraged cries of the investors and a pinch of concern for the Europeans in Egypt, plus a heavy dose of Jingoism led the British government to prepare for war. France, for some very convoluted internal political reasons, reversed policy and refused to help.<br/><br/>While an Army was being assembled the British decided that their first step should be to neutralize the extensive coastal batteries defending Alexandria. On 10 July,Vice Admiral Sir B. P. Seymour demanded that the forts, then being strengthened, be surrendered. The navies of other nations and all commercial shipping quickly sailed out of port. The Egyptians refused this demand and Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Navy cleared for action. On 11 July, 1882 the bombardment began at 0650 hours.<br/><br/>",

Each &quot;coach&quot; selects a team of one goalie, two defensemen, and three forwards, plus two extra players.  Each match is played in three periods.  Dice rolls determine the score in each period by both teams.  Challenge cards can be played in each period to influence the score or affect the entire match.  If the score is tied after three periods, overtime is played until their is a winner.  Once a team has won four matches (of a possible seven), they win the championship!<br/><br/>The expansion pack option for Big League Hockey Manager allows General Managers (GM's) to collect a Challenge each time they win a match.  Challenge cards can be traded or sold before the &quot;trade deadline&quot;.  Once a GM was won five matches, the first and second place GM's are determined. The HNIC Challenge stand-alone rules are used to play the championship final between those two teams.<br/><br/>(Note: The standard rules for HNIC Challenge are best played with two players.  The expansion pack rules can be played with two to four players.)<br/><br/>From the publisher's web site:<br/>Get ready for a quick, exciting best-of-seven series that's pits you and a rival coach in a challenge for the championship. This game is easy to learn and fun to play. Your teams face off as you roll the dice and strategically play your Hockey Night in Canada Challenge cards. Add quarter and semi finals and up to eight people can play. Each playoff round takes less than ten minutes and is perfect for hockey fans ten years old and up. This is also two games in one: Hockey Night in Canada Challenge AND an expansion pack for BLM's award winning General Manager game.<br/><br/>",

You can erect walls to protect yourself, and lob all kinds of incendiary devices at your enemies. But they will be doing the same to you. If they destroy all of your walls and take you out, then it&rsquo;s Kaboom! You get the picture.<br/><br/>Game play is very simple. Players have a hand of cards that are made up of four different types that can be used to attack their opponents and defend against incoming attacks. As the game progresses, the players will have their protective walls slowly whittled down to nothing. This leaves them exposed and the next attack from any opponent that cannot be blocked immediately eliminates the player from winning the game, but does not remove them from the game. As soon as this happens, the endgame is triggered and the Endgame cards come into play. The Endgame cards are special cards that keep eliminated players in the game to hinder all those who are still in the running to win the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one player left who has not been eliminated. This player, being the only one to survive the battle, is automatically the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While at first glance nothing more than a deck of vampire-themed playing cards, Succubus: The Reborn is a new take on a classic game tool: cards. Each card bears a symbol &ndash; Rock, Paper, Scissors, Bomb &ndash; that makes the deck ideal for fans of Live Action Role Playing (as they often need some randomizing element during play).<br/><br/>What's more, each card contains one or more unique (and sometimes hidden) symbols, which allows the deck to be used for Succubus: The Reborn, the first title in the Party Poker RPG line of games which is playable by 8-90 players (with one deck needed for each ten players). One player serves as the Dealer, who oversees gameplay and leads others in what to do; everyone else is divided as evenly as possible into four teams, the teams being vampires who are members of four great Lineages represented by the four card suits:<br/><br/><br/>    Diamonds &ndash; The Marquisi (The Elite Ones) blend in among mortals that they might trade in money, power, and control, all while clinging to an old world sense of protocol and social decorum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Hearts &ndash; The Copeadora (The Beautiful Ones) are universally insane, but also very beautiful &ndash; a benefit which they utilize in order to slake their unholy thirsts at the necks of beautiful socialites and wealthy benefactors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Clubs &ndash; The Bas-Bazouk (The Outlaws) are the enforcers, criminals, anarchists, and street-toughs of the Vampire world, plying their wits and their supernatural strength to devastating effect in combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Spades &ndash; Unlike other Vampires, the Profugos (The Forlorn) do not possess a soul; they are therefore cursed with deep, soulless, black eyes, and are prone to acts of immorality and depravity.<br/><br/><br/>Succubus: The Reborn is played over three acts, and in each act, players try to improve their hand of cards to create the best poker hand. In the first round players can trade however they wish amongst each other as long as each player always has five cards; if a player manages to trade away a joker, that player takes a card at random from the other person's hand instead of any card agreed upon. When the Dealer calls time, the player on each team with the highest card in that team's suit is the Captain, and all the Captains then compete in a single poker hand with the cards they hold, trying to win chips in the process.<br/><br/>From the second act on, players can trade cards with the Dealer for the cost of one chip, taking a random card from what remains in the deck. To trade cards in the second act, you trade in the same manner as the first act or you challenge another player, paying them a chip to do. In a challenge, each player chooses and reveals a card from his hand, with scissors beating bomb, which beats rock, and so on. The winner of the challenge decides whether or not to trade. For the third act, you can trade only with your teammates. After the second and third acts, each team Captain again competes in a poker hand, with the winner of the third such hand winning the entire game and bringing glory to his team.<br/><br/>Succubus: The Reborn includes a number of advanced rules that add quests, shadow symbols that allow for better trades with the dealer, character sheets that add special powers to the game, and more.<br/><br/>",

Amidst this chaos rose Napoleon Bonaparte, under whose influence France would become a dominant power, controlling, directly or indirectly, the majority of Europe. This companion for Field of Glory Napoleonic gives players all the information they need to recreate the French Revolutionary wars and the rise of Napoleon through to the campaigns of the Grande Arm&eacute;e and the early Empire. Emperors and Eagles also includes full army lists for the Peninsular Wars, where Britain and its Portuguese and Spanish allies slowly, but surely, turned the tide of the war and pushed Napoleon's forces back to their own borders.<br/><br/>",

Unlike chess the 7 primary pieces capability of movement is controlled by the color of the square they occupy any any given moment.  The starting positions of the playing pieces are identical to regular chess and the color of the square they are initially on serves as a guide to the relationship between the color of a square and the fighting pieces capability: black = rook; white = knight; blue = bishop; and, red = queen.  A player may have no more than one queen at a time except when capturing a pawn or a queen that stands on a red square and in the next move must move one of the queens off a red square.  With the exception of the beginning set-up, as just described, the colors of the remaining squares on the board are randomly distributed, there is no symmetry between sides.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game characterizing the oldest and largest industry known to mankind.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:  &quot;This game was designed with as much reality as possible to depict the actualities of farming.  It is impossible to inject all the complexities of modern-day farming into this game, yet it does contain enough reality to be educational to the nonfarming-oriented person and at the same time provide a competitive and fun atmosphere for all.  As you play the game, you can to some degree sense the frustrations that farmers face but yet realize the real competitive situation that farming has come to be, neighbor versus neighbor and, likewise, player versus player.  You might note that virtually all the option positions in the game are akin to decisions that farmers must make.  While playing the game you will find that what you thought was the best decision would later not be so, as the real life farmer has experienced so many times.  Another likeness of the game to farming is that your destiny depends on when and where you are.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Object of the Game: &quot;The object of the game is to buy and sell production as each player takes his turn.  Production is defined as Corn, Soybeans, Wheat Cows, and Hogs.  Commodities are defined as Corn, Wheat, and Soybeans.  Livestock is defined as Cows and Hogs.  Each player should try to buy as cheaply as possible and sell as high as possible as he stops on various spots around the board in order to accumulate the enough money to buy all the production that belongs on a player's farm.  Players should keep in mind that they must make several transactions in order to buy their production and, at the same time, retain enough assets to take care of the expenses that will surely come their way.  The first play to buy all production for their farm is the winner.  Each farm's production consists of 1 bin of Wheat, 1 bin of Corn, 1 bin of Soybeans, 1 Cow, and 1 Hog.  Bins are identified by colors.  Yellow represents Corn bins, Light Gold represents Soybean bins, and Dark Gold represents Wheat bins.  As a player buys these commodities, he may place them in their respective places on the board and, likewise, the same for livestock.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The board has a long track that, at times, offers a short or long route (and on two places a third track is offered). Movement is by a die.<br/><br/>At several points there are numbers. These numbers relate to cards (there are thus 26 cards and 26 special spaces). Before you start on a short or longer path, you can look at the numbers on such a track. This might imfluence your decision. A general rule is that the longer the track taken, the more your money is secure. However there are bonuses to be earned by finishing the track quickly.

        "description": "SUMMARY from the designer:<br/>&quot;Shades and Glamour is a card game based on an alternate history of the English Regency.  The game mimics social life in 1814 &mdash; if one adds magic. The goal is to improve one&rsquo;s social standing. Social standing is the value of one&rsquo;s cards. One improves it by acquiring better cards. As with all romances, the game ends when a character becomes betrothed by losing his or her last card.&quot;<br/><br/>AVAILABILITY:<br/>The game is available from the designers website as a print-and-play.  Some character cards are only available directly from the author at conventions.  The game additionally requires a standard deck of playing cards and a pen and paper.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:<br/>Each player will play the character on their character card.  Each character card has a different balance of a number of different attributes.  The attributes each map to a suit of a standard set of face cards.  Each player holds five facecards with which one will attempt to acquire the other player's character cards from them.<br/><br/>Players will take turns making advances via one of their attributes toward another player.  That player can respond in kind, or counter with a different, attribute (analogous to each suit having a different suit which can trump it).  Players then simultaneously reveal their played cards and add that total to the corresponding attribute on their character card.  The player with the higher total triumphs, and takes the opposing player's character card.<br/><br/>If one does not hold a suitable card one can attempt to bluff by playing a face card as if it is suitable, but when it comes time to compare scores, only the attribute on the character card is counted, with no additional strength given via the face card.  Alternatively one can opt to not participate in an exchange at all, before the face cards are revealed, but one will lose a turn as a penalty for doing so.<br/><br/>Play continues in rounds until only a player loses her last card.  Points are counted, and the player with the highest points wins.<br/><br/>",

To achieve this they have 5 lives, represented by 5 cards. If the player controlling Jerry places three items of food into the mouse hole before they lose the 5 live cards, they win. If not, then the player controlling Tom wins.<br/><br/>A variant of Balyna Magnetic Super Soccer, for smaller children.<br/><br/>Components were made of thin cardboard and plastic, and were therefore easily ripped/bent/broken.

        "description": "Fairly straightforward snakes-and-ladders style game with 600 numerical, verbal and non-verbal reasoning questions (200 of each type) used to determine progress.  Designed to help children improve their 11+/CAT scores (Cognitive Ability Tests used in the UK either as part of 11+/school entrance exams/streaming exams within weeks of starting secondary school) but with a &quot;hard-mode&quot; for adults consisting of a 30 second timer for each question rather than the 50 second timer for children. Cognosis Challenge squares add an extra dimension.<br/><br/>Cognosis is an exciting, problem-solving family game. It includes 600 questions based on the 3 question types that are used in Cognitive Ability Tests (CATs)*, tests that are faced by almost all children aged 10 or 11 in the UK.<br/>Children have 50 seconds to answer the questions (the time allowed in a test) but over 12&rsquo;s only have 30 seconds, making it a game for all the family. Land on a square and answer the question. Get it right and remain where you are or get it wrong and go back to where you came from. Land on a Cognosis Challenge square and challenge one of your opponents to answer a question of your choice &ndash; which category do they find the hardest? If they get it wrong, they go back.<br/>Reach the Final Challenge square and answer the question to be crowned the Cognosis Champion.<br/>Cognosis can be played simply as a fun game by all the family but it is also so much more. It gives children valuable practice in answering CAT type questions in the typical time allowed in the tests and so promotes familiarity and builds confidence. The best bit - as it is fun, children want to play it and don&rsquo;t realise that they are learning and developing with every throw of the dice and every question answered. They also love beating their parents, grandparents or any adult so don&rsquo;t think this is just a game for the children, they will want you to play too.<br/>Cognosis with a twist<br/>Alternative 1<br/>If you're under 12 and want more of a challenge, why not play the game using the 30 second timer<br/>Alternative 2<br/>Going on a long journey but still want to play/practice, why not take a box of cards (you choose which type) and a timer ( you choose which one) and play simply by pulling out a question, turning over the timer and trying to get the right answer before the timer runs out.<br/>Alternative 3<br/>Out of the house and with a friend. Again, take a box of cards and a timer. One person pulls out a question and lays it flat and the other turns over the timer. Who can get the correct answer first? The first one to correctly answer gets to keep the card. Play for 15 minutes. The winner is the one with the most cards at the end.<br/><br/>",

In three moves per turn, each player must try to match the color patterns on three cards to the colors on the playing board.&quot;<br/><br/>The game board features an inner and outer ring of indentations along with 5 colored balls and two decks of cards. For the easy game you use the inner ring, four balls, and the associated deck of cards. For the normal game you use the outer/larger ring, all 5 balls, and the other deck of cards.<br/><br/>Three cards are displayed at the beginning. The cards display the balls in various patterns (such as all colors sequential or colors in specific clumps with gaps between them, etc). On each turn a player gets three actions each of which he can use to relocate a ball. If at any time during the turn the balls match one of the card patterns the player wins that card (winning at most 3 cards per turn). At the end of the turn the display is re-filled to three cards before the next player starts their turn.<br/><br/>Once the deck is exhausted the players count their cards. The player who has won the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns harvesting materials, completing quests, and exploring new farm lands to settle their ever growing horde of Pygs to breed and harvest to sell materials on the market.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>Each turn is broken up into four seasons each giving unique bonuses and penalties. At the end of the cold winter will you have enough food to feed your pygs? In Spring will you pygs be in the mood to make babies? In Summer will you be ready for the invasions? In Fall will you have enough resources to trade with other players?

        "description": "Fiefdoms is a 2-4 player dice based, area control-type game. Each turn players roll four dice from which they create two grid references - determining where on the six-by-six map they can place armies and workers; occupying castles to gain points or controlling villages to gain extra powers. Once placed, your armies will have to fight for the most important locations - using a positional, dice-free combat system.<br/><br/>Thematically the game is inspired by the influx of Norman barons into England during the reign of William Rufus - all vying to grab lands and castles. Despite the theme, this is very much a Euro-game - rather than a wargame.<br/><br/>In keeping with the printandroll promise - to provide everything but the dice - the pdf includes a page of cut out and fold armies and workers. However, you may find it easier and more satisfying to use pieces from another game. As with Siegecraft, the rules are printed on the board for ease of reference.<br/><br/>The files for the game can be found in the files section, below.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A pentomino is a five-square puzzle piece. If you took five squares, and laid them against each other, edge to edge, then that would be a pentomino. There are exactly twelve different ways you can arrange five squares. In the original puzzle, the task was to create interesting patterns using the pieces.<br/><br/>This version of Pentominoes is played on a 10&quot; x 10&quot; board ruled into 100 squares. (Solomon W. Golomb's original design for a pentomino game featured an 8x8 grid of 64 squares.)  Each player has one set of Pentominoes and these are placed anywhere on the board in turn. The object of the game is not to make patterns, but to place pentominoes on the board in such a way that the last player cannot place a shape on the board.<br/><br/>Limits to placement:<br/>1. A vacant space of at least five squares must be left after placing a piece on the board.<br/>2. The winning player may place some of his remaining pieces in the vacant spaces to score double points for one and triple points for two.<br/><br/>The rules add a tip: It is advisable to try to reserve a space in the shape of one of your pieces after your opponent has played that shape.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MLB Chipz is a basic dexterity game from Topps using themed, collectible poker chips. The components are themed poker chips with a baseball-inspired design and featuring MLB players. The chips come in several variants such as magnetic, glow-in-the-dark, and metallic but the variants do not affect game play. The game board is reminiscent of a baseball diamond, with scoring zones marked for value. The themed components do not impact game play. Each package contains four random chips, a sticker, and a game board.<br/><br/>Rules are included on the back of the game board for three dexterity games: Shuffle Chipz, Flip Chipz, and Spin Chipz. In all three games, the board is laid flat with the final resting position of the chip determining the score. In Shuffle Chipz, chips are slid onto the board and players have the opportunity to knock away opposing chips. In Flip Chipz, chips are flipped onto the board, and chips landing face up score double. In Spin Chipz, the chip is placed in the middle of the board and spun. The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest score within a set number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

Each thief only moves onto cards of their own colour, which display the internal monologues from the character. As the thief leaves their card, the card is flipped, showing the opposite thief's colour and monologue. Some locations become locked and cannot flip, while other locations can be collected for their valuables. The game ends if both thieves can make it to the other end of the city, and an ending is determined by the number of cards collected throughout the thieves' escape.<br/><br/>Outside These City Walls is an experimentation in card game narrative, and the story told throughout play is of long-forgotten places and unrequited love. Even if the player resolves the puzzle and escapes with both thieves, their actions throughout the escape will determine the destiny of the two ill-fated nightrunners.<br/><br/>",

After that the players take turns to mark their symbols (X and O) in empty squares, with the option of blackening a square instead on their last turns.<br/><br/>Once the grid is full players score for consecutive lines of their symbols in any direction. However, while even numbers of symbols score positively, odd numbers (greater than one) score negatively.<br/><br/>A game consists of two rounds. In the second round of a game, the same four squares are blackened as were chosen at the start of the first round and the player who went second now goes first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Divoshi is a two-player abstract strategy board game themed as a battle of two savage tribes. While similar to chess at first sight, the rules are very different. It is played on a square/rectangular board which may vary in size somewhere around 7x7. Like in chess, players make alternative turns, attacking and capturing opponent pieces and trying to capture the chief. But here the similarity ends.<br/><br/>Divoshi has five types of pieces, and all of them may move in eight straight directions like the chess queen, but within a limited scope. What is most specific for Divoshi is the rule of pushing/retreat and capture. If a piece enters a square occupied by an opponent piece, the latter is pushed off one square further. If there is no room for the retreat, the piece is captured.<br/><br/>The rules favor an aggressive playing style in which having your own chief under attack usually entails losses. The freedom of movement and the possibility of moving two pieces in one pushing move make the game unusually dynamic.<br/><br/>",

The pieces come in three colors - red, yellow and blue.<br/><br/>Each player in turn chooses a piece of any color and places it on the board either upright, so that it covers just one square, or on its side, so that it covers two squares.<br/><br/>Pieces may only be placed on empty squares, and a piece may not be placed next to a piece of the same color, not even diagonally.<br/><br/>The first player who is unable to make a legal placement loses the game.<br/><br/>",

The starting player starts by giving a positive statement about the word on his/her card. If a player guesses correctly, both the player who explained and the one who guessed move 6 spaces on the board. If the word isn't guessed, the same player has to use a negative statement next round, and if successful both players get to move 5 spaces (one space less per round that it takes to explain the word).

        "description": "Mezmo is a collaborative game for 3 to 11 players, ages 5 and up. In the game players take turns adding a single tile to a slowly growing game board where the other players judge whether or not the played tile fits the &quot;Theme&quot; of the pieces it connects to. The game focuses on the personal judgement of each of the judges, as was as the current player's ability to convince others of their artistic vision. Failure to appease the judges forces the player to take back their piece, as well as receive another random tile from the bag. The game ends when one of the players has no more pieces to play. It's a laid back, casual game that inspires alot of conversation and thought, and is best played with a creative crowd.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marching to Richmond is a simple strategic game covering the  American Civil War in the region containing the two capitals; the map depicts most of Virginia, most of Maryland, and Pennsylvania as far north as Gettysburg.<br/><br/>The system is very similar to that in Watt's The Peninsular War 1808-14; on each turn a player can spend 12 movement points among their forces, with a maximum of 6 per unit. Units can be moved by ship to a limited extent, and in this game also by railroad. Only one attack can be made each turn, with the outcome determined by die roll; the die results don't depend on the opposing forces at all, but the number of die rolls allowed depends on the number of attacking units and the defensive terrain.<br/><br/>The game is played to an agreed-upon time limit (2 hours is suggested) at which point a small fixed number of final turns is played. The Union player wins if they control enough Confederate cities (depending on whether they still control all of theirs or not), otherwise the Confederates win.<br/><br/>The game was originally published as a do-it-yourself kit (Watts' description) in 1974. A revised version titled &quot;prototype trial edition&quot; was published in 1989. It is unknown if a further edition was released.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The images and story for the game include the most famous tight rope walker of the time, Blondin.<br/><br/>Charles Blondin is famous for first walking across Niagara Falls Gorge on a tight rope in 1859.  He would later walk across numerous other times and entertain the crowds by crossing blindfolded, on stilts, or with his manager on his back.<br/><br/>Game board shows an amusing scene with a tight rope stretched across a river flowing down from a waterfall. Directions for the game state &lsquo;Ben&rsquo;, who stands on the cliff dressed in the sailor suit has already crossed safely.  The four walkers still attempting to get to the other side by way of the rope are named Ez, Uncle Tom, Fatty Fisk, and &lsquo;the expert Blondin&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The game board also shows people falling from the tight rope and landing in the water below.  These are named in the directions too.  Ebenezer is tumbling into the water, only Nebuchasnezzar&rsquo;s feet are shown as he sinks below the water, Ezekiel is swimming to shore, and Jeremiah is said to be going up the ladder.<br/><br/>The boat in the scene is named as well.  Commanded by Uncle Sam and carrying a small African-American boy, the boat represents the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau.  This agency was created in 1865 to help the newly freed slaves.  With the tight rope bridging the gap, and the dangers of failing, the game is seen to give subtle references to the post civil war era.<br/><br/>Tight Rope is played by the spinning the indicator (earlier edition - rolling the two dice).<br/><br/>To step on the rope (place his piece on space 1), a player must spin a 1.  To move across to number 12, a player must then spin the next number to where his piece rests.  This is done by spinning two times in a row.  If a player does not spin the number needed to move his piece one step ahead, the player then moves down the grid.  Whenever he spin the number needed (no matter how far down the grid he is), he moves to the number near the rope.  If the player does not spin the needed number and is in the last space below his numbered step, he moves back one step.<br/><br/>The first player across wins!<br/><br/>",

To set up, remove the 7-10 in each suit from the deck.

If a face card shows up, it counts as a guard and is placed face-up on the table; any other card counts as cash and is placed in front of the player. (An ace also allows the player to look through one stack, then reshuffle it.) At any time during the round, a player can cash out, scoring one point for each pip on the cards in front of her and one point for each card face-up on the table, whether cash or guards.<br/><br/>If a second guard shows up in a suit, then the round ends and no one still in the round scores for the cash in front of them. After five rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the earliest of a range of Japanese card games based on Portuguese playing cards brought to Japan in the mid 16th century. All these games as well as some unrelated and more recent games are denoted by the word &quot;karuta&quot; from Portuguese &quot;carta&quot;. Due to the age of this loanword, it can be written in a bewildering number of ways. About equally frequent are かるた in hiragana as other old loans that have been naturalised and カルタ in katakana, like modern loanwords. Archaic and more rarely seen are &quot;sound-ateji forms&quot; like 歌留多, 加留多 or 嘉留太 using kanji for their sound value without reference to their meanings. The kanji 骨牌 might be read karuta, but primarily represents koppai こっぱい, meaning a particular type of cards, or &quot;bone mahjong tiles&quot; (from Chinese gǔ p&aacute;i meaning &quot;bone tile&quot;, referring to dominoes). Besides this, the term fuda ふだ might be used for at least some forms of playing cards. This may also be written with the kanji 札 with the primary meaning &quot;paper money&quot;, and in this sense read satsu さつ.<br/><br/>The term &quot;Tenshō karuta&quot; is a later term later applied to distinguish the oldest form (which in origin actually predates the Tenshō period) from later developments.<br/><br/>The 48-card deck is divided into the four suits of pau ぱう &ndash; from paus &quot;clubs&quot;, isu いす &ndash; from espadas &quot;swords&quot; (shortened), koppu こっぷ &ndash; from copas &quot;cups&quot; and ōru おうる &ndash; from ouros &quot;coins&quot; (literally the plural of &quot;gold&quot;). Each suit consists of 12 cards: rei れい &ndash; from rei &quot;king&quot;, kaba かば &ndash; from cavaleiro &quot;knight&quot; or cavalo &quot;horse&quot; (shortened), sōta そうた &ndash; from sota &quot;servant&quot; literally &quot;lower [rank]&quot; and number cards from ace to nine. As in the Portuguese precursor, the ace cards depicts a dragon holding the suit symbol. In the &quot;short&quot; suits of cups and coins the number cards rank in reverse from ace (high) to nine (low), while the &quot;long&quot; suits of clubs and swords are ranked normally. This feature is not only shared with older European cards, but at least for coins goes all the way back to the earliest Chinese playing cards.<br/><br/>Later some of the Portuguese-derived names are replaced by indigenous ones. Pau becomes hau はう, &quot;flower&quot;, and the clubs are shown sprouting flowers; while kaba becomes uma うま &quot;horse&quot;.<br/><br/>Unsun karuta and Sunkun karuta are rooted in Tenshō karuta<br/><br/>",

That autumn, for three months, Whitechapel, in East London, was terrorized by a serial killer who came to be known as Jack the Ripper.<br/><br/>After committing five more murders, he suddenly stopped. Scotland Yard never solved the case and, to this day, the identity of the killer remains a mystery.<br/><br/>The players will personify some of the main characters of this horrific drama: they will be investigators, suspects, or both. One of them will secretly be Jack the Ripper and will have to escape, alone or with some help before being revealed and arrested.<br/><br/>London 1888 does not always rely on the same strategy in order to win. Roleplaying and bluffing is a very important part of the game. Every session is different and exciting.<br/><br/>This is the second revised edition, which includes more cards, more characters, more options and revised rules.<br/><br/>",

Each card is double-sided, with the outline of a country, its name, its population and its size on one side of the card and its capital and the surrounding countries on the other. In all three games, whoever collects the most cards wins.<br/><br/>In the first game, shuffle the cards with the capitals face-up, then take turns naming the country depicted on the card. Guess right and you claim the card; otherwise, remove the card from the game.<br/><br/>In the second game, deal the cards out evenly among the players with the capitals face-up. On a turn, you hold one of your cards capital side-out toward your left-hand opponent. If he can name one of the countries adjacent to the depicted country, he claims the card; if not, the next opponent in clockwise order can try to do so. Remove the card from the game if no one guesses correctly.<br/><br/>In the third game, deal ten cards capital side-up to each player. On a turn, choose two cards and hold them out to your left-hand opponent. If he can guess which country is larger in size or population (depending on what choose at the start of play), he claims both cards; otherwise, remove the card from the game.<br/><br/>",

After each move, a player places a new spider into the web (any position, but a different grid that has intersections with the one for the dice). Once all ten spiders have been placed, these can be after a die's movement. Spiders move any distance along the web, unless they are blocked by other spiders.<br/><br/>Every time a die crosses the web, it is turned up one number (starting with a one).

        "description": "The Game of War, in the designer's own words:<br/><br/>&quot;THE GAME OF WAR is one of skill, and belongs to that class which includes chess and checkers. It is played upon a board laid out in squares or rectangles, and the pieces employed represent and symbolize the important men and weapons of warfare, while their movements simulate the military evolutions of two armies opposed in battle, advancing, retreating and engaging in the diverse methods that characterize actual warfare, and employing all the various forms of strategy.<br/><br/>Each side, as a fighting force, comprises a king, a commanding officer, field and siege artillery, cavalry and ordinary troops and flying machines.<br/><br/>All the movements of Chess are found in the game, and, in addition, the troops have the movements made familiar in checkers or draughts, while some pieces are given different moves, and more freedom of movement than in either Chess or Checkers. But while these two games are thus drawn on to contribute all their virtues, the vital principle of The Game of War is radically different and wholly new.<br/><br/>In Chess the game is won when a player so hems in his adversary's king that it cannot escape capture; in Checkers all of the adversary's pieces must be captured and taken from the board, or the last of them penned, to secure a victory.<br/><br/>In The Game of War, however, the object is to lay siege to and capture the citadel &mdash; a central square in the king's rank on which the ruler is stationed at the outset of the game. When an adversary's piece can enter and hold this square without being captured at the next move, such occupancy of the citadel wins the game.<br/><br/>Chief of the many other distinctive features in The Game of War is the introduction of two flying machines on each side. The purpose and the movements of these are wholly novel, and give a singular fascination to the playing of the game. Moreover, the board used in the game is of a new design, having one hundred squares, instead of sixty-four, as in chess and checkers, and the all-important citadel square stands forth in battlemented prominence. In addition, there are four flying machine stations.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Place the bones into the Bone Bucket, mix them well, and slide the Power Switch to On. <br/>5. Shuffle the Bone Cards and place them face down in front of Bruno.<br/><br/>To Play:<br/>1. After deciding the order of play, the first player takes one card from the top of the pile and shows it to the other players. The Player then removes the number and color of bones from the Bone Bucket as indicated on the card.<br/><br/>2. After the player successfully removes the bones indicated on the card, the next player draws a card from the pile and so on.<br/><br/>3. Following the instructions on the card, the players take turns carefully removing the bones from the Bone Bucket.<br/><br/>4. Whenever a player disturbs the Bone Bucket and wakes Bruno, he will jump and bark at the player, disqualifying them from the game. After putting Bruno back to sleep (see Step 3 in the To Set Up section), the other players continue to remove bones in turn until only one player remains that player is the winner.<br/><br/>5. If players remove all the bones from the Bone Bucket without walking Bruno, the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>6.

Pijin iz a gam ov fonetik speleng &amp; a disarmingly fun new experience of words for everyone!<br/><br/>Pijin is the world&rsquo;s first spelling game of the spoken word. It's a hackable, expandable game that emphasizes the physical experience of communication. To play, you spell what you hear and only what you hear in pronunciation,  and you spell with phonemes. &quot;Pigeon&quot; is spelled /pijin/, &quot;words&quot; becomes /wurdz/, &quot;spelling&quot; is /speleng/, and so on.  Familiar terms sometimes look completely strange, but that's part of the fun as players explore and tinker with language itself.<br/><br/>There is no board used.  Each phoneme tile is worth one point.  The player with the most points wins. In Pijin Grid the object is to create a crossword-style matrix of intersecting words, one point for each tile in every word created by tile placement.  In Pijin Sprint players may choose to create either a list or an intersecting grid of 10 words that respond to a prompt, Action Card.  The grid may take longer but offers more scoring possibilities.  Pijin ships with one set of 52 Action Cards as the game's first &quot;module,&quot; but more modules of different themes are planned for release.<br/><br/>",

Players complete quests in  support of their individual (and secret) goals, fight bandits, rebels, cults, and other Wuxia heroes while developing their Kungfu abilities and cultivating their &ldquo;Qi&rdquo;.   The story which the players create within the game is different every game, as their secret agenda is always different.  The story plot &ndash; as told by the mission the players struggle to complete &ndash; follows story elements from popular wuxia movies and novels.<br/><br/>Xiake &ndash; noble fighters of the martial arts community &ndash; live to embody their personal virtues.  They express these virtues in their main goals: defeat the tyrant emperor&hellip; or support the law against the rebels;  defeat the heterodox sects&hellip; or support the traditional leaders of the Wulin; become the Wulin Mengzhu &ndash; recognized leader of the martial arts community&hellip; or burn down the community in revenge.  Each of these goals is a secret which the player keeps until the final battle, where the player will fight against his main rival.<br/><br/>Legends of the Wulin is both a strategic and tactical game.  On a strategic level, players compete to finish quests faster than the competition, thereby gaining access to better fighting abilities.  Tactically, the combat system of LOTW incorporates a short battle card game, in which players play individual Kungfu &ldquo;stances&rdquo; against each other to get the upper hand within a three-round battle.<br/><br/>Legends of The Wulin  typically takes 2-3 hours to play.  A large-ish table is required because the board, cards, and charactersheets take up a lot of space.  The rules are not particularly complex and is easy to pick-up.

There are 8 blue pieces for one player, 8 red pieces for the other player, and 7 yellow neutral pieces.<br/><br/>The game starts with each player's pieces on the row of 8 squares on opposite sides of the board.  The yellow neutral pieces are on the 7 junctions or intersections between squares in the middle of the board.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces at a time, diagonally to an adjacent space, or jumping an opponent's piece to an opposite vacant space.  Opponents' pieces are not captured or removed from the board.<br/><br/>Players may also move a piece vertically or horizontally, but only to jump an opponent's piece, landing on a vacant space on the other side.  Because of these rules of movement, pieces will be bound to the color of square on which they began play.<br/><br/>The neutral pieces can be captured (removed from the board) by either player making a single diagonal move over the junction on which the neutral piece rests.  Also, once a piece crosses the center line, it may not cross back to that half of the board.  The player who first moves all of his pieces to his opponent's starting positions and has captured the majority of neutral pieces wins the game. Any other outcome is a draw.<br/><br/>",

On each of the tiles, there is one character: A dragon, a knight, a king, a princess and a horse. The active player rolls a die. If the result is a number, the player moves any character forward by that number of tiles. If it shows the dragon, s/he moves the dragon by one tile. If the dragon ever reaches the princess, the two of them move together from now on. If the black hat is rolled, a card is flipped over: It shows the character that has to move one tile forward. The six cards form a puzzle of the evil count. If the players manage to get all characters onto the same tile before the puzzle is complete, they win; if not, they all lose.<br/><br/>",

Since I had no experience planning wedding party games, I went online to look for ideas, and found plenty of them that were extremely lame. I knew Nicky deserved better. I was playing a lot of Cards Against Humanity at the time, so was inspired to create a card game that honors the glorious institution that is matrimony, while also preparing my friend for the all frightening realities and ceremonial absurdity of humanity&rsquo;s most fraught life-long commitment. The game I made for Nicky on my laptop and home printer was as hilarious, embarrassing, depraved, and satisfying as marriage itself. So I decided I should share it with everyone.<br/><br/>The game is simple to play: one person reads a question or fill-in-the-blank card aloud to a group of friends. Each player then gives an answer card that they think best responds. The reader picks the response they like best. The questions and clues are both a parody and a celebration of all our bizarre cultural hang-ups around weddings and marriage, and funny enough to make champagne squirt out your nose.<br/><br/>",

A tossed rock card must be from at least 2 feet way, it most be from at least 1 foot in the air, it must flip over at least once in the air, and it must no land with the 'miss' side up.  Players each toss six rocks, and then then player who destroyed the most wall segments wins.<br/><br/>From the Box:<br/>Only one Baron can rule the realm.  Will it be you?  To master the land you must build a mighty fortress and once safe behind your walls, rain rocky death from the skies upon your rivals.  Do you have what it takes to reign supreme?<br/><br/>Clash of Catapults pits 2-6 players against each other in a battle to build mighty fortifications then destroy them with catapult rocks in crazy card flipping action.<br/><br/>",

They are vulgar, sexual, positional, provocative, and just crazy. You will ask yourself, &quot;do people actually do these things?&quot; at least once every game.<br/><br/>But watch out, not every card in the Dictionary is Lewd and Obscene. Your creativity may get ahead of yourself. In that sense, you'll need to &quot;get your mind out of the gutter.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Lewd and Obscene is an adult party game.<br/><br/>The game begins by picking a card from the Dictionary. The word is read aloud but the definition remains a mystery to everyone except the picker.<br/><br/>Players try their best to define the word. They write their made-up definition to the word on their &quot;Definition Slip&quot;.<br/><br/>When all players are finished defining words, the slips are turned in, mixed up, and read aloud. After all definitions have been read, voting takes place.<br/><br/>When voting, tally points on the definition slip. If you convince a player to vote for your definition, you receive one (1) point. If you vote for the correct definition, you receive two (1) points. Once all the scores are collected, the next player picks a new card and starts all over.<br/><br/>Upon starting, you will all agree to a score to end on and once that has been reached, you will have your winner.<br/><br/>",

As few as 5,000 of these games were made in 1935 before patent 2,026,082 was granted giving Parker Brothers proprietary rights to Monopoly. The name Fortune was then added to Finance which became Finance and Fortune until Parker Brothers used the name Fortune for another game in 1958.<br/><br/>The main differences from Monopoly are: game board design, hotel color, and that the Property cards seem to be based on the streets of New York City.<br/><br/>",

The game features several play mode and levels of play to learn the game at a steadier pace. It features unique strategic elements not seen in other card/board games.<br/><br/>This game is a mostly card based game but not classified as a trading card game (Like Magic the Gathering) nor a deck building game (Like Dominion). It's a good, plain, draw a card, strategy card game and you have to adjust as the game goes on depending on what you draw.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds where each player takes a turn. The turn order unfolds in 7 steps and you play with 5 stacks of cards: Symptoms, Resistances, Transmissions, Locations and Objectives . A basic turn is composed of these actions :<br/><br/><br/>    Get your turn's energy<br/>    Draw some cards<br/>    Play the cards in your hand<br/>    Attempt to kill<br/>    Attempt to infect the world<br/>    Complete objectives<br/>    Discard unwanted cards<br/><br/><br/>To infect, you must first play cards from your hand that you draw on each turn. Laying down a location makes it possible to infect it, but you also need one or more symptom to make that happen. Getting some transmission vectors and resistances will help you along the way to reduce negative aspects or increase the infectivity of your disease. As the game proggresses, you will play objective cards and complete them to get victory points which will eventually make you win the game.<br/><br/>",

To win, find that map and hold on to it, surviving the round - or be the last pirate alive with the lowest ranking card.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>&bull; Each player is dealt two cards.<br/><br/>&bull; Players can choose to use one or two cards against their opponents, discard and draw a new card, or bluff.<br/><br/>&bull; A player can bluff as long as they have at least one card of the card type needed to perform an action in their <br/>hand.<br/><br/>Example: Danielle has one &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; card and one &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in her hand. She decides that she wants to use the <br/>special ability that requires two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. This special requires that every player with a &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; <br/>card must place the grog card face up in front of them.  That card is out of play for the rest of the game.  Those players now may only have one card in their hand.<br/><br/>&bull; If a player does not believe that another player has the cards to do the action they just performed, they may call <br/>the player&rsquo;s bluff.  If the first player was lying, they have to reveal the card that was the lie, and they discard their remaining card and draw a new one.<br/><br/>Example: John doesn&rsquo;t believe Danielle has two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. He calls her bluff. As Danielle did not have <br/>two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards, she places the &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in front of her, as it was the lie - and that card is now <br/>out of play. She then discards her &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; and draws a new card.  She is now down to having only one card in her hand.<br/><br/>&bull; When the deck runs out of cards, the discard pile may be shuffled back in to form the draw pile.<br/><br/>&bull; When there are no more cards to be drawn and no discard pile, the players that are still alive reveal their hands and what is stored in their &ldquo;Smuggler's Chambers&rdquo;.  The player with the lowest numbered card wins.<br/><br/>Drop Box location for PnP rules are located here.<br/>Drop Box location for high-quality PnP card art is located here.<br/><br/>This game won first place for the 24 hour contest - March 2014.<br/><br/>",

The scale of the rules is designed for fighting the larger battles of antiquity, where armies would number 25,000 men or more, on an average sized table.<br/><br/>Missile and melee combat has been designed to reflect the fatigue and decline in fighting ability during the course of the battle.  While it is possible to defeat an opposing force with missile fire it will take quite a while compared to engaging in melee.  As troops take casualties, their morale will decline with one side usually routing from the field while the victor will usually only have a few losses.<br/><br/>As for battlefield tactics, one thing you will find is that using multiple lines and a reserve, though creating a narrower front, will have an advantage over an army arrayed in a single battle line with no reserve.  Attacking with fresh troops against fatigued enemies will usually result in victory for the army with the fresh troops.&quot;<br/><br/>",

And then there is the 6-sided colour die.<br/><br/>From the publishers description on the back side of the game box: Tschu-tschu-tschu... the railroad is a colour die game made from wood. When the locomotive is steaming and ready the train be quite quick. Two or more build a common train or build their own one. Made from wood, so childrens hands can have a strong grip too. The game: From the wooden tiles coloured trains are built. The die sets the colour so everyone has a chance in this fast-paced tile laying game made out of wood.<br/><br/>The rulebook suggests two games: In one game one locomotive is put in the middle of the table. The wagons are shuffled and dealt to the players. The players take turns rolling the die and then adding to the locomotive if they have rolled the appropriate colour or black which is a joker in this game. The first player getting rid of all his/her wagon tiles is the rounds winner and gets a conductor tile. After 4 rounds the game ends, the player with the most conductors wins.<br/><br/>In a second variant each player gets a locomotive and the wagon tiles are put in the middle of the table. Then there must be an agreement which train will be the winning one: The longest one, the most colourful on or one in a single colour. Players take turns rolling the die and taking a wagon of the rolled colour. The rulebook is unclear if taking a wagon is optional or compulsory in this variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/>Investo is a game of High Finance for three or more players. Play consists of investing In various companies, and receiving from the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank, Dividends and Bonuses in accordance with Instructions on a number of cards drawn by the players in rotation. Companies become bankrupt by the drawing of one of the Bankrupt cards.<br/><br/>TO BEGIN. One of the players is selected as Banker, and issues each of the players with &pound;1,000 with which to make his or her investments; retaining the balance of the money as the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank. (The Banker is entitled to join in the game, and should also receive the initial &pound;1,000.) The cards are then shuffled and placed face downwards in the centre of the table. The cards representing the ten companies are shuffled separately and placed face downwards beside the Banker, who is at all times in charge of the game. A number of company cards are then turned face upwards, in front of the Banker; the number so faced being one less than the number of players. (e.g. If five people are playing, then four company cards are turned up.) Players now invest in one or more of the companies as desired. All investments must be in multiples of &pound;100. The Banker keeps a record of all investments.<br/> THE PLAY. The first player (determined by any method desired) then draws the top card and places it face up in front of him. Each card has a number of the top representing one of the companies. If the player drawing the card has invested in that company, he announces the dividend (e.g. No. 4 &mdash;30% or 6/- in the &pound;). The Banker thereupon pays ALL players who have invested in No. 4 company, 30% of their investment, from the money in the Bank. Should the player not have invested in the company whose card is drawn, the play passes to the person next on his left, and so on round the table; each player announcing the dividend or bonus to be paid. ONLY If he has money invested in the company.<br/><br/>BANKRUPTCY. On a player drawing a &quot;BANKRUPT&quot; card for the company in which he has invested, he announces &quot;No. 7 &mdash;Bankrupt&quot;, and then reads the directions as to payment to or from the Bank (e.g. &quot;Shareholders must pay in 10/- for every &pound; invested, to meet the liabilities of the Company.&quot;) or &quot;Shareholders receive 5/- for every &pound; invested in the Company, from the sale of assets,&quot; as the case may be. The Banker then collects the money from, or pays the money to, the shareholders in accordance with the instructions. After all the players have paid or received their money, the Banker removes the bankrupt company from play and exposes the next company card. Any player who had invested in the company that was just bankrupt now has the opportunity to invest in the new company. There is no compulsion, and a player who has money invested in another company may elect not to invest in the new company. On oil investments being completed and recorded by the Banker, play continues with the next player.<br/><br/>CHANGE OF INVESTMENT. Changes in investments can only be made when all the cards have been drown. All changes must be recorded by the banker who makes a charge of 10% on the total investment for the issue of the new &quot;Script&quot;. (e.g. a player increases his investment as one of the companies from &pound;200 to &pound;500. The Banker charges &pound;50.). <br/>GENERAL. After all the cards have been drawn, they are re-shuffled, placed face down, and commeacing with the player on the left of the person who drew the last card, play re-commences. When a company is bankrupt and there are no more companies to be exposed, the players who had invested in the last company to go bankrupt may choose any ONE of the remaining companies in which to invest. The game is cancluded when the last company is bankrupt. The winner is the player who finishes the game with the most money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "D24 Wrestling can be played with one to four players. It combines the elements of dice rolling (with a D24 die!) action, strategy, role play and simulation into one awesome package, with matches taking place in real-time!<br/><br/>D24 Wrestling features faces (good guys), heels (bad guys), combining for a total of 20 unique playing cards. Each card has a full color illustration on the front, and game play stats on the back. We have main event stars (like Superbandit, Goliath, all the way down to low carders like Tadpole). The unpredictability of the D24 die adds to the &quot;anything can happen&quot; feel of the game!<br/><br/>There are two versions of the game: basic and advanced. A &quot;basic&quot; match begins when two players roll the d24 to see which wrestler will start on offense. The player that gained control will then roll on his wrestler's offensive set (each wrestler has 24 moves, including their finisher(s)! For the offensive wrestler to stay in control, he must roll successfully vs. the skill rating (power, speed, technical, brawling, aerial and striking). The offensive wrestler loses control when he does not roll successfully vs. his skill rating; then the opponent takes over on offense (just like a real match!). When a wrestler hits their finisher, the opponent must roll their 3-Count or Submission Rating, plus the opponent's finisher rating, to see if he is defeated. If the opponent rolls their 3-Count Rating or below, the match is over and the opponent wins (there are also other random ways to win, such as pin scenarios on the &quot;Into the Ropes Action Chart&quot;).<br/><br/>The advanced game turns up the heat with more strategy options and player input. The advanced game allows a wrestler to attempt pins up to three times during the course of a match. Strength of moves is taken into account (some moves are more damaging than others). Maximum Damage Points from close pins/submission attempts, and finishers indicate how hurt a wrestler is, including blood! The advanced game also allows for wrestlers to use steel chairs and other foreign objects...but be careful, a disqualification may result! Other options found in the advanced version: exiting the ring, suicida moves, finisher counters, submission wrestling--you have four turns to get out of a basic submission move, and three for a submission finisher--or you tap out!<br/><br/>The game comes complete with a storyline that also allows you to take on the role of owner/booker/promoter and run your own version of WOX! Crown champions, develop feuds, determine rankings, create TV and house shows that culminate in pay per views! Schedule tournament and play nights or focus on the storyline element of the game...you're in charge!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Peides Curse: Earth is a strategic and tactical game in which players take on the role of heroes who are embarking on an audacious and dangerous rescue mission. They face the uncertainty of time travel that bring them to the future year of 2223 where they will join the Spirit and fight a tough battle to stop the power of Evil. In order to accomplish the objective of their mission, the players shall participate in the race of their lives to find 9 secret codes that will stop Evil from wielding its power and destroying Earth.<br/><br/>Each player is required to put into motion his or her most strategic plan and creative cunningness to plot successfully and beat the other players to be the first to find all the secret codes. The game uses two different decks of power card play / power travel to help the players navigate to their designated mission destination. In this phase, players must cleverly maneuver their moves to put into motion their plans and strategy. The game play takes on an infusion of race and prior planning. High levels of strategy deployment or plotting, combined with tactical maneuvers, is required.<br/><br/>In the quest to ﬁnd the secret codes, the players are required to follow the clues which will lead them to where they are hidden. They then need to decipher the code with the decoder dices. Successful attempts shall be rewarded with energy points and battle ﬂags. They are both critical game changing components that will propel the players to lead in the game.<br/><br/>The last phase of the race shall see them being pitted in the battle between the Spirit and Evil. Here, the players will be able to deploy actions or movements that will keep them safe. The battle card may also be a game killer if it is played correctly. The players need to be extra cautious at this stage because they may well fall prey to 3 &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; cards in the stack. This can cause them to deplete their Vourton power and lose a turn when they meet face to face with Evil. However, all is not lost. There are saviour cards that will restore the players&rsquo; power immediately without losing a turn.<br/><br/>",

Those clones you let escape from the Primordial Soup Kitchen a while back have made it all the way to the Garden of Smellemental Glee. You better nab them before things get out of hand. Or more out of hand, as the case may be, or, apparently, is. Oh, and watch out for hungry beasts and whatnot while you're out there. It'll take every modicum of brainularity you own to make it through this fast-paced and exciting expansion to the Dementalism card game, not to mention a shlode of luck and a few yorts of good old-fashioned courage. Also, an unspecified amount of gumption. May be played on its own or added to the Dementalism: An Ingenious Game of Ingenious Ingeniousness deck (MOC30001) and other Dementalism expansions. This 60 card expansion to the Dementalism game contains several new Denizens, Giggities (wild cards), and Turmoil Cards and introduces new Beast cards to the game.<br/><br/>",

This is achieved by capturing a number of defined objectives while simultaneously destroying enemy units. The &lsquo;Initiating Player&rsquo; commences their game turn by selecting a particular command (usually a Company or Squadron) and then attempts to move and fire it in order to attain their game objective(s). The game turn is relinquished to the opposing player immediately the current &lsquo;initiating player&rsquo;s&rsquo; selected command fails a morale test. If the command passes a required morale test it continues to move and or fire until it either completes its current orders or fails a subsequent morale test. Command Morale tests are always carried out immediately a platoon is disabled. Once the currently selected command completes all the tasks the initiating player requires of it and it passes all required morale tests, the player may select another command to move and fight or they may relinquish the initiative to the opposing player.<br/><br/>Constructing a force<br/>Both players begin the game with 6 command headquarters of any type within their selected country organisation. Once the types of commands are established, each player rolls 2D6 for each command and this represents the number of platoons or batteries contained in each<br/>command. If larger forces are required, players keep adding blocks of command headquarters as required. Commands may not exceed their T&amp;OE strengths.<br/><br/>",

Each space shows the first part of a mathematical expression, which is completed by the result of the spinning top. The amount of the whole expression is the number of spaces the cap can move forward. This game can be played like &quot;Pachisi&quot; or &quot;Trap the Cap&quot;.<br/><br/>Game 1: Be the first catching all other caps/acting by turns <br/>Board is entered on an 'A'-space. Players move their &quot;caps&quot; around the board according spinner. If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his/her cap on top of the stack. The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board. Caps on spaces with an 'F' or matching color can't be caught. Ending on a 'F'-space all captured caps must be released.<br/><br/>Game 2: More like Pachisi (kicking out other ones), but additionally players must perform one of the 4 basic arithmetic operations (according spinner &amp; space) moving their meeples.<br/><br/>",

If you have the appropriate counter card, you can ignore the distraction.<br/><br/>A simple discard mechanic adds a subtle layer of strategy: choose which cards to hold or discard, keeping your defensive cards, or going on the offense. Wild cards like &quot;Flat Tire!&quot; and &quot;Bully!&quot; help you stick it to your opponent and gain an upper hand.<br/><br/>Once you throw your paper, turn over a card from the green &quot;Toss Deck,&quot; to see how good your throw was. With every successful paper toss, you gain a Paper Token. The first player to collect 10 Tokens wins the game! Can you be the first one to toss all your papers?<br/><br/>",

He patented the game in 1933 and once again (with slightly altered rules) in 1969. It was described by the Czech game expert Milo&scaron; Zapletal in his book &quot;Velk&aacute; kniha deskov&yacute;ch her&quot; published in 1991. The game is played on a 10x10 square board with 10 flags, two missiles, two 4-jet planes, two field guns, two tanks and two generals per player. |In the 1933 patent, the flags were called &quot;regiments&quot;, the missiles &quot;airships&quot;, the 4-jet planes &quot;aeroplanes&quot; and the generals &quot;commanders&quot;.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to conquer one of the opponent's &quot;capitals&quot;, that is, one of the squares the opponent's generals started on. Today the patent specifications (GB19330001481 19330117 and GB19690023908 19690510) are freely available on the internet so that the exact rules can be studied there. The game has at least as much strategic depth and tactical choices as ordinary chess, but draws are much less frequent due to the specific architecture of the game's design.<br/><br/>",

The player that gets the most money will win the game.<br/><br/>In this game, there are two customers on the table and they need some goods such as shoes, clothes, etc.  Each player has three cards and on their turn must choose one of three actions:<br/><br/>1. Play cards: You can play up to three cards, face-down, so you can bluff. If somebody think you are bluffing, they may call &quot;check&quot; and reveal all of your cards this turn. If they called your bluff correctly, you must pay them $100 per card, otherwise they pay you $100 per card.<br/><br/>2. Finish a sale: If you think most cards on a customer are correct, you can finish the set and sell them. If most cards are correct, you can earn lots of money. On the other hand, if most cards are incorrect, you have to pay money back to the customer.<br/><br/>3. Change your cards: pay $200, redraw five cards and keep three.<br/><br/>This game is very is to learn and play. In most case, if you want to play correct card, you have to trick the other players because they want to &quot;check&quot; you. If you want to play an incorrect card, you have to trick them to sell the product and lose lots of money. In this game, trickery is the most important thing.<br/><br/>",

However, among the voting crew memebers are those that are already infected and who want to infect the entire crew. Other players each have a special ability they can use to spread or to stop the infection.

        "description": "Simon Swipe the Card Game for when you feel like defeating your friends with cards instead of the game. Be the first player to get rid of your cards each round and have the lowest score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. A round ends when one player has played all his cards. You then tally your points and the player to the left shuffles and deals a new hand.<br/><br/>Each player begins with 9 cards, the the top card of the draw deck is flipped over, if its a wild card keep flipping. This determines the first card of the pattern.<br/><br/>On your turn place a matching color, swipe or wild card on top of the first card.If you cannot play a card you must keep drawing till you do. Then place another card next to the first one, keep doing this until you run out of cards. You can start a pattern even if you can't finish it. If you finish it and have a card left over, add it to the pattern.<br/><br/>When one person runs out of cards, its time to tally points. Any cards left in your hand are equal to 1 point. when 1 person gets to 15 points then the game is over. If no one gets 15 points that hand, then shuffle the cards and play another hand. If there is a tie all tied players win.<br/><br/>",

Whoever finishes first is the winner. There are also cards what add or substract the movements of players&acute;s pawns in this game.<br/><br/>A crowd-funded &lsquo;patriotic&rsquo; board game about reclaiming Estonia after a Russian invasion has become a hit in the Baltic state, feeding on popular fears about the geopolitical ambitions of the country&rsquo;s eastern neighbor.<br/><br/>Named &lsquo;Comrade Pu conquers Estonia&rsquo; &ndash; the monicker is a popular local nickname for Vladimir Putin &ndash; the board game features a recognizable caricature of the Russian president on the front of its box, though it does not mention him by name.<br/><br/>In a variant of Snakes and Ladders, the players have to &lsquo;fight back&rsquo; from the Western border of the state, which became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, with the help of dice. Instead of ladders, players pull out cards that may help or hinder their progress. &ldquo;Pu wins the Nobel Peace Prize&rdquo; sets the player one step back, while &ldquo;Kazakhstan is prevented from joining Russia&rsquo;s side&rdquo; lets them get one ahead.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The idea of the game was born during the events of last spring in Ukraine,&rdquo; Taavi Emajoe told the Russian-language Delfi website in Estonia. &ldquo;We hope people find the game humorous. There is nothing unethical about political satire.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Emajoe, who was working on another game with two other young designers, before the spark of inspiration, says the game wouldn&rsquo;t have worked without Putin.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We chose Putin not to create animosity towards him, but because he is such a multi-dimensional political figure. Most of the ideas in the game are derived directly from his persona.&rdquo;<br/><br/>After easily passing the &euro;1,500 (US$1,734) funding requirement on the local version of Kickstarter, the game has now hit the shelves, retailing at &euro;23.45 ($27).<br/><br/>The manager of Tallinn&rsquo;s leading Apollo bookshop, Liis Paas, told Delfi that the game has been &ldquo;attracting a heightened level of attention&rdquo; from curious shoppers. However, the manager did not elaborate whether interest had transformed into sales.<br/><br/>Estonia is historically sensitive about being invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and local politicians still frequently evoke the specter of a Russian invasion, despite the country being a member of NATO and the EU.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, satirical board games about Putin &ndash; often based on Snakes and Ladders &ndash; have previously appeared in Russian and Western media following a whirlwind year for the Kremlin, mostly as playful illustrations, not actual games to be played with pieces and dice.<br/><br/>Satirical board games have enjoyed a mixed history, with acclaim depending largely on the players&rsquo; political orientation. The US board game War on Terror &ndash; which satirizes US foreign policy and forces players to temporarily don balaclavas as they face American wrath &ndash; is still popular, while the pre-WWII Juden Raus, in which German players had to &ldquo;round up Jews&rdquo; and &ldquo;push them off the board&rdquo; enjoys a different sort of notoriety.<br/><br/>",

Soon you'll have no place to stand; can you escape before that happens?<br/><br/>In the solitaire game Flakes of Ice, you want to be standing on the last bit of ice after the rest of the glacier melts.<br/><br/>The game consists of seven hexes, one that bears the game logo (which is placed in the center of the playing area) and six that bear three pairs of colored symbols (which are placed at random around the central hex). To start, you place a player token on the central hex.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first move a hexagon by rotating it 60&ordm; in either direction, or by swapping it with a neighboring hexagon or the hexagon on the opposite side of the glacier (keeping their orientations the same in the latter case). You then move the player token from a hexagon to a neighboring hexagon or the opposite hexagon &mdash; but only if these hexagons are both connected to the central hex by the same colored symbol. (On the first turn, you move the player token from the central hex to any hex of your choice.) You then flip over the glacier hex that you left to show ocean water.<br/><br/>If you can't move your player token legally, you lose the game; if you can move it six turns, then you'll be standing on the last piece of ice, victorious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FlipFight is a series of strategic manual dexterity micro-games. Battle of Gettysburg is the first game in the FlipFight series. The game pits Union and Confederate forces against each other in the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.<br/><br/>The players assume the roles of field commanders during the battle with access to different cavalry and infantry units. At the beginning of each game the battlefield is dynamically generated from a deck of key strategic locations -- from Round Top and the Devil's Den to Cemetery Hill and Seminary Ridge -- ensuring no two games will be the same.<br/><br/>On their turns, players select a combat unit from their reserves and flip it onto the battlefield in an attempt to seize control of a location or capture enemy forces to gain victory points. Infantry and cavalry units are not only different shapes, each has distinct strengths -- capturing a location featuring High Ground with infantry allows the player to perform an artillery strike, while cavalry can capture enemy infantry forces and remain in field.<br/><br/>Each strategic location has different values representing how difficult they were to control (units needed), and how valuable they were to each side's efforts (victory points). Combat units have varying levels of effectiveness, representing the makeup of their forces and the quality of their leadership.<br/><br/>The first player to earn 10 Victory Points through control of key locations or captured enemy forces wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Each player draws four cards, and then one person takes the top four cards of the deck and places them face up in a row next to it. Decide who goes first. During each of their turns, players will look at the cards in their hands and the cards face up next to the deck in order to pair up two cards, Penny to one of her Monsters or Alfi to one of his Monsters(or vice versa).

However, you also lead the barbarians fighting against the people.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a number of settlements in different sizes; hamlets, villages, towns and cities. The first player to place all of them on the board is the winner.<br/><br/>The world is made up of tiles of different kinds - foundations for settlements, resources necessary for settlements, and useless wastelands. At the start, the world is terra incognita and all tiles are turned face down, waiting to be explored by the units.<br/><br/>The units in the world are of two kinds - explorers and barbarians. They do not belong to particular players but any player may act with them. Explorers may explore a tile (move to it and look at it privately) or exploit a tile (turn it face up and make it available for all players). Barbarians on the other hand plunder tiles and turn them face down again.<br/><br/>By turning tiles face up or face down, players may make more or less resources connected to settlements. This allows the settlement to be expanded or expelled and the player to replace the existing settlement with one from the hand.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game is to play the common units so that the right settlement can be played in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>There are no such things as &rdquo;mine&rdquo; and &rdquo;yours&rdquo;, nor such things as &rdquo;good&rdquo; and &rdquo;evil&rdquo;. All units are commonly played, whether they be explorers or barbarians. To win, you must use the common resources to rise above the commons, not unlike the challenges of a real leader!<br/><br/>",

Each time a player touches a piece of evidence, they learn what it is, but unfortunately now that evidence points to their involvement in the crime!<br/><br/>The games uses 17 cards, 16 of which are laid out in a 4x4 grid with the 17th card in the active player's hand. Each card has an arrow on the back of it, and during play these arrows point at the players.<br/><br/>On a turn, you have the one extra card in hand and pick up any card from the board. You choose one of these cards and place it face-down in the empty space with the arrow pointing to you; to end your turn, pass the card still in hand to your left-hand opponent, who now takes their turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can also make an accusation. To do this, name a weapon and a motive, then pick up two cards pointing to the same opponent and look at them. If these cards match what you said, reveal these cards to everyone because you've just won the game; if you're wrong, however, place these cards facedown once again, but now pointing at yourself.<br/><br/>Each card also has a special reveal benefit. When you place a card facedown on the board pointing at yourself, normally only you know what that card is; if you reveal the card, everyone now knows what it is, but you get to do the reveal benefit on that card, e.g., looking at cards without pointing them at yourself or rotating cards to point at opponents.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt three cards each, and three more cards are placed face-down on the table. Starting with the player who's most recently had Chikuwa, each player may swap two cards from their hand with those on the table, or they may pass. Going clockwise, once each player has had their turn, the cards on the table are shuffled back into the deck, and another three are dealt face-down. Going back the other way, the players repeat their turn to swap one or two cards in their hand. Lastly, everyone shows their hand.<br/><br/>The aim is to get the best ranking combination of three cards. In the game, 3-3-3 is the worst of all, since you have been a greedy cat and stuffed yourself until you've got stomach-ache. 0-0-0 is the best combination, since the owners see you've been so unselfish and punish the other cats by giving you their food. But after 0-0-0, the best combo is 3-3-2, then 3-2-2, then 3-3-1 and so on, down to 1-0-0 which beats 3-3-3. So, by bluffing and guessing, can you work up to a high ranking hand, or do you risk holding 0s in the aim of winning all?<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>いつも仲良しのネコ達ですが、今日のごはんにみんな大好物のちくわがご飯のため、目の色を変えて奪い合います。ただし、食べ過ぎや仲良く食べていないと大変な目にあうかもしれません。<br/>遊び方は、とても簡単です。<br/>スタートプレイヤーから時計回りに中央の伏せカードから最大２枚まで手札を交換し、その後シャッフルします。今度は最後の人から半時計周りに同じ事を行い3枚の数字の合計が一番高い人が勝利となります。<br/>ただし、１番強い数字は食べ過ぎて１番弱なり、１番低い数字は仲良く食べてない事がばれ１番強くなります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VERBA is the new language learning card game developed by The Pericles Group. The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.<br/><br/>All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.<br/><br/>This is a core set specially tailored for novice level Spanish learners and works great in or out of the classroom!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Children's game. The board represents a swimming pool. Before play starts, place the 25 tiles face-down, one in each square.<br/>Players roll a colour die and may take a face-down tile related to that column or row which matches the colour thrown. If you roll a 'white' then you may choose any colour. 13 of the 25 tiles have a rubber ring on them and twelve are without a ring. When the pool is 'empty', players count up their tiles with rings and the one with them most, wins.<br/><br/>The 2nd game indicated in the rules is for older children. This time two colour dice are rolled together and draw the tile indicated by looking along a row indicated by one dice and also down the column indicated by the 2nd die. In addition, depending on the colours rolled, there are opportunities to give 'empty' tiles to other players or you may lose a tile you have previously taken. When all the tiles are taken, you add up your tiles with rings and subtract the tiles you have without rings. The highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

Two groups of citizens have come to blows over missing taxes, and pursue each other across the forum plaza and in its surrounding corridors. All pieces move orthogonally, with the aim being to trap their enemies while avoiding capture themselves. Capture is by blocking. Once trapped, hapless citizens are quickly dispatched (removed from the board). A Magistrate and two forum guards have wavering allegiances, and swap sides each time citizens are murdered. The two guards can also take part in capture. The winner is the player to eliminate all the opposing player's pieces. Leather board and wooden gaming pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of the game is to score as few points as possible. This is achieved by answering questions about capitals, and by getting rid of ones cards before the opponents do so. There are five series of cards (matching five different colors), and the cards are all numbered from 1 to 6. All cards has a country, a flag, and the country's capital printed on it.<br/><br/>The first player starts by playing card #4 in any color. He/she also asks the player to his left if he/she can match the country with its capital. If the player doesn't know the answer, he/she adds as many points as the card shows to his/her score. Play continues with the next player playing either another #4 card, or a #3/#5 card in the color already played. If a player is unable to play a card, he has to draw cards from the deck (up to a maximum of three cards). Game ends when the deck runs out of cards. Players with cards on their hands add up their scores. The scores are adjusted with earned minus points from answering the questions about the capitals.<br/><br/>The game resembles The Game of Capitals from 1933, but this version adds some more rules, and expands gameplay to include card placement resembling that in &quot;Sevens&quot; (also known as &quot;Ruter Sju&quot;, &quot;Laying Out Sevens&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;, &quot;Crazy Sevens&quot;, or &quot;Parliament&quot;).<br/><br/>",

If they land on an &quot;Erogenous Zone&quot; space they are asked a question from a card but instead of being right or wrong the answer has to satisfy their Dealer. Once they have all six rings from the outside Capital Zones they move towards the center Erogenous Center space and try to answer an Erogenous Zone question there. If their answer satisfies the Dealer, they win. If not, they must leave the Erogenous Center on the next turn and return again.<br/><br/>",

The more times you play, the more words and combinations you will learn to make.<br/><br/>Start by choosing a dealer. The dealer deals out six cards to every player. After the deal is over, the dealer puts the rest of the deck face down to create a draw pile. He then draws 7 cards and places them face up in the middle of the table creating the community cards for everyone to play off of.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player uses the cards in their hands to make the best scoring word possible by laying them on top of the cards placed in the middle. Scores their turn, then draws from the draw pile to make up for the cards they just played. The next player then plays their cards on top of the cards the previous player just played creating a new word and also new community cards. Each time a player plays the community cards and the players cards change, creating a constant change to the game every turn. Game play continues until all the cards are gone from the draw pile. The highest scorer wins.<br/><br/>Bonus cards include double word points, skips, wilds, and switches.<br/><br/>",

In what castle tower is he now? Find the Falcon Knight and, as a thank-you, receive part of the treasure.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts. The game continues in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>The person whose turn it is hides the knight underneath one of the two castle towers or under the bell tower. At the same time, the other players close their eyes or turn around and keep their ears pricked up! Maybe it gives out a telltale ring and you can work out where the knight is being concealed. Once the knight has been hidden, all the players can open their eyes again or turn back to the game and, in turn, guess where they think the knight is hiding. Each tower has a different colour, so that you just have to say the colour out loud. You are not allowed to touch or lift up the towers until everyone has had their guess.<br/>Before the secret is disclosed, you draw your bet. If you think the knight is under the bell tower, you take two jewels out of the linen bag &ndash; no looking! If you think he is under one of the other two towers, you just take one jewel. Place the jewels in front of you (do not yet put them into the treasure chest): you only get to keep them if you have guessed correctly.<br/>Now the player who hid the knight discloses the secret and lifts up the tower hiding the knight.<br/>Did you guess right? Great! Then you get to keep the jewel(s) and put them into your treasure chest.<br/>All the players that guessed wrongly throw the jewels they had just drawn into the jewel tower.<br/>The player that hid the knight this round gets to keep any jewels that fall out of the tower.<br/>If you have too many of one type of jewel (more than four of one colour), throw the extra ones back into the linen bag and shake well.<br/>It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>The first player to collect four green emeralds and four white diamonds wins the game, and leaves the castle as the victor.<br/><br/>",

Each people is led by one secret player, who rules its fate and claims its victory points.

Each of the 6 peoples have 12 tribes that are randomly distributed over the world. Each player has a secret subject people and a secret ally people each age.<br/><br/>The players take turns to move tribes, always closer to populated regions where there is space left for them, and group them into settlements.

However, those increases will benefit the leader of the next age<br/><br/>In Peoples, you are faced with tough tactical and strategic questions. Should you enrich your people this age and risk having a poor people the next? Should you make advances that benefit several settlements or only your own?

The goal is moving a pawn into a field having a hole with the same shape. When this occurs you can get a victory token. To take a step with a pawn, you need to roll with 2 dice. The first die identifies the number of steps, the second die identifies the color, so if you roll green and 2 you have to take 2 steps with one of the green pawns.<br/>  If you roll a star with the color die, you need to select a color token from the face-down pile and a shape token also from the face-down pile and these identify which pawn you must move.<br/>  The game ends when all pawns fell down in the holes.<br/> The player with the most victory tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>",

(Hannin Ha Kono Naka Ni Iru!) means &quot;The culprit is right here with us!&quot; in English.<br/><br/>This card game follows the story-line of detective novels.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a character who has three characteristics: nationality, gender, and physique. Players play event cards, detective cards, trick cards, and story cards to determine the culprit's characteristics.<br/><br/>It is not important who is the culprit. Everyone just tries to brand another player as the culprit. You can earn big points by playing a scoring card named &quot;The culprit is right here with us!&quot;, which steals points from other players according to the number of characteristics that they share with the culprit. Or by finalizing the game with &quot;You are the culprit!&quot; scoring card, when the target player has all characteristics of the culprit.<br/><br/>A succession of turnovers may happen in a game, so play several times and add up the scores to determine the grand champion.<br/><br/>There is also an expansion to the game, called Shin Hannin wa Kono Naka ni Iru!<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>推理小説のストーリー展開をイメージしたゲームです。<br/>各プレイヤーには、国籍、性別、体格の３つの特徴を持った人物カードが割り当てられます。イベントカード、探偵カード、トリックカード、様々なストーリーカードを駆使しながら、犯人の特徴を決めていき、他のプレイヤーが犯人になるように陥れていきます。<br/>合致した特徴分の点数を全プレイヤーから奪う「犯人はこの中にいる！」で得点を稼ぎ、「犯人はお前だ！！」カードで確定出来れば、高得点を奪って1ゲーム終了となります。<br/>逆転につぐ逆転があるゲームなので、トータルで得点を競う連続ゲームがお勧めです。<br/><br/>",

With far more people wanting to live here than there are homes, rents have risen to record heights. However, building new housing isn't easy, with concerns about traffic, views, gentrification, and open space, to name just a few. Still, the problem can be solved, though not by San Francisco alone. You'll have to plan and build regionally.<br/><br/>In Bay Area Regional Planner, you'll be given some policy goals to fulfill.  On each round, you'll negotiate with the other players to decide where to zone for more housing.  Everyone must be in agreement, so get ready to compromise and make coalitions!<br/><br/>Bay Area Regional Planner is for 2-12 players and typical games run 60-120 minutes.<br/><br/>More than a game:<br/>You'll have more than just fun when playing Bay Area Regional Planner: you'll be navigating real world strategies and challenges in the Bay Area planning process.  Developed as an educational tool for the San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation, Bay Area Regional Planner tries to be as accurate as possible to actual issues and numbers.  Game data on commute time and current numbers of housing units are sourced from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) and the Association of Bay Area Governments' (ABAG) Bay Area Census.  Policy goals are based on actual feedback to regional plans at ABAG's Plan Bay Area public outreach workshops, and the consensus-based decision making is an abstraction of how the public process here works.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Math Rummy is a children's educational game designed to teach basic addition and subtraction. It was released in the Leapfrog My Card Games set. Although it shares a name, it bears little resemblance to the classic card game Rummy.<br/><br/>In Math Rummy, each player is dealt eight cards, each of which show a number (both the numeral and picture showing the matching number of cartoon bugs in a jar) or a plus or minus sign. On each player's turn he or she discard cards by making an equation (x +/- y = z) on the board.  If the player cannot do so, he or she draws a card from the draw deck or chooses a face-up card that left next to the draw deck. If an equation still is not possible, the player places one card of his or her choice on the face-up pile next to the draw deck and passes.  Once the first equation is made, all players play off that same equation on their turn by covering all or part of it with new cards, making sure to keep the equation correct.  After each player's turn, a marker is advanced on a turn track.  The game ends when one player uses all of his/her cards or when the turn marker reaches the lily pad after turn ten.  In that case, the player with the fewest cards wins.<br/><br/>",

They try to infiltrate a village and control it from inside.<br/><br/>There are six villagers in the village. You send your henchman werewolves into these villagers to control them. You gain victory points by controlling these villagers, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>A game consists of seven rounds. Do the following each round:<br/>1) Players play an initiative card simultaneously. The player with highest initiative value goes first. But if there's a tie for the initiative value, all tied players lose the opportunity to play this round. (In Japan, the mechanism that has the same cards or the tied values cancelling each other out is called &quot;butting&quot;.)<br/>2) Among non-tied players, in the initiative order, place your henchman on a villager. You may then activate that villager's special ability.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, for each villager, total your henchmen's influence points on that villager. You gain that villager's victory points if you have the highest influence points on that villager. But &quot;butting&quot; is applied here again; you cannot gain victory points if your influence points are tied with any other's.<br/><br/>Although this game is inspired by Werewolf, it is not a werewolf game. You send your henchmen in like worker placement, and determine the controller of each villager by majority of influence. And the &quot;butting&quot; and a little bit of bluffing are the keys to enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>「バッティング」とちょっとした「ブラフ」が楽しい人狼モチーフのカードゲームです！人狼一族をひきいて人間の村を支配することを目指します。<br/>村には得点の異なる6つの地区（エリア）があり、自分の狼を配置していくことでその地区を支配することができます。<br/>支配したエリアの合計得点が最も高いプレイヤーが勝利します。<br/>また、各エリアにいる、特殊能力を持つ村人たちを扇動することで、さまざまな能力を利用することができます。<br/><br/>",

Players try to collect 4 cards of equal value to earn that many points.<br/><br/>All gameplay is simultaneous. The 60 cards are divided evenly among all players so that each player has their own draw pile. At the shout of &quot;Get 'Em&quot; all players quickly draw 4 cards. Players can only hold 4 cards at a time. Players can put cards face up on the table, one at a time. Players can pick up cards, one at a time, Either from their draw pile or any face up card on the table. The first player to have 4 cards with matching point values in hand shouts out &quot;Got 'Em&quot; and scores points equal to the number on the 4 cards. Then all the cards are shuffled and redistributed and a new round begins. The first player to accumulate 150 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The colored symbol dice are thrown into the dice tower, showing new challenges every turn. The various symbols and colors have to be sorted. Which is the largest set? Skill is necessary when flicking the pieces. The more dice match the target space, the further the Knight can move.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The active player throws the six dice and a small wooden cube into the dice tower. The player then flicks a wooden disk. If he hits one of the target spaces, he claims the dice that show the matching result (color or symbol). Then the other players in turn order also flick the disk to try to claim some of the remaining dice. After this, the next player becomes the active player, and continues with throwing all dice into the tower.<br/><br/>Each die collected moves the player's knight one step forward. The first knight reaching to other side of the tower wins.<br/><br/>There are also rules for a variant in which the players bet which symbol they will roll, get points for matching symbols, and are able to change their bet by paying dice.<br/><br/>",

They get points for completing their own patterns (Waschi) or for completing patterns of their opponent (Wurti). Tile placement and movement is controlled by dice. If the player rolls a black 1, 2 or 3 he may place or move the corresponding number of tiles. On the roll of a red 1 or 2 he may move 1 or 2 tiles of an opponent player. If he rolls the black dot, he has to skip a turn. The game ends when a player gets two Waschi or two Wurti.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A book containing rules for miniature wargames covering the Napoleonic Wars using various figure scales frokm 5mm to 30 mm and various ground scales of 1mm:2yds to 1in:10yds.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>A criticism levelled at many books on wargaming is that they attempt to cover too wide a period of military history.  This book concentrates on one of the most active and interesting episodes in the history of warfare - the Napoleonic Wars.  The author firmly believes that wargames should duplicate the conditions and events of real warfare as far as is possible within the context of a set of rules.  Among the factors which he stresses are the use of realistic scales and the importance of morale.  He also believes that, provided the player has done his research, the rules should be flexible enough to allow him to employ unconventional tactics.  After all, neither Napoleon nor Wellington won their battles by sticking to previously accepted ideas on tactics.<br/>This book is the result of a long experience of wargaming and painstaking historical research.  Whether the reader accept the author's conclusions or not he will certainly find much both to enjoy and discuss.  The text is illustrated with eight pages of colour photographs and nearly 40 line drawings.<br/><br/>",

You and your team are represented by your colored pawn and you try to find the best solutions for controlling the Disasters and earn Merit points (i.e. Victory points) for that. There are colored fields on <br/>the game board showing potential Disaster Epicenters. The type of the Disaster and the Epicenter location are determined by a die roll (place) and a card draw (type). An Epicenter token is then placed on the place of the Disaster&rsquo;s origin on <br/>the Game board and Spread tokens are placed on the adjacent fields. Players use various Vehicles during their Turns to travel to as many Epicenter and Spread tokens as possible and take care of them. Each token collected in this way results <br/>in a Merit point.

In this case all players must return <br/>the Epicenter/Spread tokens &ndash; being Merit points at the same time - in the color of that particular Disaster.

However, in that fervor, your flock decreases and you will have to convert the villagers of the surrounding tribes to be ahead. Be sure to send your offering before someone does.<br/><br/>The game is played among 3 to 6 players and consists of a hand draft gameplay. Players need to place villagers in their play area adding later some &quot;task&quot; cards to make them prepare the offerings, to later on, play a ritual card to send the offerings to one of the three gods available. As soon the gods are satisfied with a specific amount of offerings they reward the player with special benefits and score points for him. Different gods with unique powers grant the player interaction and fast-paced game play.<br/><br/>",

Finally the world will see who will be the best badass of all. Your task will be to taste different dishes that have been blended to pulp, recognize their nutritional benefits and assign them to each star of your team, in order to bring him / her to their highest physical supremacy.<br/><br/>All the stars will face 4 Challenges: Strength, Resistance, Coolness and Charisma. But as we all know, physical strength is not enough. To win the Challenges you will need to let your stars drink cooked and blended dishes, so that every fiber of their organism can be pervaded by the right nutrients. Carbohydrates increase the strength, Fats increase the resistance, Proteins increase the coolness and Vitamins increase the charisma. Pay close attention, because the final victory will depend on your choices.<br/><br/>First of all each player gets 2 or 3 stars each (according to the number of players), revealing them.<br/>There are 2 stages: in the first one each player get some cards that represent dishes that have been blended with a drink. Each dish is divided into 5 ingredients. Players will place on the table 6 tokens (5 ingredients and 1 drink). All tokens are true (so they have a correspondence with those indicated on each card) but one, that is false. The opponents should guess whether an ingredient is true or false. They bet on one of theit choice thanks to their own double-faced token (1 side indicates TRUE, the other side indicates FALSE). Clearly betting on the false ingredient is harder, but it gives you a lot of rewards.<br/><br/>Betting on ingredients allow players to obtain nutrition cards, that can improve the basic values of the stars. Carbohydrates improve Strength, Fats improve Resistance, Proteins improve Coolness and Vitamins improve Charisma.<br/><br/>After all players played their dish cards allowing the opponents to guess ingredients and collect nutrition cards to assign to their stars, the stage 2 starts.<br/><br/>All stars will face 4 challenges: Strength, Resistance, Coolness and Charisma. Players reveals all cards of each challenge assigned to the stars. The character with the highest score gains 3 victory points, the second only 1. In case of tie all characters at the first position gain 2 VP, while all characters at the second one gain 1 VP.<br/>Then pass to the second challenge and so on. Each character, however, has a skill that can influence several moments of the game, making the results of the challenges always unpredictable.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the team's player with the highest rank (calculating the total amount of rewards of each star of his team) is the winner. In case of tie, the player with more nutrition cards assigned to his team is the winner. In further case of tie, players share the victory.<br/><br/>",

The board depicts the pre-railway horseback mail route route either from Melbourne Post Office westward to the Town of Ararat, or from the Sydney Post Office westward over the Blue Mountains to Bathurst. Hazards include broken bridges, bushrangers and bushfires.<br/><br/>At least three versions appear to have been published. <br/>The first, apparently from the 1890s, is set in Victoria. The Melbourne Post Office is depicted anachronistically as is was after the completion of its clock tower in 1887, and the race route is via Melton, Moorabool, Bacchus Marsh, Mt. Egerton, Lal Lal Creek, Mt. Buninyong, Lake Burrumbeet, and Mount Cole to Ararat, with an alternative route via Laverton, Werribee, Little River, North Shore and Geelong. Ararat asylum is shown as two small single-storied cottages. Hazards include bushrangers and bushfires. This version was specified as being for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>A second version, published c.1900, also depicts the Melbourne-Ararat route, but without the alternative route via Geelong. The quality of artwork and printing is improved, and the Ararat asylum is depicted as three large two-storied buildings. It was also billed on the back of the board as being for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>A third version of unknown publication date features the Sydney to Bathurst route and is subtitled &quot;a great entertainment&quot;. This version came with at least 5 playing pieces, so presumably was for 2-5 players. The rules-sheet includes an adventure story of a mailman's adventures along the route, intended to be read before playing the game, and which included footnotes relating the events of the story to the various penalty and reward spaces.<br/><br/>",

Some spaces are setbacks (Bull Run at 20 sends a player back to Washington), while the Andersonville and Libbey prison spaces traps a player until another player reaches a prisoner exchange space.<br/><br/>The back of the board both describes the game and shows how it was sold.

The spread of the Medfly created a political crisis in 1981 for Gov. Brown, and led to the start of aerial spraying in the state.

Players who land on a crop space take a card with a joke event that boosts one player and penalizes the other. The Brown player deploys four Malathion tokens and the Medfly player four larva tokens, which act as landmines sending the other player back four spaces.<br/><br/>If the Jerry Brown player wins, he makes it to the U.S. Senate and becomes a potential presidential candidate for 1984.

COURAGEOUS...<br/>that's what it takes to turn the next card in this exciting, fun game of cards.<br/><br/>The higher your score, the more MACHO it takes... Do you have it?<br/><br/>Any player starts the game by drawing and laying face up on the table one, or as many cards as he chooses, but he must draw at least one card. He may stop at any time. The points on each card are counted until the player stops, and are added to his score, unless he turns up a hog or a pig card during the draw. Hogs and Pigs can take away a player's points. Other MACHO cards can force a player to draw five cards with possibly devastating consequences. A game ends when a player scores 100 points or more. It's Press-Your-Luck-style gaming as you must choose carefully when deciding to draw the next card!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Embargo is a pick up and delivery game with play mechanics similar to Monopoly or Easy Money, but laced with political jabs...just look at the box cover. The game challenges players to deliver 9 barrels of oil to a port in each country, while trying to avoid going broke. Landing on a competitor&rsquo;s port (occupied by their colored barrel) makes you roll and multiply the dice together, then multiply them again by one thousand- ultimately paying that cost to the owner of that port.<br/><br/>While the goal is to deliver a barrel to each country you can forego that objective by placing all your barrels as strategically as possible, hoping to bankrupt the other players. This is a risky endeavor since you are preventing yourself the opportunity of an outright win, and you may end up going broke yourself while pursuing the rapid acquisition of ports.<br/><br/>With 4 players, ships are divided into pairs which navigate the oceans in opposite directions. Collisions with other ships are just one of the hazards when seafaring around the globe. Landing on an &quot;Embargo&quot; space causes you to pay $25,000 or lose your precious cargo of oil. Choosing the latter causes you to lose a turn the next time you want to reacquire another barrel of oil. Other spaces can reward you with a cash payout, which you can possibly double or triple with another roll of the dice...but beware, the wrong dice roll means you get nothing. Some spaces allow you to draw a card, most of which are fortuitous but some will be detrimental to your pocketbook.<br/><br/>Money can be tight in this game unless you land on a money space or the start space (yes, passing start nets you nothing), you draw a card or you have other players land on your ports. The player that delivers 9 barrels first or forces everyone else into bankruptcy is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players work together to build a web out of rubber bands laid across wooden dowels. Recommended age is 4 and up due to the game&rsquo;s minimal dexterity requirements and small components. Set-up and break down takes about 2 minutes each, while learning to play takes about 5 minutes. For your first time playing, from set-up to putting things back in the box takes about 45 minutes. A normal game will last about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Spider&rsquo;s Cradle is very quick to learn and play, especially for young children but offers dynamic spatial challenges for adults. Because the game is cooperative, parents can work directly to physically help children play and beat the game together. Spider&rsquo;s Cradle allows everyone to feel accomplished as each player will contribute to winning the game.<br/><br/>",

It is shared by both players to draw cards. There are 20 different kinds of units in the deck and these units are commanded onto the battlefield. Each unit has an ATTACK and a DEFENSE value. These values are used to dominate (attack) and hold (defend) a column. Some units also have ABILITIES (band, flank, rage, rally, and support) which give units additional skills than these two.<br/><br/>The battlefield is divided into five sections. Each section is called a &quot;column&quot; and players compete to dominate those columns. To dominate a column a unit's ATTACK must be at least equal to the unit's DEFENSE that is holding it.<br/><br/>Players have 10 Command Points (CP) for each round and they can command as many units as they please -provided they don't go over CP. Each unit has a CP cost equal to its ATTACK value.<br/><br/>Players start the game with three cards and draw one card at the start of their turns, and they take turns to command units onto the battlefield.<br/><br/>To win a game, one player must either control all of the five columns. In cases which this is not possible (i.e. when there's no more cards to draw and/or play) the player holding the most columns win the game. And whenever a player wins two consecutive games s/he wins the battle.<br/><br/>",

Try not to let the dragon down and do your best to<br/>stick with him until the end. That means not spending all your<br/>money, or charming the capricious damsel more than the<br/>other heads.<br/><br/>Gameplay: there is an event every turn that requires the attention of a dragon (for example, if you are attacked by a knight, or there is a thunderstorm, or if something like that happens). Each player-head suggests a solution (basically, it all boils down to an auction to minimize the resources needed). Those who can solve the problem with the least effort win the favor of the princess. If the problem appears insoluble, the entire dragon suffers &ndash; for example, a knight hits it hard with a sword. A few turns &ldquo;lost&rdquo; this way end the game. In the end, this is a balance between the cooperative part (benefits the entire dragon) and the individual one (to become the most efficient manager among other heads). And, of course, the princess herself occasionally assigns tasks &ndash; and the princess&rsquo;s card additionally defines which methods she likes most.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>&bull; 9 player cards (dragon heads);<br/>&bull; 3 two-sided princess cards<br/>(six beauties in all);<br/>&bull; 30 dragonfire cards;<br/>&bull; 15 spell cards;<br/>&bull; 8 defense cards;<br/>&bull; 7 gift cards;<br/>&bull; 18 cards with daring adventurers<br/>to defeat;<br/>&bull; 6 unexpected move or<br/>&ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; cards;<br/>&bull; 6 tokens representing<br/>Gosha&rsquo;s health;<br/>&bull; 24 coins;<br/>&bull; rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>QB8 is an engaging game of balancing the accumulation and retention of game cubes.  Each cube displays one of four colors AND a number between one and six.  In order to win, a player must be in possession of exactly two cubes each of all four colors AND where all eight numbers on those cubes, when added together, total exactly 28.  You must only have eight cubes in your possession to win.<br/><br/>It's not as difficult as it sounds but it does require some concentration and some playing strategy.  The goal of each turn is to acquire a game cube.  While that's not guaranteed, the rules make it pretty easy to accomplish.  At the end of each turn, a player is allowed to &quot;discube&quot; - or get rid of an unwanted cube - thus engaging in the act of balancing which cubes a player retains in their effort to obtain a winning combination of eight game cubes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To The Last Extremity recreates the 21-day siege of Fort Stanwix in 1777 during The American Revolution. Any number of decisions or events could have altered the outcome, and 'To The Last Extremity' gives players the chance to see what might have been.&quot; --from the rule book.<br/><br/>In To The Last Extremity the forces of the fledgling United States of America, consisting of Continental Army infantry and artillery, local militia, and allied Oneida Indian units, face off against the besieging forces consisting of British Army infantry and artillery, Hessian J&auml;gers, Canadian militia, and American Indian allies. Each side receives a deck of cards representing its military forces and the various leaders instrumental in the campaign, such as the American commander, Col. Peter Gansevoort, and the British commander, Brig. Gen. Barry St. Leger, plus many others (including American Indian leaders and Benedict Arnold before he turned traitor!).<br/><br/>Players face off on opposite sides of a period map of the area surrounding Fort Stanwix. At the beginning of each turn, the American player will roll to see if a Chance card is drawn. Chance cards introduce historical events into the game and their effects on one or both sides. The rule book has detailed historical descriptions of each event, which are informational only, but help to bring the history and drama of the Siege of Fort Stanwix to life. Following a possible Chance card draw, players will secretly assign forces and leaders to each of the four sides of Fort Stanwix: north, south, east, and west. How the players choose to distribute their forces will determine the outcome of the siege. Players then reveal their cards. If the British have assigned forces to assault one or more sides of the fort, players will compare the strengths of the opposing forces on that side and roll a die to determine the resultant casualties and whether a breach of the fortress walls has occurred. If the British achieve two breaches on the same turn, they have taken the fort and win the game. If, after 13 turns, the British fail to take the fort, the outnumbered Americans have broken the siege and have defeated the British.<br/><br/>On each turn, the British may also elect to dig entrenchments to protect their artillery, or bombard or skirmish with sides of the fort to effect American morale.<br/><br/>Easily playable in under an hour, &quot;To The Last Extremity&quot; is a simple wargame that provides a great deal of historical flavor surrounding one of the earliest American victories achieved in U.S. history.<br/><br/>",

Therefore - from time to time - dwarves abandon their mining equipment for a year, roll up their sleeves and try to get most money for their gems. And to get some tension - and keep trading interesting - some small bets and wagers are placed, for finding out who's the best gem trader among the dwarves!<br/><br/>In Dwarven Traders players try to get most profit from buying and selling different gems. Every action you make changes prices and creates new opportunities for other players, so you must have a really good plan for outwitting them all! With no randomness or hidden information it's not an easy task... but also for them!<br/><br/>During his/her turn, player has always two options available, displayed on 4 public action cards: player can buy 1 gem (indicated on card), sell 1 gem (indicated on card) or do both - with only limit being gem storage (max 2 gems). After that prices change, according to card information, used card is flipped upside down and it's clockwise next player's turn. Round ends when one player is not able to perform either of actions; game ends after fourth round - and whoever has most gold is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "忍城の戦い (Oshi-jō no tatakai) translated in English as &quot;Battle of Oshi-jō&quot;, although  &quot;The Siege Of Oshi&quot; would be a more accurate name for this wargame.<br/><br/>Published in 2011 by a small group Dōjin Club Ludens Faber (同人会ルデンス・ファベル), the designers and illustrators of the game want to remain anonymous. All game elements are contained in a ziplock. This game was later substantially revised and upgraded and published in a new game Battle of Oshi-jou, with a larger map, revised rules and more than double the number of units.<br/><br/>The 1590 Siege of Oshi (忍城の戦い Oshi-jō no tatakai) was a battle during Japan's Sengoku period. Oshi Castle, a stronghold of the Narita clan, was besieged by forces loyal to the Toyotomi clan. The castle was famously defended for over a month by a force consisting of only 619 samurai and 2000 local conscripts against forces numbering over 20,000. The battle is also famous for the actions of Lady Kai (甲斐姫 / Kaihime), who led 200 Narita men into battle to rout the initial attack against the castle.<br/><br/>The game incorporates standard hex-and-counter movement on a map representing the region around the castle. The game proceeds in an &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; manner. Units may perform ranged fire in an attempt to cause enemy units to become disordered (recovery from disorder may be attempted at the beginning of each turn). Enemy units may also return fire to cause disorder on their attackers. Close combat proceeds on a simplified, odds-based combat resolution table using a single die (d6), and can result in disorder, losses and retreat. If an army suffers enough losses, it becomes demoralized, suffering combat penalties and the elimination of any unit that becomes disordered. The game includes special rules for Lady Kai's ability to boost the morale of conscript units under her.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    A4 map (210mm &times; 297mm / 8.3&quot; &times; 11.7&quot;)<br/>    50 mounted, back-printed counters (not die-cut)<br/>    A5 rulebook: two pages historical notes, four pages &quot;Warring States Folio&quot; series rules, two pages game-specific rules<br/><br/><br/>(User description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Plagued by world conflicts, the Terrans came to the realization that their survival was dependent on the colonization of other planets, resulting in the formation of four distinct Terran Megacorporations (aka the Exterras):<br/><br/><br/>    The Acolytes (Red): Economic, old money, wealthiest Megacorporation.<br/>    The Brethren (Blue): Militaristic, new money, geared for space combat.<br/>    The Covenant (Green): Covert, smallest faction seeking global power.<br/>    The Destined (Purple): Disenfranchised, a collection of dissidents from all the others.<br/><br/><br/>When the period of time known as The Trials ended, the Terran factions pursued their own interests and ceased nearly all contact with one another. More than a century has passed since the last Acolytes moved freely among the planets negotiating contracts; Brethren members seized vulnerable outposts; Covenant scientists revealed the latest technologies; and Destined raiders captured vessels in their space lanes. But, all is not well.<br/><br/>Espionage agents working for the various Factions gathered significant intelligence on their current leaders' intentions. As the decades receded into history, the families, clans, and tribes of long-forgotten names, including Avalon, Augustus, du Lac, and Ravndotter have coalesced their efforts. One hundred years of isolation have taken their toll on the Factions. While each has exploited particular assets, the lack of connectivity with others has created its own set of complications.<br/><br/>The current generation of Terrans remains guarded and suspicious of others, but they are also filled with a desire to fulfil the providential future ordained by their leaders so many years ago. Scout ships and exploration vessels, commanded by pilots and astronavigators who have never ventured out beyond their own controlled space, have only begun making the arduous journey among the stars. Will these intrepid Faction members bury the sins of their forbearers, achieving a compromise among the others, or will they simply abandon all hope for a peaceful coexistence? Historians gazing out at the political landscape agree that after a long period of silence, the Tradewars shall begin.<br/><br/><br/>TradeWorlds is a 1-4 player competitive space battle deck-building game, which includes different scenarios to determine how the game is won:<br/><br/><br/>    Traderwars: Players must balance the collection of wealth with their need to defend their homeworld.<br/>    Spacewars: This scenario is all about survival. Be the last player standing to win.<br/>    The Derelict: A single-player scenario that focuses on surviving an alien assault.<br/>    Solo AI: A full solo play experience which simulates the multiplayer game.<br/>    Co-op Mode: A cooperative scenario that entails fighting off an alien invasion. <br/><br/><br/>During a player's turn, the player first selects any 1 of the 10 roles in the game, which are:<br/><br/><br/>    Chancellor: Can initiate a diplomatic vote to reach an agreement in the game<br/>    Treasurer: Discard cards for funds<br/>    Admiral: Control multiple starships<br/>    Captain: Reconfigure starships<br/>    Commander: Reconfigure crews<br/>    Engineer: Reconfigure weapons<br/>    Sergeant: Force all opponents to discard<br/>    Private: Force 1 opponent to discard<br/>    Smuggler: Steal 1 card from 3 chosen cards.<br/>    Trader: Draw extra cards<br/><br/><br/>The scenarios determine which of the 10 roles are more desirable during the game, though each role has its purpose. Players must determine what actions and benefits they need in order to move their agenda forward. Once the role is resolved, the player may trade cards to buy Upgrade cards.<br/><br/><br/>Cards may also be sold to increase the player's Treasury value.<br/><br/><br/>Adjustments are made on the Score Pad whenever necessary and in accordance to card effects or player actions. Wealth, Homeworld Defense Points, and the number of starships the player can build are kept track of on the mat.<br/><br/><br/>When a player acquires starships, they may deploy them to the &quot;Space Lane&quot;, which act as walls to protect their Homeworld from invasion. Before a starship can be deployed, it must be configured, which entails connecting 3 Upgrade cards; the starship Upgrade card, crew Upgrade card, and weapons upgrade card. Configuration of a starship means that it is manned, armed and ready to fly. Each Upgrade card has an Energy rating (or &quot;capacity&quot;), Weapon rating (or &quot;firepower&quot;), and Crew rating (or &quot;resistance&quot;).<br/><br/>A player may command up to 4 starships at a time, from an array of 5 unique classes. Starships can be configured in up to 125 different combinations.<br/><br/><br/>Combat is initiated when the player decides to use their starships to attack an opponent&rsquo;s starships or an opponent&rsquo;s unprotected homeworld. Attacking is only possible if the player elects to take the Admiral role for their turn.<br/><br/>Attacks can be done with 1 or more starships and the attacker gets to decide which of the opponent&rsquo;s ships are included in the skirmish.<br/><br/>Initiative is determined by rolling dice. If the attacking player wins the initiative, the battle continues. If not, the opponent is able to escape the fight.<br/><br/><br/>A player's turn ends when the player is done taking all their actions, at which point they may draw back up to 5 cards. If their draw deck is exhausted, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the new draw deck.<br/><br/>The players continue to take turns until the game is won. The victory condition is determined by the scenario selected by the players. Once the objective has been met, the game is over and the winner is announced.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dust Warfare '47 is the latest incarnation of the Dust Warfare miniatures game. It is a fast-playing tabletop miniatures game set in an alternate history of WWII, in which alien technology has changed the nature of warfare in the era. The Axis, Allies, and Sino-Soviet Union (SSU) fight not only for their peoples' political goals, but also to secure the coveted vK alien technology used to power their war machines. Players build armies of 28mm scale miniatures and face one another on an open-table top using measure tape and specialized dice. Dust is a game of strategic planning, tactical maneuvering, and dramatic firefights.<br/><br/>Dust Warfare '47 is a community-driven game that picks up where the original Dust Warfare left off. New units have been added, existing units have been re-balanced, and core rules have been tweaked. While the official version of Dust (Dust 1947) which is published by Dust Studios is now the only sold version of the game, Dust Warfare '47 is officially sponsored by Dust Studios but maintained by the community. To play Dust Warfare '47 simply requires the same miniatures used for the official Dust 1947 game and a free set of rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A full color game of skill in which you pilot your own jet airplane through exciting maneuvers with life-like jet replicas. There is no dice and no luck. Your skill brings you victory or defeat.<br/><br/>This game uses a board with irregularly shaped playing spaces where the player moves his aircraft a certain number of them changing altitude at the same time. It is therefore difficult to be sure where the aircraft will end up since some playing spaces are much larger than others. There is terrain which is at a given height. The game uses color coded bases to indicate altitude. Planes are equipped with missiles which automatically hit aircraft at a certain range. Aircraft can also bomb cities (presumably with nuclear weapons) and destroy them but must be at certain altitudes to do so. It's a little like chess with aircraft based on the only documentation I have which is the patent application.<br/><br/>The original publisher is listed as MGK but as far as I can tell that company does not exist. It's possible this was a self-published game. The designer was listed as Garcia-Kuenzli. I do not know if this reflects 2 designers or what country he or they were from. This is the only copy of this game I have ever seen. Neither the designer nor the publisher is in the BGG database.<br/><br/>",

Every turn each player will anounce how many spaces the would like to move.  Then they will throw the die and if the result is equal or higher than their declaration, they will move that number of spaces.<br/><br/>However, if the result is less, they will stay in the same space, an also they can move backwards if the result is a -1. The neat part of the game is that a donkey lands on a space with another donkey, they pile them, and the player on the bottom must obey the orders of the higher donkey.<br/><br/>Has nothing to do with other games called Huckepack, and is suspiciously similar to Die Heisse Schlacht am Kalten Buffet.

Players make real-life investment and career decisions, learn to balance their portfolios and plan for retirement, manage budgets and debt, and answer questions on fundamental principles of economics and finance. No prior experience needed.<br/><br/>Players start out with $100,000 cash, roll the dice, and proceed around the board. Spaces on the board correspond to different life events such as getting paid a salary, going on vacation, or picking from the three decks of cards that sit at the center of the board. The three decks of cards are: news flashes, knowledge cards, and wild cards. Newsflashes provide a news story, and players must buy and sell investments accordingly in order to win or lose money. Users may accept advice from other players for a shared win or loss in the investment. Knowledge cards are multiple choice cards that teach users key finance information that will be used in the game and life. Wild cards are life events that will cause the loser to win or lose money depending on whether or not they own the right assets. To win, a user must double their money and own a home, life and health insurance, and a retirement plan.<br/><br/>There are several levels of game play that allow for beginner users all the way through advanced users to play the game and be continually challenged. Additional card decks are available through our company website as they become available.<br/><br/>",

In the play area are item cards &mdash; wood, stone, iron, and fire &mdash; and treasure cards. As players collect item cards in their hand, they can assemble various tools, such as a &quot;big axe&quot;, &quot;small pickaxe&quot;, &quot;spear&quot;, and &quot;wood bomb&quot;.<br/><br/>Each tool is assembled by placing the item cards in the shape of the tool. With the &quot;small axe&quot;, a player can draw one card from the play area. With the &quot;big axe&quot;, a player can draw two cards. With the &quot;small pickaxe&quot;, players choose and take one card from the discard pile. With the &quot;spear&quot;, a player can draw one card from another player's hand and snatch it if it's a treasure card. With the powerful &quot;wood bomb&quot;, players choose to draw four cards from the play area or draw one card from each player's hand and snatch the cards if they're treasure cards.<br/><br/>The active player can have only up to seven items in total of the cards in their hand and their tools. Because of this, the player may have to discard some tools or treasure cards in their hand. The game ends when a player gains 10 points through treasure cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Westfront is a company to battalion level game for WW1 forces, designed for 1/72, 15mm or 10mm miniatures. Smaller scales could also be used.<br/><br/>Westfront is designed with simplicity in mind, but since it represents communication issues, orders from above, random events like units becoming lost, as well as the actual movement and attacking of the various types of forces, it can become quite in-depth.<br/><br/>Westfront has a fairly free-form army list composition; allowing players to choose infantry, cavalry, vehicles, various types of artillery, fortifications and barbed wire at their will. Units behave historically, and 4 different theaters are available to play in. Some will have a higher chance of poor weather, and if the entire tabletop is mud units like armored cars simply wont be able to function. Thankfully season is determined before players write their army lists, so they will know ahead of time what to expect.<br/><br/>Westfront covers the evolution of the war and the changes in doctrines and units involved;<br/><br/>Early war (1914 - 1915) will have only the most rudimentary artillery usage in preliminary bombardments, and only the basic units available (no tanks!).<br/><br/>Mid War (1916) will see the standardization of the creeping artillery barrage (which really works in-game: artillery provides cover as troops advance, and causes enemies to keep their heads down if it explodes near them), indirect machine gun fire and of course the introduction of the first Mk.I tanks.<br/><br/>Late war (1917 - 1918) will see advanced infantry tactics like Germans advancing machine gun teams through creeping barrages to set up in no mans land, and the introduction of more refined tanks and German anti-tank rifles.<br/><br/>Westfront provides army lists for the Allied forces and the Central Powers, covering most of the units available. 3 qualities of infantry and cavalry are available (sup-par, regular and assault/veterans), and artillery is broken into 4 categories: Trench mortars like the minenwerfer or stokes mortar, flat-firing field guns like the 37mm maxim, and the various 77mm German guns (these have varying ranges depending on the specific gun), howitzer batteries like the 18-Pdr or 15cm SFH, and heavy howitzers like the 42cm M&ouml;rser or the BL 12-Inch. Fortifications are covered, with shallow and deep trenches, dug outs and pillboxes all available<br/><br/>Westfront aims to give fun games around 2 hours long and to give a WW1 feel for the players. Much research has been done based on the accounts of actual combatants, attempting to implement some of the important features for those on the ground. For example a forward unit on the attack may start to run low on ammunition, so could send a runner back to request supplies, but the runner may get killed along the way... Another example might be a friendly unit capturing an enemy trench, only to get shelled by friendly artillery controlled by H.Q. They desperately send a runner back to their lines to tell the barrage to stop, but it will take a few turns for the order to get through...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While Canadian publisher Somerville clearly licenced the name Easy Money from Milton Bradley, it published a very different version of MB's 1935 game during WWII and for a short period of time afterwards (dropping the word wartime from the title). The Monopoly-like mechanics are the same: roll and move, buy properties and businesses and make money. In this version of Easy Money a player keeps playing/moving their token until throwing a &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.<br/><br/>While the MB board had 48 spaces, the wartime Canadian game has only 28 spaces (six spaces and only two properties per side plus four corner spaces labelled &quot;Town Square&quot; (start); Hospital; Victory Bonds; and Income Tax. In addition, there is an inner Chance Circle of 24 spaces, each tied to one of the side spaces. Players who throw doubles on 2D6 take the result from the corresponding inner circle space without moving, and then roll again.<br/><br/>The theme of wartime sacrifices is strongly represented: even when collecting $200 for passing the Town Square, $100 must be donated to the Victory Bond space, and a player landing on Victory Bonds takes only half the money there. There also are spaces for Blackout Regulations, Air Raid Defense Plan, Soldiers Welfare Project, War Project and Red Cross Project on the outer square, and spaces for Buy War Savings Stamps and Extra Call for Victory Bonds on the inner circle.<br/><br/>",

Superbeings from all corners of the universe have taken their sides; it's the rise of the Superbeings Battle Universe!<br/><br/>Superbeings is a relaunch of the anime-styled Humaliens Trading Card Game released in 2003 by AEG with a new design and storyline by creator Rick Medina. Superbeings features a 6-Super Team concept of playing with multiple frontline attackers and multiple backline reinforcements with the objective to win by one of three ways: (1) knocking out your opponent's entire frontline, (2) knocking out a total of 5 Supers, or (3) knocking out 15 rank points worth of Supers. The game uses a variety of D6, D12 and D20 dice-rolling mechanics for establishing turn actions, attacks, and more.<br/><br/>The traditional two-player heads-up game is the easiest to start with and is the preferred play style &mdash; but when the opportunity for a massive four-player game is called upon, there's an entirely different feel to the game!<br/><br/>",

Resource Phase<br/>-   Gain 3 free resources of any type. <br/>-   For each terrain occupied by one of your settlements gain 1 extra resource of the type produced by that terrain. <br/>3.  Trade Phase<br/>-   You may convert 2 gold into 1 resource of any other type. <br/>-   You may trade/gift resources with other players who have settlements adjacent to yours.<br/>4.  Settle Phase<br/>-   You may build 1 settlement. The cost to build the settlement is 2 food and 3 wood. <br/>5.  Fortify Phase<br/>-   You may build 1 castle on one of your settlements.  The cost to build the castle is 4 stone. <br/>6.  Train Phase<br/>-   You may build armies on one of your castles.  The cost to train an army is 1 food, 2 metal, and 1 wood. <br/>7.  Move Phase<br/>-   You may move your armies to an adjacent space.  It costs 1 food to move all the armies in 1 stack (max of 4 armies). <br/>8.  Attack Phase<br/>-   If your armies and a horde occupy the same space, there will be a battle. Gain a Victory Token every time you destroy a horde stack. <br/>9.  Research Phase<br/>-   Pick one ability from the Research List. <br/>-   You may gain an extra ability for the cost of 10 resources. <br/>10. Spawn Phase<br/>-   A new horde appears on the board. <br/>-   After turn 10 two hordes appear on the map!<br/>11. End Phase<br/>-   Max resource chits you can hold is 7.

They function similar to Armies except that Settlements hit on a roll of 8+ and Castles hit on a roll of 7+. Victory Tokens are gained every time you destroy a Horde Stack.<br/><br/>At the end of the game (20 rounds), the player with the most Units (Settlements, Armies, and Castles) plus Victory Tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player controls one North American Indian Tribe.  Players use their people to gather food and to raid each other and the white men.<br/><br/>Different types of tokens are used to undertake actions and record progress:<br/>-  Population Tokens (PT) are used to conduct actions such as raiding and hunting. Each Population Token represents about 50 People. <br/>-  Land Tokens (LT) are used to give access to food and resources. <br/>-  Food Tokens (FT) are used to feed your people.  They are gained by claiming certain cards. <br/>-  Horse Tokens (HT) give advantages to Raids.  <br/>-  Weapons Tokens(WT) give advantages to Raids. <br/>-  Spirit Tokens (ST) have a variety of uses. <br/>-  Trade Tokens (TT) represent things like furs and skins or crafted items that are used to trade with whites for things like weapons and horses. <br/>-  Craft Tokens (CT) represent an accumulation of skilled labour.<br/><br/>Players share a common Spirit Card deck.  Cards are of 2 basic types: Resource Cards and Bonus Cards. <br/>-  Resource cards provide tokens and are then Discarded. <br/>-  Bonus Cards are placed face-up in front of the owner and provide either a continuous benefit or are discarded for a one-time benefit.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player gets 10 PT, 10 LT and 10 ST. A player mater is utilised to track the status of the tribe and indicate how the PT are being utilised throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game is conducted over six turns with each turn comprising 9 phases as follows: <br/>1. Season Phase<br/>-  Place 7 x no. of players cards from the top of the spirit deck face up. <br/>2. Braves Phase<br/>-  Players take turns activating Population Tokens one at a time.  An activated PT can hunt (claim a face up spirit card) or go on a raid or go trading. <br/>3. Hunt Phase<br/>-  Resolve Spirit Card purchases and conversions as soon as they are claimed.  Some Spirit Cards have a purchase cost in tokens. This must be paid immediately.  If the purchase cost cannot be paid, the card cannot be claimed.  If the Spirit Card is a resource card, immediately gain the indicated type of tokens and then discard the card. <br/>4. Territory Phase<br/>-  If you have more LT than PT, gain FT equal to the difference. <br/>-  If you have less LT than PT, lose FT equal to the difference.<br/>5. Food Phase<br/>-  Each player discards FT equal to their PT. <br/>-  If they are short then roll once on a Starvation Table for each FT they are short and resolve results. <br/>6. Raid Phase<br/>-  Players take turns conducting Raids. <br/>-  Each PT held in reserve conducts its own raid. <br/>-  When making a Raid, declare the target of the Raid: <br/>Target Opponent, Non-player Tribe, or White Men. <br/>-  Roll for results on the appropriate raid table and resolve accordingly.<br/>7. Trade Phase<br/>-  Players may trade Tokens with each other or with white men (using set conversion rates) <br/>8. Encroachment Phase<br/>-  Each player rolls once on an Encroachment Table and resolves results accordingly.<br/>9. Spirit Phase<br/>-  All unclaimed face-up Spirit Cards are discarded.<br/><br/>The game is played over six turns. At the end of the 6th turn scoring is conducted as follows:<br/>Player with most LT gets 10 VP<br/>Player with most PT gets 9 VP<br/>Player with most HT gets 8 VP<br/>Player with most WT gets 7 VP<br/>Player with most ST gets 6 VP<br/>Player with most CT gets 5 VP<br/>Player with most TT gets 3 VP<br/>Player with most FT gets 2 VP<br/>Player with the most Bonus Cards get 4 VP<br/>If tied in a category, all tied players get the points -1.<br/><br/>The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>If at any point during the game a player loses all his Population Tokens or Land Tokens he automatically loses.<br/><br/>",

To start the 36 tiles are placed, face-up on the middle 36 spaces of the Board.  Once completed the central 4 tiles are removed an placed, randomly, on the four corners of the board.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to move tiles around the board in order to make a recognized mathematical pattern of 4 tiles - a Trope.  <br/>A Trope can be orthogonal or diagonal and the tiles within a Trope must form a connected line of adjacent tiles.  In an orthogonal Trope tiles will share a side.

Players move about the Lyceum (Gymnasium and surrounding grounds) to acquire knowledge in a variety of categories and subjects.<br/><br/>The board is composed of 27 tiles, called Lyceum Tiles.  The tiles are organised into a circular track in a random order.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck. When a card is played, immediately gain its reward and then discard the card.  When the deck runs out the first time shuffle the discard and draw from it.<br/><br/>Players share a set of action tokens.  There are 7 types of tokens: Material Cause, Efficient Cause, Formal Cause, Final Cause, Potentiality, Actuality and Aristotle.  Actions tokens are used during the game for additional movement, gaining points in various categories, affecting die rolls etc.<br/><br/>There are 6 Categories: Philosophy, Logic, Life Science, Physical Science, Humanities and Arts.  Each Category is further divided into 6 Subjects.  During play points are earned in individual subjects, however for final end of game scoring, it is the total points earned by subjects within a category that count. Every time you gain a point in a Subject, you also get a corresponding Action Token according to the subjects tables.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn consisting of 3 phases:<br/><br/>1.  Aristotle Phase<br/><br/>     Aristotle starts the Game in Aristotle&rsquo;s Library and moves in a clockwise direction 2D6 spaces. <br/>     Whenever he lands on a space containing one or more students, they each get 1 point in one random subject (first roll a random category, then a random subject) <br/>     If he lands in a space containing no students, the top card of the deck is placed onto that tile.  The first student to land there gets that card, as well as the tile&rsquo;s regular offering. <br/>     If you land on Aristotle, you gain 1 Cause Token of any type.  <br/>     If on your move you pass over Aristotle you gain 1 Aristotle Token. <br/><br/><br/>2.  Move Phase<br/><br/>     Move your Pawn forward (clockwise around the track) one or two spaces OR you may move forward 1D10 spaces. <br/>     You may spend an Action Token to alter your movement. <br/>     When you land on 1 or more opponents pawns, you may steal 1 Token from any one of them. <br/><br/><br/>3.  Learning <br/><br/>     Follow the instructions on the tile you have just moved to.  This will usually earn you 1 card or some Action Tokens or 1 point in one specific Subject or a choice on a list, or a roll on a table. <br/><br/><br/>Scores are tracked using paper and pencil.<br/><br/>The game ends when players have gone through the deck twice.  <br/>The player with the highest score in the most categories is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each suite comprises 16 cards ranked from 1 to 16.<br/><br/>The board is an 8x8 grid. Each square must be big enough to easily hold 1 card.  1 card is randomly dealt face up to each space on the board. Each player places their pawn on a different corner space (each pawn represents a different manifestation of Aquaman).<br/><br/>Each player draws 3 cards to start.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising five phases:<br/><br/>1. Power Phase<br/>-  If you have at least 5 cards in your hand, you may discard 1 card from your hand to activate its special ability: <br/>-  Aquaman: Draw 2 cards from the deck &amp; put them in your hand. If the sum of the ranks of the 2 cards is less than the rank of the Aquaman card, draw and keep a third card. <br/>-  Companion: Look at the next 4 cards in the deck. Keep one and <br/>discard the other 3. The one you keep must be of a lower rank than the Companion Card. <br/>-  Sea Creature: Take the top card of discard and put it in your hand. <br/>It must be of a lower rank than the Sea Creature card. <br/>-  Plot: You may move your pawn to any target, non-occupied space this turn in Swim phase (do not bother rolling the dice). The card in the target space must be of a lower Rank than the Plot card. <br/>-  Foe: Target opponent who is adjacent to you must reveal one random card from his hand; if it is lower in rank than the Foe card it is discarded.  <br/>-  Power: Discard X cards and draw X replacement cards. The cards you discard may not be of a higher Rank than the Power card. <br/>-  Strangeness: Put 1 target adjacent card on the board in your hand. It must be of a lower rank than the Strangeness card. Immediately draw a card to replace it with on the Board.   <br/>-  Location: Look at the next X cards in the deck where X = the rank of the Location card.<br/><br/>2.  Swim Phase<br/><br/>     Roll two dice. Move your pawn on the board orthogonally first the distance of one of the dice, and then the distance of the other. For example, you roll a 2 and a 5.  You decide to first move him to your left 5 spaces and then forward 2 spaces. <br/><br/><br/>3.  Action Phase<br/><br/>     If you land on a space not occupied by another pawn, take the card there and put it in your hand. Immediately replace the card you took with the top card of the deck. <br/>     If the space is occupied by another player&rsquo;s pawn, there will be a fight: Both players reveal 1 card from their hand. High card wins. If tied, players reveal a second card. Discard all revealed cards. The winner gets to look at the loser&rsquo;s hand and steal 1 card. <br/><br/><br/>4.  Mission Phase<br/><br/>     You may complete a Mission.  To do this play (discard) 8 cards from your hand, one from each of the eight suites.  <br/><br/><br/>5.  Rest Phase<br/><br/>     Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The first player to complete 3 Missions is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Defence cards are used in response to an attack to negate it. <br/>     If 2 or more units occupy the same space then a single move card can be used to move them all, however, they must all be moved together to the same destination. Movement is orthogonal or diagonal.<br/>     A fighter can move twice but attack only once in a turn. <br/>     A starship can move only once, but may attack twice in a turn. <br/><br/><br/>When an attack by a Human unit hits, all enemy units in the space are hit. Any Formic unit hit is destroyed unless a defence card is played.<br/><br/>When a Formic attack hits, only one unit is hit. A Human unit that is hit takes 1 point of damage. Starships or fighter squads with 4 or more damage are destroyed.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by destroying your opponent&rsquo;s fleet.<br/><br/>",

The other is the evil Morganians.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck containing cards of seven types: <br/>Merlinian Sorcerers, Morganian Sorcerers, Spells, Amplifiers, Objects, Events and Defence.  Most cards have a power rating which is used during the duel (combat) phase.<br/><br/>The Merlinian player starts with Balthazar in play and the Grimhold which is equipped to Balthazar. The Morganian player starts with Horvath in play.<br/><br/>Both players draw 5 cards.<br/><br/>Each turn has 6 Phases:<br/><br/>1.  Lore Phase<br/>-   Both players draw 2 cards from the deck.<br/><br/>2.  Recruit Phase<br/>-   You may put one sorcerer into play from your hand and any number of objects. Sorcerers may give their objects to each other (max 3 objects per sorcerer). Excess objects are discarded. <br/>-   The Merlinian player may only recruit Merlinian Sorcerers. <br/>-   The Morganian player may only recruit Morganian Sorcerers.<br/><br/>3.  Event Phase<br/>-   Starting with the Merlinian player, players may take turns discarding cards with event abilities to activate and immediately resolve those abilities.<br/><br/>4.  Encounter Phase<br/>-   Each player randomly picks one of their sorcerers to undertake a duel.<br/><br/>5.  Duel Phase<br/>-   The two Sorcerers who have encountered each other will now fight as follows.<br/>-   Each player will make an attack combo which are then revealed simultaneously. For their attack combo each player may play one spell, one event and up to 3 amplifiers<br/>-   Derive a power total for each sorcerer = the sorcerer&rsquo;s power + equipped objects + spell + played event + amplifiers.<br/>-   Each player may play up to one defence card. These will cause certain opposing cards to be discarded, thus changing the power totals. <br/>-   The sorcerer with the higher power total is the combat winner. The losing sorcerer is discarded.<br/>-   The combat Loser may play a protection spell. This prevents the losing sorcerer from being discarded and his objects from being stolen.<br/>-   The winner takes the losing Sorcerers objects AND looks at his opponents hand AND then steals one target card from his opponents hand.<br/><br/>6.  End Phase<br/>-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/>-   Check for Victory Conditions. Record Time Markers.<br/><br/>The Merlinian player has 2 ways to win: <br/>1.  Destroy Morgana: Defeat her by 7 or more power in a Combat. <br/>2.

        "description": "A card game for 2 players in which players take turns controlling the Byzantine Empire. On a player&rsquo;s off-turn he represents the many foes of the Byzantines. The game is divided into 3 ages - the first 4 turns are the Early Age, turns 5-8 are the Middle Age, turns 9-12 are the Late Age. Each player will get to be the Byzantines for 6 out of the 12 turns.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 Legacy Tokens. The Byzantine Empire starts with 10 Territory Tokens (TT). The most TT it can have is 20. If at any time the Byzantine Empire is reduced to zero or less Territory Tokens the game ends immediately and the current Byzantine player loses 3 Legacy Tokens.<br/><br/>There are 2 decks: The Byzantine Deck and the Foes Deck. Cards are of certain types and have a force value. Some cards are only useable during specific Ages. At the start of the game all Middle and Late Age cards are removed from the decks and set aside. When the Middle Age starts the Middle Age cards are shuffled into the decks. When the Late Age starts the Late Age cards are shuffled into the deck.<br/><br/>Each turn has 6 Phases: <br/>1.  Draw Phase<br/>-   The Foe player fills their hand to 8 cards. <br/>-   The Byzantine player fills his hand to 9 cards in the Early Age, 8 cards in the Middle Age, or 7 cards in the Late Age.<br/><br/>2.  Age Phase<br/>-   Discard any cards in your hand that are not useable in the current Age and draw replacements. If the discarded cards are from an earlier age, remove them from the game.<br/><br/>3.  Redraw Phase<br/>-   Each player may discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.<br/><br/>4.  Meld Phase<br/>-   Each player makes a Meld. <br/>-   A Byzantine meld may have up to 1 leader card, 2 recovery cards, 4 troop cards, 1 negotiation card and 2 legacy cards<br/>-   A Foe meld may have up to 1 Northern foe card, 1 Southern foe card, 2 disaster cards (Max 1 Natural Disaster) and 4 troop cards<br/>-   If a negotiation card is played, the Byzantine player may discard 1 target Foe card. The Foe player may replace it immediately with another Foe card if he has one in hand. <br/>-   Each player totals the force of the cards in his meld. The side with the higher force total wins. If tied the Foe player wins. <br/>-   The Byzantine Empire gains or loses Territory Tokens equal to the difference in the Force Point Totals.  <br/>-   All Meld cards are discarded. Unique Meld cards are removed from play.<br/><br/>5.  Legacy Phase<br/>-   The Byzantine Player (BP) potentially earns Legacy Tokens (LT). If the Empire lost TT this turn the BP loses 1 LT. If the Empire gained TT this turn the BP gains 1 LT. <br/>-   The BP gains LT equal to the legacy value of the legacy cards he played in Meld Phase.<br/><br/>6.  End Phase<br/>-   If you have cards left in your hand, discard down to 1 card and pass it to your opponent. <br/>-   Players switch control of the Emperor Token.<br/><br/>The game ends after 12 turns. The player with the most Legacy Tokens at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tr&ouml;del-Trecker is tractor racing game. Wooden Houses in various colors are set up in a circle (there is no board). Each player has a wooden tractor and a set of cards with numbers from 2 to 9.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a color die and may move to the next house of the corresponding color. In addition, you have to flip over a number card whose number is at least as high as the number of steps you move. When moving onto the same field as another tractor, you push that one one field ahead. If you land on a field behind another tractor, you move up next to that one.<br/><br/>When you cannot make a legal move, you skip a turn. When the first player has no cards left, the game ends and whoever moved furthest is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Movement and Attack cards will have a specified range and all cards have a specified effect.<br/><br/>Players use counters or miniatures to represent the ships of their space fleets.  The number and types of ships utilised will be dependent and which of the 5 scenarios is used and on the factions played.   There are two main Factions: United Planetary Federation (UPF) and Sathar Empire though certain scenarios use Mercenaries, Pirates and Home Defence Fleets.<br/><br/>Game board set up and victory conditions are scenario driven, but gameplay is conducted in the same manner regardless of scenario.<br/><br/>Players start with 5 cards.  Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases.<br/><br/>1.    Tactics Phase<br/>-     Draw 5 cards.<br/><br/>2.    Action Phase<br/>-     You may play cards from your hand. <br/>-     Use move cards to move a ship the indicated number of spaces.  Moves are orthogonal or diagonal.<br/>-     Use attack cards to engage enemy units at the indicated range. All attacks do 1 point of damage. Attacks are orthogonal or diagonal.<br/>-     Use defence cards to negate a target attack.  <br/>-     Played cards are discarded.<br/><br/>3.    End Phase<br/>-     Max hand size is 7 cards.  Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>Each ship has a number of hits (1-12 dependant on class).

        "description": "A card game for 2+ players based on The Pacific Rim Movie and representing Kaiju vs Jaeger Combat.<br/><br/>Players share a common 52 playing card deck. Each face card has a unique ability for each type of Jaeger or Kaiju which are described in each unit&rsquo;s unique face card lists (there are six different Jaeger, and six different Kaiju). Number cards are used the same way by all units depending on their suit.  Hearts = Attack, Diamonds = Dodge, Clubs = Damage, Spades = Armour.<br/><br/>Each player picks one Kaiju or Jaeger to control. There should be equal numbers of each if possible. Players may play 2 units, but must have a separate hand for each. Each unit (Kaiju and Jaeger) start with 20 Hits.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 8 phases:<br/><br/>1.    Draw Phase<br/>-     Each player fills their card hand to their base hand size. Seven is the base hand size of all units but hand size can be decreased as a result of card play.<br/><br/>2.   Tactics Phase<br/>-    The current player may discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.<br/><br/>3.   Attack Phase<br/>-     The current player (the attacker) picks a target enemy unit to attack (the defender).  The attacker plays an Attack (Heart) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his attack score.<br/><br/>4.    Dodge Phase<br/>-     The defender may play a Dodge (Diamond) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his dodge score. If the dodge score is equal to or greater than the attack score, the attack misses in which case skip the Damage and Armour phases.<br/><br/>5.   Damage Phase<br/>-    If the attack hit (i.e. was not dodged), the attacker plays a Damage (Club) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his damage score.<br/><br/>6.   Armour Phase<br/>-    The defender may play an Armour (Spade) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his armour score. If the armour score is equal to or greater than the damage score, the attack does no damage. If the damage score is higher, the defender takes hits equal to the difference. Units are destroyed when they are reduced to zero or less Hits.<br/><br/>7.   Combo Counter Phase<br/>-    The attacker may play a face card with the Combo ability to attack an additional time this turn. This attack may be against a different opposing unit. After this, the defender may play a face card with the counter trait to also make an attack this turn (against the current player).<br/><br/>8.   End Phase<br/>-    All players may discard up to 2 cards.<br/><br/>Play continues until all enemy units are destroyed.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls one noble who is making improvements to his estate.<br/><br/>The board is a circular track with 16 spaces. Pawns are utilised to track movement around the track<br/><br/>There are 2 decks of cards: The Income Deck and the Status Deck. The top 4 cards of each deck are always kept face up and are available for purchase. <br/>-    The income deck has six types of cards: Agriculture, Mining, Industry, Trade, Titles and Credit.

These 6 card types correspond to six of the spaces on the game board. Each card has a cost and a status value<br/><br/>Each player gets 20 coins and starts with an Estate Size = 10. Players elect to be one of 5 different aristocrats which gives them a unique starting position (larger estate, extra coins etc.)<br/><br/>On your turn roll one die. You may go either forwards or backwards. If you land on a space that has one or more matching cards face up, you may buy them and place face up in front of you OR if you land on a space that has an income type matching income cards you own you may collect income from them equal to their total income value. <br/>-   If you land on the Country space you may discard all the face up income cards and go again. <br/>-   If you land on the London space you must pay 2 Coins then you may discard all the face up status cards and go again. <br/>-    If you land on the Land space you may pay 2D6 Coins to increase the size of your estate by 1. <br/>-    If you land on the Rent space gain 1D6 Coins.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player has more than 30 improvements.

Income Phase<br/>-    You must either play an income card or initiate a random income sequence. <br/>-    When playing a restaurant income card all restaurants of that type earn income. <br/>They gain 1 coin for every adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) district.  When playing a district income card all restaurants adjacent to that type of district earn 1 coin each. <br/>All players earn income, not just the active player. <br/>-   To initiate a random income sequence roll 2D8 to get a random space on the board. If that space is a restaurant, that restaurant earns income for each adjacent district. If that space is a district, each adjacent restaurant earns 1 coin. <br/>-   If you have the only restaurants of a given type on the board they gain 1 star.  All restaurants start with a base rating of 1 star.  Certain Improvements and bonuses increase the number of stars. When a restaurant receives income multiply by its star rating to get the number of coins it earns.<br/><br/>End Phase<br/>Discard cards in your hand in excess of 4.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when one of the following happens: <br/>-    Any player runs out of tokens to use.<br/>-    All restaurants of a single type are built.<br/>-    Players go through the deck twice. <br/>The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

There are 10 cards of each type with every card having a point value between 1 and 5.<br/><br/>Each turn has 5 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Deploy Phase: 2 cards are dealt face down to each player. Next 3X stacks of 2 cards each are dealt to the centre of the table (X = number of players). All stack cards are visible to all players. <br/>     Recruit Phase: Players take turns taking 1 stack of cards and putting it into their hand. This continues until all stacks are taken (each should get 3 stacks).  On each consecutive turn, the player to the left of the player who went first last time now gets to go first. <br/>     Action Phase: Players take turns taking one action each, in the same order as in Recruit phase. When taking an action, discard 1 card from your hand. This produces a result that that depends on the type of card you discard (i.e. if you discard an Alice card you may draw 3 cards and keep 1, discarding an Ally card allows you to draw 2 cards <br/>     Meld Phase: To make a meld, a player needs to have 1 card of each of the 10 types. Melds are played face up and score points equal to the total point value of all the cards in the meld.  If the total of the friend cards is greater than the total of the foe cards an extra 5 meld points are scored. All meld cards are discarded after scoring. <br/>     End Phase: Max hand size is 10 cards.  Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The winner is the player to be the first to score 70 meld points.<br/><br/>",

Each player is a team of Operatives, Mercs, and/or Survivors that have infiltrated a Top Secret Underground Umbrella Corporation Research Facility with the intent to destroy it. The teams will fight zombies, mutants, Umbrella employees, and facility defences. They will be aided by cards representing weapons, Alice, and new recruits. <br/> There are 4 common decks: <br/>Agent Deck - Contains agents you can recruit for your team. <br/>Aid Deck - Helpful events and things you find along the way.  <br/>Encounter Deck - Foes and unfavourable events. <br/>Boss Deck - Big Monsters<br/>Agents and Foes have stats for Life, Evade, Attacks Initiative, Aim and Strength.<br/><br/>The facility is represented by a track that is 40 spaces long.  The first space is the entrance. The end space is the final encounter.<br/><br/>Each player draws 7 cards from the Agent deck and discards one. Players start with 3 Aid cards in their hand.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 6 phases:<br/><br/>1.   Aid Phase<br/>-    Draw 1 Aid card and add it to your hand.<br/><br/>2.   Recruit Phase<br/>-    Some Action Aid cards are played in this phase.<br/><br/>3.   Move Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D6 and move your marker forward that many spaces. If you land on another player&rsquo;s pawn immediately move forward 1 space.<br/><br/>4.   Encounter Phase<br/>-    Draw 1 card from the Encounter deck. This will be something you have to fight this turn. If you reached the final space draw a card from the Boss deck instead of the Encounter deck.<br/><br/>5.   Fight Phase<br/>-    Units make attacks in order of Initiative. <br/>-    When making an attack roll 1D10: if this is equal to or less than the Aim score then the attack hits. <br/>-    The defending unit then rolls 1D10: if this equal to or less than the Evade score of the Unit then the attack is negated. <br/>-    Attacks that hit and are not evaded do damage. A Unit that has more damage than life is killed. <br/>-    During a fight phase turn all Units get to attack (usually just once)<br/>-    Repeat the Fight Phase sequence until one side is completely killed off or an Aid card allows you to escape.<br/><br/>6.   End Phase<br/>-    Make contamination checks if the Agent has been damaged but not killed to determine if they will turn into a zombie. <br/>-    Max hand size is 6 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to make it to the end of the track and destroy the Boss Monster encountered there.<br/><br/>",

Players move their pawns around a circular track collecting the tokens needed to solve a central mystery and its complications.<br/><br/>The board is a circular track with 12 spaces around which players move in a clockwise direction.  The spaces on the board allow players to gain tokens, or draw cards from the various decks.<br/><br/>There are six token types each representing one of six traits: Guile, Lore, Search, Heart, Fight, Magic<br/><br/>There are 3 common decks of cards:<br/><br/>Mystery Deck<br/><br/>       Each card represents a mystery that must be solved or resolved. To solve a mystery a player must collect 3 of each token type, plus extra tokens required by individual mysteries and complications.  An individual mystery card lists any extra tokens required in addition to the 3 of each type. When a mystery is solved, the solving player keeps the card and a new card is drawn from the mystery deck to be the new mystery. <br/><br/><br/>Complication Deck<br/><br/>       When a player lands on the complication space on the board, they draw a complication card. This card is placed face up next to the board.  This card lists extra tokens that need to be gained to solve the current mystery. This additional burden applies to all players.  When the current mystery is solved, these cards are discarded. <br/><br/><br/>Assistance Deck<br/><br/>       When a player lands on the assistance space, they draw an assistance card. This card gives that player one or more extra tokens. The assistance card is then discarded. <br/><br/><br/>To start the top mystery card is placed face up in the middle of the movement track. Players then take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Move Phase<br/>         Roll 1 die and move that many spaces clockwise along the track. <br/>    <br/>     Action Phase<br/>         Most spaces when you land on them give you 1 or more Tokens. <br/>         If you land on a Deck space, draw a card from the indicated deck. <br/>         If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s Pawn, steal 1 Token of your choice from him.

Keep the Mystery card and discard all complications. All players discard all of their Tokens. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The winner is the first player to solve 3 mysteries.<br/><br/>",

In order to deliver the packages, the piglets decided to form their own delivery companies.<br/><br/>When delivering a package for receipt confirmation they received a hoof print rather than a signature. Each of the piglets' companies compete to see who makes the speediest deliveries.<br/><br/>In this game, the goal is to move the three pig pieces to the four home bases (other than your own) and collect four hoof print chips before anyone else.<br/><br/>Each player controls three piglets, starting with all three piglet pieces placed on their home base. There are a total of 5 home bases, one for each player from the center.<br/><br/>On their turn, players also draw animal tiles and add them to their hand. After drawing a tile, the player carries out all of the following actions, in any order, during their turn: moving a piglet, placing an animal tile, and returning a piglet. Throw away tiles to ensure a player&rsquo;s hand does not exceed three tiles. The game ends when a player successfully moves their piglets to the other four home bases and collects all the hoof prints to win the game.<br/><br/>Moving a piglet - This action, in combination with the below action (placing an animal tile), can only be carried out a maximum of three times during a single turn (e.g., place one animal tile + move 2 spaces).  A player may move their piglet one space in any direction. The player can also use the secret passage spaces to travel even further. However, except for the home base spaces, a piglet cannot move to a space that is already occupied by another piglet. In addition, if a piglet moves onto a space with an animal tile placed on it, they must obey the law of that tile. If a piglet successfully moves to a home base, they can receive the hoof print from that base.<br/><br/>Placing an animal tile - This action, in combination with the above action (moving a piglet), can only be carried out a maximum of three times (e.g., place two animal tiles + move 1 spaces). A player places an animal tile from their hand onto an open space. An open space is a space where no animal tiles or piglets are currently placed. However, some tiles can take the place of other tiles and some tiles cannot be placed on some spaces.<br/><br/>Returning a piglet - This action can be used an unlimited number of times per turn. Move one piglet that is not currently placed on your home base back to your home base. At the same time, you can add a tile (without a piglet piece placed on top) into your hand.<br/><br/>ある日、お母さんぶたは仔ぶたたちに荷物運びのお手伝いを頼みました。子ぶたたちは荷物を運ぶために運送会社を作りました。荷物を渡したら、サインの代わりに足跡のハンコを貰います。<br/>さあ競争です。誰よりも早くみんなの家に荷物を運んでしまいましょう。<br/>このゲームの目的は、3匹の仔ぶたコマを動かして自分以外の4か所の拠点を回り、他の誰よりも早く4つの足跡チップを集めることです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>小人さんのやさい畑 (Kobito-san no Yasai Batake) is a game about little people growing crops. Kobito-san means 'small beings', akin to Halfling or dwarvish people in a fairy tale. Yasai Batake would be a vegetable farm or field. In this context 'Little People's Vegetable Patch' is probably a close match.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to plant, grow, and harvest the vegetables. Successfully harvested vegetables grant you points. The game itself has a simultaneous action choice with butting mechanics. Butting is the Japanese gaming term for matching values cancelling out, as in games like Hols der Geier.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of cards: Plant card (green border) / Supply card (yellow border) / Buy-in card (white border). Each turn, every player chooses a card from their hand, and reveals it simultaneously. If any players have played the same kind of Plants, those Plants are cancelled, dumped to the discard pile, and their turn is skipped.<br/><br/>Any remaining vegetables are played on the field, &quot;slow growing&quot; ones first. You place your chips around your planted vegetable, the same number as the &quot;required turns to harvest&quot; value.<br/><br/>Then the supply cards come in to action. Shovel icon cards have an one-time instant effect, resolve it and discard. Trap icon cards may be placed on the field with your chip as an identifier.<br/><br/>Finally, resolve the Buy-in cards. You may draw cards from the deck, but the more players that played Buy-in the same time, the fewer card you may draw. If you are the only one playing, you draw 3 cards. If 2 players are playing, you both draw 2. Otherwise, each player may draw 1 card. The played Buy-in card is returned to your hand.<br/><br/>After that come the Planting phase, the Saboteur phase and Grow/Harvest phase.<br/><br/>At the Saboteur phase, the Saboteur (some destructive animals) moves in the field. If the Saboteur runs over any of the vegetables, or chips that belong to a vegetable, that vegetable is wasted, and removed from the field.<br/><br/>Then the Grow/Harvest phase. For each vegetable, pick a chip that belongs to that vegetable, and stack it on the vegetable card. If there are no chips left on the field for that card, it is considered grown and may be harvested to score you points.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Place your hobbits in the vegetable patch and grow, harvest your vegetables!<br/><br/>Kobito-san no Yasai Batake is a game where you place your hobbits in the game field and harvest the vegetables. The first player to harvest the predetermined amount of vegetables is the winner.<br/><br/>The field is small. You may need to race to get a better area. Should you work steadily on a small, quick and easy-to-grow vegetable? Or a slow but huge one? It's up to you. But beware, Saboteur animals maybe lurking nearby. They maybe after your hard-grown vegetables, so watch out!<br/><br/>畑に小人さんを配置してやさいを収穫しよう！<br/><br/>「小人さんのやさい畑」はフィールドに小人さんを配置してやさいを収穫するゲームです。いち早く、規定量のやさいを収穫できた人が勝者となります。<br/><br/>土地は狭いため取り合いになってしまうかもしれません。小さくコツコツと育てるか、大きく大逆転を狙うかはあなた次第。<br/><br/>しかし、畑にはお邪魔物がいます。せっかく育てたやさいを台無しにされないように気を付けてください。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game for 2-4+ players themed on the Latin American revolutions 1809 - 1826.<br/><br/>The board is a circular track of 41 spaces.  Eight countries are represented on the track by a series of consecutive spaces of length 3, 4 or 5. Countries are separated from each other on the track by a revolution space<br/><br/>Players share a common deck comprising cards of two main types: Liberation cards and Royalist cards. There are 5 types of Liberation Cards: Simon Bolivar, Leader, Troops, Battle, and Ideals. All cards have a force value between 1 and 8.<br/><br/>Players start with two cards drawn from the deck and a set of counters and markers.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 Phases:<br/><br/>Draw Phase<br/><br/>     Draw 1 Card and place it in your hand. <br/><br/><br/>Move Phase<br/><br/>     Roll 1 die and move forward that many spaces OR discard a card from your hand and move forward a number of spaces equal to its force value. <br/>     If you land on a Revolution space you may do one of three actions: <br/>         Roll the die and move again<br/>         Move to any other Revolution space on the board<br/>         Draw 1 card and place it in your hand<br/>         Play a counter onto any country space you have liberated<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Action Phase<br/><br/>      If you land on a Country space that has no card on it, you may (but do not have to) play a Liberation card to that space. Tuck it partially under the board directly next to the space. Place 1 of your counters on the space if you placed a card there. If you have a card under a space you are said to have liberated it. <br/>     If you land on a Country space that you have already liberated (You have a card and one or more counters there already) you may do one of the following: <br/>         Place an additional counter on the Space<br/>         Exchange the tucked card with one from your hand  <br/>         Draw 1 card and discard 1 card (It may be the same card) <br/>    <br/>     If you land on a Country space liberated by another player, you can either do nothing or play 1 or more Royalist cards with a combined force value equal to or greater than the number of counters your opponent has on the space. If you do so, discard all the counters on the space and the card tucked under it. Remove the Royalist cards from the game. <br/>     If you land on a Country space that is Independent skip over it and go to the next space and resume your move. <br/><br/><br/>Independence Phase<br/><br/>     If you played a Liberation card under a Country space this turn and all the other spaces for that country have already been liberated (by you or others) the Country is now said to have gained its Independence. Immediately score Victory Tokens (VT) for the country. <br/>         You gain 2 Victory Tokens for playing the final card to make the country go Independent. <br/>         The player with the highest combined total of counters and card force values gets 5 VT. <br/>         The player with the second highest total of counters and card force values gets 3 VT. <br/>         All other players with at least 1 card and counter in the country get 1 VT each. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>End Phase<br/><br/>     Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends when all countries have been liberated. The player with the most VT at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card and board skirmish game for 2 players themed on renaissance warfare with Leonardo da Vinci style inventions. The setting is Italian City States at war circa 1490 - the Fivizzano are invading the Piombino.<br/><br/>Play is conducted on a 16 x 16 square grid map. Each 8 x 8 section is referred to as a quadrant &ndash; the 2 eastern quadrants are land, the 2 western quadrants are water. The 6 squares of the NE corner of the SW quadrant contain city squares -  the Port City commune of Piombino. The remainder of the map layout is determined at discretion of the players though most of the land spaces should be flat land with a few clumps of forests and mountains and a few solitary hills, villages, and swamps. <br/>One road connects the city to a village or two and then goes off the map. A few Islands dot the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Terrain types will affect the movement of the different unit types.<br/><br/>There are 11 different unit types: Infantry, Engineers, Cavalry, Artillery, War Machine, Flying Machine, Fortification, Small Warship, Large Warship, Transport and Mine Field.  Each unit type has a move rating, hits score and range, and may have a special capability.<br/><br/>The players start with a pre-defined army comprising a mix of the various units.  The attacker (the Fivizzano) starts with his units in the bottom half of the Southern quadrants. In addition the Fivizzano gets one roll against the leader table and 4 rolls against the invention table &ndash; these give advantages / enhancements that last for the duration of the battle. The defender (the Piombino) starts with units scattered in the Northern quadrants, one roll against the leader table and 6 against the invention table.<br/><br/>Players share a Tactics deck comprising cards that mostly give short duration benefits.  These cards can be used, when appropriate, to enhance your own actions or negate those of your opponent<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:<br/><br/>Draw Phase<br/><br/>     Draw 2 Tactics cards. <br/><br/><br/>Move Phase<br/><br/>     Each of your Units may be moved once up to a number of spaces equal to its move rating. <br/><br/><br/>Attack Phase<br/><br/>      Each of your units may make 1 attack vs. a target within its range. When attacking roll 1D10. On a roll of 7 or higher the attack is successful and the target loses 1 hit. A unit with zero hits is destroyed. <br/><br/><br/>End Phase <br/><br/>     Max Hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The Fivizzano win if they occupy 4 of the spaces of the city. <br/>The Piombinos win if they destroy 20 or more units.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Redneck Madness, two teams are faced by the dominance of the drink that is consumed in the USA. On the one hand, there is the Mega-corporation Puke Cola, which with all its economic power and Human Resources is implanting a new drink very sugary that is becoming addictive to the population. This Mega-corporation will be controlled by a single Player who with his fleet of Delivery trucks must distribute the Puke Cola throughout the States of the USA, hire Employees for his company and form a Puke Cola dispatcher army, manufacture the different varieties of Puke Cola, reinforce its Headquarters with traps to avoid fortuitous incursions and, finally, to avoid that the side of the Redneck steal to them the secret recipe of the Puke Cola.<br/><br/>Against him is the team of the family of Rednecks, the Hickey. They were on vacation in Hawaii when the Puke Cola began to be commercialized. In this team of 1 to 3 players will have to cooperate and help each other. To be able to get Hawaiian Air Tickets to bring back all family members, knock down Puke Cola advertising banners and put up Beer Posters, bribe Puke Cola workers to reveal company secret information, or get drunk to the employees and leave them out of the game. All this while getting better objects and new members of the Hickey family to infiltrate the Puke Cola Factory. Since there will be epic clashes to see who sticks more drinking and who ends up collapsing first, if the members of Puke Cola for the excess of alcohol from the beer. Or the Rednecks for blood sugar overdose.<br/><br/>Once they face the length and breadth of the US, everything will be decided at Puke Cola Headquarters where both teams will face for control of the drink. Will the Rednecks steal the Puke Cola recipe or will Puke Cola's loyal employees get the Redneck out of action for blood sugar overdose?<br/><br/>The game is developed over 10 rounds on a map of the USA in which as the rounds progress the player who manages the corporation of Puke Cola will incorporate in each turn a new delivery truck with which to move and conquer states and put the difficult things to the Rednecks locking up and making difficult the movement, as it conquer states it manages to recruit more distributors for its army that they incorporate to its factory to generate more Puke Cola that gives to him more force of attack for the battle final. Redneck will have to do different missions that will pick up from the deck of missions at the beginning of each turn and for which they will spend cards  of resources to move that will be obtained at the beginning of each turn and when completing missions in the form of rewards. Each mission that can complete an ally involves traveling to one of the 48 US states having to travel on a map of the US with more and more presence of Puke Cola trucks. Among the different types of missions we will have to recruit new Redneck, pay bribes with the money obtained from completing previous missions, combats the deliverymen to reduce their army, release states under Puke Cola control and thus reduce the power of the corporation. The enemy moves all of their trucks to an adjacent state on each turn while allies have to make use of the resources and rewards in the form of cards that they get as the game progresses. After the 10 turns on the map of the USA in which Puke Cola will have increased its army and attack power and the Redneck will see their resistance to the reduced Puke Cola will take place a direct confrontation in the factory of Puke Cola in the pure style Dungeon Crawler with simplified mechanics and fast combat between all the characters at once in each room. The fighting is resolved with a bidding system in which each side bets on all the plates that it picks from its bag which assigns to attack and defense and are compared with the bet by the opposing side, these bids can be modified by the different reward cards obtained in the previous phase.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pizzeria Boss is a set-collecting and hand management card game with just a little bit of a &ldquo;take that!&rdquo; element (let&rsquo;s face it, sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to stick it to your neighbor). With limited resources can you complete more pizza orders than your competitors before the end of the game? Need some help along the way? Great! You can bring in managers and even The Boss to help out! Let&rsquo;s just hope that they don&rsquo;t get fired before they serve their usefulness. To win, you&rsquo;ll need to play the right cards at the optimal time.<br/><br/>The game comes with two decks of cards, the &ldquo;Boss deck&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Order deck&rdquo;. The two decks work in conjunction with each other. The &quot;Order deck&quot; determines what toppings you need on your pizza. The Boss deck provides the toppings and all the little things needed to help your business along the way.  If you play your cards right you might even disrupt your competitors. Once you order is prepared it must be cooked.  Be wary--until that order is done and the money is in your pocket that customer could still decide to cancel. That's just how pizza life goes, right? Health inspectors, cancelled orders, not having what you need in stock - these are all possible disasters that could happen. But there is also the good things - helpful managers, a boss willing to lend a hand or customers who pay for their order early. Explore all these things and more in Pizzeria Boss.<br/><br/>",

The birds are fast, but cannot carry much.   The lizards are slow, but can carry a great deal.<br/><br/>The players must balance trade goods, guards, and water if their caravans are to reach the other side alive.  The game includes miniatures of the beasts that carry the tiles representing these guards, goods and the tiles representing raider opponents.<br/><br/>Besides limited water, the principle danger in the desert is the raiders and their dread leader, the self-styled Raider Queen.   At the conclusion of their turn a player must draw an encounter card, view it secretly, and then decide where to place it on the game board.   Players can choose ever longer routes to avoid encounter cards or risk the hazard to take a direct route to their goal.<br/><br/>If the raiders are encountered, battle will ensue.   The other players control the raiders in these fast-paced contests.   The defending player must decide how to best ward off attacks and get as many elements of the caravan to safety as possible.

        "description": "A card game for 2-4+ players with a modern combat theme<br/><br/>Players share a common deck comprising cards of 4 different types of military unit (Infantry, Vehicle, Artillery, Air).  As well as their Unit type these cards also have an attack characteristic, and an event characteristic.  These cards can be used in three different ways -  as a unit, to attack, or as an event.<br/><br/>In addition there are Intel cards which do not function as a unit but will list an attack and an event, or two events.<br/><br/>Cards being used as Units are kept face-up on the table in front of the controlling player. Cards put into play as units are said to be Deployed.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Logistics Phase <br/>         Draw 4 cards from the deck.<br/>    <br/>     Deploy Phase<br/>         You may put 1 unit card into play from your hand. <br/>    <br/>     Attack Phase<br/>         You may make 1 attack this phase by playing a card for its attack function.  The attack function of a card will specify attacker type and target type. (e.g. Infantry attacks Vehicle).   When a card is being used to attack, you must have the appropriate type of Unit in play (deployed) that can make the attack. The attack targets either the opponent&rsquo;s base or a specific type of Unit that the opponent has in play. As a result of the attack, the attack card is discarded and the target unit is discarded, or if the base was attacked, the target player will gain 1 damage for each unit that attacked.  The attacking unit(s) remain in play.  Some event cards will allow the defender to negate the Attack.<br/>    <br/>     Event Phase<br/>         You may play 1 event card this phase.  Discard the event card when played. <br/>    <br/>     Friction Phase<br/>         Max hand size is 5 cards. Give excess cards to one or more opponents. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players are eliminated when they have accumulated 20 or more points of damage. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game for 1-4+ players in which each player is a unique incarnation of Xenophon and the Ten Thousand. The 10,000 are Greek mercenaries who have come to fight for Cyrus, the younger brother of the Persian King Artaxerxes. Cyrus is killed in battle against the King leaving the Greeks abandoned, deep in hostile territory. The Greeks begin a long march northward to the Black Sea and Greek territory. The player whose pawn reaches the sea first and with the most men is the winner.<br/><br/>There are 2 Tracks: <br/><br/>     The Distance Track. This track has 60 numbered spaces. The first space is that of Cunaxa where Cyrus was killed. The last space is the Coastal Greek Colony of Trapezus. Each player has his own uniquely coloured pawn which he moves along <br/><br/><br/>the distance Track. Each space represents about 10 Miles.<br/><br/>The Time Track<br/><br/>     This track has 60 numbered spaces. A single neutral pawn is moved a single space after all players have completed a single turn. When a player reaches the sea he should take his coloured pawn from the distance track and place it on the time track on the current space to mark how long his journey took.  Each space represents about 2 days. <br/><br/><br/>Each player starts with 10,000 men. Men are lost during the journey due to fighting, exposure, starvation, and desertion. Paper and pencil to keep track of your manpower total.<br/><br/>Each Food Token represents 1 days supply worth of food for the Army. Lack of Food Tokens will result in accumulation of Starvation Tokens. Mutiny Tokens represent dissent and despondency amongst the ranks. Anger Tokens represent the accumulation of barbarian forces arrayed against you.<br/><br/>Players share an action deck. Most cards will increase or reduce the value of a target die-roll. Most improve your rolls. Others will be to the detriment of your opponent.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 16 Phases: <br/><br/>     Draw Phase - The current player draws 3 cards. <br/>     Route Phase - Roll against the Route Table.  The result will generate modifiers for one or more of the forage, travel and battle rolls. <br/>     Weather Phase &ndash; Roll against the Weather Table. The weather conditions will generate modifiers for the forage and travel rolls<br/>     Satrap Phase &ndash; Roll against the Satrap table to determine whether you encounter a Satrap.<br/>     Negotiations Phase - If you encountered a Satrap this turn make a negotiation roll. This will result in gaining Anger or Food tokens.<br/>     Attack Phase - Make an Attack Roll. If your result is equal to or less than the number of AT you have, you are attacked by Barbarians. <br/>     Battle Phase - If you are attacked by Barbarians remove 1 Anger Token and make a battle roll to determine the number of casualties.<br/>     Exposure Phase - If the weather was harsh this turn make an exposure roll and lose men accordingly.<br/>     Forage Phase - You may choose not to forage, if so skip this turn. Otherwise make a roll against the forage table to gain a combination of food and anger tokens<br/>     Consumption Phase - If you currently have a food token, discard all your starvation tokens. Discard 1 food token. If you have no food tokens to lose gain 1 starvation token. <br/>     Starvation Phase - If you have Starvation Tokens make a roll to determine the number of men lost.<br/>     Morale Phase &ndash; Roll on morale table to determine whether you gain a mutiny token.<br/>     Rally Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a rally roll to see whether you can remove any of them.<br/>     Desertion Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a desertion roll to see whether any men desert. <br/>     Travel Phase - Make a travel roll to determine how far your pawn advances on the distance map. This roll will be modified by weather and route markers and other activities undertaken during the turn.<br/>     End Phase - Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends when all players have finally reached the last space on the Distance Track. Players then calculate their scores: <br/>Player Score = (Remaining men) divided by (number of turns to reach the sea)<br/><br/>",

Word-O-Grams are ridiculous stories with missing components, Who, what, When, Where and Why. Each player will get a complete 5-set of each of the Word-O-Gram&rsquo;s missing categories. Category cards are to be kept separately.  Wordsmiths will take turns rolling the die which will determine which category is played that round. The category will display an unrelated question in which you compete for the best answer. The winning Wordsmith of that round gets to add the answer to their Word-O-Gram in the matching category. Once they have one of each category, the Word-O-Gram&rsquo;s story will be readable and complete. If a player gets 5 of the same category they may trade 4 in to get one they are missing. Remember, the goal in playing cards is not only to get picked but mainly to complete your Word-O-Gram, so choose cards that will impress your opponents but also play well with your story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simplified P-n-P board game with small play tiles with a design of play for younger players to help with matching four types of birds in a garden, counting colours (flower beds), counting scores along a score track, taking turns and taking tiles from a cup or bag.  The game can also be played by older players as well, as there are Advanced Optional Rules included &ndash; the game can actually get quite tactical for older players. The game is designed for 2 players but can be played with 4 in pairs.<br/><br/>The correct placing of the bird types and the 'wild tile' fish pond tiles scores points which are recorded on the included score track and the winner has the highest score at the end of the game.  There is also some final end-game scoring of only the coloured background tiles of the birds that have been placed within each players own columns of garden squares.  Bonus points can also be scored by correctly placing the 'wild tile' fish ponds in a player's garden column.<br/><br/>This P-n-P home-made test version includes the game-board (that represents a garden of squares and a score track), a counter-mix and a set of game rules for use by families with younger (and older) gamers at BGG to try out.  It should only take about 15-30 mins to play a game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ryle is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Guild faction.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Ryle Hoffman is the older brother of C. Hoffman and the end result of breach psychosis and the wonders of Ramos. This once-brilliant individual was almost destroyed entering Malifaux, and only Ramos' hasty work was able to rebuild him into the creature he is now. <br/>Ryle is a melee oriented construct with above average damage tracks and a few tricks to stay alive. <br/>external image 14d94912-b346-4e5d-8fc7-bd27dac8eab7.jpg<br/>Table of Contents<br/>Overview<br/>Mobility<br/>Offense<br/>Resilience<br/>Soulstones<br/>Tricks and Tips While Joining a Crew<br/>Tricks and Tips While Leading a Crew<br/>Building a Crew<br/>Playing Against Ryle<br/>Mobility<br/>He has a strictly below average Walk and Charge but his (0) Socially Repressed allows him to push 4&quot; aways from a model within 12&quot; so with good positioning you can move him 12&quot; a turn. The Socially Repressed action also allows him to escape melee easily if needed (eg. taking interact actions).<br/><br/>Offense<br/>Damage is where Ryle shines. He has a gatling gun attached to one hand and a mechanical fist attached to the other one.<br/><br/>Hydraulic Fist<br/>This as an above Ml stat and a remarkable 3/5/7 damage profile. Moreover it comes with Critical Strike so if you use a soulstone for Rams and cheat a high Ram card you will be doing 5/7/9. This is enough to kill a large proportion minions model in one action and threaten the rest with two.<br/><br/>Modified Steam Gatling Hun<br/>This is Ryle ranged attack and comes with an average Sh stat and lower damage profile than his fist. However it comes standard with a positive on the attack flip allowing you to target models in cover at your leisure and an automatic Trigger that gives a positive flip to the damage, meaning you can get the moderate or severe damage far more reliably.<br/><br/>The other Trigger Raking Fire requires an extra Ram and allows you to take the Modified Steam Gatling attack against another model which has not been targeted with it this activation. It also comes with no restriction on the number of times you can use it, so as long as you have soulstones or Rams in hands and eligible targets you can keep on firing away. This is immensely powerful against crews that clump together such as gremlins or spider swarms. However, against more elite crews you will find yourself using Concentrated Burst almost exclusively.<br/><br/>Resilience<br/>Ryle's weakest points are his low Df and terrible Wp stats, both of which are well below average for a Henchman. This makes him vulnerable to potshots from enemy Minions and Enforcers and means you'll rarely be able to win defensive duels against Masters or other Henchmen. He does come with a few tricks to help with this though.<br/><br/>Firstly he has Armor +1 and decent wounds take the edge off weaker attacks. He also has the Grinding Halt Trigger to gain an additional Armor +2 with Tomes on his Df. This means you can often pitch a weak tomes or spend a soulstone to cut 4 damage down to 1, however it cannot protect himself from attacks that target Wp or those that ignore Armor.<br/><br/>He can also heal with (0) Field Repairs at the cost of a card, letting him recoup wounds in the thick of things whenever you don't need to use Socially Repressed. This can also be used on friendly constructs, which is a handy way to spread the healing around.<br/><br/>Finally as a Henchman he can use Soulstones to prevent damage and to aid defensive flips.<br/><br/>Soulstones<br/>Ryles has several options to use his soulstones. He can use them to increase the damage of his Mechanical Fist, automatically trigger Raking Fire on his gatling gun or to protect himself but adding Tomes to his Df. As well as that with his low stats Df and Wp stats you will want to keep a few stones for damage prevention flips if he gets in trouble.<br/><br/>Tricks and Tips While Joining a Crew<br/>Ryle is a construct so he has obvious synergies with C. Hoffman. Hoffman can Power Loop Ryle to increase his stats and use Machine Puppet to get around his low mobility and provide more attacks.<br/><br/>His Field Repairs action plays well with with Hoffman but also gives him a bit of synergy with any crew with an interest in taking some constructs, such as Lucius the various construct minions.<br/><br/>He is also a good choice for any crew that wants a shooting model with some extra melee punch, meaning Sonnia and Perdita might like to take him as insurance against enemies getting too close to them.<br/><br/>Tricks and Tips While Leading a Crew<br/><br/>Strategies and Schemes<br/>Ryle is pretty killy and tends to lean towards strategies and schemes which reward eliminating enemy models. He's also reasonably mobile and can support other constructs with his (0) actions and upgrades so he can serve as a dangerous and durable anchor for a crew more focused on marker based schemes.<br/><br/>Building a Crew<br/>Francisco Ortega is useful if you are building a crew around Ryle as he can buff Df and Wp. He also provides ranged support, movement shenanigans and decent melee presence, so the two form an effective tag team.<br/>Including constructs in a crew is also a good idea as they can benefit from Field Repairs and Ryles construct oriented upgrades.<br/>Finally Ryle lacks a bit of speed so including fast objective runners should be a priority if needed.<br/>Playing Against Ryle<br/>Ryle is in many ways a glass cannon. Focus on him and he will die. This is especially true if you have models that can target Wp or ignore Armor. Models that can ignore armour are also useful specially if Ryle is in an C. Hoffman crew.<br/><br/>Do not let him hit you with his Hydraulic Fist. It's every bit as dangerous as it sounds, so you're often better off hitting him from range or after he's activated.<br/><br/>",

Calling you to come by day and by night &ndash; to drink its nectar, to pick up its pollen grains, and to transport these to another tree of the same species. Because it&rsquo;s ready to breed.<br/><br/>Flight of Pollen is a semi-cooperative game where you pollinate as many trees as possible by visiting them with a variety of different New Zealand pollinators, with different pollinators being more successful under different weather conditions.  Rounds are split into day and night segments, with different pollinators active during the day versus the night.  Each pollinator must move from one plant to the next of the same species, moving pollen between them until all of the plants of the target species are pollinated- if any are missed, the game is lost.  One or more different native New Zealand plant are the focus for each of the four rounds, and as the rounds progress more pollinator species are added, as well as more plant species with more challenging pollination requirements.  If all of the required plants have been pollinated, then the team that collected the most berries wins the game.<br/><br/>Over each of the four levels different trees send out differing messages in their flowers. You&rsquo;ll need to work together to complete each level, moving as the elements allow.<br/><br/>As flowers pollinated by you (or the wind) become seeds or berries, teams can collect the resulting berries.<br/><br/>Locally made, with recycled materials and FSC card<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a four handed version of the abstract game Xiangqi, the latter also known as Chinese chess.<br/><br/>In the tradition game, the board is divided in half by a line called the river. In the four player version, one might call this a sea. Then each player uses a standard set of pieces set up on their half of a standard board. (Hence only two sets of standard pieces are needed. Ownership of pieces is marked by their orientation since they would read as right-side-up to the controlling player.) Where the river would normally be is extended into a large empty square. Pieces cross but do not go onto this space, the sea. Lines of the board extend across the sea no differently than across the river as far as players opposite each other are concerned. The lines of movement connect to players at either side's boards as if the board on which a player's pieces begin were rotated toward the player on either side. Play is clockwise and otherwise the standard rules of xiangqi apply in all instances.<br/><br/>If at the start of a player's turn, the player's &quot;king&quot; (to use Western terminology for simplicity) is checkmated-- whether by a single player's pieces or pieces of multiple players in combination-- that player is immediately eliminated from the game. Only the &quot;king&quot; is taken from the board but that player's turn is thereafter skipped. Remaining pieces may be taken but do not otherwise move. The last remaining player wins.<br/><br/>This is a game intended primarily for DIY play. Two sets of pieces are needed along with four half-boards. These can be printed from files on BGG or fashioned using multiple sets from the traditional game.<br/><br/>To play a 3 player variant, one of the 4 half-boards is simply not used. A 2 player variant would be the traditional game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the active player rolls the die. On a roll of 2-5, they take the top card of the deck and add it to their city. If it's a location, they place it on the road from their hot springs; if it's a character they place it in a location or hot springs; if it's Hell, hey, it's also a location, so it gets connected to the road.<br/><br/>On a roll of 1 or 6, the first player to call &quot;Noboribetsu!&quot; gets to take the taxi (which allows them to draw two cards on a roll of 2-5) and move one top card in a city. They can steal an opponent's location or character; they can move a character to a matching location; or they can place a lone Hell card on an opponent's location.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, players score nothing for Hell-inflicted locations, 2 points for each location and matching character card on it, and 1 point for all other cards. Whoever scores the most points earns 1 victory point, and after multiple games whoever earns 3 victory points first wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Goosebumps: The Card Game of Monster Mayhem is a furious battle between monsters. Giant Mantis versus Werewolf. Slappy versus the Mummy. This easy and fun card game uses different characteristics to determine which monster will come out on top. Features large oversized cards with art from the Scholastic books.<br/><br/>Shuffle the monster cards, Slappy card, and Mastermind card together and deal all 60 cards. All players place their cards face down in a draw pile in front of them.<br/><br/>The game is played in 6 rounds. In each round, players battle their monsters to win a trophy. Trophies are awarded in the same order as outlined on the monster cards. Ie: in round 1, players only use the Strength ability when battling each other.<br/><br/>Player 1 takes the top card from their draw pile, places the card face up on the table, and declares either &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo;. All the other players flip over their top card and place them face up on the table. Players now battle by comparing their monster&rsquo;s ability ratings. If &ldquo;high&rdquo; was declared, the monster with the highest rating wins the battle. If &ldquo;low&rdquo; was declared, the monster with the lowest rating wins the battle.<br/><br/>Both Slappy and Mastermind are special cards. They have a 1 or 9 rating for all abilities (depending on whether &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; is  declared).<br/><br/>The player who wins the battle places all the cards from the battle into their winnings pile, and then takes the top card from their <br/>draw pile and declares &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; for the next battle. Play continues in this manner until all the monsters have done battle and there are no monster cards left<br/><br/>When the round is over, players count the number of cards in their winnings pile. The player with the most cards wins the round, and collects the corresponding trophy card.<br/><br/>Repeat this process 5 more rounds for the remaining abilities and award trophy cards in the same manner.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 6 trophies have been won. The winner is the player with the most trophies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is a maneuver and fight, dice-less card game of medieval hand-to-hand combat.  The game is for two or more players.  It recreates combat with playing cards that represent individual warriors and warhorses.  In game play, M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is like a traditional miniatures game, except that it uses cards rather than miniatures -- i.e., a miniatures game without the miniatures -- making it very affordable.  Multiple sets of decks are being manufactured, allowing it to serve as a collectible.<br/><br/>Battles are fought on a table top, upon an imagined grid of card-sized columns and ranks.  Alternatively, players may either create their own or purchase a large scale roll up play mat so that spacing is more visually apparent, though this is not required by any means.<br/><br/>The game is designed for simplicity and ease of play.  It is challenging and enables fast-paced play in 30 minutes or less, even when there are 50 warriors or more on each side.  The biggest limitation is the size of the gaming table available, rather than the cost or availability of armies of warrior cards.<br/><br/>The game designer's goal was to make a medieval combat game that cuts out the many complexities that often bog down miniatures combat games.  Instead, the focus was on rendering a more historically realistic experience on the battlefield with colorful and unique coats of arms carried by each warrior, as depicted in large size on the cards.  Launched through Kickstarter, the first sets of the game had cards that were sponsored by individual backers whose names and coats of arms appeared on each warrior card.<br/><br/>While most miniatures and fighting/combat games use various forms of hit points, unit points, and strengths, and these are slowly degraded in various engagements with dice rolling, routing, critical hits, and so forth, M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is different.  There is no extensive paperwork and unit tracking round by round.  There are no chits or markers to indicate wounded warriors or degraded units -- warriors are either alive and fighting, or are killed.<br/><br/>The game depicts small, medium, or large-sized battles, but focuses combat right down to the individual level. Its combat methodology is drawn from the actual experience of the designer (and play testers) in medieval reenactment battles, where an individual fighter is generally doing fine, fighting away, moving, charging to engage, and so forth, but then at some critical moment in the battle, quite suddenly, he or she gets out too much in front or ends up on the flank with opposing forces circling around....  Things happen quickly from there -- and WHAM, WHAM, WHACK, they're down. M&ecirc;l&eacute;e captures that experience perfectly.<br/><br/>In M&ecirc;l&eacute;e, to be defeated, an individual warrior almost universally is first overwhelmed and is simultaneously hit by multiple attacks at once.  For instance, the warrior is attacked by a pole axe, two spears, a great sword, and someone with big mace hitting from the side, and, in that case, no amount of fancy footwork can save the day.  Thus, the key to victory is to maneuver your forces and focus your attacks selectively, maintaining a mobile reserve and carefully planning when, where, and how to engage.<br/><br/>The game's combat methodology is easy to learn, quick to grasp, and fast to play.  The rules are one sheet -- front and back -- and can be explained in a few minutes to almost anyone.  Combat is resolved simply by comparing &quot;Combat Values&quot; on cards.  Generally, if the Combat Values of the combined attacking cards add up to a value of TWICE the defending card's Combat Value, the defender is killed and removed from play.  While simple in practice, skilled players find that there are multiple dimensions of complexity that result.  A unique set of modifiers also are applied based on the four medieval elements -- Fire, Air, Earth, and Water -- as each of these represent combat styles that are chosen and employed in by each player during each combat round.<br/><br/>To win, either the majority of the opposing forces are defeated -- and the other side gives up, seeing no possible victory -- or the opposing side's banner is seized, which brings and early and glorious end to the battle.<br/><br/>Players may also make up their own victory conditions, such as escaping off the field with more than half of the remaining forces when the game is started with vastly unequal sides, or killing the opposing side's Commander, and so forth.<br/><br/>Scenario Packs and Add-On Expansion Card sets are also available, although the basic game provides extensive replayability as it is.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Take Over' is a board game about gaining control of a company by building up a holding of the shares, and subsequently preventing other players from doing the same.<br/><br/>For up to 9 people - 8 players and a Chairman. With less than 8 players, the excess companies are removed from play and their squares on the board are covered over leaving only the companies in play.<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll a die and move a single counter around the board, the square the counter lands on affects all players in the game who has the shares in that company.<br/><br/>The board is similar to monopoly with the companies separated by general bonus or penalty squares that affect all players in the game.<br/><br/>When the counter passes the start the current round ends and the chairman invites bank investments or overdrafts, collects overdraft payments, and oversees the buying and selling of shares.<br/><br/>If at any time during the round, a player cannot pay all the penalties then he has to sell shares to the chairman for a fixed price. At the beginning of the next round all players can buy those shares also at a fixed price.<br/><br/>The game ends when 1 player has all 8 shares in 1 company, they get a &pound;1000 bonus. All players then add up their holdings in shares and money the player with the largest holding wins.<br/><br/>",

This card is invincible and is the card all others shall be played around.<br/><br/>From the remaining deck, deal each player 5 cards and set it face down between all players. A single discard pile shall exist beside it. The player left of the dealer has first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, a player draws up to six cards (the hand limit) and then must play one card into his or her &quot;pack&quot; by placing it in any of 8 possible slots around the &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (above, below, to the sides, or any of the four corners) that are open.<br/><br/>When a card is played, the action written on the card must be completed (if possible), and is only valid for cards played from the player's hand. The turn ends once the card's action has been taken.

        "description": "Gem Quest is the fun and simple card game in which you try to be the first to buy and collect sets of matching jewels, while attempting to stop your opponents from doing the same!<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Shuffle the deck and deal all players 5 cards. If a player gets an &quot;Action&quot; card, it must be traded in for a replacement. Blindly insert said action card back into the deck. Set the deck face down between all players, which shall have a discard pile beside it.<br/>The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, the player flips the deck's top card onto the discard pile. If it's an Action card, take the action (if possible). If it's a coin, the player takes it in to hand. If it's a gem, the player may put coins equal (or greater) to its value on the discard pile to buy it into hand. If the player cannot afford (or doesn't want) the gem, remove it to a field of cards on the playing surface (the Gem Store), from which gems may be bought during one's turn by paying coins to the discard pile. Change is not given.<br/><br/>When a pair of the same gem is collected, it must be set down for all to see. A third of that gem may be added to make a trio. The diamond counts as a pair or trio by itself. Play moves clockwise. If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.<br/><br/>The first to get 3 pairs, or 2 trios, of gems, wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card C-Quence is a light family speed game. It consists of a deck of 144 cards and a game board. This game is unique in that it only contains Hearts, Spades, and wild cards.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 20 cards face down. Players stack them in order without looking at them to form their &quot;stockpile&quot;. The Top card of the stock pile is turned face up.<br/><br/>Each player is then dealt an additional 5 cards which form their hand. The remainder of the cards are placed in the center spot on the game board. The other 4 spots on the board are for community piles 2 for hearts and 2 for spades.  The player to the left of the dealer goes first.<br/><br/>On your turn you may play any number and combination of cards from your hand, stockpile, or discard pile to their respective community spaces on the board. Wild cards may be played in place of any card in matching suit. Community piles must start with the number 1 and build consecutively to the number 5.<br/><br/>Once a pile is completed place it to the side and start a new one. If you run out of cards in your hand immediately draw back up to 5.  When you play the top card of your stockpile turn up the next card. You may play a card as long as you have one available to play or until you choose to stop playing cards.<br/><br/>Each player also has their own separate discard piles one for hearts and one for spades. To end your turn you must discard one card to its respective discard pile. Play continues with then next player in a clockwise fashion.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn draw back up to 5 cards. If the draw pile runs out shuffle the completed community piles to form a new draw pile and place it in the center of the board. The first player to exhaust their stock pile scores 0 points. The other players score 1 point for each card left in their stockpile. When a player reaches 30 points the game ends. The player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>The game may also be played in teams and requires 4 players. All rules remain the same except during you turn you may play from your partners stockpile and discard piles. You may not play from your partners hand. play continues until both players on the same team exhaust their stockpiles. Scores are kept by teams and not by individuals by adding the number of cards/points from both stockpiles.<br/><br/>Card C-Quence is a perfect mix of strategy and luck. Be the first to exhaust your stockpile and maintain the lowest score.<br/><br/>",

On the one hand Cowboys have their trusty six shooters and faithful horses to help them.  On the other hand, Ninja are well versed in the dark arts, possess secret knowledge and skills, and have no qualms about murdering you in your sleep if they think they might lose the show down at sun down.<br/><br/>In Face Off Duels you are installed as the leader of one of these mighty factions and over three rounds of tactical combat you get to figure out which group, which leader, is the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>What separates Face Off Duels from other fighting card games is a unique scoring system that forces players to not only play their opponent, but the board as well.  The result is a quick game that, like a great puzzle, you will want to return to again and again.  The Face Off scoring system plus the magical whimsy that is the Power Deck means no two games of Face Off Duels are the same.<br/><br/>Face Off Duels present you with multiple paths to victory, a myriad of strategic options, and a sense of humor that is way more engaging than this blurb.  In order to win, you must be able to plan ahead, bluff when appropriate, and occasionally pull that one card off the top of the deck.  If you can do all these (and add seven plus five in your head) you just might be able to lead your chosen faction to glory.<br/><br/>",

If successful - that is if the dice rolls exactly the numbers needed - the hunter is awarded an animal card with varying victory points. Whoever manages to collect the most points wins.<br/><br/>Since alla players is supposed to go on the same animal in the same order, animal for animal, it is teorethically possible that player one shoots all four selected animals and thereby win even before player two (not to mention players three, four or five!) has had a go.<br/><br/>The animals and their value: Tiger (100), Elephant (75), Lion (50), Rhino (50), Capercaillie (40), Bear (30), Owl (30), Hyena (20), Crocodile (5) and Chimpanzee (5).<br/><br/>This game would probably be seen as politically incorrect nowadays and impossible to publish.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Can we do that? With me possibly getting slightly more than half? After all, when the mountain of sweets has run out, whoever has the most sweets wins!<br/><br/>In その男、班文虎 (That Man, Going Halfsies), players start with a deck of 76 cards, with the values ranging from 0-8, along with a few 11s, and with the numbers 2-4 appearing most frequently. Shuffle the deck, then place ten cards on the bottom of the deck at a 90&ordm; angle from the other cards.<br/><br/>For the first turn, the active player (&quot;elder brother&quot;) reveals the top card to all players, then takes that card in hand along with three other cards. The elder brother then splits the cards into two face-down piles, offering one pile to a younger brother (the player on the left) and keeping the other pile. If younger brother accepts the split, the elder brother places their cards aside in a scoring pile, then the younger brother takes their pile into their hand, draws cards to fill their hand to four, then becomes the elder brother and offers a split with the brother on their left.<br/><br/>If the younger brother doesn't accept the split, then reveal the cards in the two piles. If the elder brother kept the larger share for himself, then you get to split that elder brother's share in half, discarding the larger half (if you can't split it evenly) to punish him for being unfair. If the elder brother's share was only a single card, then discard that card.<br/><br/>If, however, the elder brother had split the pile evenly or favored the younger brother, then the younger brother's pile is split in half or discarded as punishment as described above. The elder brother keeps their share, then retains their role as elder brother, with the next player in clockwise order taking the role of younger brother. The elder brother reveals the top card, etc.<br/><br/>When you start drawing from the ten cards that had been turned 90&ordm;, continue play until the player to the right of the first elder brother has either received a share in the role of elder brother, or doubted what was given to them, then resolved that situation. Everyone then tallies their points to see who collected the most sweets!<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;ll work through their followers in pairs to manipulate their rivals and accomplish their goals both in plain sight and in secret.<br/><br/>Final Judgment is an area control/hand management card game for 1-2 players inspired by occult practices and Tarot decks. Players will draft decks based on 4 gods: Jehovah, Christ, Satan, and Lucifer, and then use these cards to compete for Influence in a shared spread of cards called the Common Realm. Players will take various actions to maintain cards from their hand, Personal Realm, and Common Realm to utilize special powers and manipulate their opponent. Players will also use cards from a fifth shared deck, the Major Arcana, to complete secret objectives and gain more points. The player with the most influence at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Each god's deck of cards contains unique strengths and weaknesses and leads to many diverse playing strategies and increased replay-ability.<br/><br/>Also includes a single player variant with a player-controlled AI called The Fate. The player will have to manage their deck smoothly and make choices for the AI to hopefully complete 7 objectives from the Major Arcana deck as well as have the most Influence over the Common Realm to win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The legendary Blue Riband award was the greatest prize of all, won by the passenger ship with the fastest westbound transatlantic crossing. In this game, you&rsquo;ll design and operate your own classic transatlantic liner, with one player as Lusitania and the other as Titanic.<br/><br/>You have two paths to victory: speed or luxury. Focus on one strategy, or try for both at the same time. In the first part of the game, you'll act as a ship designer, competing with your opponent to build the fastest and/or most luxurious ship. You build your ship by placing design cards that can increase your ship's speed, luxury rating, safety level, and profitability.<br/><br/>In the second part of the game, you'll captain your ship as you and your opponent race across the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York. Set your speed by deciding how much coal to burn each day, and contend with hazards including icebergs and a U-Boat. Try not to sink or become stranded along the way! The first ship to reach New York wins the Blue Riband award, but you can also win the game by having the most luxurious ship. You earn bonus points through financial profit.<br/><br/>The game materials are based on historic, public domain photographs and drawings from the early 20th century. The steamship images feature Titanic, Lusitania or their sister ships.<br/><br/>",

When all are found, the Fairy Godmother will cast her spell, and Cinders can go to the ball in the castle. The pumpkin will become the golden carriage, with the mice turned into horses, and the rat and lizards as coachman and footmen &mdash; and Cinderella will get her glass slippers! But she must gather all the items ﬁrst before she can go to the ball!<br/><br/>In Cinderella Magic (シンデレラマジック), the players try to guess the played cards. On a turn, the active player plays one card either face up or face down. If it's face-up, the player plays the effect on the card; if it's face down, the card just sits there.<br/><br/>After playing a card either face up or face down, a player can declare that they're off to the ball! Each other player in clockwise order can choose to join them on this journey or not. Once everyone has decided, all face-down cards are revealed. If these cards collectively show at least one pumpkin, dress, rat, mouse, and lizard, then Cinderella indeed goes to the ball; everyone who thought they'd go to the ball then takes one face-down glass slipper card from that deck. If a pumpkin, dress, or rat is missing, but the Fairy Godmother is revealed, then the Fairy Godmother can replace one of those missing items. If not all items are present, then those who didn't go to the ball take a one face-down glass slipper card.<br/><br/>In either case, all of the item cards are shuffled, then a new round begins. Once the final glass slipper card has been claimed (with anyone else who needs to score taking an item card to represent 1 point), the game ends. You then reveal the glass slipper that has been tucked under the Prince card at the start of the game, and whoever has the matching slipper claims this card (and its points). Glass slipper cards are worth 1-3 points, and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Applying their agility, logic and savvy, children will move towards victory. During the game you will have to measure yourself with longevity, speed and fluffiness of your animals. The winner of the game will be only one who turns out to be more dexterous and quick-witted.<br/><br/>On one side of the card - the name and picture with the beast, on the other - the figures for the four properties:<br/><br/>The size,<br/>Longevity,<br/>Travel speeds,<br/>Fuzzy.<br/>To each property are added points, proportional to the values.<br/><br/>Each player in his turn receives 4 cards, but does not look at the reverse side with the data. He needs to arrange these animals in order of increasing points for a single property. When the cards are arranged in a row, the player turns them over. If the sequence is correct, he gets one card for himself in the bank, if not - he puts all the cards back into the deck. Each player has three such moves, then everyone counts the earned points.<br/><br/>",

The Egyptians have to get 1/3rd of their forces, within a time limit, off the opposite map board edge. The Judeans either have to delay them, or inflict sufficient losses on them. Historically, the Egyptian forces were on their way to help their allies the Assyrians against the Babylonians. To do so, they had to pass through Judean territory. We do not know why Josiah went to war against Egypt. The Assyrian capital, Ninevah, had already fallen to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 (read Nahum). The remaining Assyrian forces had regrouped at Haran, but in 609 they were forced west of the Euphrates. It appears to be at this time that the Egyptians under Necho II were coming to the Assyrian&rsquo; aid. King Josiah marched out to meet them in battle. Perhaps Josiah opposed the passage of Necho&rsquo;s forces through the pass at Megiddo (See 2 Chron.35:20-24) because he feared that the growth of either Egyptian or Assyrian power would have adverse results for the continued independence of Judah. (TKB 2 Kings 23:29). Pharaoh Necho II sent word to Josiah that God had told him to immediately attack Babylon &ldquo;so stop opposing God who is with me, or He will destroy you.&rdquo; (35:21) Yet, Josiah refused to accept the word of the Lord from Pharaoh Necho II and went to fight against him on the plain of Megiddo. &ldquo;Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Pharaoh Necho II has said at God&rsquo;s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.&rdquo; (35:22) Josiah was wounded by an archer in battle and died in Jerusalem and was buried in the tombs of his fathers (35:23-24). There was great mourning in Judea and Jerusalem. This is 2nd Megiddo, King Josiah vs Pharaoh Necho II. Can you change history?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pitches bear the Bugman&rsquo;s B, while the bearded face of the master brewer grins down on players from massive billboards. When Bugman turns up at a match in person it is a spectacle to behold.<br/><br/>Bugman is no mere spectator, however, as the stout brewer owns numerous teams, and coaches them from his private dugout as he knocks back beer after beer. For all his bluster, and the vast quantities of XXXXXX he consumes, Bugman is actually a fair coach, having a good eye for the ebb and flow of the game &ndash; the problem arises when things don&rsquo;t go his team&rsquo;s way, or he gets excessively drunk, or some combination of the two, and he staggers out onto the field to take matters into his own hands&hellip;<br/><br/>This resin kit contains the components necessary to assemble 2 models &ndash; both of which depict the iconic, stout figure of Josef Bugman. The first is Josef as coach, pipe and rulebook in hand, watching over his team with a stern, furrowed look and one foot resting on a beer barrel &ndash; the second depicts Bugman in a rather less disciplined state (probably something to do with the beer barrel mentioned earlier&hellip;) &ndash; this is Josef Bugman, Star Player, holding a ball aloft in his left hand and a foaming stein of XXXXXX in the other.<br/><br/>This kit is supplied as 9 components, and includes 2 32mm round Blood Bowl bases. Rules are included for fielding Josef Bugman as a part of Dwarf, Halfling, Norse, Human, Amazon and Ogre Blood Bowl teams.<br/><br/>",

Progressively, they began to contest the established monopoly of drug dealers in their cities, and soon emerged as some of the major players of drug trafficking in the continent. The Hells Dogs are a collegiate organization; meaning that their president is not omnipotent and that all the important decisions need to be voted unanimously by the inner circle.<br/><br/>These nomadic riders are present in all of North America; thus allowing the Hells Dogs to start their operations from Illinois, California as well as British Columbia.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt an equal number of the 86 cards showing multiplication problems. Like in war, each player then turns over a card. They must then solve the multiplication problem displayed on the card. The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards. If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right. A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it. Like in wars, equal answers result in a &quot;war&quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards. Players play a predetermined number of times through the deck or until one player has all the cards.<br/><br/>",

The genre is filler-for-laughs, but the scoring mechanism ensures a competitive edge along with hand management and &quot;take-that&quot; elements.<br/><br/>In turn, each person rolls dice to determine their gender and ethnicity, collects or loses &quot;victim points&quot; based on scoring cards, have an opportunity to play penalty cards to change other players' ability to score points, and play cards to eliminate restrictions on themselves.<br/><br/>Gaming groups that are open-minded, will find humor in poking fun in absurd elements of the &lsquo;Social Justice Warrior&rsquo; movement. Be warned, not everyone has the objectivity to laugh at poking fun at their own set of taboo subjects.  However, Victimology, like all games that look for humor in taboo subjects, will offend some.<br/><br/>From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;Tap into your inner Snowflake, start your virtue signaling and above all else, be offended! &ndash; Because he, she, or &lsquo;ze&rsquo; with the most Victims Points at the end, wins!&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Level 1 is a simple game that is easy to learn, with each subsequent adding a new layer that deepens the complexity.  Level 1 takes only a few minutes to play and can be casual or serious, whereas Level 4 takes roughly 40 minutes and offers richer opportunities for strategy. Each level is its own game, and players choose which to play based on preference.<br/><br/>Strings does not require a board and can be played on any flat surface. Each player starts with an identical deck of forty cards in their color. Each card has a color, element, and power. Players place cards from their hand onto any free space next to a preexisting card. The board is generated from the card placement and unique to each game.<br/><br/>In Level 1, players try to align the color of their cards while blocking their opponent. In Level 2, players must align their cards into strings where each element appears exactly once. In Level 3, players may also move their cards on the board. In Level 4, players may use their cards to attack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Incorrect politically, hilarious and eccentric.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player draws eight white cards. One player becomes a Reader. He randomly draws a black card and reads the question or fill-in-the-blanks phrase out loud. Each player chooses an answer from white cards kept in hand and passes it face down to the Reader. The Reader shuffles received cards and successively reads the answers and arranges them on the table. It's best to read the answers together with the question matching the syntax where it's needed. Some questions require two white cards. In this case, the Reader does not shuffle them and reads in the order arranged by players. When all responses have been read, each player points the finger at the funniest answer. The player whose answer got the most votes wins the round and gets the black card as a reward. When it's a draw, each of the drawers wins and gets a black card. Before next round everyone draws cards up to eight, the next player becomes a Reader. The game lasts until no cards, time or participants left. The player who earned the most black cards wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You'll have to cross out that number and cut your losses - OR, if you're convinced all you need is just one more try, you COULD use your Do Over card.<br/><br/>But be careful! You can only use it once!<br/><br/>Keep on playing through the nine rounds of ego-humbling challenges. Once every number on everyone's cards is either circled or crossed out, add up your points and announce your scores.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Fun, funny, and challenging in ways you've never imagined, I Got This is sure to become an instant family game night favorite.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Having never seen the sport up-close before (only having caught the occasional big match on the crystal ball in the local tavern), she is immediately taken with the flashy plays, colourful commentary and over-the-top violence. She sticks around after the match to help clear up and manages to speak to some of the Hochstadt Hellfires, who convince her to abandon the provincial life and join them on the road. She spends the next few weeks driving carts, raising stands, selling tickets and dealing with troublemakers, but it isn&rsquo;t long before the Hellfires open their doors for new recruits. Karla is one of the first in line, where her passion for the sport impresses head coach Krüber. She takes a spot on the reserves bench and never looks back.<br/><br/>In 2483 Karla helped the Hellfires quit the backwater circuit and start hitting some of the bigger stadiums. She has proven herself a natural Blitzer, always leading the team from the front. When they came up against the Bloodskull Brutes, she coordinated the front offence to bring down both of the team&rsquo;s Trolls in short order, and was awarded the position of team captain in recognition of her efforts.<br/><br/>Karla von Kill is a Star Player who can be included in the following teams: Amazon, Halfling, Human, Norse. This highly detailed miniature makes a fantastic addition to any team that can afford to hire her.<br/><br/>This is a complete, multipart resin kit which contains one Karla von Kill. She comes with a 32mm Blood Bowl base and her rules can be found in the Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac.<br/><br/>",

There are 3 different commodities: shops (black letters), restaurants (red letters) and a cinema (Filmpalast).<br/><br/>A player owning a shop may make further investments to increase the fees he gets from the other players if it's number is rolled again. The fees for restaurants are increased if a player owns 2 or 3 restaurants in adjacent buildings. Fees for the cinema are only payed if a player owns both halves (space 63 and 64). If a player owns only one half, another player may still buy the other half or even the half already in possession. When a player owns the whole cinema it is opened and the fees increase automatically every time it's number is rolled, without the player having to invest any money.<br/><br/>If a double is rolled, an event occurs that causes the player to lose or gain money.<br/><br/>The game ends after a fixed playing time or if all players but one go bankrupt. The last remaining player or the player with the most money and the most valuable commodities wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

When you happen on a city, you take the corresponding counter from the deck (seeds).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you will collect several seeds that are placed on their right outside the game plan. Sowing can be attempted when stopping or passing over the Celi box. We turn the record of how many seeds we own at that time. If the character in the slot of the disk is green then you can sow in your garden (friend of Lul&ugrave;), if it is red (Enemy), you will have to resitituire all seeds collected so far.<br/><br/>When the player has finished sowing on his own garden or passes on the Paris box, he can collect his own flowers.<br/><br/>Game content: a game plan, 4 LuLu&ugrave; counters of four colors,50 double-sided scented cards,1 cardboard rotating disc,3 cubes with colored faces (dice),9 triangular markers (3 per player).<br/><br/>The cards depicting the flowers on one side and the seeds on the other ... rubbing the part of the seed gives off the scent of the corresponding flower.<br/><br/>",

Each tile shows the amount of possible dammage, as well as who will suffer the dammage in function of an auction result.<br/><br/>During the auction, each player secretely selects one among their hand of value tokens (6 ascending values in 3 color ranges). Then, in a sequence depending on the dragon tile, players will bid a number which has to be lower than the total of all value tokens. When all have passed, tokens get revealed, and the result is applied: either the highest bidder is lower or equal to the total and receives victory points, then the tile effect is applied in function of the total; or the highest bidder is higher than the total value of tokens, and the bidder suffers the attack.<br/><br/>When all dragon attack tiles have been played, the game ends and score is computed to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each altcoin has a corresponding stack of Market Cards that predict gains or losses. You need four players to be Investors to start the action. Each Investor gets two wallets and 10 physical Bitcoins. One Investor is also the Exchange Manager for the round. The Exchange Manager passes out one Insider Trading Card to each Investor and spins to see which altcoins will be open for trading that round. The Exchange Manager also secretly sets a timer for any time between 3 and 15 seconds so that only he or she knows how much time is on the clock for placing bets. Each Investor reveals their Insider Trading Card to the group to see what action they can take before the Market opens. You might even get an insider tip that gives you a competitive advantage in placing your bets. The Market is open! Investors simultaneously bet their Bitcoins on the altcoins by placing their wallets on the board. Trading immediately stops when the timer rings. The Exchange Manager then flips over the Market Card for each altcoin to reveal a gain or loss for each Investor. It&rsquo;s Bitcoin boom or bust--one minute your wallet&rsquo;s full and it&rsquo;s Lambo time, the next second you lose everything in a scam! Keep playing until the Bitcoin Bank runs dry.

Jungle wardens' airplanes are parachuting food packages to the animals, but each animal prefers its own kind of food! To complicate the matters further, all packages look the same and animals first need to open them to see what's inside. All the animals rush wildly for the clearings where food packages appear...<br/><br/>The object of Jungle Chase is to collect as many food packages as possible before they run out. Players do so by controlling six animals each of varying strength on a hexagonal board representing a jungle with clearings and landing spots for food packages. On their turn, players roll two six-sided dice to determine which animals may move one space each, with doubles enabling special moves. When animals of opposing players meet the stronger animal chases its opponent off the board.<br/><br/>Contents of food packages are hidden from players and a player whose animal enters the package space may look at it without revealing the contents to other players. If the food is appropriate for the animal, the player may now collect it. When all packages, whose number is determined at the beginning of the game, have been collected the player with the most food is the winner.<br/><br/>Jungle Chase is a &quot;classical&quot; board game with game pieces, dice and a board with a very deliberate old-school feel and yet quite modern in it's final execution in terms of tempo, duration etc. Basic mechanics and inherent logic are quite simple and yet the game strives to offer enough depth for an adult to enjoy the game as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

So it may happen that the keywords are replaced by the &quot;fox&quot;, a phrase is to be drawn or only the topic and a keyword from the phrase is known. It also appears that all players at the same time rate it. In turn, a player always reads a phrase card. The color of the phrase card specifies the task. For example, crucial words in the read phrase are reversed or only snippets are read. The goal of the teammates is always the same: guess the phrases as fast as possible.

With a lot of team spirit and good communication, the players have to roll the ball from start to finish. Each player is responsible for one corner of the three-dimensional game board and only together can the goal be achieved. For this skill and concentration is required, because otherwise, the ball falls into one of the numerous holes. If that happens the team has to start again. But watch out, time is running fast and the other team is just waiting for their chance. In Labyrinthia, two teams play against each other. The team that works smarter and works better together will win in the end. Stops the time and challenges the opposing team: which team is faster?<br/><br/>",
