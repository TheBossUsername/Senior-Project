Each board is divided into nine grid squares, so that there are 54 grid squares in all. Each of the 54 picture cards shows, larger and more clearly, a creature from one of the grid squares, and on the back of the card the appropriate grid reference is shown. <br/>The aim of the game is to match the creatures to the grid squares, either through observation or by using the grid references.<br/><br/>The attractive design of this game belies the degree of observational skill required.

        "description": "Adapted from the old Macintosh Computer game, this game pits 2 or more players in a battle to see who can programme the most efficient tank. The tank with the most efficient yet adaptable programming and subroutines will dominate the battlefield and vanquish the other tanks.<br/><br/>Storyline<br/>You are a battlefield commander of an evolutionary new tank in the battlefield of the future. Wars of today are fought by remote war machines. Pitted against you is your enemy, fielding their latest war machines. This will be a fight to the finish, the struggle for supremacy.<br/><br/>With your superior skills as a commander, you are to programme your tank and set it loose. Win or lose will depend on your intimate knowledge of your own tank's inherent abilities as well as your uncanny reading of what your opponent's tank will do and how you perceive it would react in battle.<br/><br/>Win or lose, after each round, redesign, re-programme, rework your tank's subroutines and primary programming to fine-tune your tank's performance. Remember, your enemy is doing the same thing. He would have watched the previous battle and noted his tank's and your tank's performance. He too will be working to reduce deficiencies and weak points in his own programming so as to triumph over yours. Then when you're both done with your re-programming, set let them go at it again! Send out prototype after prototype until either your tanks now reign supreme in every engagement, or they all lie devastated, crushed under the steel treads of better enemy tanks.<br/><br/>Programming is limited to the number of standard programming tiles available in the common pile but be wary of cumbersome programming that may make your tank less than efficient as it spends a fatally long among of time processing your programming while your opponent's more efficient design finds and destroys your tank!<br/><br/>Gentlemen, start your engines.... and let the games begin.<br/><br/>Game Pieces<br/>1 dice (to determine your tank start position on the board)<br/>1 main &quot;battlefield&quot; board - (for 2P board 17steps across, + 1P add 3steps across)<br/>2 primary programming plates<br/>8 subroutine programming plates; 2xFight, 2xEvade, 2xFlee, 2xDamaged<br/>1 red team light tank<br/>1 orange team light tank<br/>1 red team heavy tank<br/>1 orange team heavy tank<br/>6 &quot;damage&quot; pins<br/><br/>A) 1 step Action Tiles<br/>i) Move Forward 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) Move Forward 2 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iii) Move Forward 3 (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>iv) Turn Left 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>v) Turn Left 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>vi) Turn Right 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>vii) Turn Right 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>viii) Reverse 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ix) Complete Halt - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>x) Detect Level 3 (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/><br/>B) 2 step Action Tiles<br/>i) Detect Level 4 (Logic Gate) (only Heavy Tank) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) Fire - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>iii) Shield Activated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iv) Shield Deactivated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/><br/>C) Decision Tiles (goto)<br/>i) FIGHT subroutine (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) FLEE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iii) EVADE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iv) return to PRIMARY - (for 2P 8pcs, + 1P add 5pcs)<br/><br/>notes:<br/>1) Tank start positions are determined by a throw of the dice and placed on the corresponding number on the board<br/>2) Action and Decision tiles are limited.

He used to take his carrots to market in a wheelbarrow, but one day, over the radio, he heard that airships where much faster than wheelbarrows, so he bought himself something with which he could fly in the clouds.<br/><br/>So here we have a playing board to represent the country over which Uncle Wiggily flew from his carrot farm to the market where he sold his yellow vegetables.  But the rabbit had so many adventures in his new airship as he did when hopping through the woods to cure his rheumatism at Dr. Possom's office.  There were storms, waterspouts and he fell into tail spins and once had to jump in a parachute.<br/><br/>The moves are made by drawing cards.  There are 105 white cards, each one telling you how many miles to hop Uncle Wiggily through the air.  There are 35 red cards, which may move Uncle Wiggily ahead or perhaps delay hime for a turn or two, all according to luck.<br/><br/>The air path, from Uncle Wiggily's farm to the market is marked by sign boards each containing a letter instead of a number.  And when these letters are separated into words, beginning at the farm, they spell out a funny little verse.  See if you can write it down after the game.<br/><br/>",

You just earned 5 points.<br/>     &quot;Mish Moshing&quot; the Language - Build sentences out of English words written somewhat phonetically with Hebrew letters.<br/>     Historical Mish Mosh - This variation can be played by any number of players.  One player thinks of a &quot;a famous Jewish Historical person&quot;, then spells his or her name with the tiles.  (e.g. ABRAHAM)  The next person must think of another whose name starts with the final letter of the previous one.  (e.g. MOSHEH).  This is an elimination game like HORSE:  Each time you fail, you &quot;earn&quot; a letter of MISH MOSH.  Once you have spelled the whole name, you are out.<br/><br/><br/>Each tile has both the traditional print letter and its handwritten equivalent.

The attacker (using the red end) places a red bomb on any square where it will bracket a black bomb between it and a red bomb already on the map.  When he does this he flips the black bomb over to red.  The defender (using black) does the same with his black bomb, being sure to bracket a red bomb with his black.   If a player is unable to find a legal place he loses his turn.<br/><br/>Play continues alternately until all 60 squares are filled.

        "description": "Pirogue: The Trinidad and Tobago Tarpon Tournament is a trick-taking game inspired by big game Tarpon fishing in the warm, blue waters of Trinidad and Tobago.  The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.<br/><br/>The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; &amp; Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.<br/><br/>One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.<br/><br/>Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.<br/><br/>Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!<br/><br/>",

Each unit type has a different movement, for example the soldier can move 1 space in any direction, the tank can move 1 or 2 squares in any direction.  A unit is captured by entering its square and in some cases (cannons) the unit capturing can jump over intervening friendly units.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opposing dictator or dictators at which time the captured dictator's entire army &quot;surrenders&quot; and is removed from the board.   When four people are playing then two sides ally and both players on one side must be defeated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Harett-Gilmar produced Wiry Dan's Electric Baseball in 1950. This game, and a similar Jim Prentice-branded offering in 1948, added electricity to the outguess-your-opponent mechanism. In this case, the pitching player secretly pushes a metal arrow down onto one of four metal pitch option circles. The batter touches the lead on a wire to one of four hit circles. If a light goes on, he uses a spinner to determine the kind of hit.  If nothing lights up, the batter touches the ball and strike circles to determine the result of the pitch. Two more circles by the &quot;Smiling Umpire&quot; determine the results of attempted steals and bunts, foul pops, tagging up or double-play attempts.<br/><br/>",

Ending on specific spaces forces the player to draw cards and perform the actions.<br/><br/>The player is given a cockpit to track altitude and turns.  Orders can require being at specific altitudes and specific places to complete the mission.<br/><br/>Designed by a WWI RAF veteran, its quite interesting and advanced for its day.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publishers homepage:<br/><br/>Background<br/>It is almost a true story. The Mayor of Farum (city on the outskirts of Copenhagen) had ruled the city like a king for almost a decade. His party ruled the city board and no one dared to speak out against the Mayor. But as with Hamlet, something is rotten in the Kingdom. A Danish newspaper blew the story wide open. It turned out that the Mayor, among other things, had made some creative investments and given his friends loads of city business. To top that off, his expense account carried not only trips to Championship Football games, but also wine for more than 10,000 a bottle &ndash; Cheers&hellip;<br/><br/>Sales and PR<br/>PBX was released in the beginning of November 2002, and were sold out before New Year &ndash; that made PBX: The fastest selling board game in Denmark ever. 12,000 copies sold from the shops in only 6 weeks &ndash; without a dime spent on marketing. Yet PBX was able to create heavy and very positive media coverage: The media also focused on the fact that PBX was the first of it's kind. Some articles even had politicians (the main characters in PBX) playing the game and reviewing it. National TV News gave it full coverage as Christmas Gift of the Year, including a review done by two Mayors. The second largest daily newspaper had &quot;business&quot; Cavling Winning (same as Pulitzer) journalists reviewing the game (BT).<br/><br/>Game play<br/>As a Mayor of a Danish town, you are obsessed about making your city the best city in the country. To fulfil all the dreams you have for the city, the Game starts out with you taking an illegal loan of 250 million from the Government. Now your job as a Mayor is to drive around the game board in your Mayoral car and try to spend the money as fast as possible. On your way you pick cards with instructions on how much to spend on, for instance, &quot;gifts &quot; to business relations in return for favours, dinners you have to give to keep your fellow politicians on board and travels you need to make in order to do proper &quot;research &quot;. You have to be careful, because the people you mingle with can easily forget their obligations to you, even though the gifts you spent on them were expensive. Your political opponents (though still full from the &quot;friendly &quot; dinner you hosted) will try and expose you, or the Government might even call you in for a little chat that would force you on a leave of absence, where you have no chance at all of blowing your 250 million. The instruction cards, mixed with questions on luxury lifestyle, all evolve around issues that actually did take place, though blown totally out of proportion and with a humorous distance, making this the first Board Game ever to truly be appointed: A Satire Board Game.<br/><br/>",

Three catch-triggered compartments sit behind a transparent plastic window with a small target located centrally beneath each. In each compartment there are one or more marbles.<br/><br/>Players roll a single marble each turn at the three targets from a predetermined distance - six to eight feet is recommended in the rules. If any of these are hit, a catch is released and the marbles in the compartment above are released to the player. One marble must be replaced in the compartment once it is reset for the next player. A plastic ramp located behind the targets catches stray marbles which roll up the ramp and then enter one of the three compartments in the machine. Players must also place marbles from errant rolls (e.g. those which miss the machine completely or are not strong enough to reach it) in any compartment they choose (there is a small square hole above each for this purpose).<br/><br/>Players are eliminated when they are out of marbles. The last player left with one or more marbles is the winner.<br/><br/>N.B. This game should not be confused with the 1978 marble game called Pay Off (or Pay Off Machine - game ID# 9025) also released by IDEAL which looks like a canister with horizontal sections that rotate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game half of the players are cargo vessels shipping goods to ports. Other half are buccaneers trying to steal the goods. Whenever a cargo vessel successfully delivers goods player is awarded points to the value of the cargo. Buccaneers receive points when they successfully steal the shipment. When the shipment is delivered or lost, the cargo vessel player draws a new card that indicates destination and value of new shipment. Game is played until all the shipment cards have been used.<br/><br/>The map consists of two different kinds of routes, open water and shallow. Players can freely move which ever way they prefer, but if a ship ends its move on shallow water the player has to draw an action card. Most of these cards either make the player sit out next turn or allows them to take new turn right away.<br/><br/>",

It's a matching game! You and your opponents try to collect the most matching pairs of cards by choosing cards from the board or from players' hands. Can you remember where Tantor the elephant is hiding on the board? Or Manu the monkey? Whose hand is Bara the antelope in? Find two of these-or any other colorful characters in the game-and you have a match! The player with the most pairs wins the game.<br/><br/>Strategy Hints:<br/>try not to show the players the cards in your hand or on your side of the board. you know what these cards are, but other players may not. Unless another player chooses one of your cards, don't show them, choose one of their cards instead. <br/>Mix up the cards in your hand as often as you'd like, but especially when other players have seen your cards. Don't make it easy for them to make a match with your cards.<br/><br/>",

Equipment includes the game board, two dice, 2 searchlight beams and 8 bombers.<br/><br/>Players place the searchlight on the board with the small end on the X about the searchlight crew and the large end pointing to the 1.  Play is alternately done and is based on the roll of a die.  The roll can be used to either move a plane or the searchlight.  A roll of 6 means the player loses his turn.  Planes may be moved in any direction but must be moved the full distance of the die roll in that same direction.  The searchlight can be moved in one direction, up or down, based on the die roll.  A plane is shot down when either it is on the same line as an enemy airplane at the end of the enemy's turn or it crosses the searchlight beam.  A score is obtained if the plane can cross over the targets in enemy territory.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest bombing total after all planes have been brought down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the &quot;Pledge&quot; link on the Decision Games Website:<br/><br/>This mid-sized-monster game can be played as a two-player or three-player contest. It has three large-hex maps, with 560 half-inch counters, covering the ETO from D-Day to V-E Day at 20 miles per hex. The main fronts are covered, excluding only Scandinavia and Greece. Each game turn equals a third of a month. Units are divisions for the Western Allies and Germans, corps for the Soviets (but with a complete divisional artillery order of battle), and armies for the Yugoslav's and the various minor powers.<br/><br/>The system is an operational (rather than strategic) derivation of the one used in &quot;Beyond the Urals&quot; and &quot;Operation Kremlin.&quot; No unit will have more than one step. All entry data, notes about reinforcement or special status, etc., can be printed on their reverse sides. Stacking is eight units per hex, with both sides having the move/fight or fight/move sequence option, along with the possibility for limited use of fight/fight.<br/><br/>The system will be simple, making for a game players can finish in one long weekend, but there will also be plenty of historic chrome, such as: V-weapons, the Warsaw Rebellion, liberation of the death camps, F&uuml;hrer-Mandated Offensives, FLAK divisions, the Upper Silesian industrial region, German economic collapse, National Socialist ardor, proletarian heroism, heavy bombers, naval gun support, fortified lines, etc.<br/><br/>Play begins with the Western Allied player (or the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; player in a two-player match) launching the D-Day landing. He'll be free to choose just about any coastal hex from northern Germany to the Spanish border as his landing site. Or he might choose to come ashore that first time on the Mediterranean coast of France, the far north of Italy, or even somewhere along the Yugoslavian coast. He'll also have a second invasion available for use later that summer.<br/><br/>Victory is determined using a point system, primarily based on the German retention of cities according to a schedule derived from the historic Allied advance. There will be periodic victory checks to prevent the German player from adopting any kind of unhistorical strategy based on retreating into the Reich's heartland at the very start of play to try to form some kind of super defensive hedgehog. That ploy would have been impossible for the Germans to support economically in the real-world, and having to maintain a certain level of victory points in order to survive the period victory checks will work to the same effect in the game.<br/><br/>The combat results table will be of the unit-elimination type, with results of &quot;D-elim,&quot; &quot;D-back-2,&quot; &quot;Exchange,&quot; etc. Thus replacements will be plentiful and the action along the fronts fast and furious. Typical German infantry division will have attack and defense factors of 1-1, 1-2 or 2-3, while panzer divisions will weigh in as 3-2s and 4-3s. In comparison, US infantry divisions will be 3-4s, while that nation's armor divisions will be 4-3s and 5-3s.<br/><br/>A boxed game to be designed by Ty Bomba. Est. Retail: $60 (Est. Pledge: $45)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seafood Palace is a medium-weight resource management and auction game for three to five players aged 10 years and older. Games usually last from 60 to 90 minutes. The game features an innovative dice drafting mechanism for players to obtain resources used in bidding for cards which yield points. Each turn, players have a variety of actions available to them and tempo is an important consideration &ndash; it may be good to get a bid in first to win a card cheaply, but at the cost of taking a high value die instead.<br/><br/>In Seafood Palace, players take on the role of Chinese seafood restaurant owners in Singapore, seeking to gain fame points by bidding to satisfy public demand for tasty seafood dishes. The more resources you put into the dish, the more likely that people will identify that dish with your restaurant, and this recognition is represented by fame points.<br/><br/>Every player starts with stores of fish, prawn, crab, non-seafood resources (chicken and vegetable), beverages and coins. The resources are represented by counters on the player&rsquo;s own board, which represents the player&rsquo;s stores.<br/><br/>Each round, public demand is represented by dish cards that become available for auction. Players bid to satisfy the demand with the corresponding resources and the highest bid wins the card and the fame points on the card.<br/><br/>Each round, new resource dice and number dice are available for players to replenish stores.  These dice are traded in as pairs (one of each kind) to get the specified number of the specified type of resource (e.g. a 5-number die and a crab resource die are traded in for 5 crab resources).<br/><br/>There are also bonus cards which could permit special actions to benefit the player - some of the bonus action cards include discounts on buying seafood resources, using MSG to get an advantage over your competitors (but with a penalty) or the abundant catch that helps you stock up on seafood. Bonus cards could also be set menus, which if fulfilled by the end of the game, will yield bonus points. A wedding banquet menu is valuable, and this game also caters to vegetarians with a vegetarian set menu. If you hire a master chef, your lowly 1-point dishes will increase in value.<br/><br/>The twist is that players have to choose which of several actions they want to take (take a die, bid on a dish, claim a dish, bid on a bonus card, claim a bonus card, or pass) and focusing on one action means sacrificing the tempo to carry out another action. If you decide to go for the high number die, someone else could take the resource die of the type you need badly, and yet another will get in a bid on a valuable card that you can&rsquo;t outbid because you haven&rsquo;t managed to obtain the right dice yet &hellip;<br/><br/>The game lasts enough rounds so that each player has the advantage of going first an equal number of times. At the end of the game, players score fame points for dish cards they have won, set menus they have fulfilled with their dishes, and recognition for having the best stocked cellar (player with the most beverages) and best seafood stocks (player whose least seafood resource is greater than other players&rsquo; least seafood resource). The player with the most famous restaurant wins.<br/><br/>Seafood Palace was accepted for play-testing in the 2008 Hippodice competition<br/><br/>",

The wooden playing board has a pair of book-like spines on one side and the illusion of book pages on the others, with an outer slip case to hold everything together. The set also contains a dual arrowed spinning indicator which its makers proclaimed as &quot;A Complete and Unobjectional Substitute for, and Improvement on Dice, Teetotums, &amp;c.&quot;<br/><br/>In the basic Pilgrim's Progress game, played on the outer board halves, a player must move both of his pieces (two pawns: a Pilgrim and a Staff) by the number of spaces indicated by the dual spinner until he reaches the Giant Despair space. He then moves his Pilgrim alone until it lands by exact count on the Golden Gate, and thence (if not displaced) to victory in the Celestial City. Rules for three other variants are also included. These use various combinations of board spaces and require differing numbers of pieces.<br/><br/>In Going to Sunday School, played in one of the inner board halves, players spin and move around the board. Essentially, the player that lands on the most picture spaces (10 special spaces, each illustrating a virtue or a vice) is the winner.<br/><br/>The Tower of Babel, played in the other inner board half, combines a race for the top of the tower with a race to the bottom. Different rules apply to each race within the game. The winners of each half have a spin-off to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     Rule booklet<br/>     12 round-headed (Pilgrim) wood pawns<br/>     6 pointed-headed (Staff) wood pawns<br/>     Dual arrowed spinner<br/>     Wooden game board<br/>     Slip case<br/><br/><br/>",

The figures move around the board reaching places that represent school, the bus, home, the mall and other places a child might be. Children are asked questions about hypothetical situations - some social, some life-threatening - and asked to tell what they would do. Adult cards ask parents to answer questions about their own childhoods. When children are empowered by correct responses and adult reinforcement, their lives will be safer. Discussing these issues can help a kid to act smart, not scared if they find themselves in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>",

In Tac-T-Flix, Burocrats, a second type of game piece, are introduced.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>One rules sheet says:<br/><br/>     54 flexible taxpayer men (in three colors for the different players<br/>     24 Burocrat[sic] Men (8 of each color)<br/>     3 special Flix dice<br/>     12 Numbered Tokens<br/><br/><br/>So there are 18 &quot;taxpayer men&quot; and 8 &quot;burocrat[sic] men&quot; in eaach of the three colors. The men are made from looks to be a drinking straw. The top on both is cut off at about a 60 degree angle to give a very pointy appearance. Presumably this is the end that you'd stick in first through the board holes. The bottoms of the taxpayer men are cut off straight across, however the burocrat[sic] men are notched into a &quot;V&quot; and are longer.<br/><br/>The numbered tokens are a card sheet with 12 very thin strips that are meant to be cut off. The strips have a number on them. The set is six 10's, three 25's, two 50's, and one 100. The idea is that when the strip is folded in half that the number is hidden when stuffed inside a &quot;straw piece.&quot; The numbered tokens are only used in the  game Pay Off Flix by folding them in half and randomly splitting the 12 token between the two players.<br/><br/>Also see:<br/>Qubic which is 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GAME SUMMARY:<br/>Towers&amp;Bridges is a board game for two players. It combines traditional elements of chess &mdash;such as a squared board&mdash; with original pieces and movements. The game symbolizes a battle between two feudal lords: the White Lord and the Black Lord. Each one leads an army composed by attack towers and portable bridges.<br/>The principal aim of attack towers is to capture enemy castles. But these are surrounded by deep moats. Portable bridges are used to cover those moats. In this way, towers can cross moats; and thus, they can take castles&hellip; but only if the tower is as high as the castle. Most attack towers are initially smaller than most castles. However, they can get bigger by capturing an enemy tower. When this happens, the stages of the defeated tower are added to the winning one. So, winning attack towers become higher and higher. In the end, they may even match the highest castle: that is, the enemy lord&rsquo;s one.<br/>During the combat, both contenders may be helped by mercenaries and flying creatures. But these are jailed in strong citadels, so first of all, attack towers must free them. Once they have been liberated, mercenaries can blow enemy bridges up; and winged creatures can transport their lord by air, crossing even moats not covered by bridges.<br/>The main purpose in the game is to trap the opponent&rsquo;s feudal lord, who takes shelter in the highest castle.

        "description": "Rules from AGPC Archives: The game is played with a deck of Horse Cards with names of horses and numbers 1 to 3 printed on each card. 5 horses are entered in a race (hand), a horse can finish 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. During the race (hand)all players try to form a sequence of horse cards from 1 to 3 in front of them. Beginning with number 1 and then adding 2 and 3 consecutively. A player completing the sequence 1-2-3 ends the hand (race). The winning sequence does not have to be completed with the same horse in all three positions. If a  player does complete the 1-2-3 with the same horse that player becomes the next BANKER. The banker in the game sells and redeems Bank shares and Wager Tickets. All money received from the sale of bank shares and wager tickets is kept in an account. At the end of the game the amount in this account is divided among shareholders with an equal amount being given for each share held. At the beginning of the game players can purchase bank shares which are always redeemable for their face value. Anyone not redeeming purchased bank shares during the game is entitled to a split of whatever money is in the bank at the end of the game. At the beginning of the game (race) players can purchase wager tickets on their favorite horses. Bets are made across the board in all 3 positions and players collect from the bank for how a horse finished.<br/><br/>In order to play the game the deck of cards is shuffled and then the first player draws a card, if its a number 1 card it is kept face up in front of the player, if its any other card it is discarded play continues until someone has completed the 1 2 3 sequence at which time players holding winning tickets matching names of horses somewhere in the winning sequence are paid off. In other words when the wining sequence happens if you had bet on horse 'Stewball' to finish second on one of your betting cards and the winning sequence actually has 'Stewball' in the #2 position that wage ticket wins money for you.<br/><br/>",

The number of toppers used in the game is always one less than the number of players playing. the deck is made up of 36 cards in books of 4 cards each. A book consists of 4 cards having the same number. As many books are used as number of players in the game, so if you only have 6 players your starting deck would d have only 24 cards (6 books of 4).<br/>How to play. The dealer places the toppers on the playing board in the center of the table. He then shuffles and distributes the card face down to everyone. The object of the game is to get a complete book of cards in their hand. You do this by passing one card to the player on his left. That player decides if he wants to keep the card and give a different card or if he wants to pass the card on to the next player. This goes on until a player has 4 cards the same in his hand at which time that player then grabs a topper from the center of the board and then everyone else tries to make a mad grab for a remaining toppers. Of course since there is always one topper less than the number of players playing one will not get a topper. that player accumulates the letter T on his score card. Each additional time that the player gets no topper another letter in the word TOPPER is accumulated. The first player who has TOPPER next to his name loses the round and sits out the rest of the game which is then played with less cards and less toppers. Eventually only one player remains and he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

They don't actually know this, they're just having lots of fun!  Here's how you play...<br/><br/>One trip around the board is one day in Hungry Hank&rsquo;s life.  As you make your way through Hungry Hank&rsquo;s day, he will have breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even dessert.  He'll also get plenty of exercise (and so will you)!<br/><br/>Each time you land on a food space, pump Hungry Hank the number of times indicated by pressing the big green button by Hungry Hank's feet.  For example, landing on a bowl of cereal and a banana for breakfast is 1 pump.  Two donuts and chocolate milk for breakfast - that's 3 pumps!  All food spaces require at least 1 pump, but you will see some require a lot more!  Every time Hungry Hank eats, his arms flap, he burps or grunts and his belly grows.<br/><br/>When you land on an exercise space, you must get up and do exactly what Hungry Hank is doing the number of times indicated (for example, Jumping Jacks 8 times)!  All exercises can be done right next to the game.  When kids play the game with their parents or other adults, it's great for them to see adults exercising!<br/><br/>The player who lands on a food space and causes Hungry Hank to pop ends the game.  You don&rsquo;t want to be the one to make Hungry Hank pop!<br/><br/>Ages 4+<br/><br/>2 - 4 players<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Powerbroker is similar to the Classic game Monopoly, but with several changes. In addition to buying and auctioning businesses, players may also place them Receivership, or take out a Loan against one. Players can attempt to Swindle each other out of owed patronage [i.e. rent]. Businesses under Receivership are vulnerable to be stolen in a Corporate Raid by other players, and those with loans can be lost in a Hostile Takeover. In addition to the spaces running around the outside of the board, players can enter the High Roller route, where both business cost and patronage is determined by the dice. The game ends when only one player remains, or after an agreed upon time.<br/><br/>This game was published under different names including Bend's  Powerbroker  and Burbank's Powerbroker. Each business is named for an actual local business, whose name and contact information are listed on the rules sheet. Additionally the box states that proceeds benefit the local business community. Bend's Powerbroker is based on the business offerings of Bend, Oregon.<br/><br/>",

The prime motivator of the game is a spinner embedded in the game board with both numbers (1-4) and weapons/accessories (Strength, Reflective Shield, Pegasus, Cloak of Invisibility, fire, sword, arrows, or Power of the Gods) represented on its rim.  Players take turns spinning to determine how far they can move.  Upon entering any creature's space (except the Sphinx or Minotaur) the player spins to determine combat.  Landing on an appropriate weapon defeats the creature, with the reflective shield defeating the gorgon and basilisk and so on.  If the player enters the Sphinx' space, he must answer a riddle to advance, while entering the minotaurs space requires the draw of  a card to decide combat.  The first player to escape the maze wins.  The game includes a book detailing 15 mythological beasts from around the world, 15 painted plastic miniatures, 4 minotaur cards and a game board.<br/><br/>",

Module #5 completes the series with a set of campaign and optional rules.<br/><br/>RUSSIA has several highly specific design goals, all of which will be kept firmly in mind as the modules in the series are under development.<br/><br/>1. The emphasis on the entire series will be on playability&mdash;and we mean that. To this end, we will always be willing, during development, to chop out detail that impedes the speed of play&mdash;and we are focusing on the major defining elements of each campaign rather than the tiny details. In addition, the game will do everything possible not only to eliminate large stacks, but to provide hexes large enough to provide for comfortable counter placement.<br/><br/>2. Play will alternate quickly between the two sides. Not only will interactivity occur while each player is conducting his moves, this is not a game in which one player moves all his units and then the other player does. Instead, play will switch constantly from one player to the other, and the game system is being designed from the ground up to eliminate downtime.<br/><br/>3. The complexity rating of the modules will never rise above a rating of 5, and even with the campaign module will not rise above 6. This is a promise. These ratings assume that EFS and OCS have complexity ratings of 8 (as a point of comparison).<br/><br/>4. The game will make it impossible, at the strategic level, for the Soviet player to simply run away from the German army. Drawing from the research in David Glantz&rsquo;s series of studies of the war, the RUSSIA series forces the Soviet player to think in terms of frequent&mdash;even continual&mdash;attacks, beginning very early after the initial attack. The Soviet player can ignore this requirement, but if he does his &ldquo;War Experience&rdquo; (as the system is known) will never increase, and he cannot win the game. The Soviet player must learn that victory in battle means something much different for him than it does for the German, and the that he must be aggressive in attack from the earliest days of the war.<br/><br/>5. The system will provide a variety of ways for each player to win, but also a number of ways for players to lose. Juggling one against the other will provide a constant challenge.<br/><br/>The first module of RUSSIA will ship in May of 2009, with each additional module appearing at roughly one-year intervals. We plan to unveil the campaign module at Monstercon in 2013.<br/><br/>",

Trade name for a breakfast cereal made from a species of seaweed.<br/><br/>Well, which one?<br/><br/>Hobble-de-hoy! is a published version of an old parlor game, Dictionary.  It consists of a single hardbound book, a little over 9&quot; high (23 cm).  The book contains complete instructions, a word list of 1001 words, and, in the back of the book, definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary for the 1001 words (reprinted with permission).<br/><br/>The book can be opened from either end - flip it over, and it appears to be right-side up from either side.  One side brings you to the word list, the other to the definition list.  Each word and definition are numbered so you can match them up easily.<br/><br/>As in the traditional game, players take turn finding an obscure word and announcing it to the group.  Everyone writes down a definition for the word, while the player in charge writes down the official definition.  The player in charge of the word then shuffles the definitions, reads them through once, then reads them again.  Players voting for the correct definition get 2 points, while players whose word was selected as correct by someone else get 1 point for each selection.<br/><br/>The word list is a very interesting selection of some of the more obscure words in the Oxford English Dictionary.  In the parlor game, a player has to thumb through a dictionary looking for an obscure word.  In this book, you won't recognize at least 98% of the words!  The title of the game is one such word, meaning an awkward, callow youth.  (Did you get that right?)  Some of the lovelier sounding words chosen include quemeful, poculary, bewscher, dedolence, cawquaw, wicopy, timwhisky, etc.  And did you know there's a word that has the definition, &quot;Excessive use of the letter R&quot;?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is designed to help teachers and 4H group leaders teach kids about farm safety.  One person takes the role of game leader and runs the game without playing; everyone else splits into two, three or six teams.  Each team gets a farm animal paddle -- this paddle is passed from player to player within the team, and only the player holding the paddle at any given time may answer questions (though the whole team may influence those answers).<br/><br/>During play, teams take turns answering question cards in six categories: F.Y.I., In the Moos, You Herd It Here, Ouch, Seeing is Believing, and Heads Up.  Cards have a base point value of either 10 or 20 points, and all the 10-point cards are played before the 20-point cards.  All of the category cards feature a question about farm safety, and some also include bonus questions which can be answered for additional points if the first question is answered correctly.  Some cards require the players to look at large 11x14 photos showing farm activities and equipment.  Wild cards with general, non-farm-themed trivia may optionally be mixed in, and Daily Double cards may be added to force players to wager points on certain questions instead of using their face values.<br/><br/>The game leader decides the exact mix and number of cards, so the game can be weighted to favor particular topics and length of play can be shortened or lengthened as necessary.  Regardless of which cards are used during play, the game must be set up so that all teams get to answer the same number of questions, and the team with the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With so many games available that involve the leaders and royalty of medieval nations either battling each other or in competition with each other economically or socially, it is about time that a game came along that focuses on the real unsung heroes of those nations and kingdoms... the court jesters that entertained and provided much needed levity during those stressful times.<br/><br/>In Jesters, each player is an up-and-coming jester working on the medieval entertainment scene. To begin with, they are truly indie DIY performers and will be handling their own career and trying to book performances for themselves and win over fans.  As they progress, they may hook up with special persons like publicists and accountants and managers to be part of their entourage and help them achieve more success.  <br/>        <br/>There are several aspects of each jester's career which they will be working to advance over the five week Season of Mirth; Popularity, Wealth, Mojo, Reputation and Satisfaction. Jesters will also need to develop their material and save some of their best stuff for the big Woodshtick Festival at the end of the month, where all jesters are rated against each other and have the potential for a big payoff.<br/><br/>All of the wealth, fame and reputation in the world won't mean a thing if a jester can't get no satisfaction.  Jesters is ultimately won by the player who generates the most Satisfaction.  There are several ways to gain Satisfaction in the game; through great performances, through the support of people in your Entourage, and by having a lot of fans at the Festival.  Satisfaction Points can also be lost, through bad performances or other circumstances.<br/><br/>Jesters is played over five turns, each representing one week, with a final Festival performance at the end of the fifth week.  The game combines action drafting, hand management and area majority and plays in about 75-90 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Time Machine has been set in motion before it was sufficiently tested... Its team of developers may end up being stuck in an endless loop cycle between the time it was first activated (4 minutes ago), the time it was first launched (now) and the time it can be relaunched (4 minutes into the future).<br/><br/>Time and player movement is kept track of on a board depicting one minute intervals between the first activation and the second launch. Gameplay involves players drawing and placing numbered/colored hexes. At the beginning of the game, before the first time machine launch, a line of hexes is laid out to create the sequence of events that led to the time machine being built. Then, after the first launch, each turn uses a new hex sequence where players try to recreate the sequence of events that created the first launch while also &quot;fixing&quot; it just enough to make it work correctly and hopefully break them all out of the loop. One aspect of the gameplay uses actual one minute time measures as part of the process.<br/><br/>Adding to the challenge, each time a player goes back in time, there is another one of them added to the game (depicting someone from the present traveling back in time and encountering themselves in the past). A light/dark color scheme is used to distinguish the present/past player tokens (dark blue/light blue, dark green/light green, etc.).  Each new version of a player adds abilities and also causes potential problems, and there is a limit to the number of multiples a single player can have before the time line is destroyed beyond repair.<br/><br/>Play is cooperative, with a special commendation for the team member(s) who had the biggest part in fixing the machine. A game may also include a saboteur who is trying to subtly destroy the machine and prevent any progress in the field of time travel.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is a particularly slimy snake oil salesman, traveling between different regions, trying to sell their elixirs to eager balding or ailing customers.<br/><br/>Each area has a different population and gullibility rating, so the potential for success and for higher sales will differ from region to region. Only one player can perform a sales demonstration in a particular area at a given time, though, so before each turn, there is a simultaneous action selection for where each player goes and what they intend to do. If more than one player chooses the same area, then neither of them can demonstrate there, or they may choose to resolve who will get to demonstrate there. A player's success will depend on their ability to sell, the effectiveness and pizzazz of their pitch, and the saleability of their product. Players bid from among different available elixirs and can choose to spend time rehearsing their pitches or watching other players demonstrate in order to improve their ability to sell.<br/><br/>Once a player has successfully demonstrated in an area, there will then be a limited number of turns before that area will become dangerous for other salesmen... The people of that region will soon realize that the last product they bought was bogus and they will be more skeptical of new salesmen coming to town. Later in the game, salesmen may have no choice but to try to sell to places that are already very skeptical or even downright hostile towards them, and will have to use special abilities gained throughout the game (including disguises, new pitches, flashier gimmicks, etc.) in order to succeed.<br/><br/>Particularly bitter areas will send out police or mobs after the shysters, and so players must be careful to avoid being jailed or injured, which will set back their efforts. Players may also work together at times in order to protect or vouch for each other, but of course, alliances made among scoundrels aren't likely to last...<br/><br/>After a certain number of regions in the area have become hostile, all players must make it to a train station within another turn in order to escape.  The player who escapes with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Also contained are a pack of 60 starting prices cards, a betting slips pad, scrip (in various denominations), a pack of race cards numbered from one to sixty and a results pad &amp; pen.<br/>The object of the game is to accumulate the most cash by placing &amp; winning bets on six races. <br/>A player is selected as banker/bookmaker and hands each player (including him/herself) the same amount of starting cash.<br/>The first race commences with a starting price card from the relevant (shuffled) pack turned face up for all players to see. This will show each of eight individually named horses together with their starting prices for either a win or a place (second or third) as an odds expression. Each player is issued with a betting slip and now decides how to place bets given the information odds provided by the starting price card turned up. When all bets are placed, the banker collects the betting slips &amp; cash from each player and turns up a card from the previously shuffled race number pack. This will indicate which audio track of the two compact discs will be played for this race (track 1-60). After a full audio commentary of the race is heard, the race commentator will announce the winning and second and third placed horses. The Bookmaker writes down the named horses on the game pad provided in order to facilitate paying out the winning players at odds shown on their betting slips. After all bets have been settled, the next race commences in a similar fashion.<br/>At the end of the sixth race the player increasing his/her original capital by the most amount, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player is an explorer looking to discover new terrain, claim territory, and build homesteads.  Each round has three phases.<br/><br/>Phase 1:  Each player will stock up on resources for the discovery phase (Phase 2).  Players fill their player&rsquo;s area with 9 evenly distributed landscape tiles and 3 <br/>territory claims markers.<br/><br/>Phase 2:  Players will take turns exploring the continent and discovering new territory by laying landscape tiles of forests, lakes, rivers, coastlines, mountain ranges, and farmland.  Each player gets one opportunity each turn to claim any unclaimed territory on the board, so there will be plenty of competition for the best land with the most abundant natural resources.  New territory is continually being discovered, so predicting the value of the real estate is difficult.<br/><br/>Phase 3:  Each player may construct new buildings and upgrade existing buildings depending upon the size of her farmland and the number of adjacent resources she owns (fresh water, lumber, and stone).  Players may also relocate buildings (at a cost) to a square with more farmland.<br/><br/>Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player laying tiles, claiming a territory, and building homesteads.  Players may compete for territory, seize an opponent&rsquo;s claim, or tear down an opponent&rsquo;s building.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of Antarctica&rsquo;s usable land and resources have been discovered.  The player with the most wealth (earned by constructing buildings and discovering complete territories) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The video was produced by Ed. Arcade Movie Company in 1998.<br/><br/>Are you curious about how gnomes live? Do you wanna know what kinds there are, and how they live? Find out with this game.<br/><br/>This is based on the traditional &quot;Game of Goose&quot; board game. The game board consists of a spiral track with consecutively numbered spaces up to the number 63 with the starting point on the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to the roll of a die. The spaces are numbered and filled with objects that are specific to the lore of gnomes that you will learn about when you land on them. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a gnome is depicted. Landing on a gnome allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards, lose one or more turns, or be sent back to start.<br/><br/>Ages 4-400. Includes VHS video, gnome board game, 6-piece puzzle board, 4 gnome hat pawns, and a white die.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played with 2-8 players.<br/><br/>How to Start:<br/>Players choose their pieces.<br/><br/>Each player starts with $1500 (however the money can summed up to equal $1500 is fine. Ex. Two $500 bills and five $100 bills or three $500 Bills)<br/><br/>All players start on the START space.<br/><br/>Place all of the &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve Found True Love&rsquo; cards (8 total) on the &lsquo;Found True Love&rsquo; Space. Do the same for the &lsquo;Makin&rsquo; Money&rsquo; cards on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space<br/><br/>Roll Dice to determine who goes first.<br/><br/>After the first person is determined to start the game all players&rsquo; turns are random. After each play you must spin the bottle. When the bottle stops turning and the head of the bottle is facing someone that person goes. You cannot go twice in a row it must land on someone other than yourself. In the case of two players just go back and forth, no need to spin the bottle.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Once it is your turn, roll the dice.<br/><br/>Move the amount of spaces as dictated by the dice.<br/><br/>After you have moved to that space pick a card from the draw pile (the draw pile should consist of all cards that are not money, making money, or found true love cards). If you land on a space that says &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get scammed&rsquo;, you move to the large corner space with those titles on the board and DO NOT move off of it until you roll a &ldquo;6&rdquo; or higher by adding together both dice. Then you move only ONE space off of &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get Scammed&rsquo;. You can be sent to these spaces by either landing on them or drawing a card that sends you there, either way the rules apply.<br/><br/>Follow what the cards tell you to do from there on out.<br/>a.    Put cards next to the draw deck that you cannot keep.<br/><br/>b.    If you get a keepable card (ex. A house or car) and you already have it nothing happens just put it in the discard pile.<br/>c.    Re-shuffle the cards once there are no more left in the draw pile.<br/><br/>d.    If you land on a corner space your turn ends there regardless of how many spaces you rolled.<br/><br/>How to end the game:<br/>     Someone has found a true love card on the &ldquo;Find true love&rsquo; space&rsquo;, they have a job card, a house card, and a car card, land on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space to get a &ldquo;Makin Money&rsquo; card, and make their way back to the Start space. When they have done all this they have won the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heresy is a 6mm miniatures game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Designer Peter Ramos began working on this game a year after beginning the NetEpic project.<br/><br/>Heresy is built to reflect more &ldquo;gritty&rdquo; game mechanics that usually get left out in most game systems like morale, true command and control and combined arms tactics. It is designed for a minimum 6 by 4 feet playing surface and uses ten-sided dice to resolve most of combat. Although Heresy is based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe using Epic scale miniatures, it is not authorized by Games Workshop, and any 6mm model range can serves as proxies.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are not based on any previous version of Epic. Counters, templates, and tables are downloadable. The game is meant to be as self-contained as possible.<br/><br/>Heresy is available from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.netepic.org/EPICentre/Downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.netepic.org/EPICentre/Downloads/</a><br/><br/>(Note: This link is dead)<br/><br/>Heresy is now at this link: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.netepic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.netepic.org/</a><br/><br/>",

Each quadrant is further subdivided into a route map of delivery addresses (1-18) which may be traveled on throw of a dice by each players transport vehicles. Each vehicle has a different capacity for mail (vans can diver up to two of the players cards, trucks carry three). Since each card dealt to a player indicates an address printed on it (e.g. B13, A6 etc. etc.), on his/her turn, dice must be thrown and vehicles moved towards those destinations in order to deliver the mail. When this is done, the player earns a cash bonus. A delaying element is added to the game via aircraft, which can be rented to deliver unwanted cards (to a maximum of four)from a players hand to another players depot when that player may seem likely to run out of deliveries &amp; win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Confab is a conversation-based blank-card game for any number of players; ideally two. It was idly invented for a prize in Round One of BlogNomic (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://blognomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://blognomic.com</a>), and has been polished slightly for more-than-two-player games since.<br/><br/>Get a load of blank cards; at least ten per person. Everyone then scribbles arbitrary conversational sentences ('Hello.' 'How are you?' 'Yes.' 'No.' 'You're very tall.') onto the cards, until they're all covered. Shuffle them all together, deal five to each person and leave a face-down draw pile.<br/><br/>Taking turns, players must either play a card from their hand that follows conversationally from the previous card (or opens the conversation, if they're the first to play), or - if they can't go - draw a new card from the draw pile.<br/><br/>It sounds a bit of a throwaway game, but there's a good level of strategy and humour to it; the 'offensiveness' and 'defensiveness' of particular sentences, the vagueness of wild cards, the general effect of cartoon characters communicating via pre-written signboards. Language is a game, after all.<br/><br/>Available at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://kevan.org/games/confab.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://kevan.org/games/confab.html</a><br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of inmates from Angola prison with different sentences, and spin their way around the board, hoping for eventual parole when they obtain 1,000 points. They must endure &quot;Unavoidable Circumstances,&quot; ranging from frame-ups by enemy inmates to extortion, and players may commit offenses as well, which could land them in the work camp or the &quot;Dungeon,&quot; or simply lose you the game (e.g. suicide). Good behavior and informing on other inmates may help players to be freed. The game is made to convey the hopelessness of prison life, as some players may not win at all if their sentences are not commuted. The designer created the game to be played by youth offenders to encourage them to stay out of prison.<br/><br/>",

Gorecki and New Day Enterprises, helps young children develop a healthy attitude about themselves, their emotions and life in general.<br/><br/>Rolling the die (a large foam cube), players move about the graphically interesting game board amid colorful children's activity scenes, following directions and gathering cards which clearly display the meaning of Love, Happiness, Sharing, Caring, Honesty and Friendship.<br/><br/>Players may be lucky enough to climb a tree to the &quot;Nest Rest&quot;, glide down the &quot;Water Slide&quot;, or go &quot;Finish&quot; space, all the while keeping an eye on their &quot;ALL OF ME&quot; goal and their playmates.<br/><br/>The first child to collect and assemble all six positive value cards on his or her self-character and move on to the &quot;Finish&quot; space wins.  Yet, because of what the game teaches, and the active excitement and positive feelings it creates, there are no real &quot;losers&quot; ... only winners ... in &quot;All OF ME&quot;<br/><br/>",

Payout! is a &ldquo;race to the end&rdquo; board game. You start the game with 20 cents. There are 6 different types of spaces on the board. Each type corresponds to a vault. If you land on a vault with coins in it, you get the coins that are in the vault. If you land on a space without coins in it, you have to put coins in the vault. When you get to the end of the board, you get to sit in a vault and take all of the coins that go in it. If you have the most money at the end of the game, you win.<br/><br/>Payout! is a game for three to six players, although you can play it with two if you really want to. Payout! uses two dice, loose change, pawns, and a custom board. You can download the custom board and read the rules at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/477\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/477</a>. A four-player game takes about 30 minutes to play. Payout! is appropriate for ages 7 and up, and is a great way to reinforce basic counting and money skills with younger children.<br/><br/>",

Judging by the art deco/American &quot;streamline&quot; design, the best guess would be that it dates from the mid-1930s to early 1940s.<br/><br/>The playing field consists of a Tic Tac Toe grid with holes in each square surrounded with wooden pegs inserted at various points to serve as bumpers. Players alternate hitting a metal lever to launch marbles up a chute and onto the playing field in an attempt to get their marbles to settle into the squares. As with Tic Tac Toe, the winner is the first to get 3 marbles settled in a row.<br/><br/>",

The game is played with a standard deck of cards, a marker for each tribal champion, a marker for each tribe, a bunch of territory markers and three six sided dice.  A grid of face down cards are laid out before the players.  The players roll for their number of allowed actions each turn, moving their champion on the cards, looking at face down cards and sometimes taking them into their hands.  Cards may be used to duel other champions or collected to build a promiseland for the tribe.  Face cards may also be used for special actions, like taking an action in the middle of another players turn.  Once a player has collected enough cards for a promiseland, they must cross the board to get their tribe and bring them to the promiseland.  The first to accomplish this wins.<br/><br/>Itesser Ink sells only a rulebook, all other pieces must be provided by the purchaser.<br/><br/>",

In role of the most well-known gentlemen rogue and very cheer and wanton ladies a player try to collect the points of their realized desires. The only strategy and erotic game all over the world.<br/><br/>Juchajdo! is a humorous Czech adult-themed game illustrated by one of best Czech illustrators Kaja Saudek. You'll need two sets to play with 8 players, one is enough for 4 of them.<br/><br/>Players draw cards with male and female characters and play them on a square grid. The deck also contains some special cards, that can be used when placing these characters or when doing various actions.<br/><br/>Once you have some character(s) in game, you can move them. All characters have some preferences, when it comes to &quot;partnership&quot; and you try to &quot;pair&quot; your characters with those, that are matching these preferences (getting them to the same square).<br/><br/>Once you &quot;pair&quot; one of your characters with one of opposite gender, the owners of both score points by the preferences of their character and &quot;qualities&quot; of the second one. Unless of them play some special card, both of them are removed from game thereafter.<br/><br/>Having a very nice price for such a game, it is a cheap print on waxed paper, cut-before-play, is full-colour, and especially if laminated can remain for a long time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From a copy of the rules put out by Gamesarchives.<br/><br/>Neutral by V.E. MORRILL CO, was produced in 1914. It is a game consistent with current history. The striking difference between Neutral and other games in which tricks and trumps figure a part of, consists of the suit of Neutral Cards representing the United States, played under certain restrictions as described in the rules which are supreme over trumps and all other cards.<br/><br/>The game comes with 48 cards divided into 8 suits. 40 cards represent the 5 principle warring countries; Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Austria. The cards of the warring nations are termed &quot;Belligerents&quot;.  Each set of Belligerent cards consist of The Ruler(value 8), General (7), Colonel (6), Major(5), Captain(4), Lieutenant(3), Sergent(2), and Corporal(1).<br/><br/>The United States represented by 8 cards plays the role of Neutral and Peacemaker to all of the warring nations.. Any trick won by the United States is neutralized and theoretically removed from the conflict.<br/><br/>The game is played like most other trump games with players bidding to be able to establish trumps and then win a certain number of tricks. The established trumps win tricks if played on tricks where you have none of the lead suit but Neutral Trumps beat established trumps if they are played.<br/><br/>If you succeed with your bid you score points, if you fail you score nothing. Each Neutral trick won scores 2 points + 1 point if the ruler card is included in the traick (The US ruler card is President Wilson). Ruler cards won in  &quot;Belligerent tricks scores nothing. Game consists of first to score 50 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The tile placement starts in the center of the board and develops to the edges, where the most points can be collected.<br/><br/>There are 4 tile placement rules, which make this game very playable. But what makes this game brilliant is the fact, that it includes 6 tiles more than needed (42 tiles for a 36 space board!).

They all had interesting mechanics and/or inventive victory conditions - but they had no theme!

The game is played by two to five players using the pieces from a backgammon set. Each player places six checkers in the player's portion of the board, with the center of the board representing a &quot;pool&quot; area that is empty at the start. Pieces are captured from the groups of the other players, or moved to the central pool, or taken from the pool, based on the roll of two six-sided dice. To win, a player must clear all the checkers from his portion of the board and then roll a 6. Bell also reports on a drinking game variant.<br/><br/>",

The 50 Problem Cards and the possible impact that facing these dangers have on the expeditionary teams&rsquo; successful progress through the pyramid, took three years of research alone. As the players will discover, archeological expeditions into pyramids encountered many physical and emotional challenges as the result of the sadistic mind of the pyramid builder, who incorporated deadly traps in order to frustrate and confuse grave robbers.<br/><br/>Three groups are created, each with two competing archeological teams (approximately five players per team). The teams progress through the pyramid by correctly answering Question Cards, selecting a Passage Progress Card and collecting Hieroglyphic Cards, each with a hieroglyphic symbol and the translation of that symbol. Although most of the symbols were created to resemble actual hieroglyphics, the simulated experiences encountered as the players collect, piece together, and correctly translate a real message from a hieroglyphic tablet, is authentic.<br/><br/>The goal of the two competing archeological teams is to travel to each of the three chambers; the Pharaoh&rsquo;s Burial Chamber, the Queen&rsquo;s Burial Chamber and the Great Hall. As each chamber is entered, a piece or several pieces of a Hieroglyphic Tablet is/are discovered. Using the Hieroglyphic Cards accumulated, the team that can correctly piece together and translate the Mummy's Message wins the simulation game.<br/><br/>",

Even the rule sheet is presented as a &quot;Prescription Form,&quot; which notes Refill: PRN (As needed for fun).<br/><br/>Per the rules: &quot;Each player acts as a resident physician. (A resident physician is a doctor who is undergoing specialty training following medical school.)<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is given 10 patient cards [which] represent the patients that the player must try to discharge during the course of the game. One patient is discharged each time a question is answered correctly.&quot;<br/><br/>The first player to discharge all his/her patients wins.<br/><br/>As per the Trivial Pursuit model, there are color-coded spaces on the board that correspond to question categories. The 4 categories are:<br/>Green-History and Personalities<br/>Yellow-General Medicine<br/>Red-Anatomy &amp; Surgery; Public Health; Preventative Medicine<br/>Blue-Nutrition &amp; Exercise.<br/><br/>In addition, other spaces offer exceptions to the color code system and present players with alternative Bonus and Risk cards that can modify their position on the board or choice of question categories.<br/><br/>The rules conclude with a directive [keeping with the prescription pad theme] for &quot;NO GENERIC SUBSTITUTIONS&quot; and &quot;Keep within reach of inquisitive teenagers &amp; adults.&quot;<br/><br/>This is followed with a fairly substantial disclaimer that though this game is based on reputable sources, one should turn to Dr. Arnvie for advice on medical treatment or conditions but should, instead, consult your regular medical provider.<br/><br/>",

Stores are established in spaces on the apple-shaped board, and players manage their inventory by holding onto cards representing goods.  These cards are purchased from warehouse spaces and frequently change hands since a player is obliged to purchase a card whenever he or she lands on an opponent's store.  The maximum price which may be charged for an item depends on the number of floors in a store, so players are constantly expanding their outlets.<br/><br/>The game deals with more than just cash -- every player gets a balance sheet used for tracking bank loans and credit with other players.  Credit limits are determined at the start of the game and affect the length of the game -- a $300 limit is recommended for an hour-long game, while $500 can last two hours or more.  As players reach their credit limits and are unable to pay back their creditors, they go bankrupt and drop out of the game.<br/><br/>In addition to the normal flow of buying and selling, the game features board spaces and cards that spice up gameplay with random events.  There are also some special transportation spaces (taxis and subways) which allow players a little more control over their movement to add variety to the normal rolling and moving.<br/><br/>Big Apple obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Monopoly, but it's not just a retheming -- there are enough differences to make it distinct from its more famous predecessor.<br/><br/>",

The board is composed of a 12x12 grid with a line of six starting/home squares parallel to and centered along each edge of the board. The players place their six pieces in these squares at the start of the game. In addition, each player has a seventh piece, which is slightly larger, known as the Priest of the Bow.<br/><br/>The object is to cross the board and occupy the opposing home spaces, capturing as many men as possible on the way. Moves are made one square at a time along diagonal lines, with the pieces being placed at intersecting points. The pieces may not be moved backward.<br/><br/>When two pieces surround an opposing piece, it is captured and removed from the board. The first captured piece is replaced by the capturing player's Priest of the Bow, which has the ability to move either on the diagonal lines as normal, or at right angles.<br/><br/>",

This is intended for your entertainment and learning.<br/><br/>I think we all know young boys or girls who seem like they were hard-wired for finance. When the subject of money is being discussed, they are right there like spounges soaking it up. I know because I was one of them, but my parents didn't take the time to teach me about money. Today lots of parents still don't teach their kids enough about money, and yet our kids will all deal with money most days in their lives and how early they begin to understand money, will directly influence their lifestyle. This game is for parents to encourage those little finance prodigies. The world is changing to where the cash in your hand is the crumbs from the table, while the banquet is inside the corporations. For Grade 5 and up, but best for teens and up.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Big Board&rdquo; is like a nickname for Wall Street, while &ldquo;Raiders&rdquo; are the teams of entrepreneurs, lawyers, accountants, brokers and investment bankers who engaged in hostile takeovers of the companies they pursue. In Big Board Raiders, players can gang-up by pooling their capital to promote a cause or stop another player, but alliances don&rsquo;t last forever and when they end, backstabbing is an inevitable strategy. Communication and deal making are very important enhancements to a player&rsquo;s game strategy. A few choice words can help your portfolio or have the opposite effect on your opponent&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s all about opportunities, timing and the hustle.<br/><br/>There are two main objectives players engage in while playing Big Board Raiders; the first is to get elected by proxy as a director of a company and the second is to grow your portfolio using the many investment vehicles, so that you will have the capital to make your move to control your company; the company in which you were elected to the board by proxy. There are four trading companies: Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green. Six Subsidiaries, and each of these subsidiaries has a proxy vote that it gives to the players as they land on their subsidiary space on the game board. To win, grow your capital while collection the proxy votes to be elected as a director, then buy enough shares to take over control of that company.<br/><br/>",

Players drew chips from a bag to determine which word on the host's card they had to spell correctly.  Paul Wing was an author and NBC staff director.  His show was originally heard only in the cities competing in each weekly broadcast, but the program did eventually (and briefly) gain full network status.  Cutting costs even in the 1930s, Milton Bradley's materials for this game were identical to the ones used in Vox Pop.<br/><br/>The game was played by choosing a word caller, then going around the room and having people pull numbered disks out of a bag; the number on the disk determined the word you would spell (and some words were notably easier than others, so it was a bit of a game of chance). Correct moves got you a little green counter called a &quot;honey,&quot; and wrong moves got you a little red counter called a &quot;stinger&quot; (because it's a bee, get it?)<br/><br/>",

Units are squad-sized, hexes represent about 100 meters across, and game turns are 60 to 120 seconds of real time.  Six small scenarios are provided.<br/><br/>The rules are short and succinct, with no real surprises from the standard igo/ugo practice, with one exception ... players alternate, not in taking their full turns, but in initiating combat until all combat is completed, and then in moving until all eligible units have moved.  This tends to slow the game down somewhat, but the benefit is the ability of the players to respond to threats in a more timely manner.<br/><br/>The components include four geomorphic map sheets, each 8.5&quot;x11&quot;; six pages of rules; and 166 uncut counters.  The production quality is low as the game, as well as the magazine in which it came (more on that in a moment) is photocopied.  Photocopied, remember, using 1977 technology.<br/><br/>The magazine is Volume 1 Number 1, and therefore Issue 1, of Combat!, the International Magazine of Conflict Simulations.  It's published by Wellington Wargames, also known as Swedish Games Productions, the brainchild of Fredrik Malmberg, who is himself a bit of a prodigal.  He began his wargame producing career in earnest when he was 14 years old (see his design 'Fight for Tobruk!')  Only 200 copies of The Combat issue 1 were printed.<br/><br/>",

The first part of the journey includes the choice of two routes. The overland journey visits the city of Alexandria and the sea cruise calls in at Sierra Leone and the Cape.<br/><br/>With 36 stops along the route, the visitor participates in a remarkable, colonial experience of the world.<br/><br/>The game includes a box, mounted color map, reproduction rule book and catalog, The Historical Games Collection catalog, four re-created pawns lightly tipped in colors, and a six sided teetotum (spinner - dice were considered at the time as something used for gambling).<br/><br/>Game play involves spinning, moving your pawn the appropriate number of spaces, and then reading the educational paragraph about the colony or possession you have landed on.<br/><br/>The reproduction edition's rulebook notes: &quot;These rules are copied directly from the originals and reflect the moral and social outlook of early 19th century imperialist peoples. The facts and attitudes are often wrong, intolerant and patronizing and should be read from a historical perspective.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game was published at the height of the British Empire and outrageously describes the appearance, customs and culture of the region's peoples, comparing their way of life to that of the British.<br/><br/>The game comes in a box with a mounted full color reproduction board, reproduction rules, Catalog of The Historical Games Collection, four &quot;travelers&quot; (pawns) - each lightly tipped with a different color, 16 counters (chips, each with the rose face lightly colored to match pawns), and a teetotum (top with eight sides, numbered 1-8 - dice being items of gambling).<br/><br/>Each player spins and moves their pawn a number of spaces, attempting to progress to 25 by exact count. Each space has a description in the accompanying rule book to be read aloud, describing the scene from an area of Asia.  The counters are used to mark off missed turns assigned by the descriptions.<br/><br/>The rules note: &quot;These rules are copied directly form the originals and reflect the moral and social outlook of early 19th century imperialist peoples. The facts and attitudes are often wrong, intolerant and patronizing and should be read from a historical perspective.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A set of rules which can be played on any map showing political subdivisions. The players take turns placing one piece at a time on the mapboard in order to capture territories. Pieces may not be placed into enemy held spaces, and a player may not have more than three pieces in a single space. The diceless combat system requires you to establish a larger force in spaces adjacent to those occupied by the enemy. The game continues until both players pass, at which time the victor is the player who controls the most spaces.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by the 1983 SSI computer game Fortress, which was played on a 6x6 grid and limited to 21 turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, players race to move four pawns from their starting positions around the board into their &quot;Home Country.&quot;  Basic gameplay resembles Pachisi or Sorry!, but there are a couple of twists.  First of all, movement is controlled by a deck of standard playing cards (with some extra Aces and Kings) -- most cards move a pawn forward by their face value, but some have special powers (get a pawn out of the starting area, move multiple pawns, trade places, move backwards, etc.).  Additionally, while the game can be played as a free-for-all, it is also possible for players to split into partnerships and aid their partners in the race to victory.<br/><br/>The game is subtitled &quot;An International Card Game,&quot; featuring rules in eight different languages and decorating its board with the flags of many of the countries where it can be played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clubhouse Golf Dice Game loosely simulates a round of golf through the same scoring system - the lower the number of strokes, the better your score. The game comes with 5 dice: A white Tee die, a light green Fairway (F) die, a blue Water (W) die, a yellow Sand (S) die and a dark green putting (G for Green) die. Except for the putting die, the dice have letters on them indicating the next die to be cast. The putting die has numbers on it.<br/><br/>Each hole, a player starts by rolling the Tee die (the first stroke). Subsequently, the player rolls the next die indicated by the previous die, adding one stroke to their score for each die rolled. However, when the Water die is rolled, the player adds 2 strokes instead. When the Green (G) is rolled, the player rolls the putting die and adds the number rolled to his/her score - the hole then ends for that player and his/her score is the number of strokes played. Players can play 18 holes for a full round of golf. The lowest total score wins.<br/><br/>It's easier to get a hole-in-one in this game than in real golf - roll 'G' on the Tee die, followed by a roll of '0' on the putting die.<br/><br/>",

No copyright date is attached.<br/><br/>The art was provided by painter &amp; illustrator Einar Torsslow, and may be considered mildly racist today (the Negroes are depicted with black-face), and there is a reference to cannibals in event #62.

At the corners it had side routes which you could choose to go on instead of the main route. These would have slightly longer detours around the corners. You would roll one die and advance that many spaces. On each space were opportunities to earn money, spend money, find ancestors and locate ancestors. If you found an ancestor, you obtained a blue (boys) or pink (girls) card representing that ancestor which you then put on your own board (which you had in front of you) which represented you and all your ancestors. The idea was to collect all these ancestors (such as brother, mother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, etc.) and put their cards in their respective portions of this board. Once you had them all, the next goal was to seal/unite them all together. You did this mainly on those side routes, which was where you could get sealing cards. You would put these cards (one per link between each ancestor) to connect the ancestors together. The first person to connect all their family/ancestors together won the game.<br/><br/>",

This prevents the pieces in the first rank from directly attacking each other.

Simply use as many BINARY DICE as needed in each case: the two or three lowest in an ordinary family game, or all five for deciding an important outcome to within a resolution of 3%.<br/>Contents: 5 &times; BINARY DICE, rules for Binary Yatzy and Binary 3 in a Row.&quot;<br/><br/>The set consists of just 5 little white square tiles, each of which is blank on one side and bears a number (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16) on the other. The dice can be used to play two games - Binary Yatzy (A Yatzee-like game that has an innovative scoring grid which adds an extra dimension to consider when taking one's score) and Binary 3 in a row (Tic-tac-toe using the binary dice - players cast the first 3 binary dice and then must flip one of them before using the total sum to place their mark, so there is some thought involved).<br/><br/>",

The players move forward or backwards around the board track according to the cards that are drawn in sequence. No dice are used.<br/><br/>Players in the game are drafted randomly into several different roles of the Endeavour: Bosun, 1st Mate, Joseph Banks, and of course Captain Cook.  Cook has a few privileges and winners of the race get to play him in other rounds of the game. Cook moves first and is essentially the dealer.<br/><br/>The game comes with an educational supplement published by the NSW Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. The playing cards also contain illustrations and facts about some of the Flora &amp; Fauna of New South Wales, Australia.<br/><br/>The game also came with 'historic cut out medals' that players were encouraged to pin on themselves in order to add the element of role-play.<br/><br/>",

Each office on a state increases the chances of collecting votes during primaries which are held on a fixed calendar at certain turns of the game.  Movement is 0-5 squares at player's choice, but an end-of-turn die role introduces random events.<br/><br/>Strategy consists primarily of shrewd choice of states in which to compete -- you can spread over many small states, concentrate on a few large ones, or make some attempt at a hybrid.  Player vs. player interaction is limited; the end-of-turn event roll gives you a 1/6th chance of being able to send an opponent to the Federal Election Commission space (which is, effectively, jail).<br/> Components, unusually, include a cork board and colored pins. The game otherwise has poor production values by modern standards (it appears to have been a self-published one-shot and is more than 25 years old), but is redeemed by a simple and effective design.<br/><br/>This is a quick-playing, light-weight, clever game that exploits its topic well and is worth two or three plays in the unlikely event that you can find a copy.<br/><br/>It is regrettable that the game does not credit its designer, and the name of the publisher is an obvious joke punning on &quot;gerrymander&quot;<br/><br/>This game is long out of print and rare.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assault Of The Ogroids is a computer moderated solo board game published in the May 1987 issue of Sinclair User magazine, a computer magazine for the 8-bit SInclair ZX Spectrum.<br/><br/>The player takes the part of Deerfoot, a scout sent to gain aid for his city which is being besieged by the evil Ogroids.  The board is a rectangle 12 spaces by 15 spaces, and the player wins the game by traveling across the board within 30 hours.<br/><br/>Every square entered takes a toll of the available time and the player's stamina.  There are five different types of terrain, and the random encounters include finding useful items, meeting unfriendly monsters, becoming lost or finding a quicker route to your eventual goal.  You lose once 30 game hours have passed, or if you are killed by a monster or other kind of encounter.<br/><br/>The computer program is approximately 90 lines of BASIC. It randomises numbers for combat and for encounters met along the way, and also keeps a track of the gold and items held by the player.<br/><br/>Gary Chalk designed the game and also illustrated it in a style familiar from the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; game books.<br/><br/>",

You've got 8 pawns each, all in 1. (or 8.) row. You must capture maximum possible number of opponents pawns in your turn. To win, you must capture all of opponents pawns or to move all your pawns which still are on the board to the last row. Ties are rare, but possible. You must pay attention, because it's possible to lose more than 5 pawns in one move, even if it doesn't look like. Easy to learn, hard (or maybe impossible) to perfect.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of 36 game cards plus one card with the rules: 20 of the cards deal with Gulliver's journey to Lilliput, and the other 16 to Brobdingnag.<br/><br/>The cards are illustrated on one side, with the relevant passage from the novel on the back.  The cards are marked with numbers from 1-9 and letters from a-d: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, etc.  Every four cards with the same number are a set.  The story is told sequentially from card to card, obviously heavily abbreviated.<br/><br/>The game is a simple &quot;Go Fish&quot; variant, but oddly enough they recommend gambling when playing the game!  (&quot;A pool of counters formed at the start pays an agreed bonus to the player with the most fours.  A stipulated fine may be paid to the player who is misinformed about a card.&quot;)  The game does not include any &quot;counters&quot; ...<br/><br/>The cards are completely in English, despite being made in Austria.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steamwork Arena is a quick playing, diceless, customizable, miniature-based fighting game.  You're the pilot of a steamwork mecha in an arena battle with one or more other mecha.  During play, you move your mecha's miniature around an un-gridded playing area, attacking and being attacked by your opponent(s).<br/><br/>Here's the big gimmick: You have a special card for your mecha.  This card is called a template.  Your template keeps track of your health.  It also keeps track of which one of 5 modes you're in.  Your mode dictates your attack, defense, energy, movement, and the range of your ranged attacks.  During play, you'll shift from mode to mode as your needs change.  As you take damage, modes will &quot;shut down&quot; and become unavailable to you.  You win the game by dealing enough damage to your opponent(s) to shut down all of their modes.<br/><br/>Here's the small gimmick: There are no dice.  During play, you'll spend energy to attack and defend.  To do this, you hide energy tokens in your hands and your opponent gets to pick a hand.  The number of tokens in the selected hand determines how strong your attack or defense is.  All tokens in both hands get spent.  This &quot;pick-a-hand&quot; mechanic encourages bluffing and strategic play that's atypical for miniature games like this.<br/><br/>Steamwork Arena is a game for two to four players, although you could probably play it with more.  Steamwork Arena uses miniatures, a large flat surface, small tokens, custom templates, and paper clips.  A two-player game takes about 20 minutes to play.  Steamwork Arena is appropriate for Ages 12 and up.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/474\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/474</a><br/><br/>",

Historically the Romans usually raced 4, 8 or 12 chariots.<br/>Each player controls one or more units. A unit can be a chariot OR a driver that survived a crashed chariot.<br/>During a turn each player moves their unit one at a time in the following order decided by track position: The current race leading unit moves first each turn. If more than 1 unit is in the same row, then dice to decide the order of movement for the units in that row.  Highest roll wins; re-rolling ties. If the leading chariot has crashed and the driver survived, it is still considered the leading unit until overtaken by another chariot or driver. The next to move is the unit in the next closest row (not lane), and so on.  Dice for units in the same row as above. If a unit has been lapped, its physical position on the track behind the race leader at the start of that turn counts for movement order, not the number of laps completed. <br/>Crashed chariots do not move voluntarily, but may move as the outcome of a collision (see COLLISIONS). Collisions are resolved at the time they occur and any outcome moves applied, before a unit completes a move. For curves, determine the unit in front by comparing front lines of each space when extended sideways.<br/><br/>",

Players gain/lose corruption via combat and reaching or opposing purposes.<br/><br/>While the game's Buffy CCG roots can clearly be seen, there are many differences. The main ones being: <br/><br/>    Each character has six stats: fighting ability, intelligence, persuasion, mysticism, integrity and charm. <br/>    The purposes have both good and evil sides, so both players can attempt them, regardless of their side.<br/>    The turn structure is much less organized, as players play cards, move characters, and resolve actions all in the same phase, instead of having move, resource, combat and end steps.<br/>    Cards have a corruption cost, so the more powerful cards can only be played later in the game, and only by players of that alignment.<br/><br/><br/>The initial set has 482 cards, of the following types: starting effects, characters, items, skills, plans, events, locations and purposes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Masters of Golf is a golf simulation game. It is based on the rules of golf.<br/><br/>The players use a personal percentage table to determine which club to select. A turn on a wheel determines the accuracy of the hit. Dice determine the direction of flight. If the hit was unsuccessful (for example the ball is possibly out of bounce) an action/outcome card is drafted and the resulting action/outcome is taken (actions/outcomes are based on the rules of golf). A pion marks the place of the ball.<br/><br/>There are 9 boards for 9 holes, and the small game/putting is simulated on a separate board. The players can use their own golf statistics to make up their own tables for use in the game. All variants of golf can be played (stableford, strokeplay, matchplay, foursome, fourball, skins)<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.masterofgolf.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.masterofgolf.nl/</a><br/><br/>",

Apparently its name was derived thus: ADdition, SUBtraction, MULtiplication, DIvision.<br/><br/>Included with the game are instructions for two variants, Adsubmuldi and Adsubmuldi Fractions.<br/><br/>Here is a quote from its introduction: <br/>&quot;These two series of games are based on the game of checkers, and are played on a standard checkerboard with checker-like pieces.  The basic rules of checkers also apply.  Although two players normally oppose each other, the games can be played by one person opposing himself or by four players pairing up and playing as partners.<br/><br/>The object of the games is to accumulate the most points by solving correctly the larger number of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems.  Adsubmuldi is designed to reinforce these skills with whole numbers, and Adsubmuldi Fractions does the same with fractions and mixed numbers.<br/><br/>The game ends, as in regular checkers, when all the playing pieces belonging to one of the players have been captured.  However, the winner of the game is the player with the most points, even if he is the one who lost all the playing pieces.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Try to get rid of it as fast as possible. Put it in a burger and hope that no one notices. Fortunately you also can put it in an opponent's burger. But he may give you his burger then and you mustn't refuse that nice 'gift'.<br/>Bluff: Place your ingredients face-down on the table. So no one knows if it's cheese, salad, onions or a little tick. When your opponent gives you that burger, you'll get extra-score. Find the right strategy and the right face-expression to convince your opponents. When the cards are turned face-up, it's getting funny. Tick-Burger is a funny mixture of strategy, chance and bluff for the whole family.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The other is set in the Navy and landing on medal, badge of rank or targeted submarine squares are advantageous, and enemy subs, mines and torpedoes are bad.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the games are Snakes-and-Ladder clones, but with themes contrasting a career in the navy with working in an office.<br/><br/>",

However, getting to the center of the board is not enough.<br/><br/>In order to beat the Gold Clan, players must &quot;power up&quot; along the way by defending their own clan`s territory, crossing over into other clans` territories via &quot;cross-over points&quot; and Card Battling against rival clan members to collect their cards in order to increase their energy (life) points and gain much higher level &quot;Combo Attacks&quot; which they will use to defeat the Gold Clan and wipe out any of the menacing Kuragami Demons lurking about along the way.<br/><br/>Victory is obtained only when one player enters the final arena and defeats the Gold Clan.<br/><br/>This game can be played by 1~5 players on a single game board. Players with multiple game boards can network with each other following a special set of &ldquo;Clan Battle&rdquo; in which the primary objective is simply to eradicate the remaining 4 clans. (Recommended for up to 3 game boards and 15 players.)<br/><br/>",

Both sides threw in more and more troops until by late August, each had committed entire armies.

In the beginning your first rolls will determine if you want to go Greek or not, as well as paying tuition, eventual you land on a major and then as you go, you face different paths to take and if you want a bachelors, masters or doctorate. Each major has a different pay rating and is of course dependent on your level of degree. You also earn points for each semester according to GPA and there is a scale as to how much you make. To win  you have to graduate and the game ends with everyone graduating and the winner is the one with the most money. If you reach graduation first don't worry you continue to collect money each round without having to do anything. Also the game was distributed in a long tube and the game board is vinyl that rolls up nicely.<br/><br/>",

There are some of the white squares depicted with a value, like the faces of a die, hence their being known as &quot;Dice&quot;. Those white squares of which have no die depicted are called the &quot;Check&quot; squares. The black squares are never in play at all. Each player has 12 tokens, that are referred to as &quot;tiles&quot;, with 2 smaller &quot;markers&quot; that players use to keep track of the score on the score track.

Each move is a random length and takes a random time (rolled on two separate dice); the game starts with 72 hours before the eclipse - the duration of each move is deducted from each player's personal 'clock'.  In the process the players also have to earn money by doing bits of casual work here and there in order to have the &pound;50 entrance fee that admittance to the &quot;optimum viewing site&quot; requires for admittance.  If time gets tight the players even have the opportunity to visit Merlin's Cave at Tintagel to be sent back in time after completing a task for him.<br/><br/>It's a strange game, probably more interesting as a curiosity/souvenir than for gameplay.  The quality of components and printing is very good, although most of the graphics used in the game appear to be royalty-free clip art, along with a rather varied selection of fonts.<br/><br/>",

To this day it remains one of the great unspoiled wildernesses on the planet and one of the most rugged places on the Earth.  Located on the Pacific&rsquo;s Ring of Fire, Kamchatka holds some of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful active volcanoes. Add to that the earthquakes, mudslides, flooding, and avalanches and it is easy to see why Kamchatka is literally a force of nature.<br/><br/>The fauna is just as imposing: Giant roc-like eagles reign from above (seriously, google Stellar&rsquo;s Eagles-these things are unreal!); huge sockeye salmon are plentiful in the many rivers and waterways; walrus and seals live and breed along the shores; herds of reindeer number in the thousands; and there is a greater density of giant grizzly bear in Kamchatka than anywhere else in the world.<br/><br/>GAME<br/>In Kamchatka you must fight to survive.  Time stands still here: You play an indigenous hunter hundreds&mdash;even thousands&mdash;of years ago surrounded by Kamchatka&rsquo;s frigid seas, great rivers, dense forests, and snowcapped volcanic mountains.  Your village depends on you and your small hunting party to hunt, trap, and trade in order to search out the resources they need.  You will risk your life on this journey through Kamchatka&rsquo;s harsh bush and in its treacherous seas to bring back the required resources to your villagers.<br/><br/>Kamchatka is designed to play solitaire or for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

When they visit a supermarket they are overwhelmed by the tons of food because on their planet there is only pink striped slimy sea grass. So they start tasting everything: cheese, chocolate, butter, plums, frozen pizza,<br/>spinach, potato chips, canned fish, raspberry marmalade&hellip;<br/>Suddenly their faces go all funny with squares. &ldquo;I feel really sick!&rdquo; moans Tim Taster-lots. &ldquo;I have eaten so much I can't move&rdquo;, complains Daddy Taster-lots. They all know they have eaten too much. But what should they have eaten and how? Can you help?<br/><br/>Throughout the game you collect the foodstuff that your body needs during the day. Doing so, you should collect neither too much nor too little foodstuff. The food pyramid printed on your stamp sheet shows how much and which foods you should eat during the day. Each little box of the pyramid corresponds to one portion of the foodstuff shown.<br/>Example: Your body needs 4 portions of fruit and vegetables while you should only eat 1 portion of sweets (a portion is as much as fits in your hand).<br/>The aim of the game is to be the first to have checked all the boxes on your nutritional sheet with a stamp.<br/><br/>",

Place all of the circular pieces in the center of the table and turn them all face down, then give each player a card. The object of the game is to complete the cards correctly. The first players selects one of the pieces. If it completes a figure in his card this player has another opportunity to draw and continues in this way until he draws a piece which does not belong in his card, which piece is put back on the table face down and mixed in with the others and the next in turn plays in the same way and so on until all have played. Continue playing in turn and the one whose card is complete first wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Note: Box claims a patent date of July 23, 1912<br/><br/>",

The Empire of Man has reached out into the intergalactic depths of space, and a lost son has been found&hellip;unfortunately. The great Quantumliners of the Scouting Guild has encountered an artificial species completely inimical to humanity. Each alien robot is directly controlled by a single artificial intelligence known as Ladek! The twisted, disembodied mind of the former human scientist now lords over these automaton artifacts of a long extinct race. They have invaded every galaxy controlled by man&rsquo;s glorious Imperium, and have begun a systematic extermination of every human life it encounters. While the Imperial Navy and Marine Corp defends the home galaxies against the attacks of these monsters, it falls to the Scouting Guild to hunt out and destroy Ladek units along the Imperium&rsquo;s frontier worlds.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;One player plays the Human Imperial Scouts and the other plays the Ladek Marine Robots. Forces are &lsquo;purchased&rsquo; by means of points. Both sides must decide how many points they should begin with. I highly suggest beginning a campaign (a series of wargames between the same player(s)) with fifty points for each side.&rdquo; The object of the game is to destroy all the opposing units.<br/><br/>",

Miniatures or chits, marked for facing, are used to represent the spaceships. The players construct their own fleets based on lists of ships and weapon systems. The scenario sets the number of fleet points that each side starts with. Three scenarios are included in the rules.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are simultaneous, based on simple written orders. Combat occurs from the last space a unit enters. The written combat orders consist of indicating the weapon system fired and the mapsheet grid number being targeted. Damage inflicted depends on defensive equipment of the target ship (fields, screens and jammers) and the type of weapon used. Nukes and missiles caused fixed amounts of damage, while energy and projectile weapons have diminished capacity at longer ranges.<br/><br/>Statistics are given for nine types of base ships, ranging from the lowly Transport (used for scenario victory conditions) to the burly Battlestation. Ships are rated for cost, move, hits, number of shields, and number of weapons. Some types of ships can carry Fighter Squads. Ships can be equipped with three types of shields: Albedo Screens (protect against energy weapons), Intertia Fields (protect against projectile weapons), and Jammers (protect against missiles.) Weapon systems that can be purchased include Lasers, Rail Guns, Missile Launchers, Missiles, and Nuclear Missiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Card game for 5 players. Based on the 1995 SF PC Game Emperor of the Fading Suns.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In this detailed game of interplanetary struggle and conquest, each player is the leader of a Noble House who is seeking to become the Emperor. Each player starts with control of a Noble House, five random planets, five Scepters, and a War Fleet. Each Noble House has a unique bonus.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to hold the position of Regent for four consecutive turns. The first player to do so is declared Emperor. The Regent is selected by vote of the players, with each Scepter they hold being worth one vote. In addition, a player with the favor of the Church or Guilds may vote with Scepters controlled by those groups. In the case of a tie vote, no player serves as Regent that turn. Scepters can be obtained from other players by making successful attacks.<br/><br/>",

The deck includes Mission Cards, Munitions Cards, Enemy Cards, and Event Cards.<br/><br/>Mission Cards are ground targets of various Mission Point values. A player who successfully attacks the target wins the Mission Card and adds the Mission Points to his score. Enemy Cards, representing a variety of Soviet air and ground threats, are played against opposing players. Munitions Cars represent bombs, missiles, or other payload items which aid in attack or defense. Event Cards offer a variety of bonuses and can be played at various times as specified on the particular card.<br/><br/>There are also six named Pilot Cards that are not a part of the main deck. At the start of the game each player randomly selects one Pilot Card. Each pilot has a special advantage.<br/><br/>Fuel and ammo counters are used to track each plane's status. The aircraft are required to return to base to refuel and rearm. Damage can also force a plane to return to base where the damage is repaired.<br/><br/>The object is to have the most Mission Points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Victory: Shoot your opponent out of the skies.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player has five dice: a 20-sided die representing Visibility (from the aircraft), a 12-sided die representing Speed, a 10-sided die representing Maneuverability, an 8-sided die representing Firepower, and a 6-sided die representing Defense.<br/><br/>The Sopwith receives positive die roll modifiers for Visibility and Speed and the Fokker receives positive modifiers for Maneuverability and Defense. Neither aircraft has a bonus in Firepower.<br/><br/>The players roll all their dice each turn and compare them to determine a result. If the result of the dice places one of the aircraft in firing position with a higher Firepower score, the target must roll on the Damage table for a result. This ranges from destruction of the aircraft to damage which reduces the value of certain dice for that aircraft.<br/><br/>The game also includes rules for stalling (when a 1 is rolled on the maneuver die) and Ace Pilot skills.<br/><br/>",

The rules boast 3 games in one, the main game is Modern Warfare, a &quot;game that fills up a long standing demand for a war game and introduces you to our latest mechanical inventions and the rapid development of their uses as weapons of destruction in the present day war operations&quot;.  Additionally there is a wargame, called &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;, based on the old styles of warfare and finally a simple &quot;Hit and Miss&quot; game.<br/><br/>Modern Warfare uses large (1.25 inch) lead Soldiers, Aircraft, Tanks and Artillery as units in the game and they are initially placed in one of four lines (3 main lines and the reserve).<br/><br/>The main game begins with the firing of a single  artillery piece on each side for 4 turns (a spinner is spun for combat results and movement) followed by an artillery barrage (both artillery pieces fire on each side) until one side loses both their guns.  Then the winning side gets 3 more shots and moves and attacks with his air and tank units in the first line.  The other side then moves all air and tank units in the first rank.  This alternates until one side has lost all their units.<br/><br/>The winning side retires their remaining air and tanks to the reserve and the infantry then fights alone...  Terrain can be destroyed on the map (indicated by placing a red square on the destroyed item).<br/><br/>Fascinating instructions with detailed play throughs and fairly complicated rules depending on the unit type and position (line) the unit occupies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the DG website:<br/><br/>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory (NEW), aka Glory, has been moved back to new status due to an exciting development. The designer has added two new elements to the game that will make this a truly unique ACW game. First, he is adding Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game that will serve as an introductory scenario. This short campaign will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have a game that can be finished in an evening. The second element is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War. Though little combat occurs (guerrilla warfare in Kansas, etc.), the card play covers the actions inspiring events, leaders and regional positions (Border States) that affect the allegiance of states to a region and the ability of military leaders at the start of the Civil War. Crisis &amp; Compromise can be played alone or used to create alternative starting situations for Glory.<br/><br/>Glory is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War in the style of Krieg! Maps of the Eastern and Western Theaters include terrain, Strategic Objectives, roads/rail, naval zones, navigable and non-navigable rivers, cities and locales, supply centers and other features affecting the game. Counters represent the corps and armies of the war. Cards provide the strategic-political-economic direction for each side. Strategies are many and varied but the ultimate goal is to demoralize the opposing faction's population through military, economic and political victories while sustaining your own population's will to continue the fight. The players each choose a Strategy Card and an Addendum Card before each new season and may opt to play an additional card as a diplomatic response to certain events. These cards lead to new military units, leaders, and replacement steps and result in socio-economic and political events. The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations. Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight. In addition, both sides may attempt to develop and manufacture new technologies, both historical and speculative, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedoes, observation balloons, repeating rifles and Gatling guns. Both sides can introduce espionage and even sabotage, which can have many unexpected consequences, including assassination. Three maps, 352 large counters for Glory and 280 small counters for Manifest Destiny and Crisis &amp; Compromise, 220 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Happy Camper was inspired by John Conway's Game of Life. It can be played on any flat surface using any objects that can be arranged in a square grid.<br/><br/>The game is played in two phase. In the first phase players start &quot;campsites&quot; with one &quot;camper&quot; (piece) each and then take turns adding one camper to their site and one to their opponent's. When all the campers have been used the second phase starts; the last player takes just one camper and places it in the opposing campsite. (The number of campers is odd; the rules suggest 11, 13, 15, or 17.)<br/><br/>In the second phase players take turns removing a camper from their opponent's campsite and placing it in their own. The removed piece must have fewer than two or more than three neighbors, and must be placed in a space with exactly three neighbors.<br/><br/>When neither player can move the game ends and the player with the high score wins. Three scoring variants are given: in the simplest each camper is worth one point, in the others the pieces have to have numbers on them (e.g. playing cards) which determine their point values. The numbered pieces can be used face-up or face-down, with players only able to look at them when they are moved.<br/><br/>",

They have decided to organize a contest and send their naughty little house elves into an old mine to retrieve the magical golden egg of Eddenburg. The 1st elf to return to the Mine Entrance with the golden egg wins.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The hen that lays the golden eggs is protected by a giant and his body guards (a family of rock-hard ugly trolls). The giant and his bodyguards have been living in this same little mine shaft for over 300 years. Now as you can imagine the mine is really disgusting, there are germs everywhere, and not only germs but super germs. These super germs can cause diarrhea in house elves. As you can imagine it is hard for an elf to ride in the mine carts and sneak around quietly without their Pepto Bismo.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As far as combat the trolls certainly have an advantage over the elves in strength, but they are stupid and sometimes completely forget who they are and what they are. They begin to waddle and walk around in circles mumbling to themselves. If these trolls had a brain they would be really dangerous.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Another interesting aspect of trolls is that when they see an elf they drool, and when I say drool I really mean drool. Because of this it is really difficult for an elf to sneak around because they are tracking mucus around on the bottoms of their boots, not to mention it is really slippery. On the positive side when a troll captures a house elf and drools all over it, it can become very slippery and sometimes<br/>it can squirm and slip free.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Two other techniques house elves have learned that are effective against trolls. First, trolls can't stand elves that squeak and second, trolls are particularly self conscious when elves flash them.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players move around the board, using cards dealt to them. Cards are clearly marked with alternate uses, increasing the available play options. A key component is that play pieces can be coupled, allowing the top player to take control of his opponent&rsquo;s play piece(s). Other forms of interaction include trading, uncoupling, switching control, and sending an opponent back to start again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Germania broadly represents the situation in western Europe following the fall of the Roman Empire.  Each of two to five players represents one of the Germanic invaders who, pushed by the Asiatic Huns, settled in and eventually destroyed Rome.  As they attempt to consolidate and expand their holdings, a variety of invading nations threaten to overwhelm them, as they overwhelmed Rome. The game combines &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; elements with a light historical wargame.  The game uses no dice; players use cards to influence combat, and also use event cards to control non-Germanic invaders and influence other players.  Scoring occurs each century, with the last century counting much more than others.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a game of survival, of maintaining a civilization.  It is possible to win without directly attacking other players, though successful players usually directly attack another player at some point in the game.<br/><br/>Players take turns executing a variety of Actions up to a limit of six Action Points.  Some of the Actions are creating new settlers, moving pieces, and playing Event Cards.  Three or (in Standard and Advanced games) four rounds of turns are a century.  Invasions occur at the end of each Century, or they may occur because of an Event Card played by a player.  One player or another temporarily controls Invaders as they invade.  Players attempt to increase the number of settled areas, improve those areas, and, in Standard and Advanced games, build cities.  They will probably fight Invaders, and may fight one another, using Battle Cards to help resolve these fights.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During his work at the Operations Research Office, the physicist George Gamow invented a simple war game to be played by analysts. The game is played with three identical boards, one for each of the players and one for a referee.<br/>The board &hellip; represents a tank battlefield by a lattice of hexagons, &hellip; some of which are hatched to represent wooded areas of low visibility. The white hexagons represent open fields, and the size of a hexagon represents the &ldquo;radius of action&rdquo; of a tank in battle.<br/>Each player starts with ten markers representing tanks at his back line, and &ldquo;a move&rdquo; consists in displacing any number of tanks into any of the adjacent hexagons. Each player sees his board only and must infer from the play where his opponent&rsquo;s tanks are located.<br/>(from the rules)<br/><br/>Get the full game: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://grognard.com/download/games/board/tankgame.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://grognard.com/download/games/board/tankgame.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game consists of 48 cards with questions and answers on them. Start by dealing the cards in equal amounts to all players. The first player starts by asking a question from one of his cards of the player on his left. If that player answers correctly, he gets to take the card and set it aside. If he answers incorrectly, the questioner gets to take a card from that player's hand and set it to his side. If the question is answered incorrectly, the questioner gets to continue to ask other players, until all players have been asked, or the question is answered correctly. If no player gets it, the questioner gets to set that card aside. After all cards are exhausted, the player with the most cards laid aside wins.<br/><br/>",

Like Digi-Quate, it was invented by a National University of Singapore lecturer and it is game of forming mathematical equations on a square grid board. Players have hands of 10 tokens showing numbers and mathematical operators. Each turn they try to form an equation, intersecting crossword-style with equations already on the board. Covering special squares on the board gives bonus points.<br/>The feature that distinguishes Higher Digi-Quate from Digi-Quate is that it adds three dice to the game, a green D10 (numbered 0 to 9) and two red D6s (numbered 0 to 4). The board is larger and there are now bonus squares with pictures of a green D10, a red D6 and two red D6s. Placing an equation that covers these dice bonus squares allows the player to roll the dice and their score may be multiplied; there's also a small risk that the score may be multiplied by zero.<br/><br/>Digi-Quate is a game invented by a lecturer from the National University of Singapore.

        "description": "From 1790 to 1815 Europe was at war with itself and dragged most of the rest of the world with it. The Napoleonic Wars are Earth&rsquo;s first true World War. England and France had colonies all around the planet. Many of the other nations entered the fray. Most note worthy was the War of 1812, the USA v Great Britain.<br/><br/>SQP is a chance for players to take one of the armies of the<br/>combatants into one of the large battles that denoted combat for that period. Experienced players can easily maneuver 40 or more battalions. The rules are historical and designed for a medium degree of difficulty. Veteran gamers will feel comfortable after a walk through. Players new to gaming will be able to compete after their first game.<br/><br/>SQP is designed for two to six players to enjoy a three hour game.<br/><br/>Armies list for the 17 major European nation, the Ottomans and<br/>Americans are included.<br/><br/>",

It is played with 4 loaded (8-sided) dice called Quotes which are designed to give the effect of a constantly changing market. The black Quotes are weighted so they usually come up with low numbers and the whole Quotes are weighted so they usually come up with high numbers.  Only 2 Quotes are used at a time so that a market can be low (both black), mixed (a black and a white), or high (both white).  Object if ge game is to buy stock at a low price, hold it for awhile, and sell it at a higher price.  The game ends when one player doubles his money or when someone goes broke.

Build a path that leads to the longest rows of shells to get massive points. Use your branches and curves, build over other cards to cut-off the others path. With the right card you can even dig-out other cards. Place your pawn wisely to get double score. If you manage to connect to paths together, you may even get the other player's score. With three cards on hand you can plan your path carefully, but still the other players may manipulate your path. Also take care not to concentrate on certain kinds of shells only, since the lower scored-shells also count at the end. The war goes off at the middle of the gameboard, it's getting crowded there! Will you stay cool?<br/><br/>Shellz is a tricky building-game. You sometimes have to &quot;think around the corner&quot;. Don't let the beautiful shells distract you - it's a tough game for big brains.<br/><br/>For 2 to 4 players Ages 10 and up, 30 - 45 minutes playing time. English instructions included.<br/><br/>",

When you are unable to play on existing family lines, they must start new ones, but only lines of 4 or more cards will score points.

        "description": "Background from the instructions:  The OUTDOORSMAN GAME was created by avid sportsman in a sparsely populated, wildlife rich area of Eastern Oregon.  When he discovered that many of his junior high math students shared his enthusiasm for outdoor activities, he came up with a way to make statistics and probability more interesting to them.  Drawing on his own experiences afield and information from fish and game departments, he developed a game that would involve fishing and hunting while teaching certain mathematical concepts.  When people kept insisting that the game  was too much fun to confine to the classroom, the idea was born of developing an activity that would challenge and entertain sportsmen when time, weather, or resources prohibited an excursion afield.  The OUTDOORSMAN GAME is the result of those efforts.  In the game, the species of fish, fowl, and big game, and the seasons and areas in which they are pursued, closely follow the actual events as they occur in Eastern Oregon.  We trust you will find the OUTDOORSMAN GAME to an enjoyable and entertaining activity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a dice game in the Onsworld Jackpot Dice series (the other's being Black Jack, Crossword, Liar Poker and Lucky Fortune Dice).<br/><br/>Players are dealt a card which shows six 2-digit numbers. They put counters into a pot which they are vying for. The only digits which appear on the cards are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9. On their turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice and with the two numbers rolled, forms a 2-digit number. For this purpose, the 6 can also be used as a nine. So, rolling a 1 and a 6, the player can form 16, 19, 61 or 91. All players check their card and if they have the 2-digit number, they can cover it with a counter. The player who first covers all the six numbers on his card wins the pot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a dice-driven stock speculation game with an unusual scoring mechanism. There are three decks of cards: red Bear cards, blue Bull cards and white Speculation cards. All three piles are placed face down on the board, along with a pile of stock certificates, each bearing the name of a different major company and a $1,000 face value. Each player puts $100 to start in the Broker space.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll 2D6. On a 3-6, they draw a Bear card. On a 7-11, they draw a Bull card. Either variety may offer an opportunity to take a Speculation card. On a 2 or 12, they collect all cash and stock in the Broker space, and each player then pays another $100 into the space.<br/><br/>While some cards call for cash or stock to be paid to or from the Broker or other players, most provide a market up or down number. This does not affect the value of any stock, however. Each player has a scorecard with a metal clip that starts at zero and can move from -20 to +20. Each time the player's market hits +13 on the way up and +20, he draws a free stock certificate. He loses the same at -13 and -20. The winner of the game is the first to accumulate $7,500 in cash and stock value.<br/><br/>This Depression-era game has a clear upward bias: players draw Bear cards only 39% of the time, with the remaining rolls being positive; and 60% of the Speculation cards are positive. As the slogan on the game's rules puts it: &quot;Big Winners, Big Losses, but Losses are Quickly Regained&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

(Since the Russian alphabet has 33 letters, in the original Russian version there are two of each letter except Ъ and Ь of which there are one each.)  In addition each piece has a numeric score depending on the rarity of its letter, and a suit (red, yellow, green or blue).<br/><br/>",

In came in a colorfully illustrated 4.5 x 7.5 inch box.

A Complete and Unobjectionable Substitute for, and Improvement Upon Dice, Teetotums, &amp;c. It's various uses. 1st--As a substitute for Dice, spin the Arrows, and play with the numbers at the points of both Arrows. 2d--As a substitute for Teetotums, use the number at the point of the black Arrow only. NOTE--Should an Arrow stop on a line, both Arrows should be spun again.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A Thrill on Every Play. New Thrills in Every Game. Easy to Play. Realistic Football for Real Fans.&quot;<br/><br/>This vintage football card game was originally released in the mid-twenties. A 1940 edition, marked on the box cover as the &quot;New Collegiate Edition&quot;, was used to prepare the following description. The limited information located regarding the twenties edition indicates that it may have been self-published, but otherwise it is believed to be similar to the later edition.<br/><br/>The 1940 New Collegiate Edition consists of a box, a 16 3/4 x 9 3/4 inch football-field board (a box bottom insert), 55 Offensive cards, 55 Defensive cards, individual card boxes for these two sets of cards, 29 Time-Out cards, a metal football marker, a cardboard &quot;10-Yard Marker&quot; and the rules.  Note that there are are tracks on the board for keeping track of the four quarters and four downs, so there may have been additional markers to place on these tracks.<br/><br/>The board depicts a 100-yard football field, marked in one yard increments. The 10-Yard marker is used to determine when enough yardage has been gained for a first down. The metal ball is used to mark the field position of the ball. Movement of the ball up and down the field is determined by the Offensive and Defensive cards.<br/><br/>The 1925 set does not contain Time-Out cards, or mention of time-outs in the rules.  The separate board does not have any tracks for quarters or downs.  In addition to the Rules, it includes four pages of &quot;Help for the Novice&quot;, a summary of the current NCAA football rules.<br/><br/>",

Essentially applying the mechanics of the game, Snap, the game uses 60 cards (4 each of 15 designs) with illustrations of grotesque and pitiful creatures that have succumbed to the evils of drug abuse. Each card comes with a little rhyme detailing the sad fate of its character - for example:<br/><br/>MAK THE RABBIT<br/>&quot;I wish you peace&quot; said Mak the rabbit.<br/>His friends gave him drugs,<br/>Now he can't kick the habit.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt out evenly to each player and players take turns to reveal a card from their stack. When two cards of the same design are seen, the first player to shout &quot;NABBED!&quot; gets to keep both stacks of upturned cards adding all of them face down to the bottom of his/her stack.<br/><br/>The name of the agency providing the concept and design of the game was WORK - no individual designer was indentified. The illustrations are credited to Theseus Chan and the rhymes to Jim Aitchison.<br/><br/>The Partnership for a Drug Free Singapore programme began earlier in 2002 and featured the characters in a series of cartoons with anti-drug rhymes. The card game was published in 2004 and was distributed in schools.<br/><br/>",

SAILS was played tested using 1 to 6 ships per player, games lasting 20 minutes to three hours, table sizes ranging from 3'x3' for 2 players to a 4'x8' for 4 players.<br/><br/>These rules were written using the KISS method: Keep It Short and Simple.

But making money should not be too hard, this is the busiest port in the world.<br/><br/>The Port Singapore board is divided into bays. Next to the board lie the ships that need to be loaded. Each ship has a hold that needs to line up with one of your bays before you can get your grunts to load the goods (barrels).  Along the back of the board is a track on which 4 action cubes sit.  On your turn you pick up one of the cubes, do the action, then slide all the cubes forward putting your cube at the end.  Cubes usually have a cost involved in choosing them, but they get cheaper the farther they move down from the top of the track.  The actions on the faces vary from cube to cube, you may only take the action shown on the top face of the cube when you choose it.<br/><br/>The cubes contain actions like:<br/><br/>    Heave ho.  Pull a ship along the wharf or send full ships off and get new ships to load. Good for annoying players who may be about to load or bringing a ship to your warehouse bay.<br/>    Union meeting.  Shuffle you grunts around the wharf and roll one of the action cubes for a random result. <br/>    Do business.  This gets goods in your ware house to load or lets you hire grunts to do your loading.<br/>    Load a ship. Move one load per grunt into a ship's hold opposite to your warehouses.<br/>    Take a bribe.  Helps you get things done.<br/>    The Payoff.  Pay one of your opponent's grunts to simply go home for the day.<br/>    Brawl.  Cause a ruckus in the bay next to one of your bays, good for disrupting opponents.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when the barrels in the supply run low (depending on the number of players).  The player who has made the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Africa, Near East) from the fall of the Roman Empire through the Mongol invasion, 406-1250 AD.<br/><br/>Players control several nations (Britannia-like) with differing objectives.<br/><br/>There are two versions using the same map, one using picture-dice combat, 6 turns, 90 minutes, one more detailed and using battle cards (no dice), 11 turns, up to 180 minutes.<br/><br/>In both cases the point scoring is much simplified from Britannia--one 8.5 by 11 inch sheet shows all scoring and appearance, no &quot;nation cards&quot; needed.<br/><br/>",
