You are not only responsible for adding coaches of the colour assigned to you, but to also complete the train as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>A short train building game for two, consisting of only 19 cards.  The winner of the game is the person with the most valuable coach segment in the color they are responsible for. Train coaches are worth different points based on their class, and coaches can only be added to coaches on the train if they have the same class or colour, where first class passenger coaches cannot be added directly to third class coaches, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Players face a simple choice on each turn: Take a train coach card in their hand, or add a coach coach from their hand to the train. But beware - coaches not placed at the end of the game counts against your score.<br/><br/>",

The game consists solely of ten tunnel cards that each bear earthworms in their paths, and players take turns placing these in order to get their mole to the worms.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game, two cards are placed and one worm is attached to every worm-sign. The active player places a new card &mdash; every card is printed on front and back with different tunnels &mdash; and attaches a worm again. Then he moves his mole as far as possible, taking every worm on the way, but sometimes it's better to move not so far in order to have an advantage for his next turn.<br/><br/>When all ten cards have been placed, the second phase of the game starts. Now the active player takes one already-placed card without a mole, removes all remaining worms to the storage, then places it again, attaching worms again, too. In the second phase, players have the opportunity to enter the connecting tunnels of the other players.<br/><br/>The player who has found the most worms at the end of the day is hailed as the greatest earthworm hunter.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the cards and deal them face down to each player, so that each player has approximately the same number of cards. Don&rsquo;t look at your cards, but place them face down in a deck in front of you. Then you continue in a clockwise direction. When it&rsquo;s your turn, draw the top card from your deck. Reveal it by turning it away from you, so that you are not the first one to see it. That way, no one can accuse you of cheating! Place it in the middle of the table. Then each take it in turns to place your card on top of the card previously laid. Continue doing this until a card demands an action. Tip: the faster you turn over your cards, one after the other, the more fun it becomes.<br/><br/>Which cards demand which actions?<br/><br/>Pasta: <br/>As long as pasta appears, nothing happens. The sort makes no difference whatsoever. The neighbour on your left plays the next card.<br/><br/>Re: As soon as one of the four Kings turns up, salute him very quickly. Move your flat hand to your forehead and touch it with your fingertips. It makes no difference whether you use your right or left hand.<br/><br/>Signorina:<br/>As soon as one of the four Ladies appears, quickly call out &ldquo;Buongiorno, Signorina&rdquo; (pronounced Buonchorno Sinnjorina).<br/><br/>Mandriano:<br/>As soon as one of the four Cowherds appears, quickly blow a kiss. To do this, simulate a kiss on your fingertips and symbolically blow it away.<br/><br/>Cavallo:<br/>As soon as one of the four Horses turns up, like lightning, bang your flat hand down on the card(s) in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>This is how the game ends:<br/>The game ends as soon as one of you has no more cards left. Have you laid your last card in the middle of the table? Then you&rsquo;ve almost won. But Attenzione: if instead of showing pasta, it demands an action, then you must carry this out quickly and correctly. Therefore, make an effort so that you don&rsquo;t have to take all the cards from the middle of the table. Did everything go well? Complimenti &ndash; you have won!<br/><br/>",

After choosing the options, start the game.<br/><br/>Individual mode: The first question appears on the screen. For example: words beginning with &quot;A&quot; and containing the letter &quot;N&quot;. From that time it begins to count time (which leads the device). The player with the device in hand says a word with those conditions, and if you do, the device passes to the next player quickly, which should be another word that has not been said already. When the time expires, an alarm sounds and the player with the device on hand at the time (in this moment), is eliminated. New question appears on the screen, repeating the same cycle with the players that are left. The goal is not to be eliminated, as when only one player is the winner.<br/><br/>Team play is quite different. The question appears on the screen, and each of the teams will discuss among its members the number of words that are able to say with those conditions, in 60 seconds. It's like an auction. The team that makes the best bet, will play the first round of 60 sec. and each of the team members will be saying a word and pressed his team number on the device (1 or 2) so that it takes account at the end of 60 seconds. If successful you will get the first point, otherwise, the point is for the other team. Then comes another round of 60 seconds. with new question and following the same mechanics.<br/><br/>When starting the game will have agreed how many rounds will be played or how long the game. Once completed, the device itself will tell how many points each team leads, and whoever has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Therefore, a person who had ever played Monopoly, will quickly adapt to the rules of Business 2000.<br/><br/>Business 2000 is an economic strategy that contributes to the development of logic and observation, responsibility for decision making and ability to predict results.<br/><br/>It is a roll-and-move game, where the participants throw the dice and walk around the perimeter of the playing field. They buy or sell various properties, companies and even entire industries. The players can also develop their property.<br/><br/>The players have the right to trade and negotiate with each other at any time. The ultimate goal is to drive opponents into bankruptcy. The main differences from the Monopoly series are special fields and action cards, that have specific rules, namely the &quot;Casino&quot; and &quot;Hippodrome&quot; fields and the &quot;Shares&quot; special action cards, that increase a player's income every turn.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first person to get 55 points of minerals, however no one has said you need to dig the minerals yourself you could always try to steal it from the other unfortunate miners, will you be a honest hard-worker miner or you would choose the path of betrayal and deception.<br/><br/>Game mechanism:<br/>The game consists of 49 mine shaft tiles, which on clear side has a mineral picture and a corresponding dice roll to extract that mineral on the collapsed side there is a die indication a +3 for dice roll for cleaning the rubble's. There are four different minerals; Diamond, gold, silver and bronze, each need a different dice rolls for successful extraction. Also there is only one tile with Diamond and it is always placed in the middle of the board.<br/>After placing the Diamond tile on the middle faced down, the other tiles goes randomly around that which will create a big square. Now the four entrances will be placed to the side of the fourth tile from each side. <br/>Players decides on which color they want to play and throw dice to see who goes first, the first player puts his token on any entrance he likes, clockwise the other do the same, they could pick an entrance which already has occupied by another player.  <br/>The first play will start the game, he would have two actions each round which could be; removing the rubbles (+3 dice), moving on tile (two for two actions), mining the tile for the valuable minerals (dice varies) and destroying the tile which he is on (+3 dice). <br/>The player could acquire the mineral depicted on the tile by a successful roll and take corresponding token from the pool, also after extraction a depleted sign is needed to be placed on the tile. Each mineral types has different winning score, whoever reaches 55 is the winner.<br/>Another strategic action is to destroy the tile which will force the occupant on the tile and adjusting tiles (no diagonally) to escape. Anyone except the person who caused the cave-in will drop the last mineral they have mined on effected tile and they also have two moves to escape to safety (open tile), if they failed to move to safety with in two moves than they would die and they could re-spawn from any tile they like. The destroyed tile will flip to collapse side and the depleted signs will be removed from those tiles. <br/>The game will proceeds until someone reaches 55 points by any means and he will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of each week players buy stalls, and then take it in turns to roll for customers at the market. Each stall activates on a particular dice roll, giving the owner an income, and the player who rolls must select which particular stall that this customer buys from. If you're the only player with a stall that activates on a 10, then you might get a payout even on other players' turns!<br/><br/>Owning some stalls allows a player to re-roll or flip one of the dice, giving them much more of a chance to activate their high-profit jewelry or luxury watch stall... while some other stalls activate every time someone rolls their number, regardless of whose turn it is. Players must pick the best combination of stalls with their limited workforce to increase their chances of earning the most money by the end of market season.<br/><br/>Cinnamon Rolls is a single-sheet game that relies only on a few items most gamers will already have around the house, and is intended to be printed on the inside face of Christmas cards for gamers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 21st century, a coalition of wealthy governments, troubled by the continued destruction of earth's natural habitats, put together a team of elite astronauts to begin the first human settlement on Mars. Surviving Mars: The First Mission, is a game about those first few astronauts and how they managed to create the first settlement on Mars almost a century ago.<br/><br/>In this game, players must work together to construct a predesigned and prefabricated habitat consisting of a biosphere, a sustainable crop system and a number research laboratories. Additionally, players must complete a number of critical life supporting research tasks in order to ready the habitation system and the Martian terrain for the first wave of humans. The game can be played as a single experience, or series of episodes where player continue further the mission, and pick up where the last game left off.<br/><br/>This game is a cooperative (or solo) worker placement, dice rolling and deck building experience, that complement the push-your-luck feel of dice with the ever growing stability of deck building. Player cooperative choose teams of two astronauts (each with their won specialty) to complete missions over a series of episodes. Players take on the role of one of four characters; Biologist, Engineer, Researcher, or Commander. (An expansion is still in development that will allow a 5th character, the Medic.)<br/><br/>Each round players must cooperatively make both tactical and strategic decision with an overwhelming amount of unknowns.  A successful Martian settlement means, players must strategically balance a number of risks: the natural risks of the Martian terrain and extreme Martian temperatures; solar radiation and sandstorms; the immediately fatal risks of damage to their life support systems or habitat; and, or course, starvation. All this while still maintaining the state of mental and physical health necessary to construct the full habitat before the next wave of humans arrives!<br/><br/>Can you survive the first mission to Mars?<br/><br/>description from the publisher:<br/><br/>",

The first edition (released on Kickstarter) includes 72-cards, a 54-card main game plus an 18 card expansion. All illustrations and design elements were produced in pen and ink and hand-painted with watercolor.<br/><br/>The goal of Zen Squire is to collect 1,000 points. Each player begins the game with five cards, drawing one card and playing one card each turn. Cards are played into the area directly in front of each player, this area is your Castle, the total sum of which is your score. Diplomat cards contain positive or negative points. Any player can play Diplomat cards to any Castle. Once your Castle totals to 1,000 points, you win the game.<br/><br/>Challenger and Defender cards contain actions, which can be played to the Discard pile in order for their action to occur. Actions may allow players to draw additional cards, steal cards from opponents, or even swap Castles! Rulers are played to any Castle and pair with a Diplomat card already in that Castle. Rulers cannot be removed by Challenger or Defender cards. Multiple Ruler cards can be paired with the same Diplomat card. Once paired with a Diplomat, Rulers may double that card's points, change a negative value to a positive value, or make that card immune to all actions.<br/><br/>",

They are very busy with the great job of collecting pollen and nectar. Bees are working hard, humming from dawn till sunset while mixing pollen from various flowers. This is a very important action for plants and is called pollination. Plants would remain fruitless without pollination. In their hairy feet bees are carrying pollen to the beehives, where they continue working to produce sweet honey. It is not an easy job, though! Let's help the bees and fly up!<br/><br/>The game helps children to develop counting skills up to 10, train attention, fine motory movements and coordination, promotes ecological education, teaches to distinguish colours and sizes of objects.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In the game you roll with a die to move your bee from flower to flower. If the color of your bee matches the color of the flower you can take 1 or 2 point chips depending on the size of the flower. The point chips are puzzle pieces you can attach to your hive. As soon as the hive of one of the players is finished the other players get 3 more tries and the game is over. Then turn over your hive and count the points on the back of the point chips. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Ritual is a strategic tile-laying game of magical dominance for two to five players. In Ritual you take on the role of a powerful wizard joining with other wizards to perform an intricate ritual of magic. Being a wizard, you must take this opportunity to prove once and for all that YOU are the best wizard by having the most influence over the ritual at its completion.<br/><br/>At its heart Ritual is about three things: tiles, runes and influence. Being a tile-laying game, Ritual&rsquo;s core mechanic revolves around drawing hexagonal tiles one at a time from a common pool known as the ley line and placing them onto the scroll that serves as the board.<br/><br/>Each tile has three parts know as rune pieces. Throughout the game players try to match up identical rune pieces in groups of three known as runes. Runes players create can be activated to cause powerful effects capable of reshaping the board, but such power comes at a cost: influence. Each player gets a set of colored cubes known as influence cubes. These cubes are not only used to activate runes, but also to determine where you can play on the scroll and to tally your final score. Clever use of tiles, runes and influence is essential to winning a game of Ritual.<br/><br/>Ritual&rsquo;s simple gameplay, deep strategy and beautiful presentation make it a fun game for beginners and experienced board-gamers alike.<br/><br/>",

Each adventurer has a special power. A round starts with a random event and then players take it in turns rolling 6 dice, hoping to collect gold (useful for buying weapons, equipment, banners or curses), swords (for attacking opponents), hearts (for healing the damage) and half-banners (basically two of these = one victory point but one on its own is useless) There is also a blank side and a wildcard side. Players have one chance to re-roll any dice they don't like. Control of the realm enables players to gather more resources but also makes them vulnerable to attack. There can only ever be one player in the realm. There are two versions of the game: an elimination version (win by collecting 10 banners or eliminating everyone else) and a points version (players who lose all their life lose half their resources and re-spawn).<br/><br/>",

You play as ghosts possessing a group of kids in a cabin in the woods, trying to figure out how you died by piecing together your fragmented memories.<br/><br/>Play is started by shuffling the 26 double-sided word fragment cards (Fewer cards can be used for a faster game). Each player is dealt one card (they can flip the card to the other side at any time). One card is placed in the middle of the table. Any player may start play. The first player places the card from their hand onto the tableau so that it forms a word using one or more letters from the card already in the tableau. The player may put the card on top of the card already on the table, or slide the card underneath, as long as the card on the table is not shuffled around. When the first player has formed a word, they draw a word fragment card from the pile and point to another player. The player pointed to must start to tell the story of the death of the ghosts from the ghosts&rsquo; point of view, incorporating the word that was just made. For example, if the first player formed the word &ldquo;angst,&rdquo; the player they pointed to could say: &ldquo;The last thing I remember is a feeling of angst as I slumped through the halls.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Any player may go next by adding their card to the growing tableau to make a new word and pointing to a player to continue the story (as long as a player does not make a word twice in a row). Play continues until all the cards in the deck and players' hands are gone. The last person to make a word points to the player who will bring the story to a satisfactory close in which &quot;Everyone dies!&quot;<br/><br/>The inspiration behind the game is &quot;anyone can be a storyteller!&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Evolve is a competitive game that involves aspects of hand management, tactical decision making and a take-that style of sabotage.<br/><br/>In the game, players need to establish evolutionary links to their current life form, before being able to progress to the subsequent level of organism. Many organisms and evolutionary links have additional bonuses or dual uses, so players are often required to make decisions about when to play cards, or when to keep them in hand. Additionally, &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; cards can also be used to increase the development of your organism, or to hinder players.<br/><br/>During each turn, players perform 6 moves, where they can choose to pick-up, discard or play cards (each action costs 1 move).

        "description": "What&rsquo;s the Dirty Squad? <br/>The Dirty Squad is a bunch of dirty cops within the precinct, recruited by the Mafia.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of their recruitment? <br/>A number of killers have been brought to the station for questioning, whom they must covertly help escape.<br/><br/>How do they do this?<br/>The victim&rsquo;s friends and family members, innocent bystanders, witnesses, and accomplices have been summoned to the station as well. Using them as cover, the cops must bluff the killers out. They&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if it means using every dirty move in the book to do so.<br/><br/>What do they get for this work they're doing?<br/>The dirtiest cop &mdash; the one who lets the most number of killers escape, wins the game by becoming the Squad&rsquo;s undisputed leader and the Mafia&rsquo;s highest-paid Inside Man. A reputed spot that can only be won by playing dirty!<br/><br/>Test your skills in this underhanded bluffing card game and find out if you've got what it takes to out-bluff and outsmart the others and become the undisputed leader of your Squad!<br/><br/>What's in the box:<br/>There are 122 cards &mdash; a mix of Character Cards and Power Cards:<br/>25 Killers, 12 Accomplices, 12 Family Members, 12 Witnesses, 12 Victim&rsquo;s Friends, 12 Innocent Bystanders, 2 Character Impersonators + 35 Power Cards + 70 medal tokens.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The aim of the game: <br/>To release the most number of killers from your hand.&nbsp;<br/><br/>How to Play: <br/>You start by shuffling the deck of cards thoroughly and dealing 7 cards to each player, along with 3 medal tokens.&nbsp;<br/><br/>You have to bluff the killers out of your hand, so when you want to let go of killers, they must be disguised as any of the other characters. You must never announce the fact that you are releasing a killer.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Hand Example: you have 2 killers, 2 family members, 1 innocent bystander and 2 power cards in your hand, and in your first turn you want to release killers:<br/>Place one or both of the Killer Cards face down and announce ANY OTHER character. (Say: 2 Family Members)<br/>Only you know that the two cards are NOT Family Members but the others have to gauge whether you are bluffing or telling the truth<br/>The player to your immediate left gets to decide whether he would like to open the cards and check them, or trust you and let them pass. If he passes it goes to the next player and the decision falls upon him. If no one checks your cards they go face down in your Released Pile. No one knows what cards have gone except you<br/><br/>If a player decides to check your cards: in this case, since you did bluff, you have to give 3 medal tokens to that player. That player &lsquo;catches&rsquo; the killers you were trying to help escape and keeps them in his custody.<br/><br/>Custody: is when a player catches another player&rsquo;s killers and keeps them face UP in front of them. This does not bode well for you, since, all the dirty cops are looking to help escape the most number of players. And when you get caught, it costs you more than just your pride<br/><br/>But: if you haven&rsquo;t bluffed and a player checks your cards, then, they must give you 3 medal tokens for wrongful doubt, and those cards go face down in your Released Pile. Draw back to 7 cards in hand at the end of your turn.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Securing Killers: Coming back to caught killers. These killers can be stolen by any of the players, so they must be secured. You can do so by placing up to 4 medal tokens on them. To steal a killer is harder now because the player will have to match the number of tokens on the killer to be able to steal it unless he has a Power Card that allows him to steal without having to give to give tokens.&nbsp;<br/><br/>To release killers from your custody, you can do 1 of 2 things:&nbsp;<br/>Give 5 medal tokens and close the killer, or, use the Power Card that allows you to release the killer without having to give any tokens at all&nbsp;<br/><br/>The Power Cards play an important role in the game too. Each Power Card has its description on the card itself. Please read through the cards to understand them better. But, with those in play, the game keeps changing until the very end.&nbsp;<br/><br/>So, on your turn, you do one of the following:<br/>Take 3 medal tokens (caps at 8. If you have 8 in hand you cannot take more)<br/>Play character cards&nbsp;<br/>Play action cards&nbsp;<br/>Release killers&nbsp;<br/><br/>The game ends when:&nbsp;<br/>When there are no playable cards in any player&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>The player to have the most number of killers in their released pile is the winner.&nbsp;<br/>But know this, any killers left in hand cancel out 1 killer from the closed pile. So make sure you let go of all the killer from your hand.&nbsp;<br/><br/>If there&rsquo;s a tie, then if any player has open killers in their custody wins&nbsp;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bones of the Caribbean is a small format, competitive game for 2-5 players in which you play as pirates vying for the most reputation by raiding islands, burying treasure, stealing plunder, navigating storms, and attacking rivals. The ultimate scourge takes the prize of the seas.<br/><br/>The game uses &quot;take that&quot; and press-your-luck mechanisms. You roll to take actions, but pressing your luck might cause you to get scurvy. Every result allows you to interact with another player in some fashion, whether you're digging up a rival's treasure, attacking their ship or island, plundering the sea, causing storms to damage other ships, or creating a mutiny on someone's ship. Along the way, you'll score points for building ships, hiring a crew, taking plunder, burying treasure, and winning combat.<br/><br/>",

Peregrinate through the board&rsquo;s five habitats&mdash;the Backyard, the Desert, the Woodland, the Wetland, and the Shores&mdash;and track each bird you spot by collecting the tokens for each space you land on and placing the token on your birder's journal. Roll the die to see how many spaces you move along the outer loop (the habitat loop).<br/><br/>Along the way, you&rsquo;ll discover how to be a good bird steward. But watch out&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need to dodge storms, avoid falling in a river, and beware of birds that poop on your head (it happens). All of these will negatively impact your turn, in some cases sending you backward or in other cases making you put a token back, and some will have a global impact on all players.<br/><br/>The game has three different levels to play at, from standard to more difficult. Once you spot the required number of birds, which is determined at the beginning of the game, then the game becomes a race to the finish. Turn up one of the four trails to the Bird Sanctuary and be the first to reach the end and you&rsquo;ll rule the roost!<br/><br/>",

The title is derived from two kanji words: 論理 (logic) which means in this game you can win by precise deduction, and 心理 (psychology) which means in this game you can win by bluffing as well. So the title implies this is a game of deduction vs. bluffing.<br/><br/>A round consists of two phases: mustering phase and battle phase.<br/><br/>During the mustering phase, players draft revealed soldier cards to form their hand of five cards each.<br/><br/>A battle phase consists of five battles. During a battle, the attacker places a card face-down from their hand. The backside of the placed card has partial information about the soldier's identity. The defender looks at it, and places a card from their hand. Then they reveal both cards.<br/><br/>A soldier card has its soldier type and power value printed on it. If both players have played a soldier of the same type, the soldier with the lower value wins the battle. Otherwise one with the higher value wins the battle, but some types get a bonus power against a certain type.<br/><br/>A new round begins after the fifth battle. When a plyer has won total of six battles, that player immediately wins the game.<br/><br/>Players know the identity of some cards their opponent has drafted, and the partial information is printed on backside of each card, which means defender can predict which card attacker has played. But there's some chance of attacker's bluff if carefully drafted. You should consider your opponent's intention to win the game.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>ラウンドの前半では場に公開されているカードを順番に獲得して自分の手札を構築し、後半では１枚ずつ使用することで相手と勝負を行います。<br/>各ラウンド５回勝負を行い、先に一定数の勝利をおさめることでゲームに勝利します。<br/>カードごとの相性による修正や同種衝突による強弱逆転によりどのカードをいつ使うかの判断が、またカードウラ面により一部情報がわかるのでそれを元に最適解を見つける要素があります。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

The Japanese title translates more closely as 'Galactic Powers' and the designer uses 'Galapa' for short.<br/><br/>Players develop planets by constructing facilities, improving technology, and developing spacecraft. Victory points can be earned through construction of the orbit elevator, the status of spacecraft development, and the population settled.<br/><br/>The game of space exploration wars uses worker placement with an rondel action track. When the game starts, players focus on infrastructure development, such as building facilities on the home planet and developing and strengthening spacecraft while advancing technology. Then, players build a subspace transfer device and move to an unexplored planet to pursue exploration. However, this involves the dangers of space pirates.<br/><br/>Discovering planets and building orbital elevators can also give you victory points, but the most points come from the population of settlers on exoplanets. The most settlers on the planet will be awarded the total number of facilities built on the planet as victory points.<br/><br/>But runners-up will be given the final total population of that planet as victory points. This means players must balance the development of facilities with the growth of the settlements. Produce too many settlers against facilities and the other players gain. Judging this expansion is important and the designer says it gives the game high replayability.<br/><br/>The game was released at Game Market in Spring 2019. The designer found some errata in the rulebook, and gave out a free card to fix an error on one card.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Each group moves around the board and can purchase items to increase their strength and then challenge opponents to combat. Each fight is resolved usually by rolling dice.<br/><br/>The winning faction is the one that dominates the most areas or defeats all groups of the enemy faction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

An armored brigade drove up Route 9 from near Khe Sanh and was supported by troops airlifted to six landing zones.<br/><br/>The map (assembled from four sections) covers the region along Route 9 from the Ho Chi Minh trail in the northwest to some way east of Aloui in the southeast. The scale is approximately 800 yards per hex. There are 369 uncut counters.<br/><br/>There are 16 three-day turns. The main ARVN objectives are Aloui and Tchepone.<br/><br/>One feature of the game is the initiative roll beginning each turn, which is weighed by modifiers such as the ARVN body count. Only the side winning the roll gets a combat phase. In addition, if the ARVN wins the roll they get to conduct air strikes, and if the NVA wins they get to conduct an artillery barrage. The air strikes need to be planned and then are affected by weather.<br/><br/>A wrinkle in the combat system is the use of attack points; the NVA starts the game with 70 and the ARVN with only 40, though the NVA needs to spend theirs for artillery barrages and the air strikes are free.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2042. Due to The Unfathomable Events of 2037, madness reigns across the cruise industry. The four remaining cruise lines now pursue market share through warfare. As a result, cruises are more popular than ever, because everyone is nuts (also due to The Unfathomable Events of 2037).<br/><br/>The &quot;cruise&quot; part: as the Admiral (formerly CEO) of a cruise line, you must send out your fleet of ships to navigate the treacherous waters of the Caribbean, dock at various tourist traps, and return to your home port. The &quot;bruise&quot; part: rival cruise lines are out to destroy your fleet via missiles, torpedoes, and maniacal passengers that live to raid other ships. The Admiral who finds the best balance between cruising and bruising will win.<br/><br/>Bruise Cruise is a hexagonal map-based, turn-taking strategy game with relatively simple rules that lead to complex outcomes.<br/><br/>2-4 players control a fleet of up to six ships using a hand of multi-use cards. 82 Action cards allow each player to sail, dock at ports, or acquire weapons or life preservers (the currency of 2042; they literally preserve your life). 18 &ldquo;Unfathomable&rdquo; cards allow players to do truly Unfathomable things, such as warping their ships to the Shady Offshore Bank or Warlord Island.<br/><br/>(Each Action card also features flavor text that teaches you strange and amusing facts about the ports and countries you&rsquo;ll visit during game play.)<br/><br/>Victory points are scored for docking ships at ports, firing weapons at your competitors, and returning ships to their home port after they have completed their cruises. The game ends when the cards run out, though there are a few endgame rules that make the end particularly intriguing and encourage taking big risks.<br/><br/>A 2-player game between experienced players will take about 30 to 40 minutes. A 3- or 4-player game will take between 50 and 80 minutes.  Recommended for players aged 14 and up, though 11-13 year-olds with board game familiarity will do just fine.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Well, what did you want from a horror magazine publisher anyway? Too bad Vampirella doesn't appear on this one - she's so... toothsome.<br/><br/>This is one of five somewhat tongue-in-cheek horror games from Warren magazines (publishers of Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella) featuring campy 70's horror boardgame fun. The Werewolf! game was created by Bill DuBay and appeared in Creepy magazine issue #57 (November 1973) and Eerie #52 (November 1973) inside the magazine covers to cut out and play, and separately as a bundle of &quot;Warren Monster Madness&quot; games by mail order (#2661 for $2.50).

        "description": "You are a lanista, a gladiator school manager and trainer, aiming to become the most prestigious of Rome.<br/><br/>The game turn plays in four phases: Recruitment, during which you buy gladiator slaves from the market; Contract Negotiation, during which you try to place your gladiators in spectacles; Combat, during which you have your gladiators fight each other; and Healing and Resting, during which prestige may be earned from happy accidents.<br/><br/>The game is based on extensive historical research. The gladiator names are authentic, as well as the equipment sets and pairings.<br/><br/>Recruitment: On the market are gladiators. Each has a cost in gold and an equipment set (provocator, thrace, retiary, etc.). Some have special abilities.<br/>Contract Negotiations: Various cities have gladiatorial games for tender. They rake in a certain amount of money and fame but require specific gladiator teams.<br/>Combat: Each lanista organizes one or more fights between their own gladiators. Random draws determine the outcomes. Players can manipulate the odds in various ways.<br/>Healing &amp; Resting: If a gladiator physical integrity is compromised, he must be healed...or there can be an accident that yields prestige.<br/><br/>Random draws use a bag loaded with tokens of various colours. Players manipulate the token counts to influence the odds. This matches electoral systems used in Antiquity.<br/><br/>Lanista is accessible and educational; it will please newbies and grognards, be they inclined to compete or to manage.<br/><br/>",

Each player will bet their resource cards (Wheat, Calf, Vineyard and Producer) in the betting board. After betting their cards and throwing the die, the player will claim the corresponding prizes in tokens, and place them in their resource board.<br/><br/>Before ending their turn, they can trade again tokens for more elaborated resources using the cards in their hands, or sell tokens to the bank to get more money.<br/><br/>Once all players have finished betting, all cards are returned to the deck. The obtained tokens remain in their resource boards. A new round starts and 5 cards are dealed to each player.<br/><br/>",

To win the game all you have to do is collect five Boozles of the same color by drawing them and stealing them from other players. Outmaneuver your friends and force them to drink while you steal their precious Boozles!<br/><br/>Each player has the same five actions available to them: Snatch, Nope, Drink, Draw and Repeat.  At the beginning of each turn all players simultaneously choose two of their actions and play them in secret.  Players then go around the table revealing and resolving their actions until everyone has used both of their actions.  At this point the actions go back into your hand and the turn starts over.<br/><br/><br/>    Poozles (purple) are classy fellows. They drink like sirs.<br/>    Roozles (red) are angry drunks. If something wasn't destroyed, the night wasn't a success. <br/>    Yoozles (yellow) are the life of the party. Free rounds and high-fives for everyone.<br/>    Groozles (green) are a bit much. They always take things one step too far. <br/>    Bloozles (blue) are drama queens. If they aren't making a scene, they're crying in the corner.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dicey Curves is a dice-driven car racing game, where the track is constructed from a deck of cards. To move around the track, you need to roll dice combinations: straightaways allow you to move for whatever combo you can make, advancing one space per die in the combo, while curves contain gateways that require specific combos of dice &ndash; from one to five &ndash; in order to pass.<br/><br/>Five-dice combos are tough when you have only five dice to roll, but thanks to &quot;exploding dice&quot; you'll have a chance. In game terms, every 6 you roll allows you to add another die to your roll. To balance the luck sometimes inherent to dice games, players have control chips that allow them to reroll dice, add additional dice, switch positions between cars, and even control other players' cars.<br/><br/>With the track deck, players can construct traditional pre-configured tracks or race along a &quot;mystery rally&quot; route.<br/><br/>",

The first one who escape succesfully wins the match. But it is not that easy to escape...<br/><br/>There is a double-sided board in the box. Each side is for different game variants and with different complexity. There is a simpler side (which is called &quot;Legyező&quot; and recommended for players from 3-4 years) on which players can play a quick and easy game variant because all events (such as reroll, bonus steps etc.) are drawn on the board. The other side of the board (which is called &quot;Cselsz&ouml;vő&quot; and recommended for players from 7-8 years) is for the more complex game variants. Game variants that are played on the &quot;Cselsz&ouml;vő&quot; side need action cards (the box contains 40 action cards with some different effects). The game rules book contains 2 more game variants (for exemple one for the pro-gamers with challenging complexity) so the constant fun for everyone is guaranteed.<br/><br/>",

What kind of figure this time took the well-known wizard: a nobleman with a lush beard or maybe a proud gentleman with a pipe? Try to catch Twardowski, but watch out: the most famous mag will try to mislead you!<br/><br/>Mr. Twardowski is a deductive game where players have to look carefully at the image of the tavern and indicate which element has changed, to collect clues about Mr. Twardowski's identity. <br/>The &quot;Rome&quot; tavern is represented by 16 double-sided tiles. In each round one player flips single tile, while other players don't look. Then, the others have to guess the flipped tavern segment. The player who will do this first, can check one of the clue cards and learn more about the wizard&rsquo;s appearance (eg. &quot;He doesn't smoke pipe&quot; or &quot;He has moustache&quot;). With enough clues the real Twardowski can be selected from the suspects list. The game ends when one of the players is sure he can catch the wizard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miś Wojtek &mdash; &quot;Wojtek the Bear&quot; in English &mdash; is a family board game with a rich historical background, telling the story of Poland's &quot;soldier bear&quot; Wojtek (pronounced like &quot;VOY-tek&quot;) who shared the complicated fate of Poles deported from Poland deep into Russia during World War II.<br/><br/>In September 1939, Poland was attacked by its neighbors: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Poland was conquered and divided between the invaders. Many Poles were expelled and sent to forced labor camps or sent to remote areas of the Soviet Union. Then, in a surprise move in 1941, the German army invaded the USSR. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the USSR, agreed to create an army from the Polish soldiers who had been held in Soviet camps. Following the deterioration of Polish-Soviet relations in March 1942, these Polish soldiers and civilians left the USSR under the command of General Anders to support British allies in the fight against Germany.<br/><br/>On their way from the Soviet Union to Iran, Polish soldiers bought a small, malnourished bear from a hungry Persian boy. They named the bear &quot;Wojtek&quot; and enlisted him in the army, complete with military papers and the rank of private.<br/><br/>Wojtek remained with the soldiers throughout their difficult journey from Iran, through Palestine, Egypt, and Italy to Scotland. He shared their ups and downs, their joys and sorrows, giving them many opportunities to smile and helping them when in need. He guarded the equipment, and during the battle of Monte Cassino, he even carried heavy ammunition boxes.<br/><br/>The players join Wojtek the bear and the Polish II Corps on their journey from the USSR to Edinburgh, Scotland. Along the way, they collect souvenirs related to the fate of General Anders's soldiers and their famous bear. The aim of the game is to collect the best set of memorabilia!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players receive five travel cards and a bear pawn. Players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, the active player plays a travel card with a truck and moves their pawn to the next (closest) empty space in the color of the card played. Then the player takes one bear card from the board, from the box with the same color as the color of the space to which their pawn moved. Finally, the player refills their travel card hand up to five cards, and ends their turn.<br/><br/>To move their pawn, the players may also play wild cards with a walking bear (which allows them to move to a space of any color as long as they don't pass another pawn) or play three travel cards in the same color in order to name any color and move to the next (closest) empty space in the chosen color.<br/><br/>At the moment when the first pawn reaches Edinburgh or any player has a complete set of bear cards (six different cards of the same type), the last round of the game begins.<br/><br/>After ending the last round, players score their bear cards. Players sort their cards into sets. Each set must have the same type of cards, with no repeated cards. The largest possible set is a complete set of six different cards in one color. The player with the largest set wins.<br/><br/>A note on language dependency: The game is almost fully bilingual: Some components (city cards, game board) are double-sided, with English on one side and Polish on the other side. Other game elements are language independent. Both English and Polish rulebooks are provided in the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player has four merchant ships which they are trying to race across their own &quot;side&quot; of the board to the home port. They also have a submarine (which can attack the merchants) and a destroyer (which can counter-attack the sub).<br/><br/>The game is basically like &quot;Battleships&quot; with movement. The cool part of the game is the board.<br/><br/>The board stands up vertically and each player plays his own side of the board. The ships stay in place as their bases are short pegs that fit pretty tightly in holes on the board. The board is made of a sandwich of two thick card boards with a thin sheet of rubbery plastic in between, so you can't see which holes your opponents ships are in. But you can push your &quot;torpedo&quot; and &quot;depth charge&quot; through the hole, stretching out the rubber and popping your opponents ship off the board. Coolest physical game mechanic ever! No, wait, it gets better! At the bottom of the board is a periscope. Yes, it really has mirrors. You slide this left and right to any column of the board, and then peek through the eyepiece to sight the enemy. You get a view of one column of the board and a peripheral view of the columns each side. If you get a sighting of an opponents ship on the central column you can try and estimate the range and torpedo it. The enemy destroyer then gets a shot at counterattacking your sub. The view through the periscope looks just like looking out from a sub and seeing ships peeping out of the ocean (nicely painted board) along the line of sight. Absolutely the coolest physical game mechanic ever!!!<br/><br/>Board: 13 x 13 square grid<br/><br/>Pieces each side: 4 Merchant ships, 1 Sub, 1 Destroyer, 1 Torpedo, 1 Depth Charge<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The playing field is put into a plastic frame and placed on edge. Each player equips the field on their side with ships, which are inserted into the holes in the playing field. An opaque plastic sheet between the layers of the playing field makes it impossible to see the opposing ship positions. At the bottom of the playing field a &quot;periscope&quot; is hooked, with which one can spy out the opponent's side of the playing field under limited conditions. The goal is to remove the enemy ships from their position with the help of torpedoes and depth charges. These are inserted into a hole on your own side and push out the enemy ship on the opposite side.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who is the last to have their own ships left in the playing field.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mixology is a simple cocktail card game for 2-5 players. You win by creating the best selection of cocktails for your bar. Complex cocktails or cocktails that require rarer ingredients will score higher points. The first players whose menu contains 25 points wins the game.<br/><br/>In each turns, players secretly choose 3 out of 9 available actions cards to gather ingredients/make drinks/hiring a bartender or various other actions. The chosen actions cards are arranged faced down from left to right. All players will take turn around the table performing their first action card. Then proceed to the second action card and so on.<br/><br/>Every actions and the sequence you put them in matter as your friends might snatch the ingredients or cocktails you're aiming for. And more powerful actions will have harder conditions to meet. This makes the players try to push their luck as much as possible by sneaking in more powerful actions. Though these moves are easily blocked. But when well placed, even one action can place you in the lead!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skittle Pool is similar to &ldquo;Skittle Bowl&rdquo;, however the pins have been replaced by nine 2&quot; billiard balls. The table is approx. 24 inches square with 3 pockets each on the left and right sides. At the bottom of the board is a pendulum device that acts as the striker. The cue ball is placed in a special pivot foot and that foot is rotated to aim the cue ball at a target ball. The striker, a ball similar in size to the cue, is lifted and released (or gently thrown) to strike against the pivot foot which in turn transfers the energy to the cue ball.<br/><br/>Most billiard type games can be played on the table. A scoring rack (wire with plastic scoring chips) is included in the game.<br/><br/>The game was most notable for its promotion by American actor Don Adams who was well known for his role as a bumbling secret agent in &ldquo;Get Smart&rdquo; on 1960&rsquo;s television.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a climbing game that has the rare status as being regarded as good for 2 players.  It uses a 48 card deck, with three 2's and one Ace removed.  Like Big Two or Tien Len, the 2 is high, Ace's next, and the remaining cards normal down to three.  A deal is 16 cards each player.<br/><br/>Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, runs singles (5+ cards), consecutive pairs or triplets (2+ sets), full house (triplet+pair), and bombs (four of a kind plus an additional card, except for aces, where its a triplet plus an additional card).<br/><br/>The game is played for points - you get as many points as there are cards remaining in your opponent's hand, unless he is holding 16, 15, or 14 cards, in which case you would just get 50, 40, or 30 points (respectively).  A typical threshold for winning the game is 60 points.<br/><br/>",

Place a lot of features you want and erase unnecessary features to aim for the ideal floor plan.<br/><br/>There are two rules included &ldquo;Design Together&rdquo; (for 2 to 5 people), where everyone collaborates to make one floor plan, and &quot;Design Apart&quot; (for 1 to 5 people), where each person makes their own floor plan. At the start of the game in both rules, you are given an entryway card that shows you a main objective and a side objective (only used in &ldquo;Design Apart&rdquo;) which are your main scoring criteria. These objectives are hidden from the rest of the players.<br/><br/>Design Together: One entryway is placed in the center and you take turns choosing from 3 floor plan cards to add on to the group floor plan. Your goal is to have as many of your main objective fixtures as possible.<br/><br/>Design Apart: Each player creates their own personal floor plan by taking turns choosing a card, with main objective fixtures being worth 1 VP. The side objectives, windows, and variety of fixtures are used to round out the scoring.<br/><br/>",

These cards contain various numbers of jewels worth one point each. These add directly to your score. This deck also includes some &quot;Take a Jewel Card from Another Tiger&quot; cards.<br/><br/>When a tiger gains all ten of its stripes, the game is over. Players count up how many points they have from jewels, then subtract two points for each missing stripe. The player with the highest score wins.

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDementalismAlright, smarty buns, here's your chance to show everyone how smart your brain is. Due to the continuing idiocy of you and your fellow security guards a whole bunch of clones have escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen and are now wandering the various countrysides of Mutha Oith. You guys better get your wazoos in gear and recapture them before your bosses find out and you lose your jobs.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;ll take all of your brains, half your luck, two thirds of your charm, a bunch of guts, and a pinch of divine inspiration to survive this fast-paced and exciting original card game by award winning illustrator and game designer Andy Hopp.<br/><br/>Peeps: 2-12<br/>Ages: 8+<br/>Durations: 30-60 minutes<br/>Contents: 128 cards, instructions, setup card, sticker<br/><br/>The Gist of the Thing<br/><br/>Security at the Primordial Soup Kitchen, that ridiculously wondrous and mythical repository of Oith&rsquo;s genetic legacy, has been lax of late, to say the least. Following an insane night of fermented circuspi nut binging, impromptu (and painful) interior redecorating, and decidedly unsexy pillow fighting between you and your fellow guards you awoke from a grog-addled stupor to discover someone left the goosin&rsquo; doors open. Again.<br/><br/>It wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing under normal circumstances, but a while back the honchos decided it would be a good idea to start stockpiling clones of various important denizens of Oith (and some unimportant ones for practice). You know, in case of calamity or somesuch. Well, thanks to you and your cronies, these clones (three of each!) are now wandering the countryside, clueless and confused.<br/><br/>You guys should probably get your wazoos in gear and nab those hapless triplicates before they fall into the Keister of Gawd or get eaten by something. Oh, and whoever finds the most denizens doesn&rsquo;t get fired or fed to anything.<br/><br/>The Beginning<br/><br/>Step 1: Gather unto thee a bunch of friends. Arrange them around a table or some other suitable playing surface.<br/><br/>Step 2: Take all the cards and shuffle them up really well. Then lay some of them face-down on the table in a grid 8 cards wide and 8 cards long. If your table is too small you can use a smaller grid (6 cards x 6 cards, for example). This is called the SPREAD.<br/><br/>Make sure each player has enough table space in front of him or her to lay a row of several cards side by side. This space, the STORE, will eventually be used to house the player&rsquo;s STACKS (the cards a player collects throughout the game). Also, designate a spot somewhere on the table for the KEISTER OF GAWD (the discard pile). Set the rest of the cards facedown in a pile known heretofore as the HEAP.<br/><br/>Step 3: Read the rest of the rules.<br/><br/>Useful Terms<br/><br/>Cards: There are three different types of cards a peep will encounter:<br/><br/>Denizens represent the various peeps that escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen. The Spread contains three of each Denizen.<br/><br/>Giggities have the zazzy ability to copy the traits of other organisms. Thusly, they can form a Stack with any Denizen.<br/><br/>Turmoil Cards represent assorted events, catastrophes and phenomena that affect the game in various ways. Sometimes they&rsquo;re good, sometimes they&rsquo;re not.<br/><br/>Denizen Power: A special ability granted by a Safe Stack. A player may only use one Denizen Power each turn.<br/><br/>Flip: To turn a card face-up.<br/><br/>The Heap: The draw pile.<br/><br/>The Keister of Gawd: The Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Nab: To steal a Stack.<br/><br/>Reveal: To turn a Stack face-up. Revealed Stacks stay that way until the end of the current player&rsquo;s turn, unless otherwise denoted.<br/><br/>Peek: To look at a Stack or card without revealing it to the others.<br/><br/>The Spread: The face-down grid of cards that forms the primary playing area.<br/><br/>Stacks: Matching cards collected throughout the game. Three types of Stacks exist. Each is worth a different amount of points.<br/><br/>Sneaky Stack (1 point):A Denizen and a Giggity.<br/><br/>Stacked Stack (2 points): Two identical Denizens.<br/><br/>Safe Stack (4 points): Three of the same Denizen. A Safe Stack can NEVER be discarded or nabbed by another player. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>The Store: The area directly in front of each player that houses the Stacks the player has collected. Stacks in the Store are always laid from left to right in the order they were collected. Sneaky Stacks and Stacked Stacks are laid face-down, while Safe Stacks are face-up.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>The most flatulent player (by consensus) goes first. Here&rsquo;s what you do on your turn:<br/><br/>Step 1: Flip over any one card in the Spread. If it&rsquo;s a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Giggity or Denizen leave it in place face-up (unless you can make a match with the Denizen).<br/><br/>Step 2: Flip over a second card. If it is a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Denizen or a Giggity you have options:<br/><br/>Two Giggities: If both of the flipped cards are Giggities toss them both in the Keister of Gawd.<br/><br/>One Giggity &amp; One Denizen: If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack. Adding a card to a Sneaky Stack makes it a Stacked Stack. Discard the Giggity into the Keister of Gawd. Adding a Card to a Stacked Stack makes it a Safe Stack. You may now flip it over. It can&rsquo;t be stolen and you immediately have access to that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (you can still only use one Denizen Power per turn, though).<br/><br/>If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen and the other is a Giggity you may snatch them both up and create a Sneaky Stack.<br/><br/>If one or more of the cards is a Denizen and you think you know where another player has a Stack that matches that Denizen you may try to steal the Stack from the other player. Point to the face-down stack in front of the other player and demand to see it. The player flips over the stack, revealing it to everyone. If you are correct, and the Denizen in the Stack matches the one you flipped, you Nab the Stack from the other player and add it to your Store. If you are incorrect, your turn ends immediately and you LOSE YOUR NEXT TURN. The owner of the wronged stack flips it back over and play continues.<br/><br/>Two Different Denizens: If both cards are Denizens who don&rsquo;t match each other and you don&rsquo;t know where a matching stack is, flip both cards back over and play passes to the next player. If one or more of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack (discarding the Giggity to make a Stacked Stack or combining three Denizens to make a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>Two Identical Denizens: If you flip two of the same Denizen you may combine them into a Stacked Stack and place it in your Store. If you already have a Sneaky Stack featuring the same Denizen you may discard the Giggity from the Sneaky Stack and combine the Denizen with the Stacked Stack to form a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>If you suspect another player has a Sneaky Stack featuring the flipped Denizen you may attempt to nab it as described in the previous section.<br/><br/>Step 3: Used Turmoil cards go to the Keister. Unmatched or undiscarded Giggities get flipped back over. Fill in any gaps in the Spread with face-down cards from the Heap. Once the Heap is depleted just leave the gaps empty.<br/><br/>Step 4: Your turn is over. Play progresses clockwise around the table unless a Turmoil card or Denizen Power indicates otherwise.<br/><br/>Sidenote:  You may look at the Stacks in your own Store whenever you want, but if you do you must temporarily flip them over for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Denizen Powers<br/><br/>No doubt the observant among you have noticed a block of text at the bottom of each Denizen card. This describes the special power you can access once you have that Denizen in a Safe Stack (all three matching Denizen cards).<br/><br/>Each turn, once you&rsquo;ve acquired one or more Safe Stacks, you may choose to initiate the power from ONE Denizen. You may activate the power at any point during your turn, but you can only use one Denizen Power per turn and you may not use the same Denizen Power two turns in a row (even if you only have one Safe Stack).<br/><br/>As soon as you get a Safe Stack you can access that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (as long as it&rsquo;s your turn and you haven&rsquo;t already used a Denizen power that turn). Some Denizen Powers are activated by the actions of other players and can be used whether it&rsquo;s your turn or not, as long as you haven&rsquo;t already used one that turn (such as Squiggins Neverlost&rsquo;s ability to avoid lost turns).<br/>When you activate a Denizen Power turn the relevant Safe Stack the other way around (but still face-up) to signify its usage. Turn it back around at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>Once the Spread has been depleted and all the cards are either in the Stores or the Keister of Gawd, the game is over. Whoever has the most points, determined by the type and number of Stacks in each player&rsquo;s Store, is the winner and gets to keep his or her job as a hapless minion of the Primordial Soup Kitchen. Everyone else gets fired or fed to something horrible.<br/><br/>In the event of a tie, whichever tieing player has the most Safe Stacks wins. If it&rsquo;s still a tie the win goes to the player with the most Stacked Stacks, then the most Sneaky Stacks. If it&rsquo;s still a tie after that the world blows up and nobody wins.<br/><br/>Stack Values<br/><br/>Sneaky Stack (1 Giggity &amp; 1 Denizen): 1 Point<br/><br/>Stacked Stack (2 Denizens): 2 Points<br/><br/>Safe Stack (3 Denizens): 4 Points<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>",

The cards are of a few different types:<br/>- Carrots, one to three (possibly partly eaten)<br/>- Rabbits, one to three<br/>- Super rabbit<br/>- Rabbit, hand clap<br/>- Rabbit, hands up<br/><br/>The players divide the cards evenly among themselves and put the bell in the middle of the table. They then take turns to put one card face up on the table, each one in their own pile around the bell. When the number of uneaten carrots and rabbits are equal, players should ring the bell as fast as possible. Whoever does this first gets all the cards. The winner is the player who manages to collect all the cards. A player with no cards is not out of the game; he can still hit the bell first and get new cards. If a player hits the bell incorrectly, he has to give one card to each other player.<br/><br/>When the super rabbit comes up, hit the bell as fast as possible regardless of the other cards. When the other two special rabbits come up, players have to hit the bell and then clap their hands and/or raise their hands to win.<br/><br/>",

There are no pawns nor score boards: the game ends when a player finds a certain amount of objects (depending on the number of players).

We believe that's about the maximum time before the Coalition ground force's diminishing supplies, coupled with a loss of the domestic political will necessary to continue the fighting, would bring about a settlement if victory were not achieved in the field.<br/> The game includes one map of North Korea, from shore to shore (as well as the northern region of South Korea), and one counter sheet (280 counters) of game pieces representing all of the contemporary US, Allied (South Korean) and North Korean forces that would be engaged in a US preemptory conflict in the near future.<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 280 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "菊花賽 (Kikkasai) is a two-player dice game from Japan that derives a lot from Riichi Mahjong, the Japanese version of Mahjong.<br/><br/>The name is a pun on the phononym 菊花祭 (Kikkasai), a flower festival where exhibitors show off their prize blooms. 菊 (Kiku) is a popular and lucky formal flower (花 hana, ka) in Japan, and 祭 (sai or matsuri) is a festival. Many flower farmers strive for a better Kiku. There are flower festivals where you can find and buy many flowers, and so a festival focused on Kiku is 菊花祭, especially with plants shown in competition. But 賽 (sai) is dice, so 菊花賽 is also Kikkasai, making a Flower Festival Dice game.<br/><br/>The game follows the style of Mahjong, drawing dice from a bag, rolling, discarding, trying to complete sets. In this game, you only handle 2 + 1 dice, so your target is to create one single set. Many of the rules match Mahjong; draw 1 discard 1, claiming the dice your opponent discards, or the rule of &quot;trend&quot; which gives you extra points (like the Dora rule in Mahjong).<br/><br/>Initially, one die is placed as the &quot;trend&quot;. You get extra points for winning a hand by using a same colored die / same pip with the trend die. Then each player grabs 2 dice from the bag and rolls behind their screen. These dice are the players' hands.<br/><br/>Each turn, if you can use the last die discarded by your opponent to complete your set, you declare and win the round. If not, you grab a die from the bag and roll. If the 3 dice (2 in your hand and 1 just rolled) completes your hand, you win the round and score points. If not, you must discard 1 die, either from your hand, or the rolled one. Be careful not to toss out a die your opponent wants. Now the turn switches to your opponent.<br/><br/>The round ends when any player wins, or the bag is out of dice. Put all the dice back in the bag. If any player has 0 points or less, that player loses. Or else, start a new round, switching the starting player.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>A 2 player game of dice-Mahjong.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the Finals of a Flower show competition for prize Chrysanthemum. You aim for the victory by completing your set of Chrysanthemum dice. Both players start from 6 points, and you win by depleting your opponents' points to 0.<br/><br/>Basic game set is for 2, but combining 2 sets would allow you to play by 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>２人用のダイス麻雀ゲームです。<br/>舞台は菊の品評会の決勝戦。<br/>３つの菊ダイスを揃えて優勝を目指します。<br/>６ポイントずつ持ってスタートし、相手のポイントを０にすると勝ちです。<br/>※基本２人用ですが、２セットあると３人プレイ、４人プレイをすることができます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "His father's name was Celtillus, of a noble family and a chief of the Averni tribe of Gauls--a people with a remarkably sophisticated civilization and tradition as warriors and craftsmen, but fiercely resistant toward having a ruler at beyond the tribal level. Celtillus tried to assert authority to organize and ally the disparate tribes against Roman incursions, but tradition and habit were against him and he was killed by his own people. But strife with Rome worsened, and his son elected to try again for tribal unification to survive against the two threats of voracious Rome and ambitious Julius Caesar. The son negotiated, inspired, made alliances, and finally took on the traditional title of &quot;supreme warlord&quot; that his father had died reaching for.<br/><br/>That title was &quot;Vercingetorix,&quot; and he bore the title so well that people today think of it as his name (which we do not know). But then, no Gaul ever bore the title again. Maybe you can change that.<br/><br/>ATO #44 offers Vercingetorix: Twilight of the Gauls, a new game by designer Richard Berg, that challenges players to unify Gaul in around the 1st Century B.C. from 2-4 players compete for power in all three of the main Gallic areas. The Romans and Germans are NOT active players, but introduced with random and temporary control to interfere with active player intentions. Players draw chits each turn to improve their holdings, begin campaigns, or obtain more tribal allies. Or, they may draw surprising &quot;Opportunities&quot; that allow them to interfere with other players' turns and even launch revolts that could suppress Roman activities and elevate player esteem. Game length varies with number of players, but most games will last 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>The choice is yours. Can you make the title &quot;Vercingetorix&quot; your own?<br/><br/>",

The French army counters represent a force of some 45,000 troops and the British 35,000 troops. Using these simple but comprehensive rules up to six players are able to recreate a complete battle with all its complex maneuvers and colorful tactics. The battlefield can be varied to suit any type of ground and the printed terrain pieces placed in any position desired thus give an extremely variable playing area, unrestricted by hexagonal or squared playing boards.<br/><br/>One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a mapboard) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters for units.<br/><br/>Supplements:<br/>Napoleonic<br/> TTG-MA-N01 Prussain<br/> TTG-MA-N02 Russian<br/> TTG-MA-N03 Austrian<br/> TTG-MA-N04 Polish<br/> TTG-MA-N05 Spanish<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt a card depicting an outlaw, the city he's located in and reward amount for capturing him. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance along the trails the number of spaces indicated. When you reach the town where the outlaw on your card is located, you immediately spin the spinner and if it stops on &quot;HIT&quot;, you capture the outlaw (otherwise you try again next turn). Once captured, you place a &quot;Bullet&quot; token on the card then draw a new one. If you land on another player, you may have a shootout (high spin wins) and the loser has an outlaw escape. The first player to return to San Francisco with the required amount of money ($15,000 with 4 players) by capturing outlaws wins.<br/><br/>",

Two sheets of color die cut counters ... 'super sized' with a second set ABSOLUTELY FREE are also included, a total of FOUR sheets of counters.

Therefore, the names of all the beasts encountered in the game are palindromes:<br/>Drakard, the dragon<br/>Trollorts, the trolls, and <br/>Ruffurs, the beasts<br/><br/>Also, the win condition of each encounter with a beast is to roll a 3, 4, or 5 dice palindrome, for example: 3-5-3 or 6-2-2-6.<br/><br/>Move through Drakard's dark forest, encountering beasts and friends along the way.  Make it to Drakard's lair to battle the dragon.  Defeat him and your journey is halfway over.  Continue on to the edge of the map to win the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>After rolling dice to set your initial resources of Health, Food, Coins, and Magic, begin your journey.  Each turn, pay 1 food to gain movement points.  If the hex you land on is a beast, encounter it by rolling your dice.  Win the encounter by rolling a 3, 4, or 5 dice palindrome depending on the beast.  If you win, gain any one resource.  If you lose, pay a penalty in Health.  If the new hex is a friend, gain the indicated item.  You may also trade items on friendly spaces for other items or more weapons (dice).<br/><br/>Win by traversing the entire forest and emerging with more than zero Health.<br/><br/>Note: Currently, there are 2 different maps to choose from: a simple 1 page map, and and enlarged and improved 2 page map (recommended).<br/>   <br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

That&lsquo;s where they must be: the pearls of Poseidon. The players take turns scanning the seabed with a stamp. Their treasure maps show strange objects that are of great importance in finding the pearls. Those who recognise them not only know where the treasures are to be found, but are also able to decipher their  magical names.<br/><br/>Attentive eyes are needed in this treasure hunt. The player who manages to locate the most pearls and gives them the right names wins the most Poseidon thalers and thus the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Schnapp to it!<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out the 96 picture tiles face up so that they can be seen by all players. Each player receives a task card; this task card shows nine pictures that its holder will have to describe, a challenging task since the 96 pictures are grouped into 16 different families, with each family consisting of six very similar images.<br/><br/>In each round, the player to the left of the active player starts the sandtimer, then the active player looks at his task card and begins to describe the icons and pictures on it for the player two spots to his left. He cannot show his card, point to tiles, or answer the searcher's questions; he can change which item he's describing at any time. The searcher can only say things like &quot;Done!&quot; or &quot;Got it!&quot; to spur the active player on to describe something new. Once the time runs out, both describer and searcher score points for all correct items grabbed, then those items are returned to the table.<br/><br/>After everyone has been the active player once, the second round begins, with the active player first drawing a handicap card that imposes some condition on him while he gives clues to the same searcher as before. For the third round, the describer and searcher switch roles, with the new describer also having a handicap. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The rulebook for Schnapp's includes a few variants, such as one in which three people search for matching pictures at the same time and a fully cooperative game.<br/><br/>",

However, you lose 1 point at the end of the game for every space with a gravel tile in your farm.<br/><br/>Water:  You gain 1 additional food when you use the Fishing Action Space for each water tile on your farmyard.<br/><br/>Other New Tiles:  Some of the new minor improvements have you add new tiles to your farmyard.<br/><br/>Disasters:  Players may play a Disaster card whenever they could normally play a Minor Improvement instead of playing said Minor Improvement. Disasters cause all sorts of mayhem when they are played and a played Disaster is worth 1 point at the end of the game.  Unplayed Disasters are worth -1 points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>New Start Cards:  This expansion introduces 16 new start cards.

They didn't have the heart (or the support of PETA) to kill the animals so they instead decided to give them heavy tranquilizers.<br/><br/>They were still bored. So to make things even more interesting they started betting on whether the cats would emerge awake or asleep. Pay being what it is, they soon resorted to trickery. Now they could use their money and slight of hand to win the respect of their peers, for Science!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round a number of cats are placed on the table and boxes are laid on top of them. Each player shuffles and then draws 5 cards from their 10 card deck. Everyone takes turn playing wager cards (which include some cheats and other sneaky stuff), until they are out of cards. Everyone's deck is the same, but the cards they drew could be very different. Finally the boxes and wager cards are flipped face up. The player with the most money on an awake cat receives one Science! for that cat. Asleep cats do not give Science! Play continues until one player has 7 Science! for 2 players, 5 Science! for 3 players, or 4 Science! for 4 players.<br/><br/>",

(With two players, each player sets up two card holders.) Ideally these cards have been mixed and shuffled so that they face in different directions. Once all the holders are set, each player passes a holder left, then a 30-second sand timer is started, during which time each player writes down on their score sheet what images they think they see in the line-art jumble. Players go through this process for each holder, then they reveal the images one by one.

It will be their job to read from the book. The other players must create their persona and then within 5 minutes be ready to enter the twisted rooms of Hotel Lovecraft.<br/><br/>If they get through all six floors of the building and escape alive maintaining their reality, they win. Fail, and they never check out.<br/><br/>Each room has its own specially designed soundscape and narration, once entered you will be given four choices, from which you must choose before you are allowed to descend further. The HOST will tell them of the results and elaborate upon the story to bring the players deeper into the adventure.<br/><br/>A player will start on the top floor of &ldquo;Hotel Lovecraft&rdquo;. Play or read the Acts in order, before the player can start opening each door to the floor. They must open all but one of the doors on each floor before the lift will allow them to move to the next level. They can if they wish to revisit a floor, once they have activated the lift.<br/><br/>Players will start with full HEALTH and Zero MADNESS. If the players lose all their HEALTH or REALITY points, the game ends for them.<br/><br/>",

In the latter case, the player has to use a high-resistance fishing line to release the fish and haul it into his boat.<br/><br/>If after the second step, the player still has 8 cards in hand, he may:<br/>1. Place a second fishing rod in his boat.<br/>2. Throw bait into the lake.<br/>3. Attach a colour-coded fish to bait of the same colour on his fishing rod or on another player's rod. <br/>4.

        "description": "While the rules call this a wargame, it is highly abstract and more of a family game.<br/><br/>The system is an interesting attempt at representing the general flow of a given battle with very simple rules.  The board consists of a (very sketchy) schematic of the battle area overlaid with arrows indicating the troop movements, much as one might see on a diagram of a battle.<br/><br/>The arrows are divided into spaces - on a turn, a player rolls a die and moves a piece (infantry or cavalry - the artillery does not move) along the appropriate arrow (which arrow or arrows it can use depends on where it starts).  Landing on certain spaces may let you advance further, or may destroy the piece (there are a number of the latter spaces on the Light Brigade's paths).  Getting to the end of an arrow destroys an enemy piece, generally, but sometimes has other effects on the opponent.<br/><br/>There are special rules for each group indicating what its orders are or what it actually did in the battle, more or less (some can traverse the arrows more than once, etc.).<br/><br/>While the box says that either 2 or 4 people can play, there is no provision in the rules for more than 2, and no obvious way to accommodate this.<br/><br/>Greensmith designed a similar game for Palitoy on the battle of Waterloo.<br/><br/>",

For example, there may be questions about the illusive Black-Vented Shearwater, whose range includes the western Mexico, the Baja Pennisula and southern California.

Battle Stations is different in that its emphasis is on medium to large sized battles which can be completed in a day or even in hours.  The designer reckons for each ship involved in the game it adds ten minutes of playing time.<br/><br/>Have it all in one package!  Inside you will find ship stats for all the naval powers which fought in World War II: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Soviet Union, and United States.  All of the major naval aircraft are here too like the US Hellcat, the Japanese Zero, the Re 2001 (for the Aquila), the British Swordfish, the D520 for the French carrier Bearn.<br/><br/>The ship charts include a comprehensive listing of ship classes ranging from aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, escorts, commerce raiders (all the German raiders are here), merchant ships, MTBs, submarines and even the experimental battleships like the German H39 class, the improved Gneisenau class with 15&rdquo; guns, the Graf Zeppelin and Seydlitz German aircraft carriers and the not to be forgotten Italian aircraft carrier Aquila.<br/><br/>But that is not all, you receive extensive listings of the number of ships in each class, when the class became available and when certain ships in the class were sunk.<br/><br/>Damage and speed is kept track of on the game table eliminating extensive paperwork.  Two sided counters tracking speed and damage are provided.  Each turn represents a half hour of time so action is fast, furious, and realistic.  Rules are very comprehensive covering fleet morale, surface combat, mine warfare, torpedo launches, carrier combat, submarine warfare as well as surface combat and damage control (which varies by nation as well as by year).

        "description": "The game is based on the French-Canadian movie called &quot;Les Boys&quot;. The movie is about a garage league hockey team. The game picks up the hockey theme and is played in 2 teams, for a total of 2, 4 or 6 players.<br/><br/>As in the real hockey game, this card game is played in 3 periods, the first player plays a card, the puck is for the team of that player, until a player from the other team can play a card, the puck stays in the control of the team.<br/><br/>A goal is made when a team can produce a card to shoot to the goal and the other team cannot block the shoot.<br/><br/>This game is similar to the game called Slap Shot but does not include a board to play on it (as Slap shot has) and predates the game by a year.<br/><br/>",

This is a<br/>game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody<br/>responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls<br/>the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.<br/>All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody<br/>to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps<br/>if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive<br/>study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you<br/>to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for<br/>eventual world domination.<br/>&quot;Elegance in Simplicity&quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the<br/>dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.<br/>Enjoy.<br/>All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are<br/>composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players<br/>may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal<br/>&ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined<br/>by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,<br/>or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.<br/>But it all boils down to:<br/>Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.<br/><br/>",

Players are secretly assigned roles: either &quot;Werewolves&quot;, who know each other; or &quot;Villagers&quot;, who know only that there are Werewolves amongst them. During the night phase of the game, the Werewolves choose an innocent to kill. During the day phase, all players debate and speculate the identities of the Werewolves and vote to kill someone whom the majority suspects. Players are eliminated until either all Werewolves are killed or the Werewolves outnumber the Villagers.<br/><br/>Werewolf In Town is partially derived from the original game called &quot;Mafia&quot; which was later given a Werewolf theme, and is being presented on The Game Crafter for the first time with all new, original 8-Bit style artwork and brand new rule variants for you and your group to enjoy. Also included on the cards is something missing from most productions of this game: explanations of the roles. No more running to the rulebook when you get a role you haven't had before or having to expose the fact that you have a unique role because you don't know how it works!<br/><br/>Also included are some Blank Cards for you to experiment with your own new roles to liven up the game play after you have mastered what is in the box!<br/><br/>",

Each Crime Lord has its own special ability and a varying number of points required to win and/or lose the game. So, each time you play, the difficulty and challenges will change.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ヘッジホッグジレンマ (Hedgehog's Dilemma), you and your fellow players are hedgehog breeders who are trying to encourage the little critters to get closer to one another on a cold day, perhaps to form a hedgehog couple if all goes well, so they need to be close enough to meet but not too close.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>The deck has cards numbered 1 to 4. Players are dealt six cards to their hand and a number of cards are laid face-up matching the number of players. Everyone chooses a card from their hand and reveals it. Cards that match up go to the player, everything else is discarded. Repeat this until the players' hands are empty, then score. Total up the whole of the cards you collected, the player with the highest total wins a token. Shuffle the whole deck over, play another round. The game ends when the fifth token is given out, the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>Matching cards simply means matching the number on the card, so if the table shows 1,3,3,4 and you're the only one to lay a 4, you get both 4s. But if more than one player lays a 4, you all get nothing. If two players each laid a 3, they'd each get a 3 from the table. If one player laid a 3, they'd only get one 3.<br/><br/>But if a 1 is matched in a turn, then the highest value table card is discarded, and so any matches are also lost. This brings in double-think, what are they other players likely to do? Do you go for the 4, or try a safer 3? What looks like a simple game becomes more cunning and watching what cards have already been played matters.<br/><br/>The card art is lovely, showing a variety of spiny creatures, sea urchins, lizards, turtles, porcupines. The cards are quite thin but the game is well made.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ancient Egypt, more than three millenia ago, men confronted each other in the Trial of Osirium under the eyes of the immortal Gods. Inspired by Osiris, the judge of souls who came back from the dead, the Osirium allowed to settle many conficts and to have the truth triumph. If honesty guides your actions, then you won&rsquo;t be afraid of walking in the duat, and you will make your Deity proud.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/>Osirium is a trial. Your goal is to defeat your opponents to make the deity to whom you pledged allegiance proud. To do that, you need to collect as many points (or Ankhs) as possible, performing Rituals with various Amulets. 4 deities are available: Isis, Anubis, Bastet and Seth.<br/>The Trial<br/>The oldest player plays first, since it is assumed that they&rsquo;ll join the gods sooner than the others&hellip; Then, the player on their left plays their turn, and so on.<br/><br/>On your turn, <br/><br/>     You must play one of your 4 Amulet Cards. Place it on any free space of the board, choosing its orientation. Then, draw a new Amulet Card to have 4 Amulet Cards in your hand again. You can either take an Amulet Card from the Deities&rsquo; Market, or draw a random Amulet Card from the top of the draw pile. If you take a card from the Market, immediately replace it with a new card from the draw pile.<br/>     You may cast one of the Rituals of your Deity Board (see Cast a Ritual on p.7). You can do this before or after placing an Amulet on the board. You can cast as many Rituals as you like. Casting a Ritual is not mandatory. <br/><br/><br/>Alternatively, you may decide to pass. This allows you to discard your entire hand of Amulet Cards to draw 4 new Amulet Cards instead. When you pass, ignore the two actions listed above. <br/>The Trial ends once a player has cast 5 Rituals. Check if any player has completed their Exaltation Card (a secret secondary objective), then proceed to final scoring.<br/><br/>Cast a Ritual<br/>There are two types of Rituals: Simple Rituals and Advanced Rituals. Players receive Simple Rituals at the beginning of the game. They are easy to cast but do not score many points. Players may draw Advanced Rituals during the game. These Rituals score more points. Each Ritual Card depicts the Amulets required to cast the Ritual.<br/>To cast a Ritual, you must make sure that the depicted Amulets are correctly linked to each other: An Amulet is linked to the adjacent Amulet if both arrows are face to face. There must be no other Amulets between the arrows of the Amulets required to cast the Ritual. There can be more Amulets than required, of course. In that case, simply indicate the ones that you are using. <br/>A Ritual allows you to gain Ankhs (as many as indicated on the card, in front of the matching symbol). However, casting a Ritual consumes the Amulets&rsquo; energy. For this reason, some of them need to be broken. Remove the Amulet(s) of your choice from the ones used for the Ritual and place them in front of you. <br/>Rituals can be cast according to two principles: Order OR Chaos. <br/>ORDER : Such Rituals score more points and break less Amulets &ndash; which means that more Amulets remain available for the other players. <br/>CHAOS : The black symbols depict the Chaos Principle. Such Rituals score less points and break more Amulets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It would be a great adventure to find a safe, for example.<br/>The search for the mysterious safe is a challenge: Every day, a tricky riddle has to be solved to find out which room of the old building may be entered the following day. Clever powers of deduction, imagination and creativity are required.<br/>But don't worry, if you get stuck, a table on the back of the pack with 2 hints per puzzle and a breakdown of the solution will help.

Normally, each player &quot;invests&quot; two of these cards to begin the round, placing them face down in front of himself. Players use their own hidden information (the cards they've invested) and the other players' bids to make educated guesses about the true value of the market (i.e. the total quantities of each commodity present among all players' cards), while trying not to give too much away themselves.<br/><br/>One player kicks off the bidding, making a prediction about the minimum number of a given commodity present among all player's cards, for instance &quot;Five Wheat.&quot; The next player must then either increase the bid, or &quot;sell,&quot; thereby challenging the previous player's bid. When increasing the bid, however, players can choose between increasing the quantity (e.g. &quot;Seven Wheat&quot;) or adding a commodity to make a combo bid (e.g. &quot;Five Wheat and Gold,&quot; meaning that there are at least five of each). A player who is stuck, neither wanting to increase the bid nor challenge, has a third option available: investing an additional card (up to a maximum of 4) in order to change the bid to a new commodity (or combo) entirely, for instance, changing from &quot;Five Wheat and Gold&quot; to &quot;Six Oil.&quot; The catch is that this additional card increases the player's potential losses should they be the eventual loser of the round.<br/><br/>When a player sells, all cards are revealed, and the loser of the challenge loses all the cards he had invested: his initial two, plus any additional cards he invested in order to change the bid. A player without cards is eliminated, and the last player standing is the winner.<br/><br/>Cash or Cash plays well in groups from two to eight (though with the usual caveats about player elimination when playing with a large group, i.e. make sure there's something to do for those out early), and features two additional game modes and an optional &quot;doubling&quot; rule to accommodate different groups' preferences.<br/><br/>In Endurance mode, only one card is invested by each player to start, and the bids can only be raised in single steps, for a more tactical game. In Blitz mode, on the other hand, players may bid and challenge out of turn, and there is no cap on the number of cards a player can invest; challenging successfully out of turn allows players to recover a card lost in an earlier round.<br/><br/>With the doubling rule, the bidder who is being challenged may &quot;double&quot; in response to the following player calling &quot;sell.&quot; The challenger must then either withdraw her challenge and bid as usual, or else persist in the challenge, with the stakes now doubled (i.e. the loser will have to discard additional cards from their hand equal to the number lost normally).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bloemeneiland - the Island of Flowers - is a game for 2 or 3 players who are flower buyers for the King. Players must buy flowers from the local merchants and growers and send them by ship back to the Palace to gain favor at court. The player with the most favor after six rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/>Beginning with the round&rsquo;s Starting Player, players take clockwise turns doing 2 actions in order.<br/><br/>Action 1: Players must move the Island Marker on the board in a clockwise direction from one Townsperson space to another (or to the Dock). They may move any number of spaces but only the first space moved is free. Each additional space costs 1 gold. If the marker stops in front of a Townsperson that player will receive a benefit if they choose. If the player stops at the Dock they<br/>will cause all players to deliver flowers to the Ship.<br/><br/>Action 2: After the player visits a Townsperson they must move their numbered Player Marker to a Location which matches the Townsperson&rsquo;s colored border. Locations occupied by another player may not be visited. You may then use the Location&rsquo;s Special Action. If the Island Marker is at the Dock, no Locations may be used.<br/><br/>If the Island Marker is at the Dock, all players may now choose to deliver flowers to the Ship and gain Favor Points. Beginning with the round&rsquo;s Starting Player and then continuing clockwise, each player may deliver one type of flower to the ship, but never more than the Palace currently demands as valued by the dice in play. After each delivery, adjust the corresponding die down by the number of flowers delivered. Anyone who delivers flowers receives Favor Points equal to what is currently shown on the Favor Point track above the Ship.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends after the sixth Ship has sailed. In additional to the Favor Points earned during the game, each player receives an additional 1 Favor Point for every 3 flowers of each type they have in their possession. Gold is not worth any Favor Points. Whoever has collected the most Favor Points is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is an express version inspired by Santiago de Cuba by Michael Rieneck.<br/><br/>",

They were designed by Jason Tagmire and illustrated by Campbell Whyte.<br/><br/>Each card features an illustration with 4 unique elements. There is a character, holding an item, completing an action, in a location. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.<br/><br/>The cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a rank, suit, mood, season, letter, and color.<br/><br/><br/>The Storyteller Manual includes rules for 16 different ways to play. From strategic coloring to push-your-luck storytelling, there are game variations for everyone. Many variants are story based gaining points for each card played, best poker hands and matching card elements, but others include strategic coloring (where players must complete illustration quadrants to earn points), and endless possibilities (where the players create and change the rules in a race to 30 points).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Drive on Dubno: is the third game in the East Front Battles Series by Decision Games.<br/><br/>During the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, the German First Panzer Group drove deep through the Ukraine with its ultimate objective the great city of Kiev. Leading the thrust was the 48th Panzer Corps. The Germans broke through the Soviet frontier defenses, but the Red Army quickly counterattacked with several mechanized corps. While the Germans were outnumbered, especially in tanks, they had superior command control and tactics, allowing them to defeat the Soviets piecemeal. Moreover, the Red Army at this stage of the war was in the midst of reorganization, and suffering from severe logistical shortfalls. Still, the Germans got a surprise when they ran up against T-34 and KV tanks which were far heavier than the German AFVs, and were largely impervious to their anti-tank fire, except for the infamous 88mm flak guns. Following several days of mobile battles, the Wehrmacht routed the Red Army. Yet, the Germans were delayed long enough to cost them a quick capture of Kiev, a failure which would have considerable ramifications in the next several months of the campaign.<br/><br/>Originally published in World at War magazine #31 (Aug-Sep 2013).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.5 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (276 9/16&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

Exercise your vivid imagination and infer the thing that comes into your opponent&rsquo;s mind by using the sense of touch. <br/>Due to the nature of the game, the visually impaired people can enjoy and play, too!<br/><br/>//story<br/><br/>In ancient times, when the mammoths and dinosaurs walked the land, or perhaps even before that, there was a civilization called &ldquo;Dattakamo&rdquo;. Its people excelled at making things out of clay, of which they made many: from what they found at the bottom of the ocean, to what they saw in the beyond the galaxy; from flowers and animals around them, to things from the imaginary future.  They treasured what they had made, and lived happily. One day, however, a volcano suddenly erupted and the civilization perished.<br/><br/>Time flew by, and now in the present, the works of the &ldquo;Dattakamo&rdquo; people have been excavated and brought into the Academy. What are they? Some of the artifacts are broken; others, with strange and bizarre shapes. All of them were treasures of the &ldquo;Dattakamo&rdquo; people.<br/><br/>In the Academy, a renowned professor and his students sit around these artifacts. The professor wonders what the pieces are, while his students discuss his ideas earnestly.<br/><br/>// Game Progress<br/><br/>The purpose of this game is that the students guess right what the professor imagines. The students ask the professor three questions, one at a time, during their turns. This is called the &ldquo;discussion&rdquo;, and a discussion has 3 rounds.  The professor has to answer correctly these questions. During this phase, students can freely touch the piece as many times as they want.<br/>If a student manages to make a correct guess, he gets the piece from the professor.<br/>When all the players have finished playing the role of the professor, the game ends and the player who acquires the most artifacts is the greatest professor ? and wins!<br/><br/>",

The first few blocks will be easy to place but as more blocks get placed, the available space on the board dwindles, and it becomes rather tricky to place the last blocks.<br/><br/>If all the blocks get placed on the board, the game enters a second phase, in which players must take turns to push a block towards the centre of the board. At some point the blocks will suddenly snap together, and the player taking their turn at the time is eliminated. Eliminate all your opponents to win.<br/><br/>Knowledge about the physics of magnetism is not essential; what you need are a steady hand and nerves of steel, because those snapping blocks will make you jump.<br/><br/>Schnapps is the adult variant, in which the player who makes the blocks snap together must drink a shot.<br/><br/>",

Then the player in his turn, reveals the 9 cards and rolls the three dice supplied. A skittle is hit if the number on a card corresponds with the numbers on the dice,either as an individual figure or the sum of 2 or 3 dice. In this way combinations of the dice may be used to knock over as many skittles (turn them over) as the player can. There are rules about which skittles in a layout are covered by other skittles. This cannot be knocked over until the skittle(s) covering them are knocked over first.<br/><br/>Players in their turn can throw the dice three times. Every skittle knocked over scores a point. If all 9 are knocked over in three rolls, then the score is 12 instead of 9. If you can knock them all over in just two throws, you score 15. First player to 77 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The board is reversible, with traditional backgammon on the reverse side.<br/><br/>Regular backgammon rules apply for movement.  The setup is slightly different, since the points &quot;farthest away&quot; from your home court are used by another player, so those 2 stones start one unit closer to home.<br/><br/>The major change is direction - that all players in a three or four player game are moving clockwise.  Evidently there is no way to set up four players with two running clockwise and two running reverse.<br/><br/>There are variants listed, including team play where two players can have stones resting on the same point.  For two players on this board, each gets two sets of pieces.<br/><br/>This game differs from Quadragammon in that there are four complete sets of stones and the board has additional points printed in the corners.  And its main difference, the all-clockwise movement.<br/><br/>Contents - reversible board (4-fold), 4 sets of stones, 2 dice (!) and rules.<br/><br/>",

Over 50 historical scenarios (5 of them solitaire) are provided, each featuring one or more fighter aces . . . The 40 aircraft types include the Polish PZL 11, French Potez 63 fighter bomber and the highly advanced Dewotine D520, the German Fieseler Storch, Focke-Wulf 200C, Dornier DO 17Z, and Messerschmitt 109, British Hurricanes, Spitfires and Beaufighters, and the archaic Fairey Battle, plus US and Italian aircraft.&quot;<br/><br/>This game extended Jim Hind's Aces High game system from World War I into World War II. Spitfire was the first of four projected games simulating World War II.  Spitfire covers the early period of the conflict, from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of 1941, when the war became global. 3W had announced the 2nd game in the series but never released Messerschmitt.  The other two title were not named.  No Pacific Theater airplanes were released by 3W.<br/><br/>Note that Spitfire! is not related to the 1973 SPI release bearing the same name.<br/><br/>",

The goal is simple: earn yourself 10 Bed Notches while avoiding the consequences of your actions such as lost turns, Clingy Exes, STDs, and babies. The dialogue is both horrible and hilarious. Play is quick as everyone has the ability to play cards on another person's turn. A player will have seven cards in their hand and can GETSOME, become PREGGOS, gain a Status Effect, heal a Status Effect, or block a player from a GETSOME or PREGGOS encounter. Don't forget to call in your Wingman when the time is right.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the story telling, where you'll create the details of your deeds and how you overcame difficult challenges presented by your so-called friends in pursuit of your next conquest. Your evening will be filled with buddies, belly laughs, and blushing cheeks of the newly acquainted.<br/><br/>The heart of the replayability is in the multifunction design of many of the cards to perform different tasks depending on your needs. There are an unlimited number of ways for rounds to play out. There's an amazing breadth of crazy things you'll hear yourself say over the course of the night, and a card for just about every occasion. Once you GETSOME, you're definitely going to want to GETSOME again.<br/><br/>",

In no time, he has freed all the animals from their cages, and together, they experience the craziest adventures. What could have happened? No doubt, you can think of many funny stories. Remember them well, because only then you can help the monkey to end the chaos!<br/><br/>Der verdrehte Sprach-Zoo (The Twisted Language Zoo) is played in two phases. During the game, players take turns drawing two tokens: one animal, and one object. The player has to come up with a story of what has happened with that animal and that object. For example, when a player draws &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;balloon&quot;, he can say &quot;the snake has found a balloon in a tree, and uses it to fly away&quot;.<br/><br/>When there is a story about each animal, the second phase of the game starts. Now, the players take turns remembering the stories. On his turn, a player draws an animal card. He has to remember what object was connected to that animal. The other players may give hints. If the player gives the right answer, he may move the monkey one space on the score track.<br/><br/>The players win together if the monkey reaches the last space of the score track (the tree). If they run out of cards before the monkey reaches that last space, they lose together.<br/><br/>The game comes with a mechanized gameboard for hiding and revealing the answers, and several rules variants.<br/><br/>",

The game is designed and produced for the exhibition HET Instrument 2010.<br/><br/>Players are managers whom get a very clear assignment. Automate and improve and old rundown factory and turn it into a profit generating money machine. Processes are improved to obtain better quality, a higher efficiency, lower costs ans HSE needs to be improved to meet the necessary standards.<br/><br/>Improving your plant alone isn't quite enough in this game. Buying resources and selling goods is an integral part of the game and the way profitable companies operate. The simulated markets emphasise the need to buy and sell wisely.<br/><br/>The players are experienced Plantmanagers hired by the owner of a plant in need of modernisation. They have to upgrade the machines with products and services from the FHI members to improve the quality and quantity of the plant's output. To do so, resources are bought, processed and the final products are sold on the market.<br/><br/>Each round players select actions by putting they playing pieces on action spaces. For each action they play an Event card, Purchase resources, takes improvement cards, gets the HSE bonus, sells goods, pays OPEX, pays maintenance and pays taxes.<br/><br/>At the end of five years the managers are judged on their performance. The most valuable production plant with the most capital scores the most points.<br/><br/>",

The Servers scurry out of the kitchen with food, the Boss directs the traffic, trying to please everyone.<br/><br/>It's tough when a customer finds a Bug in her Salad or Lipstick on her Coffee Cup. Worse can happen when a Server slips on a Greasy Spot &amp; spills the Soup.<br/><br/>Time slips away, but maybe with an extra coffee and a piece of delicious blueberry pie, we can coax the Driver to stay a few minutes more. Maybe not. Still, you have to love those Big Tips earned for good service and we hope to get many of them.<br/><br/>Quick-paced, original, &amp; challenging.

Each player chooses one Player Card and then which side they wish to use, placing cubes to mark their initial XP and HP.<br/><br/>Each player begins with 2 skills, listed next to their initial XP: STR (Strengthyness) and CRF (Craftyness). All players have a starting STR equal to a D4 and a CRF which will differ depending on which card they chose.<br/><br/>For both STR and CRF, the die rolls will be as stated until you reach a new XP level where they will increase (ex. The Warrior begins with a STR:D4, when he reaches 2 XP this then changes to STR:D5)<br/><br/>The Sorceress and Wizard can also cast magic spells (their Magickyness). There are two types of spells: those in blue can be cast at any time during an Attack; those in red can be cast during an Attack but the player may not use their STR to help (see Attack below) in the Party Attack number. Only one spell may be cast in an Attack.<br/><br/>Each player also begins the game with a Special Skill or Starting Spell which is listed at the bottom of the Player Card.<br/><br/>Attack: Most rooms have a foe in them to be overcome. Attacking is mandatory unless the Wizard uses his Enchantment Spell (in this case the party moves to the next room and there is no attack but the party receives +1XP for being sneaky).<br/><br/>Each player will roll for their STR value separately and both values are then added together. This is the Party Attack number. One player then rolls for the STR of the foe (as listed in the current room). This is the Foe Attack number. If the Party Attack number is equal to or higher than the Foe Attack number, the players win the attack, slay the foe and proceed to the next room, with each player gaining the Success Bonus as listed. If the Party Attack value is lower, each player takes the amount of HP damage as listed and they then proceed to the next room.<br/><br/>Order of Play: The players will proceed from room to room, in numerical order, until they reach the final room where they will be successful and live to fight another day, thereby winning the game, or they will be soundly and  utterly defeated.<br/><br/>This is the 4th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012) and Gameshop Gladiators (2013)<br/><br/>",

Games can last from 10 minutes, to 2 hours, depending on how long you want to play. The print and play set is ok for folks aged 15+, and becomes ok for all ages when you remove the cards marked with a lil&rsquo; skull icon.<br/><br/>Players take turns speaking a selected phrase in the voice of a character chosen by the round's judge, who then decides who performed the best voice for the round. Both the judge and the speakers have ways to attach additional descriptors to the current character, Upping the Ante of difficulty, hilarity, and reward for the round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Diamond Checkers is played on a nine by nine grid of checkered squares.  The game is played on the light colored squares, of which there are forty-one, including all four corners.  The squares on two opposite corners of the board are marked with a diamond shape and are called the Diamond King squares.  Each player has one of these corners of the board closest to him or her.  The next two light squares following the edges of the board to left and right are marked with rings and are called the King Squares.  Each player begins with twelve stackable checker pieces, each with its crown side facing down, on the nine closest light squares and on the middle three squares of the next row closest to the center of the board.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their pieces with the goal of eliminating their opponent from the board.  The ordinary pieces may move to one adjacent square vertically towards the opponent, or horizontally to the left or right.  Upon arriving on any of the opponent's King squares, a piece is turned over to become a King, and may now also move back towards his own side of the board.  Upon arriving on the opponent's Diamond King square, a piece has another stacked upon it with its crown side up and becomes a Diamond King.  Such a piece may move in any direction to an adjacent square, including diagonally.<br/><br/>Pieces are removed from the board as in Checkers, by jumping over them to an empty adjacent square.  Pieces may capture in any direction in which they normally move.  Jumps may be continued as long as there is opportunity to capture more pieces in a single move.  Capture is compulsory, but a player is not required to inform his opponent of a missed opportunity.  Players with choices of more than one capture may choose which to take.<br/><br/>The first player to remove all of his opponent's pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have the fattest cows (i.e., the cows who ate the most grass, in the form of green plastic chips).<br/><br/>There are eighteen event chips showing different weather conditions. Sunny weather means the cows are moving around eating grass. Lightning kills all cows standing in the water or under a tree. Cows caught in the rain (i.e. are not in the stables or under a tree) catch a cold and cannot eat in the next turn. If there is dry wind (after a sunny turn), new grass grows. Wind after rain also damages the cattle's health.<br/><br/>The game has a push your luck element - which locations are safest while offering good grazing grounds? The stables are safe, but the cows don't get fat.<br/><br/>When all eighteen events have been played, the player with most grass chips is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far you may move on the board, moving in any direction they choose (but they may not visit the same space twice in a turn). The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue. Each card has 4 clues on it, descending in value (10, 7, 4, and 1). Players may hear the clues in descending value until they reach the minimum value indicated on their space on the board -- if they can successfully answer at a higher point clue value, they will receive the higher points.<br/><br/>An alternate form of scoring is based on stealing points from the opponents by landing on a space on the board without a number. When this happens, the player competes head-to-head with the person that has scored the most points on that category's scoring scroll.<br/><br/>",

The propellant provides the power for your vehicle, the consumables are the food, water, and oxygen for the crew members.

The instructions also include optional rules to increase the difficulty of game-play for more expert players.  Players can move or rotate a Mirror Block to increase their score or to try to block their opponent.<br/><br/>The player places the View Cube at the beginning of a selected path.  They then place their finger on the Target Peg that they think is at the end of the path.  The player looks down into the View Cube.  If the predicted Peg is seen, the player scores by adding the values of the Mirror Blocks and the Target Peg to their existing score.  If the selected Target Peg is not correct, the player scores nothing&hellip;<br/><br/>Mirror Mania is a fun and relatively quick-playing game, and the Day-Glo&reg; hot pink, electric yellow, and fire orange Mirror Cubes are a retro blast!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Due to its simple rules and ease of playing, &quot;The Bowl Game&quot; is a perfect party game for mixed groups of non-gamers.<br/><br/>Much like the parlor game &quot;Celebrity&quot;, players are broken into teams and given slips of paper.  Each player writes down a set number (usually 10) of 'things' on slips of paper.  These 'answers'  are folded up, placed into a bowl (or hat or cup, whatever you have handy), and the game begins.  Each player is  given 1 minute to draw slips of paper, one at a time, and try to get their teammates to guess the answer.  Much like Taboo, no charades (hand gestures) may be used, and no rhyming or &quot;starts with&quot; is allowed.<br/><br/>The &quot;things&quot; written can be anything that makes sense, and can be conveyed.  Expressions, quotes, famous people, things, etc.  As long as it's not nonsense, it's appropriate.<br/><br/>When the timer goes off, the team gets one, and only one guess, as to what the last answer was.  The teammates must confer, and come up with a guess.  Usually there's a time limit to this.  If it's guessed correctly, it's a point, otherwise it's tossed back in the bowl.<br/><br/>The bowl is then passed clockwise, and the next person gets a turn.<br/><br/>Continue until the bowl is empty.<br/><br/>",

In order to progress, one must collect key cards, which represent faith, truth, and humility.  Once all of these are collected, it is possible to move into the inner rings.  However, once you have reached the inner rings, it is possible to help those who are stuck.  You may give up your turn, in order to give one of your key cards to someone in need.  For this kind deed, you receive a crown card.  There are also a number of obstacles, including pride, doubt, deception, and the sins of flesh.  Along the way, one may also need to draw a Scripture card.  These include a Bible verse that you need to memorize before its your turn again in order to proceed.  The game ends once a player reaches the center or when a timer goes off (the rapture option).  The winner is the player with the most crown cards.  Thus, victory goes to the player who helped the most other players.<br/><br/>",

There is also a 3-minute sand-timer and a pad of scoring diagrams for players to use.<br/><br/>Two games may be played with this set (and one of these two games may itself be played in two ways).<br/><br/>Mingle-Crossword makes use of the scoring diagram - each player gets one sheet of score pad with a 17 X 17 square grid on it (and space for writing down the scores). Each turn, the 8 dice are cast and the timer started. Players then have until the timer runs out to form a word using two or more of the eight letters showing. This first word must cover the centre square. Play continues, with each player forming words that intersect crossword-style with existing words on their own diagram. The diagram contains shaded squares that when used result in double or quadruple letter scores or double or quadruple word scores. After a fixed number of words (say 25), players total up their scores and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Mingle-Listing is simply a game of anagramming letters that come up on the eight dice when thrown. The first way to play is simply to throw the dice, set the timer going and for each player to list out as many words as he/she can. The player who lists the most words, wins. The second way of playing is to have players take turns to state a new word that can be formed from the dice. When a player cannot state a new word, he/she loses and drops out. The remaining players cast the dice again and play continues until only one player remains.<br/><br/>This game is probably no longer in print as it is not mentioned in SPM's current website.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player may take one of three actions:  lay a tile which expands the dungeon, move a monster in his force, or cast a magic spell.  The objective is to move your monsters into enemy Crypts.<br/><br/>Monsters begin the game in their home Crypt.  Each has a strength and movement rating.  Strong monsters are slow, weak ones fast.  Which will you play early and which will you save for later?  Which will you use to defend, and which will seek entry into enemy Crypts?<br/><br/>Dungeon tiles are used to build the dungeon.  Lay them carefully to block monsters from entering your Crypt, and make entryways into enemy Crypts.<br/><br/>Spell tiles keep things interesting.  Poisons lower abilities; Potions raise them.  A Reaper could mean instant death, while a Seraph returns you safely to your Crypt.  Traps stop movement, while a Ghost lets you walk through walls.  Or use Transporters to pop up in unexpected places.  Suffering under an enemy spell? Remove it with a Zapper.<br/><br/>Crypt is an easily-learned, quick-playing tile-laying game suitable for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up.  It is available as a self-published print-and-play game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Re is a popular Chess variant.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 5x5 board. When the game starts, the board is empty. Each player starts with 10 player pieces: One king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and two pawns.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can do one of the following three things:<br/><br/><br/>    Put one of your pieces (not yet put into play) on an empty square on the board.<br/>    Make a capture with one of your pieces on the board.<br/>    Pass. Note: This may only be done when you have put all your pieces on the board.<br/><br/><br/>When both players pass consecutively or when all pieces of a player have been taken, the game ends. Each player earns points for their remaining pieces on the board: 3 points for each king or queen, two points for each rook, knight, or bishop, and one point for each pawn. Each player counts the total number of points for the pieces they have taken, and the player with the largest number of points wins the game (the score is the difference between the point totals).<br/><br/>Originally published as Spielbox Edition No.8 in Spielbox issue 2/1994.<br/><br/>",

Alchemy is played with one player&rsquo;s basic set of pieces from Symbol, and thus provides a clever way to determine first player for a game of Symbol or can be played as a separate stand alone game for those who want a quick match that is easy to learn, almost impossible to solve, fun, and mathematically very interesting; though a new and unique game, Alchemy shares some ideas and mechanics with other stacking strategy games and members of the NIM family of games.)<br/><br/>The players represent dueling alchemists trying to make chemical reactions with the Aristotelian elements (earth, water, air, fire), and a fifth, unstable element of destruction.  Alchemists want to create gold, but they never could figure out how to create gold, so instead the players are fighting over a single gold coin by alternating turns making new combinations of elements.  When on a player&rsquo;s turn no new combinations are possible, that player loses the round.  The first player to win two rounds in a row wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a non-active player starts the timer, then the active player races to create a word using at least one of the letters facing him on his rack and at least one letter facing out from an opponent. Words must be at least four letters long, and a player cannot use letters from more than one opponent.<br/><br/>If a player calls out a word before time expires (and the word is valid), then the player scores the letter cards used in the word, leaving those particular letters face up. If a player uses all six letters in his rack or an opponent's rack, then he takes another turn (after players refill their racks to six cards). If a player fails to call out a word, the first non-active player to grab the &quot;flash round&quot; token from the center of the table creates a word and scores it.<br/><br/>When the card deck runs out and no one can create any more words, the game ends. Players sum the letters they used in words (with wild cards being worth zero points), then subtract the point value for letters that remain in their racks. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The players occupy varying social levels from servants all the way up to the King. Each player tries to make the best carrier possible. The game process copies that of the Russian card game Durak (or &ldquo;Fool&rdquo; <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak</a>), but the fun lies in players acting out their roles and interacting with other players.<br/><br/>Players have their own rights and duties that they must perform. For example: the Janitor collects the cards that were beaten, the Hangman punishes those who have wronged, and the King gives orders. If players don&rsquo;t complete their gaming duties, then they can be punished by having to do certain unpleasant tasks. On top of that, the game contains a certain mode of conduct which, if broken, can cause even the King to become a simple servant.<br/><br/>The expanded version of the game also includes social order cards, the King&rsquo;s Charity cards and the ability to chronicle each player&rsquo;s gaming achievements. A number of blank cards also allow players to devise their own characters.<br/><br/>",

For this, 35 dice are placed in the playing area leaving an empty space, and the 36th die is used as action die: the active player rolls it, and the rolled value can be split into several sub-values (for example: 6 = 3+1+1+1) to perform one or more of several possible actions, such as turning a die, swap files, etc.<br/>DICE provides several options to build the starting dice grid, as well as advanced rules for a longer and more challenging game experience (additional dice moves and a more challenging winning condition). <br/>DICE is available in several colored sets: Natur (36 white dice); Regenbogen (6&times; 6 dice in each of the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet); Devil Dice (black dice with red pips, and the pips are randomly placed on the die faces, making it impossible to predict which value will show after turning a die); and also two- or three-color dice sets.<br/>More colors means a more complicated game and more possible tactical variations, as additional winning conditions can be established (for example, a home row with alternating black and white dice, if a two color DICE set is used).<br/>According to the rules leaflet included with the game, there also exists a set of 121 dice called MARATHON DICE.<br/><br/>",

Once enough of a type have been Settled, players can Utilize each system&rsquo;s special ability to further their positions, scoring more points and expanding their empire!<br/>Mechanically, players will be collecting sets of System cards and playing them in front of them. A player&rsquo;s final score is based on the System type of which a player controls the lowest value, so an even balance of development is key. However if a player settles more than a critical value of a System type, he/she can utilize that type&rsquo;s ability every turn for the rest of the game!<br/><br/>",

In order for the great smith Ilmarinen to forge the Sampo, you must bring him the finest wool of a lamb, a single grain of barley, white iron, and a white swan feather. However Louhi, the Sorceress of Pohjola, also wants the Sampo to bring her prosperity! Will you be able to gain the Sampo and return to the Stone Fortress of Kivim&auml;ki before Louhi can steal the Sampo?<br/><br/>There are four stats in the game: Brawn, Wits, Magic, and Luck. At the start of the game, Brawn, Wits, and Magic all start at 1, and Luck starts at 0. You have 9 points to distribute between the 4 stats. Each point means you roll an additional six-sided die when using that stat.<br/><br/>These stats are used for the encounters at each location.  Each encounter is fixed, and requires certain stats or combinations of stats for you to succeed.  These encounters are how you gain better stats, gain the items you need to make the Sampo, and once you have the Sampo, how you avoid Louhi and her minions.<br/><br/>Inspired by the story of the Sampo from the Kalevala.<br/><br/>",

Movement switches rapidly back and forth between players keeping you fully involved in the game with no long waits between players.  In any order you want, you can: enter reinforcements; bring back into play previously eliminated units; move an army, air force, fleet or elite corps on the map via land, sea or air; launch a conventional attack or launch a nuclear attack. Both conventional and nuclear attack options are available to players.<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Time Scale: Varies 1yr/turn<br/>Map Scale: Global Area Movement<br/>Unit Scale: Armies/Fleets/Air Forces<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The aim it to circle the castle once counterclockwise. The choice of the way is freely selectable.<br/>At the beginning, the game machine is set up with the towers. The dragon comes into the courtyard. Each chooses a character and places it on its tower on an outer edge. <br/>The active player turns the rotary arrow. Afterwards each player is allowed to move his character as many spaces as indicated at movement points. If a player ends his move in an occupied space, he simply moves on to the next empty space. At intersections the direction may be freely chosen, whereby it is clearly dangerous along the inner courtyard.<br/>If the dragon symbol is turned, the active player must activate the dragon. He pushes the lever as a trigger to a freely selectable point and lets him go. The dragon now winds its way across the field and beats against the towers until after a certain time it is switched off by the device alone. The duration of its movement depends on the position of the trigger.<br/>If Knights have fallen down or been knocked down by towers, they must begin their journey again from the beginning. This also applies to knights who have been completely pushed off their current field! The dragon is then placed back in the middle of the castle.<br/>End of the game: If a knight manages to completely circle the castle, the game is over.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It is a trick-taking game played over 4 rounds.  In each round, players will draw 6 cards from the deck, and split them into two sets of 3 cards.  These cards will be placed onto a rack adjacent to the player.  The other player next to the rack will choose which set of three cards they would like in their hand, and the splitting player will have the other set. (The cards remain on the rack.) Each player will have 6 cards to play in a hand, 3 on each adjacent rack.<br/><br/>Trump cards come from a special trump suit, and the lowest card of the trump suit, otherwise of the lead suit, will win a trick.  (There is a special exception for the 7 cards.) The winner of a trick keeps the card they played face up in front of themselves (until the end of the game); the other cards are discarded.<br/><br/>A player's score is calculated at the end of the game and is equal to the sum of their score in each of the 5 suits. In a suit, a player's score is the product of their highest rank card and the number of cards collected in that suit.  The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Font Karuta is a version of this traditional card game for people who are obsessed with recognizing the differences between typefaces.

To drift into the dark and bind forever.&quot;<br/><br/>This dark prophecy is borne by the one ring that players will handle in Der Herr der Ringe: Der Ringtr&auml;ger as they take the roles of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions and make their way to Mordor to destroy the ring and save Middle-earth from the evil of Sauron.<br/><br/>In more detail, the players move across the different landscape tiles, starting in the Shire and fleeing from the constant threat of the Black Riders, the Nazg&ucirc;l.<br/><br/>One player starts the game as the ring bearer, wearing an actual ring. The game is played co-operatively, with the cards in your hand being partly visible to yourself and partly visible only to the other players; players can play cards from any hand.<br/><br/>Each round, Sauron's power is strengthened and the Black Riders move forward. If they catch the companions, the game is lost. If a fifth card of Sauron's is placed in front of the ring bearer, they fall under the dark power and becomes Sauron's assistant; in the future, the ring bearer plays against the companions, with the &quot;Dark Deck&quot; at their disposal.<br/><br/>After this dark turn, helper cards are laid out and can provide necessary support for the companions. The active player carries out two actions, preparing the journey or discovering the next landscape, before sending the companions on their journey and ensuring them as much of a lead as possible over the pursuers.<br/><br/>If the companions reach Mount Doom without being overtaken by the Black Riders, they win together. If a person becomes Sauron's assistant, they rely on the Nazg&ucirc;l to enable themselves and their master to win, with the remaining companions trying to prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>",

There are a few property cards such as the &quot;3 goals in 21 seconds&quot; card that could benefit with a factoid explaining its significance.

The die with the numbers 4-9 is used for the advanced game.<br/><br/>The six smaller black dice have the standard numbers 2-6, but the remaining side can be used either as a 1 or a 7, depending on the player's choice.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>The 4-9 large die is set aside. All players play at the same time, taking turns as to who will be the 'roller'. The other eight dice (2 large and 6 small) are simultaneously rolled in full view of all the players, and must not be touched by ANY player.<br/><br/>The two Large Dice form a 2-digit number, which can either be high or low. For example, if the large dice show a 3 &amp; 6, the low number would be 36 and the high number would be 63. Players study the dice and quickly call &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;HIGH/LOW&quot; or &quot;ZIPPY&quot; AFTER they have found a way of totaling either of the two numbers formed by the large green dcie with the small black ones using addition, subtration, multiplication and division.<br/><br/>The first person to call and get a correct result gets 1 chip, unless they call HIGH/LOW and show both answers - then they get 2 chips. You lose the same amount of chips if you are incorrect. If you call ZIPPY (which means no possible way to reach the target values) you get a chip from the bank unless someone challenges you. Then, whomever is correct pays the other.<br/><br/>The advanced version uses the 4-9 die in place of one of the other large dice for more challenging possible results.<br/><br/>UK players will see this as a dice driven version of the numbers quiz from the TV show Countdown.<br/><br/>",

The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.<br/>The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear.

        "description": "In the card game Feiges Huhn! (&quot;Cowardly Chicken!&quot;), you have to decide when to step into the ring &mdash; and when to tuck your tail and run.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of 48 cards, with cards in three colors numbered 1-8 twice. Shuffle the deck, place three cards aside face down, then deal out the rest of the deck evenly, placing any remaining cards in the box. Without looking at their cards, players place them face down in front of themselves.<br/><br/>The start player flips a card into the center. The next player either takes the top card of the discard pile and tucks it under their deck or flips their top card onto the discard pile. If the flipped card is the same color as the top card or the same value or lower, then the player's turn ends; if the flipped card is both a different color and higher than the top card, the player takes all cards in the discard pile, then either tucks them under their deck or places them face down to their side as a point stack. In either case, they flip the top card of their deck to start a new discard pile. (If the discard pile is empty due to a player taking the top card, the next player flips their top card to start it again.)<br/><br/>On a turn, if a player is hesitating over what to do, another player can yell &quot;Feiges Huhn!&quot; at them. If the active player decides to take the top card from the discard pile, the player who yelled gives them the top card of their deck to tuck as well. If the active player flips a card and succeeds, then they give their top card to the yeller, who tucks it under their deck. (If the active player fails, they take the discard pile as normal with no other penalty.)<br/><br/>When a player's deck runs out, the round ends. Reveal the three cards set aside. For each such card in your point stack and your remaining deck, score 1 point; if, for example, the three cards are 5, 5, and 7, and you have one 5 and three 7s, that's 5 points. Each 1 among your cards is worth an additional 1 point, regardless of whether they were set aside.<br/><br/>After three rounds, and the player with the most points is the unluckiest person at the table and (simultaneously) a sad chicken.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Expansion packs of 150 different general-purpose death cards, to add variety to your games. This set contains all 3 sets (A, B, &amp; C) that were previously available separately.<br/><br/>Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. <br/>     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. <br/>     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>     The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>     The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/>     Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>     Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>             Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not. <br/>        <br/>    <br/>     Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>     The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

Each turn, one person gets two cards with objects on them, then reveals one and keeps the other one hidden. That person is trying to get everyone else to guess the hidden object. The trick is that they can say only what is true about both objects. They can give unlimited hints and the other players have unlimited guesses. When someone guesses the hidden object, the guesser and the hint giver both get a card and the next play proceeds clockwise. The first player to get five cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Let's say for example, that you drew an airplane and an apple. You could reveal the airplane and say both these objects are bigger than a strawberry, both these objects might be found in New York, both these could fall on scientists. Frame your hints to get your audience in the right mindset. This free-for-all mode of the game works best with 2 through 10 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pack Wars is a simultaneous action selection card game played over 5 rounds. Each round is selecting and performing two actions. At the end of the 2nd action the Hirelings pack out an item. The winner is the Hireling that has the lightest backpack. Since the pay to be a Hireling is terrible, why would you choose to carry anything heavy? Leave the heavy items for the Hirelings that don't know any better!<br/><br/>There are two type of cards; Items and Actions.<br/><br/>The Item cards are placed in a 3x5 grid know as the &quot;Loading Dock&quot; (the rest of them create an item draw deck). Each item has a weight value. You do NOT want to get stuck carrying the heavy stuff (it could hurt your back!).<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 action cards. Select two cards to play this round. Simultaneously reveal the first card. The card with the lowest value is resolved first. Do this again for the second card and after the cards are resolved you pack out the item in the Loading Dock closest to your Hireling (if you didn't pack one out from your action). At the end of the round, draw two new action cards and refill the loading dock.<br/><br/>Most Action cards switch items around on the loading dock, but some can make you pack items out earlier. A few actions such as &quot;Prancebald Brought a Mule.&quot; , allow you to discard the items instead of packing it.<br/><br/>",

You give a rating to wines from various countries, while investing in wineries to monopolize the market.<br/><br/>This game uses 4 investment tokens per player and 16 cards. On the table, there is a space to hold 16 cards in 4 x 4 square grid, and each row and column represents reputation of a winery in which players may invest.  Each turn, you have two options: you may place a rating card, which ranges from -3 to +5, in the square grid, affecting two wineries; or you may place two investment tokens on any wineries.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the first majority investor on each winery takes the reputation score on that winery. After the third round, the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>Although the cards have Japanese text, you can play Wine Rating ignoring the text. There are two types of cards: winery cards and rating cards. Winery cards are written in English and Japanese, and all Japanese text on the Rating cards are just flavor. They gorgeously describes a wine in wine critics' comments. Japanese players can enjoy the text, but it is not necessary for gameplay.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ワインレーティングは、ワインの評論家となって、各国のワインに評価を付けると同時に、ワイナリーに投資を行って市場の独占を目指します。<br/>使うのは、たった16枚のカードと4枚のコインだけ。カードを置いてワインの評価をするか、コインでワイナリーに投資をするか。ルールはシンプルですが、しっかりとしたゲーム感を味わえる新感覚のエリアマジョリティ（陣取り）カードゲームです。<br/><br/>",

Competition is fierce, and the goal is to revive as many dinosaur species as possible. Jurassic Park awaits you!<br/><br/>Digger is a competitive card game for 2-4 players and ages 8 and up. Each game lasts approximately 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>Obtain all the 5 different dinosaur tokens.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>ROUNDS: the game lasts 3 rounds.<br/><br/>At the beginning of their turn, the starting player must decide which rule (or trick) they will follow during said turn. A trick is the combination of cards that the players will use to win the turn. Each player&rsquo;s trick must consist of a minimum of 2 cards and a maximum of 5, and they can be of various dinosaur species. There are 4 possible trick types: EVEN VALUES (2, 4, 6...), ODD VALUES (1, 3, 5...)., CONSECUTIVE VALUES (1, 2, 3&hellip;)., MATCHING VALUES (5, 5, 5&hellip;).<br/><br/>Once the starting player&rsquo;s trick has been placed face up on the table, all the other players, in counter-clockwise order, will have to play their cards (a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5), following the starting trick&rsquo;s rule. Players may use any dinosaur species, even those that have not been used in the starting player&rsquo;s trick.<br/><br/>The player who has played the card with the highest numerical value of each species will keep that card (having beaten the other players in that species) and place it on the table next to them. If they have played the highest card in more than one species, they will win those high cards and place them accordingly, one next to the other to differentiate the suits. The next player to their right must then play their trick, and so on until all players have played their tricks.<br/><br/>When all players have been the starting player the corresponding number of times, a round is completed. At the end of each round, the player who has won the most cards of each species will receive a token of that species.<br/><br/>Once the tokens have been dealt, all the cards (player cards, won cards, and play and discard decks) are put together in a new deck, which must be shuffled before the deal for the next round can begin.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME AND VICTORY<br/>There are three ways to end the game:<br/><br/><br/>     A player obtains all the 5 different dinosaur species tokens.<br/>     The 3 rounds are completed and the player with the most tokens of different species wins.<br/>     One of the 5 species token piles runs out of tokens. If such a case is met, follow the rules from above.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(If she had picked up a token previously, she returns it to its original location on the game board.)<br/><br/>If a player rolls a dragon egg on the die, she flips one of the dragon egg cards to its wakeful side. If all the dragon eggs have been flipped, the player then flicks the dragon egg on the game board. Any pawn knocked over by the egg, including the active player's, is moved back to the location where it last picked up a treasure. If a player has picked up no treasure tokens, it returns to start. The dragon egg cards are then flipped to their sleeping side again; the egg remains on the game board or is returned to the nest, depending on where it landed.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches the dragon's treasure chest at the end of the path. This player wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Five Minute Delivery: Hamlet #2 Fnurf can be played as a stand-alone game or combined with Five Minute Delivery: Hamlet #1 Slurgo. Players take on the role of bundle deliverers in the goblin town of Goobliopolis. On a randomly constructed board, players listen to directions from the narrator on an MP3 as they try to deliver bundles to various locations. The locations are determined by Address Cards each player gets, and the routes are different based on the layout of the tiles that make up the town. Because the length of the game is determined by the MP3's that work with the game, it takes... five minutes to play. (The title seems obvious now, doesn&rsquo;t it?) The game is played in real time (meaning everybody plays at the same time with no turns). A variety of MP3&rsquo;s give players different directions and (along with the random town layout) different play experiences every time.<br/><br/>",

Joe Commando Attack game.<br/><br/>This is a simple combat game in which players attempt to capture all six of their opponent's commandos. Players roll a die to determine how many spaces they may move any combination of commandos.  If a commando ends their move adjacent to an opposing figure, combat takes place:  each player rolls a die, and the higher roll captures the opposing piece.  Once per game, captured commandos may be freed by moving onto a compound gate space.  There are also resource tiles on the map that can be picked up and later used to temporarily boost your team's abilities.<br/><br/>The real attraction of the game comes into play when a player rolls the &quot;missile launcher&quot; symbol on the die. The player then uses a battery-operated gun to fire one or two foam discs at the board. If a piece is knocked over, it is captured, even it happened to be your own commando.<br/><br/>",

There is a chance to secure points with the dud card, but other than that whatever you have in your hand at the end will be your score. You must watch out for the M80, they empty your hand. Enjoy and remember, fireworks are not toys!. Set things on fire responsibly!<br/><br/>Set Up:<br/><br/>    The last person to light a firecracker goes first. That person chooses a dealer.<br/>    Deal 4 cards to each player and everyone discards 1 <br/><br/><br/>Form a discard pile next the remainder of cards which is now the draw pile.<br/><br/>    Each player will organize the cards in their hand and hold then face up in front of them. Only the top card will be visible.

They may choose themselves or any other player. <br/><br/>    They will draw one card from the draw pile and give it to that person face up so everyone can see.<br/><br/><br/>That card is to be played on the card showing in that players hand. <br/><br/>    If it&rsquo;s a match, it lights a firework showing as the action on the card goes into effect. <br/>    If it&rsquo;s a lighter, the player gets to decide on the card in the other persons hand they wish to act on, but they don&rsquo;t get to look, just announce.

(You could keep choosing yourself, but there are M80&rsquo;s in the deck that will wipe you out).<br/><br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Play continues until there are no more cards to draw. The cards left in your hand at the end of the game are totalled and scored. if you have any cards in front of you as result of the dud, you add them to your hand total and that&rsquo;s your score. The highest score wins. If a tie, the player with the most of the highest point value cards wins.<br/><br/>",

She moves closer to them as she learns about things such as their ability to cook, the amount of dowry they&rsquo;ll bring in and whether or not they have &ldquo;child bearing hips&rdquo;<br/><br/>The girls spend their time coming up with creative ways to avoid getting hitched by the aunty. They can do so by talking about having a career, gaining weight, being seen in the mall with boys, or several other things that every other society would consider normal, but are seen as disgraceful in South Asian culture. <br/>Occasionally, they might find out things about the aunty, such as the fact that she has a 23 year old unmarried daughter, and use that to blackmail her into moving away from them.<br/><br/>At some point during the game, the Aunty comes across the Golden Boy.

This is when the entire game dynamic switches around, as it turns into a rat race to get married to the dreamy Mr. Right. <br/>The girls then start to make their way towards the aunty by flaunting their talents, such as the fact that they pray 5 times a day, or only have female friends.<br/><br/>Only one girl makes it in time to marry this Golden Boy, and the rest are hitched off to the mama&rsquo;s boys and womanisers who believe that they&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s gift to humanity.<br/><br/>",

All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.<br/>Example: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.<br/><br/>from the rules translation<br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>At the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.<br/>Example: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.<br/>If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players trade in seven commodities: two grains (corn and wheat), two meats (cattle and hogs), one industrial metal (copper), one money instrument (T-Bills), and one precious metal (gold). These commodities differ in their volatility; the higher the volatility, the greater the opportunity for both profit and loss...<br/>LIMIT UP makes you part of the commodity world. You can speculate on the expected price movement, protect your crop, balance your portfolio and limit your risk, or use high leverage. You compete with government policy, weather, and other market forces.<br/>No commodity trade would be complete without an &quot;inside track&quot;; someone always seems to know more than others.

        "description": "A VERY High-Voltage Card Game for 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>Through clever play of your cards, you place bids, hoping to win tricks which will bring you more powerful cards to use in future hands. So it's a blind-bidding, trick-taking, deck-building hybrid.<br/><br/>The 144 cards in the deck depict events in the amazing life of the great electrical genius, Nikola Tesla, one of the inventors of our modern age. Following the successes and pitfalls of his life story, each player in this game attempts to accumulate the greatest amount of Voltage (victory points) before the deck runs too low.<br/><br/>In keeping with the theme, many aspects of the game are in threes, and victory points are measure in Millions of Volts (A.C., of course).<br/><br/>Each player begins with an &quot;Input Deck&quot; of nine cards. From this they deal themselves a hand of six to play the round. Each round then consists of three tricks. The first trick consists of (A) drawing three &quot;prize cards&quot; from the main deck that the players will try to win and (B) each player chooses three cards from their hand to bid, trying to win those cards. (Sometimes, if the &quot;prize&quot; is undesirable, a player may play low to intentionally lose the trick.) The winner gets the prize cards, and all players keep the cards they played, which go into their &quot;Output Deck&quot; (discard) for future use.<br/><br/>The second trick in the round uses TWO prize cards and each player plays TWO cards from their hand to the trick. Finally the last trick is a One-Card trick. And again, prize cards go to the player's own Output Deck, and all other cards are recycled by each player.<br/><br/>In succeeding rounds, when a player's Input Deck is depleted, their Output Deck is shuffled and placed face-down to become the new supply for their hand. This way, the prize cards come into play as the game progresses. Some cards are &quot;Power Cards&quot; which cause extra draws, discards, and actions to be taken which add extra value to one's hand, and can hinder an opponent's efforts.<br/><br/>The winning is determined after all cards have been won. Some cards are &quot;Positive&quot; and some &quot;Negative&quot; scoring cards, and several have special point values. The suited cards do not have a scoring value UNLESS the player has acquired a &quot;Value for your Voltage&quot; card, which gives those cards points at the end. Therefore, gaining those during the game (even though they have no value until the end) can make the difference in a winning or losing score.<br/><br/>Now available at Amazon.com and RedHenToys.com !<br/><br/>",

Once per turn, you're able to attack by discarding any card in your hand. The defending player then discards any numbers of cards.

        "description": "Upstairs is an exciting, tactical race for the entire family. Two to four players take control of one first-class secret agent each (m/w ^^). Your group entered the base camp of the evil dude, but instead of the villain all you find in the basement is a giant bomb. To make matters worse, there is no easy way out  the janitor has locked all the doors shut. The only escape route is via the roof. But there is no need to be afraid, because just like in every good action movie, the bomb will only explode when the (first) agent is taking off with the helicopter. Good for him, bad for the rest that is left behind.<br/><br/>Upstairs - A game ...<br/><br/>for a gang of up to four friends, where the one that comes second is the first to lose the game. So you all better hurry up, and race as fast as possible through the labyrinthine high-rise building, just to be the lucky, or in fact the only survivor. Upstairs is an excellent racing game with a great charm.<br/><br/>In Upstairs, the 9 playing cards make up the high-rise building, from which the players have to escape. Not only do they have to run through the labyrinthine base, but also to dodge the extremely aggressive guards, who in the harder gaming variant can end the life of an agent faster than he would have liked. Winner is the first player to reach the roof. Only then will the jump  naturally, and befittingly, in slow-motion - succeed in the nick of time, with the agent grabbing the skids of the descending helicopter, carried off to the next hotel, where wine, women and song are waiting for our hero. The short playing time of around 15 to 20 minutes makes Upstairs the perfect warm-up game for any games meeting.<br/><br/>",

Everything you will do to save your pack will be told for centuries as a legend to the young wolves around the Rock, during the long and wild jungle nights.<br/><br/>I Racconti del Libro della Giungla (&quot;Tales from the Junglebook&quot;) is an innovative storytelling game thanks to the impartial scoring system. It has an engine made of 27 element cards as objects and moves. A few of these cards will be given to players and will be their hands.<br/>During you turn you tell a story starting from a quest card incipit. You can mention 3 elements at most in your tale. If another player has the corresponding element card, he has to show it to take a point but help you gaining points at the end of the quest. <br/>When you reach the story end throw a die and add to the result the number of element cards shown by other players. If the result is the same as the quest card's at least, you take points from the quest card.<br/>Allies like Baloo and Bagheera and enemies like Jakala and Shere-Khan will give bonus and malus to the quest.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of 95 yellow cards (DISEASE/NON-DISEASE) and 55 red cards (ACTION).<br/>Game play is simple. Each-player is dealt eight yellow cards. On each turn, players draw one action card and follow the instructions. The objective of the game is to rid one's hand of all disease cards. <br/>Action cards may either benefit or negatively affect players.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP: Choose 1 other player. You each discard 1 DISEASE card. <br/>SHARE A DIRTY NEEDLE: Choose 1 other player. You each draw 1 YELLOW card.<br/>There are also special ability cards (NON-DISEASE). Example: STAY HOME AND MASTURBATE which protects a player from having to draw a disease card.<br/>Each round takes approximately 10-15 minutes to play. Play as many rounds as desired. Optional scoring rules are also included.<br/><br/>",

Scores are based on the total number of individual sets distributed across the 4x4 game board grid of shelving.<br/><br/>Score equals - 1 set - 3vp  &bull;  2 sets - 5vp  &bull;  3 sets - 8vp  &bull;  4 sets 12vp  &bull;  5 or more sets - 17vp<br/><br/>&bull; Score for each individual collection of all 5 game types AND all 5 games sizes within the grid of shelving(ex. E2, W3, R4, S5, C6) without repeat of size values among that collection of the 5 types.

Prepare for your own WALK IN THE WOODS with this fun new game! GEAR, CHANCE, and CHALLENGE Cards define your journey.<br/><br/>GEAR - Be prepared and learn to use the essential items during the game when faced with emergency scenarios.<br/><br/>CHANCE - Encounter opportunities to race ahead, hazards that slow your pace, or choose to stop and enjoy the trail.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE - Play and learn about hiking first aid, LEAVE NO TRACE camping and backpacking skills, Plant and Animal I.D., and Trail History.<br/><br/>Chance and GEAR Cards interact during the game.  When faced with an emergency, if you are carrying the proper equipment, then you can continue your hike.  Collect points as you correctly answer questions, identify plants and animals, and use the gear in your pack to help navigate through perilous situations that arise! The game ends when the first player completes a Thru Hike--arriving at either Katahdin or Springer Mountain. All players then tally the points from their Trail Journal cards and the player with the most points is the Winner!<br/><br/>This game is a fun and engaging way to prepare new hikers (kids scouts, students) for a their next adventure!  It is also great for seasoned adult hikers to reminisce and test their knowledge! (Did I hear &quot;alternate rules&quot; with adult beverages?) It is also perfect for COUCH POTATOES because it lets them hike the AT from the comfort and safety of their living room! (One of the game pieces is a sofa!)<br/><br/>",

Dragons can fly across territories to raze and pillage. Mighty leaders send hordes of mercenaries and strange creatures into mortal combat.<br/><br/>Troop types range from basic infantry, knights, mystic creatures, and heroes. Each troop card is placed in a battle line and casualties are removed from the front of the line unless they can be targeted with a special ability. So generally you want to place your toughest units in the front lines.<br/><br/>Each card lists its strengths and weaknesses. The number of stars across the top represent the amount of damage it can take, followed by number of dice it  rolls in combat, offensive strength, and defensive strength. This seems simple, but the addition of creatures, special abilities, artifacts, and spells add to the strategy.<br/><br/>",

The group decides on a story by consensus, then builds characters. Players play cards on themselves with the positive side up to represent resources they have within the context of the story; they play cards negative side up on other players as problems.<br/><br/>Players take turns telling tales about how they will use their resources and the story itself to overcome their problems. Other players select number cards from their hands to represent the plausibility of the active storyteller's chance of success. The player who selects the median number is rewarded with a bonus resource and the median number becomes the chance of success for the storyteller. If the turn of a card is below this chance of success, the problem is turned into a resource.<br/><br/>After all players have had two turns to tackle their problems, the player with the most resources frames the climax. Players wager their resources on the final turn of the card.<br/><br/>",

Also new is guidelines/formula for rating the value of warplanes yourself, based on game ratings, to allow for more in-depth comparison of aircraft.<br/><br/>The game system is identical to and compatible with Battle over Britain. This 52-page full color, illustrated book includes standard rules, advanced rules, solitaire rules, and historical scenarios.  In fact, the aircraft and campaign games include those contained in Battle over the Pacific (Vol. 2), Faith, Hope &amp; Charity (Vol. 3), and Flying Tigers (Vol. 4).

This edition is a handsome volume and comes with new North African and  Additional Plane counters, featuring aircraft new to the system, plus others such as the RAF Battle and Hudson, the Italian C-32 and SM-82, American P-38 Lightning, Australian Boomerang,  and German Storch and Ju-52 Tante Ju.

        "description": "Adventure's Kit: Expedition is a treasure-collecting card game for 2-4 players. The game is designed for younger ones to start with, as it becomes more strategic with aggressive play for adults. In the game, players send out expedition teams to explore ancient continents and collect world-famous artifacts.<br/><br/>To set up the game, draw ten culture cards, then place them on the appropriate continents on the game board sorted according to their age. Place museums and relics to the side as they are bonuses acquired during the game. Each player starts with five expedition cards in hand; if anyone holds an event card, they should discard it, and redraw until they have five cards, after which event cards are shuffled back into the deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, draw one expedition card, then choose to either send out the expedition team (i.e., place the specialist cards on the table), replace any number of specialists in hand by redrawing, or explore. You can explore only if you've already established an expedition team. When you explore, see whether the cards played match any of the artifact requirements on the table; the artifacts can be retrieved by consuming certain specialists, and the player can continue exploring the next card in the same continent as long as the requirements match. At the end of your turn, check that all four continents hold at least one artifact; if not, draw ten new culture cards and place them as at the start of play.<br/><br/>The game ends after 5/7/8 museums or relics have been uncovered, depending on whether you have 2/3/4 players in the game. Players then tally their scores from artifacts collected, along with any bonus points they've acquired. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hungry Hugo is a card and dice game. Every player starts with a hut (consisting of 5 parts), an empty garden, with 5 spaces for nice garden d&eacute;cor and 3 action cards, which can be: Build (d&eacute;cor), Move (the sleeping monkey), Wake (the monkey), Banana (for bad times).<br/><br/>In the middle of the table, there are 20 &ldquo;BEAUTIFUL THINGS&rdquo; (garden d&eacute;cor standees), which players can build in their gardens. The first players, who has 5 &quot;BEAUTIFUL THINGS&quot; in his garden, wins the game.<br/><br/>Sounds easy? There&rsquo;s a little snag. The snag is called Hugo, and is 3 meters high. This monkey is always hungry &hellip; when he&rsquo;s awake. Fortunately he sleeps most of the time. <br/>The game is played turn by turn. In his turn a player can play 1 action card, or discard 1 action card, and draw a new card (hand = 3 cards).<br/>As an action you can BUILD a beautiful thing into your garden - but only if the monkey is not in front of your hut. Another possible action is to MOVE the sleeping monkey to another players hut. Or, you can WAKE up the monkey, when he&rsquo;s at anothers players hut.<br/>If someone plays a WAKE card, he rolls the HUGO DICE, to see what the monkey will do. The dice has 4 sides with HOT HUNGER, which means, Hugo will eat one of your BEAUTIFUL THINGS. 1 other side shows a sleeping Hugo, which means, Hugo felt immediately back into his dreams, the guy in the hut is lucky, and nothing else happens in this turn. The last side of the dice is I SEE YOU, which means Hugo noticed the active player, while waking him up, and follows him to his hut. <br/>And what about the banana? You can keep these cards in your hand, to give it to Hugo in a HOT HUNGER Situation, so that he can eat it &hellip; instead of your garden d&eacute;cor. <br/>And so players will build d&eacute;cor, push the sleeping Hugo back and forth, collect bananas and hope not the have the monkey in front of their huts, when he awakes hungry. Every eaten thing comes out of the game, so the game ends, if someone has a full garden (5 beautiful things), or if no beautiful things are in stock (in the middle). In this case, the player with the most beautiful things wins. In case of a tie, the winner will be the one who&rsquo;s furthest away from Hugo.<br/><br/>",

It is a game for the whole family, easy to learn, with a fast gameplay and two bonuses for the bravest pirates.<br/><br/>L'Isola del Tesoro is a basic roll and move game, where you are trying to get from the Start tile to the Treasure Island, progressing through all the Sea tiles placed in a line. On your turn, you roll the six-sided die and move as many spaces as the result of the roll. You flip the tile where you land and apply any effect indicated (move forward one space, move to the tile where stands the last ship, skip your turn...). The first player to reach the Treasure Island wins the game.<br/><br/>The Monster tiles are used to block your progression. When you cross one, you must stop, flip it and stop your turn. On the following turn, you roll the die to try to beat the monster. Whoever beats the monster gets the tile, which doesn't give any advantage.<br/><br/>",

Later it was published as a stand-alone game, though the basic Warhammer rules are still required.<br/><br/>In PtG you take control of a Chaos Champion. You are allotted 35 &quot;Favor Points&quot; with which to build your retinue of chaos followers. Available are anything from Barbarian marauders and Chaos Knights to Evil daemons and the foul chaos spawn! Once you've collected your War band you set out to battle against other war bands in a show of might and power. If the Chaos Gods are pleased with your performance they award you with their favor (Favor Points), although they may even punish you, as the will of the Gods of Chaos are fickle and unpredictable...<br/><br/>",

Several discs are chosen randomly to form a grid to start the game, and each player receives seven discs as his hand. Players also receive two challenge cards, each of which shows a pattern consisting of either three or four discs.<br/><br/>The idea is to find the card pattern somewhere in the grid. A player may use his discs to change the colors in the grid. For example, one color in the grid, say, blue, does not match the color he needs, say, orange, to complete the pattern. He can play a disc with a blue side on top of the blue disc in the grid. If the other side of the played disc is orange, then he is done. If not, he can add one or more discs to the same stack in the same fashion until the grid pattern matches the card pattern.<br/><br/>Draw new challenge cards as you complete them. Replenish to seven discs at the end of your turn and play until all discs have been used and no one can make a match.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arcane Guardian is a quick, fun solo dungeon crawler card game of tactics, scarce resource management, and luck. Ancient powers have risen and are threatening humanity once more. It is you, the Arcane Mage who must face them. You have to weaken them before they swarm the realm of the living. To do so, you have to confront all the terrors crawling deep below the surface. The goal of the game is simple: escape the dungeon. Will you live to see the daylight?<br/><br/>Arcane Guardian is lightweight and highly enjoyable from the very first play with enough depth to keep you entertained. You control a mage who wanders in an enchanted dungeon, opens treasure chests, fights monsters and drinks magical potions. You have to defeat numerous elementals and undead. Try to save as much Mana as possible, for if you run out of it, you cannot even emit light from your staff and are left in the dark. Your options are limited, while the dangers are many. In Arcane Guardian, every decision matters!<br/><br/>Arcane Guardian is a Print and Play card game. The deck contains 60 cards, and there are an additional 21 cards. One game takes about 10 minutes. The game is made up of steps that are to be carried out in a set order. In the beginning, you have three ways to go. You select a deck and interact with the upper card. If the chosen card was not revealed, then you must reveal it and instantly interact with it. You may collect the card or discard it into the discard pile. After an interaction&rsquo;s end, you have to reveal all cards that are unrevealed (face down) on top of a deck except on the one that you interacted with. If your health goes below 1, and you cannot heal than the game is over and you lose. You should always consider whether to fight an enemy and lose health, or cast spells and spend your mana. You may suffer several terrible curses that weaken you, but you can even their effects out with masks, or create powerful and interesting combinations of different positive and negative magical effects. Of course, luck has an impact on your gameplay, you have to roll a die when you open treasure chests and when you interact with traps.<br/><br/>You play until you find an ending card among the bottom six cards of a deck. If you successfully interact with it, then you win the game and escape the dungeon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The basic premise of the game is to acquire 10 virus-free Object cards that represent computer resources such as Graphics, Software, Web Pages, Games, Documents, and Email. Action cards provide game play strategy that allows players to introduce viruses (represented by tokens) onto their opponent&rsquo;s Object cards. You can&rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.<br/><br/>A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.<br/><br/>",

In many ways, the Gigamic games owe something to this one. In Rex, players stack colored balls onto nine pegs, one each per turn. The goals are to get three balls a) vertically on any one of the pegs b) horizontally on any level in any one row c) diagonally within any one row d) at the corners. It's not as confusing as it sounds once you read the instructions printed on the back of the box. Neat game. Probably didn't sell well.

        "description": "The Hat is a game for a good big company that plays it all together. Players one after another try to explain, show by pantomime or draw any word and all the others do their best to understand it. A performing player and those who coped with guessing words get winning points. Sometimes it happens that you need to describe several words but the time is always limited. Moreover player can cut down his time or make his task harder by any other way to earn more points. Players take the word samples from the hat or something modeling it. They decide how to fill the hat choosing words themes, their difficulty or language. It&rsquo;s easily possible to come across with unknown words or you can compose the tasks by your own self.<br/><br/>This parlor game has got its name after the game popular in many companies where you have to explain words written down at the sheets of paper that are put into a hat. The game mechanics is based on the popular russian games such as &ldquo;Associations&rdquo;, &ldquo;Crocodile&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stooping dog&rdquo;. Mostly well-known western board games of this genre are Activity and Alias. <br/>The Hat cards are the basis of the game &ndash; they describe the way of representing the word: to explain by words, to show or to draw it.<br/><br/>Players draw cards with face up from The Hat pile by turn and define the way of the word explanation. Finally played words bring winning points marked at the card. Also cards recount the time for the performance. It&rsquo;s possible to reduce explanation time to increase points. In this case the time is fixed by a dice roll. <br/>There are also 3 other card types with extra explanation terms. You get more points if you succeed using these cards. For example, you can take a complication card &ldquo;draw a word with your left hand&rdquo; as an addition to a simple drawing task.<br/><br/>The main trait of The Hat game is in the unlimited ways of using words. Only you decide what word should appear in the hat and what will be guessed by your company. Varieties are numerous because Russian dictionary contains 140 000 different words, and it&rsquo;s possible to play using any foreign language as well.<br/><br/>The game box contains of several word sets that differ by difficulty. They are sealed so nobody will see them before the game begins. You need to cut the word sets into the hat without opening it.<br/><br/>It also happens that players get tired of the word game after guessing the same words for several times. This will never happen with The Hat. Words from the basic sets suit only for the first play. New words can be downloaded from our web site or bought in the special boosters.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to be the first player to run out of crewmen because everyone knows the captains of boring voyages don't get promotions. You do this by sending them on missions they are not trained for, taking away vital equipment at the last second, and occasionally, just shooting them in the back and shoving them out an airlock.<br/><br/>Redshirts 2: Leprechaun's Revenge is an expansion, offering a new set of cards, featuring the evil protagonist, Leprechaun.

The deck consists of black, green, and gray cats (six each), blue and red cats (three each), golden cats (four), and eight music notes.<br/><br/>On a turn, you reveal a card, then stop and collect that card or reveal another card. If you reveal a type of card that's already been shown, then your turn ends, you collect nothing, and all revealed cards are laid face-down again. If you stop before this, you collect the revealed cards except for a revealed note card, which is turned face down again. If you collect a blue and red cat, thereby reuniting the lovecats, you score 2 points; if you collect a pair of matching cats, you score 1 point. Golden cats are wild and can be paired with any color. You cannot use the same blue cat to score for both lovecats and a pair.<br/><br/>The first player to score 8 points wins. You can do this solely by collecting cats, but another possibility is to start your turn by saying &quot;Note atsume&quot; (&quot;Collecting notes), then reveal only note cards &mdash; which are worth 1 point each &mdash; until you have a total of 8 points between cats and notes, thereby winning the game; if you flip anything other than a music note (i.e., a cat), your turn ends and you must hide those notes once again, while giving the cat card to the player on your left. Hope you didn't make them win!<br/><br/>",

Seems simple. It is. But the 'Green Fingers' cards turn up unexpected twists and turns.

There are lots of interesting, funny, and 'eye-opening' facts that players will learn along the way as they play the game.

By setting cunning questions and getting the right answers from the other players the thief of the paintings will soon be tracked down!<br/>A communicative memory game.<br/><br/>Mechanism: Players take turns submitting riddles. To submit a riddle, randomly take one of the colourful drawings and let everybody take a good look at it. Then cover the picture and ask a question to which the answer is a colour. The other players then mark their answer on a rotating disk and simultaneously reveal their answers. On a correct answer, you may move your pawn one step in the direction of the thief. The riddle submitter scores a point if at least one player gives the correct answer and at least one player gives a wrong answer. The game ends after a set number of rounds or when a player reaches (&quot;catches&quot;) the thief.<br/><br/>A variation included in the game lets you put riddles where the answer is a number.<br/>Other questions are also possible, but this requires pen and paper to write down the answers. Players can also supply their own drawings or photographs to ask questions about.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.<br/><br/>More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Merchants, with a number of changes<br/><br/><br/>",

This era saw the birth of the most renowned captains, famous for their incredible feats. Here are gathered the pirates that made their marks on history: some were great fighters or great adventurers, others relied on cunning to reach their goals. Choose your captain and play with your very own deck of action cards to get the advantage. Manage your hand by drawing weapons, items, movement and cannon fire cards. The seas being full of dangers and opportunities, take advantage of the fair winds but beware of storms, the Royal Navy and the Kraken. What will be your strategy? Brutal, quick, opportunistic or crafty? Get the most treasures, and bring them back to the capital!<br/><br/>In Terre Pirates, a card-driven game, each player embodies one of six famous pirates, such as Blackbeard, Anne Bonny and Bartholomew Roberts. Each pirate has his own deck of cards, leading to different strategies: while some are better at boarding ships, others are good navigators, or focus on stealing treasures from the others. On each turn, you will be able to play cards to move, fight or get treasures, and draw up to five cards from four different decks, depending on your current needs: navigation cards to move your ship, cannons to shoot your opponents, weapons to board ships, or items to get treasures. The first player to bring four treasures to the capital wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.<br/><br/>LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.<br/><br/>The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.<br/><br/>Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.<br/><br/>Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.<br/><br/>",

Play is on a 7x7 board, but the black and white squares are rotated 45 degrees so as to appear as diamonds to the players. There are 9 pieces per side: 5 &quot;runners&quot; and 4 &quot;guards&quot;. The object is to get a runner from your back row to the opponent's back row. Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards. Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions. Due to the diamond formation, guards are always on black squares and runners always on white squares.<br/><br/>Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, or all of one side's runners are eliminated.<br/><br/>This game plays quickly and easily. There aren't a lot of pieces, and the runners are in constant jeopardy from the guards. This is a game of deterrent: making sure your opponent doesn't take your pieces by setting up attacks of your own.<br/><br/>The sides seem to be the safest places for runners, but they're very vulnerable anywhere.<br/><br/>A &quot;lite&quot; game that is perfect for a few quick matches on a rainy day.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Politics simulates a simplified version of the presidential election in the United States of America (electoral votes based on the 1930 or 1950 census, depending upon the edition of the game).<br/><br/>The playing board represents a map of the United States showing each state and its capital.  The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>In the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.<br/><br/>The 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many &quot;counties&quot; (4-7 in each state) they win.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to collect a set of cards to become the winner.<br/><br/>Each player is given a hand of 7 cards at the start, while all the other cards are mixed into a common deck.  One player starts the game by drawing a card from the deck and playing it.  Character cards (those with an icon) are placed face down, while other cards are played face up.  Going clockwise, the next player plays a card of higher value from his or her hand or passes.  The player who drew and played the initial card is the last to decide whether to play a card of higher value or not.  The player who played the highest value card in the pile gains the initial card into his or her collection; all other cards are discarded.  Players replenish their hands after the conclusion of this round and the next round begins with the next player.<br/><br/>Once a player has collected a pre-determined set of Character cards (based on their icons), he or she can call an end to the game.  The players tally their scores from the cards in their hand and collection, and add any bonuses (for ending the game, the collected Character cards, etc).  The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The opponent then rolls the die and moves that many circles on the track.

In the middle are four squares, each of a player's colour, and in the corners are 3x3 grids used to store combinations of an opponent's captured pieces.<br/><br/>The movement proceeds the same as with chess except under the following circumstance. When a player captures a certain combination of three of the opponent's pieces, that player's King is able to move 2 spaces at a time. If another combination is captured, the King may move the three spaces (which is the maximum).<br/><br/>The game ends when one of two conditions is met: If a player is checkmated or if a player can get his/her King to the center square of his/her colour.<br/><br/>There are several variations to the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Broadsword - Wargame rules for Medieval Battles - Minatures Rules<br/><br/>The rules are a spin&mdash;off from Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age (by Lin Carter and Scott Bizar) which embody a functional combination of systems that lead to a playable and accurate simulation of medieval warfare when played without magic<br/><br/>Medieval battles were set piece affairs usually leading to an uncontroversial decision. Opposing armies deployed in sight of each other, just beyond maximum missile range, and received the sacraments before the engagement began. When &ldquo;infidels&rdquo; fought against them, European Christians displayed a special fervor to conquer all before them. Ironically, there were occasions, such as the sack of Rome in 1084, when commanders dispensed with the sacraments owing to the mixed composition of their armies. Feudal cavalry was the dominant battle winning component for most armies in this period, but its success often relied upon a close sense of coordination with civic militia and archer units, or special elite mercenary men&mdash;at&mdash;arms who formed the base from which the attack sprang. When peasant levies were included in any army, they were placed where they could do the least harm to the enemy or their own allies.<br/><br/>Woods, marshes, rivers, rocky terrain, or ocean fronts sometimes covered an army&rsquo;s flank as an anchor, but most battles took place in the open on a plain or in defense of a dominating height. Western armies rarely employed fancy turning maneuvers, and most battles between similar forces were resolved by direct brute force. Even so, the value of committing the last reserve for the ultimate decision was well appreciated. Islamic, Eurasian, and Byzantine armies, of course, applied much more sophisticated strategems, such as feigned retreats and sweeping double enfilades.<br/><br/>",

Boom Box can be played by 2 or more players at the same time: each player just needs the supplied deck of 27 cards (print and cut them); the faster the player gets rid of his cards, the better! The cards represent different notes in three different colours and different lengths. After each player has flipped over the first card from their decks (this card representing the Boom Box itself), they must play their cards to the left or right of the radio, respecting these two easy rules: if you want to place a card on the Boom Box left channel, this card does not have to have any characteristic in common - number of notes, colour, length - with the preceding one; on the other hand, if you want to place a card on the Boom Box right channel, it must have at least one thing in common with the previous one. It is easy, isn't it? But what if the goal is to have the same number of cards on the left and on the right? Things get interesting and slightly harder, but funnier as well! Challenge your friends in this fast competition, and you will see! As soon as cards are placed, players draw new ones from their decks: when a deck is emptied, the round is over and points are scored. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

One stone is in the field between the starting positions and the castle; it must be collected before the castle can be entered.  When a raven first enters the castle it gets one magic stone.  On subsequent turns the player rolls two dice to get zero to two additional magic stones (there are 12 in the castle in addition to the one in the fields).<br/><br/>The nature of a raven's current square determines the type of turn in has; in each case the player must guess a colour which will determine move distance.  On one type of field dice are rolled and spots in the guessed colour determine movement distance.  Another has a second player draw two cards and select one, with the first player's move distance determined by spots of the selected colour on the card.  In the final case, all players secretly select coloured chips and the guessed colour determines which chips will determine move distance.<br/><br/>",

The events contain nice stories but all amount to &quot;miss a go&quot; or &quot;swap a card with someone else&quot; style results. You stand a 2 in 3 chance of drawing a new part card, in which case you have to add it to your growing machine and discard one you don't need.<br/><br/>The machine itself is built much like dominoes.

Players fill their canoes with wares to trade to Indians in the territories for fur. When they are ready, or their canoe is full, they travel to a fort or a town to sell their furs at the current price. Because of the hazards involved in wilderness travel, it can behoove the explorer to fly the canoe back home. Flying is not without its perils, though, as the canoe may tip and the canoe's contents be lost.<br/><br/>This game involves action points (you have three to do with as you choose), smart card play (cards determine movement, crew, and other special abilities), and smart trading (what goods do I take to trade to the Indians?).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the year 122 Ad the Roman Emperor Hadrian visited the Romance province of Britannia and inspected Rome's military status there. When there he decided that Rome needed a military zone in northern Britain in order to keep the Brigante Tribes under their rule in check and be ready to put down rebellions. Additionally, it was well reasoned that the conceived of wall would also protect Rome from barbarian invasions from the independent tribes of the Scottish highlands. Construction began right away.<br/><br/>In the decades that followed Rome would send a number of expeditions north of the wall in an attempt to subjugate the remainder of the island. The Caledonian tribes of northern Scotland proved challenging to conquer and the hills and mountains of Scotland proved a challenging terrain for the Roman Legions to campaign in.<br/><br/>In this game 2-4 players will compete for dominance of Scotland. One of these players will always be the Romans. The other players will assume control of one or more of the major Caledonian tribes. Rome must conquer all of Scotland to win. The Caledonian tribes must work together, in part, to confront the mighty power of Rome, but should Rome be defeated, only one tribe can emmerge as the victor and warfare with the other tribes is a long tradition easily predating Rome's arrival in Britannia.<br/><br/>Guild of Blades has produced a 2nd Edition, featuring a new full color map and full color mounted units.<br/><br/>",

Two, four or eight players control respectively four, two or one sail boats. The winner is not always the first one to arrive, but the boat (among the ones arrived in time) that has scored the best points. Points are awarded or lost due to cards, not giving way to other boats when you should, passing the buoys first or on the wrong side and so on. The game uses dice, but it's not a new version of The Duck Game! There is space for luck (wind direction and other things) but also for some tactics and for some cooperation between boats of the same player. For this reason the best way to play it is in two or four people.<br/><br/>",

Here&rsquo;s the case Jake is being chased by a buffalo stampede when he comes to a wide, deep river. To escape, he must cross the river, but there is no bridge and he has no boat. He cannot even swim. Nonetheless, he easily gets away and, although the river is full, he doesn&rsquo;t even get wet. Why is Jake able to cross the river, and why don&rsquo;t the buffalo follow? If you don&rsquo;t know the answer, the clues will get you closer&hellip; How many will you need? 1) Jake uses no equipment or tools to cross. 2) The buffalo weigh over 1,000 pounds each, but Jake weighs only 100 pounds. 3) It&rsquo;s wintertime.

Pieces can move a single space or jump any other pieces any number of times. If a piece jumps a subordinate piece of the opponent, it is captured and removed from play. Priests beat lawyers, lawyers beat psychiatrists, and psychiatrists beat priests. Any piece can capture the citizen. The board is a 9x9 grid of squares; each player starts from a home corner and moves towards the opposite (opponents) corner. On every move, a piece must end up farther forward than it began.<br/><br/>A number of variants are provided, e.g. &quot;Dictator&quot; where there is no capturing, and one in which players may set up their pieces as they wish.<br/><br/>Created by a psychiatrist, the pieces are modeled &quot;according to WH Sheldon's somatotypes&quot; - &quot;priests are round, comfortable, and cuddly, lawyers square and forceful, psychiatrists triangular, lean and edgy.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the game box:<br/><br/>This game involves a little old lady and her attempt to prevent the pipeline from being built. During her campaign, the public goes through an energy crisis and the oil companies leave Alaska. Another character in the game is called the little professor, and it&rsquo;s his job to answer all of the objections to the pipeline. The objective of this game is to refute the attacks on the pipeline then get the permit to build it.<br/>Played with cards on a board, which contains the map of Alaska, the scoring spaces are gas-ration coupons. Use the least amount of gas-ration coupons and win the game.<br/>Pipeline comes ready to play. It includes a game board, game pieces (6 pawns), rule sheet and 52 playing cards.<br/><br/>additional from the 1990&rsquo;s reissue box:<br/><br/>The first game based on the energy crisis came out in 1973. Called Alaska Pipeline referring, of course, to the source of oil we were hoping to receive from Alaska. The Trans-Alaskan Pipeline was completed in 1977 and we have been utilizing the oil since then.<br/>Now, nearly three decades later we are faced with yet another energy crisis and it&rsquo;s time to play the game again.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The games underlying purpose is (was) to educate and create support for the Alaska Pipeline to be built, and it does it by placing facts, opinions, events, and objections about The Pipeline onto playing cards &ndash; the game, in mechanics reality, is actually really just a Hearts card game variant, and the board&rsquo;s 100 &ldquo;gas-ration coupon&rdquo; spaces simply represent the scoring total.<br/><br/>4 suits of cards (&ldquo;Oil Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;Objection&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Public&rdquo; &ndash; 13 of each) represent the four suits. Players gain/use &ldquo;gas-ration&rdquo; points by getting stuck with the &ldquo;Objection&rdquo; cards during trick taking (which are 1 point each, like the hearts suit in Hearts), or the &ldquo;Oil Company&rdquo; Pipeline Permit card (which counts as 13, like the queen of spades in Hearts). Players move their pawns up the board the number of points acquired after each round. Though, if one player can take them all (the 13 &ldquo;Objection&rdquo; and the Pipeline Permit card) they can either advance the other players 26 points, or deduct 26 from their own total and move back on the board. This game also includes the Native Land Claims &quot;Fact&quot; card allowing the trick taker to deduct 10 points (i.e. like the jack of diamonds variant in Hearts). After the first player reaches 100 gas-ration coupon points, they lose and the game is over and the player with the lowest gas-ration points wins. There are also rules for 3, 5 and 6 player games.<br/><br/>",

However, it requires that you correctly answer questions based on children's literature from many different periods.  While some of the questions seem rather obscure, for a literature lover, this game is a fun test of knowledge.  But it primarily is designed for all ages.<br/><br/>It also is an excellent tool to help young readers, and even non-readers to extract answers from text selections.  You don't have to have read all or any of the books referenced to play.  You don't even have to be a reader, so young children can play too, as long as there is a reader to help them.<br/><br/>",

Some examples of rules are:<br/><br/>&quot;No Swear Words.&quot;, &quot;No Pointing with your Finger.&quot; &quot;No crossing your arms or legs.&quot;<br/><br/>Will your opponents catch you or will you get away with it? As the game progresses, you&rsquo;ll have many of these rules in effect at the same time. You&rsquo;ll be afraid to speak or even move. If you&rsquo;re really good you&rsquo;ll be able to trick other players into breaking the rules.<br/><br/>Some of the Rule Cards allow you to make up your own rules.  All new rules begin as &ldquo;Community&rdquo; rules and must be obeyed by all players. But if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to draw a rule-changing card, you can give any rule to any player you choose to pick on. Now only that player has to play by that rule. But revenge is mighty sweet since there are several of these cards, and you may soon find yourself on the receiving end.<br/><br/>",

The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank.  Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.<br/> One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot;  The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.<br/><br/>When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.<br/><br/>The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.<br/><br/>",

The garden goes through a natural growth cycle and through the seasons.  But you have you watch out for pests and bad weather!<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to roll the die and move their gardener playing piece clockwise around the board.  The square that is landed on provides instructions on which plants can be put in the garden, which are in bloom, which have been killed off by frost etc...<br/><br/>Seeds, bulbs and flowering plants are taken from a tray known as &quot;Mother Nature's Garden Shop&quot; and placed in the appropriate place on the player's garden card. In so doing the garden becomes populated with seed, bulbs and plants which mature and flower as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The first player to get their whole garden into bloom is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Launched Essen 2005, Wordwild is a wordgame with a speed element. The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.<br/><br/>The game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.<br/><br/>As quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.<br/><br/>The game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.<br/><br/>Players put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.<br/><br/>It is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available. But after a while, you can get into the flow and the game moves very quickly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Domina is a traversal game by noted New Zealand game and puzzle designer Karl Scherer. The object is to get one of your pieces to the opposite end of the board before your opponent does the same.<br/><br/>The board is an 8x8 square grid, and the pieces are rectangles in two colors, seven for each player, each spanning two square spaces. Dominos in two colors on a standard Checker board work well. On a turn, a player pins one end of any of his/her pieces, then rotates it 90&deg; clockwise. If, and only if, that would cause the rotating end of the piece to occupy a space that is either already filled, off the board or behind the pivot end of the piece, continue rotating the piece another 90&deg; to 180&deg;. Likewise, continue rotating another 90&deg; to 270&deg; if the next target space is unavailable or illegal. If none of the three target spaces make a legal move, the player must select a different piece to move. The first to land one end of a piece on the opposite row wins.<br/><br/>",

Game enthusiasts now get to join in the fun with the release of The Great Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Game. As in the annual Macy's march down Broadway, Santa Claus takes center stage. The player (two to four can compete) whose Santa travels the entire parade route and enters the Herald Square store first wins. Depending on the roll of the dice &mdash; and the float or balloon square landed on &mdash; game pieces move forward or loss ground. &quot;Surprise cards&quot; keep the action going.<br/><br/>Greengrass enjoys playing the game with her 4-year-old grandson, but says she'll be out on the real parade route again this holiday.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of the Second Boer War commencing October, 1899.<br/><br/>Game comes in a small 9&quot; x 6 1/2&quot; x 7/8&quot; box with a cover illustration of a well-dressed Victorian family playing a map-and-pin flags boardgame of the war.<br/><br/>The cardstock hex map measures 16 1/2&quot; x 11 5/8&quot; and depicts the region of conflict running from cape Town and Port Elizabeth in the south to Mateking in the west, the Rhodesian border in the north and the port of Lourenco Marques in the east.<br/><br/>Map has one-inch hexes featuring Clear, Hill, Railway, River, and Mountain terrain plus economic centers and ports.  The mounted, pre-cut 3/4&quot; counters featuring forty green Boer Commandos of various strengths, Command Flags (three per player), two Natives, thirty-five &quot;Gold&quot; (Supplies), twenty red British Infantry brigades, twelve red British Cavalry brigades, and five red British Garrisons plus a Turn Marker.  Two D6 are also included.<br/><br/>Unit counters feature, as appropriate, a drawing of a Boer horseman firing at the gallop, native shields, national flags, British lancer, British infantry, and a field gun with crew (for garrisons).  Counters include deployment location or turn of appearance, combat strength, and movement allowance.  Historical unit identifications are also included.<br/><br/>Normal game length is fifteen turns (victory determined by holding the most economic production centers) or, optionally, thirty-six turns (pursuing the bittereinder to the last counter; if one survives to the end, the Boers win).<br/><br/>Rules cover reinforcements, the British War Chest, Natives, Neutrals, Railways, Sea and Off-map Movement, Multi-hex combat, Sieges, and the assymetrical nature of opposing forces.<br/><br/>Movement is handled in a distinctive way.  Each turn, Boer and British players alternate placing a &quot;flag&quot; on the map (numbered between One and Six).  After placement, players alternate moving units adjacent to these flags.  Units must stop if they move adjacent to a hostile unit.  Following this &quot;Consolidation Movement,&quot; Combat occurs.<br/><br/>After Combat, surviving units may engage in &quot;Dispersal Movement,&quot; which is the opposite of Consolidation Movement.  Movement to and from flags takes place sequentially in the order of numbered flags.<br/><br/>Optionally, players may place their flags simultaneously rather than sequentially; in this instance, players plot the hex number where each flag will be placed.  Another option allows for random flag draws from a cup.<br/><br/>Combat is determined by odds ration and a singld D6 die roll.  The resulting number indicates the &quot;Butcher's Bill&quot; imposed upon either the S (smaller force) or L (larger force) engaged.  Losses are in units removed; the Boer player may retreat in lieu of taking losses if his units may retreat the full amount (one or two) and not move next to any British or native unit.  &quot;Gold&quot; (supplies) may not retreat and may be captured.<br/><br/>",

You're the host and you have to decide how many and which ones to invite.  Do you want an exclusive party where only select meeples are welcome?  Or do you want a wild riot of a party where everybody is welcome?  Each has its merits and both are subject to unwelcome party crashers.  The player who has the most valuable party at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The game was designed for and given to attendees of Unity Games X on January 21, 2006.<br/><br/>",

Next they set out to design a series of new games which use the same pieces and board but have either more modern moves or conditions of victory to make them appeal to today&rsquo;s game players.<br/><br/>The classic games that you will find in the book are;<br/><br/>Alquerque(&quot;Alquerque&quot; is a Checkers variant) from Spain<br/>Seega(&quot;Seega&quot;) from Africa and Egypt<br/>Cercar La Liebre(similar to &quot;Catch the Hare&quot;) also from Spain<br/>Five Field Kono(&quot;Five Field Kono&quot;) from Korea<br/><br/>The new games from Acorn Games in the book are;<br/><br/>&quot;Fortress&quot;, a &quot;condition&quot; game<br/>&quot;Centaurs&quot;, a &quot;replacement&quot; game<br/>&quot;Troop&quot;, another replacement game<br/>&quot;Neutrino&quot;, another condition game<br/><br/>In a &quot;Replacement Game&quot; the players are each trying to get from<br/>their starting point to where their opponent started out from.<br/>Sort of like in &quot;Chinese Checkers&quot;<br/><br/>In a &quot;Condition Game&quot; the players<br/>are trying to be the first player to DO something.

Each set of colored chips is segmented into 3 sets (10 each) of 1, 2, and 3-minute activities. Play starts when each player antes up a corresponding minute chip and 5 cards are dealt (a 1-minute ante must be matched by another 1-minute ante and so on). As play progresses, each player may elect to call, raise, or fold. Players bet by choosing among the chips that contain the activities that they would be willing to perform in the event they lose. At showdown, the player with the best poker hand will get to receive all of the chip activities that were bet from the other player. For example, if the guy wins the hand, the woman must now perform all of the activities contained on the pink chips that were bet into the pot. When you ante up, you are not deciding what you want done to you; you are choosing what you will do for your partner. This way, players own comfort level will dictate how 'hot' things get. Choose your own variation of poker or stick with the standard 5-card draw. Poker rules and a hand-ranking sheet are included.<br/><br/>",

As you would expect, players hope to make profits by buying and selling shares in one or more of six companies whose prices can rise or fall dramatically during the course of the game. Share prices are affected by several means.<br/>1 - Market Information cards. These have immediate effect on one (or more rarely all) companies once a player lands on a particular square<br/>2 - The Stock Exchange. Players select a company in which they have a minimum holding and roll dice to determine the extent and direction of the share price of that company.<br/>3 - Inside Information cards. The most fun, these cards can be kept by players and played at the most advantageous moment. For example, by raising a share price immediately before you sell, or dropping it as you want to buy (or your opponents sell!).<br/><br/>This UK game was released at the height of the yuppie, 'greed is good' period in the late 80's.<br/><br/>",

Cowards all, why suffer the slings and arrows of abject defeat! All you can lose are your paint skins. No longer suffer the permanent scars of sorcery so that your own mothers won't know you, webbed feet, pointed ears (sorry Mr. Spock) and other aids to charm and elegance. See no more your followers disappear in a puff of smoke or vanish with the light of day - just put them away until next time, etc., etc., etc. This is for you, a representation of those days of long, long ago. Fight the Men of the West, defeat the powers of darkness in safety on a wargames table. By the wizardry of Miniature Manufacturers the forces of Dark and Light are reduced to 1/75th their full size. At least, manageable Treemen! Read on for further enlightenment.&quot;<br/><br/>",

But there are subtle differences: instead of streets the tracks are mostly illustrations of different Casino-related games.  When a player lands on a track with a specified game, he must play that game by placing a bet using play money and drawing the related card.  The card drawn will show the &quot;summarized&quot; result whether the player wins money or loses them.

Nothing like this actually happened, though the Allies went to great lengths to convince the Axis powers that such plans were intended in order to mislead them <br/>as to their true intentions. Nonetheless, some Allied strategists and leaders, including Winston Churchill, believed that an invasion of Europe via the Balkans was a legitimate and war-winning activity. Hence, the game is partially a reflection of the concepts and anxieties of both sides.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals about 20 miles (about 30 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents 2-5 days, depending on the scenario chosen and the weather currently in effect. Every ground unit represents a division, division-equivalent, or brigade of about 5,000 to 20,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles.[...]<br/><br/>This game has 3 scenarios: <br/>&ndash; Operation BOARDMAN: In summer 1943, the British 8th Army is sent to liberate Greece and Crete. This was a deception to cover Operations HUSKY and AVALANCHE, the historical invasions of Sicily and Salerno.[...]<br/>&ndash; Operation ZEPPELIN: In summer 1944, the notional British 12th Army attacks Greece and Albania while the US 7th Army attacks in Dalmatia, in concert with Soviet amphibious operations against the coast of Rumania and Bulgaria. This plan was part of Operation BODYGUARD, the overall deception plan to disguise Operations OVERLORD and ANVIL (the invasions of northern and southern France).[...]<br/>&ndash; Operation GELIGNITE: Actual plans were drawn up to send the British 8th Army across the Adriatic in late 1944 or early 1945 to cut off the final retreat of German Army Group F and forestall any further Soviet advances towards northern Italy. The plan was shelved due to shortages of troops and landing craft.[...]<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>(source: rulebook and user's description)<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2-5 days (depending on scenario)<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 30 kilometers<br/>Units: Brigade to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15<br/><br/>",

A United States citizen twenty-one years old could file a claim on 160 acres of public land which he wished to own as a home for himself and his family.  If he lived there for five years, had built a house and was raising crop, he was given title to the land.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The country was wild, the problems faced by the &quot;sod-busters&quot; were great.  Many homesteaders gave up before five years had passed.  Everyone who succeeded did so through sheer determination and by using every skill or handicraft he could master.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards and playing them onto their Land Tracts.  The cards come in 5 colors, one for each year.  At the end of the game, players who have a house, crop, and 4 of the 6 other types of cards, without having the claim jumper card, win.<br/><br/>",

The basic game provides a good blend of strategy and luck, while advanced rules allow for either pure skill games, or ones where luck is more of a factor. Suitable for solitaire, one to five individual players, and several combinations of teams.<br/><br/>The game of Tesserae pits players against one another, meshing colored tiles into the ever-evolving play field, each trying to exhaust their supply of tiles while preventing their opponents from doing the same. Skillful strategy can pay off, but be careful -- things can change on the luck of a draw! This is a game that will stretch your brain.<br/><br/>",

For the German, it is to sink cargo and oil tankers in demanding quantities and or destroy oil refineries, depending on orders. The German must find and sink tankers with oil cargo moving to refineries. For the Allied player, they must move their oil and cargo ships across the map. Oil tankers must land at a refinery, unload the oil, refine it, reload it and then move the tanker off the map with the oil through U-boat infested water. Cargo ships with non-oil material must also cross the map. Of course, their other objective is to use their bombers and meager ASW force to sink U-boats!<br/><br/>Available in both DTP and Print-n-Play<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game from Nigeria that may be played by two players or teams. Traditionally the game was played on an area consisting  of 5x6 spaces using sticks or stones for pieces.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players taking alternating turns placing one of their twelves pieces in an empty space. Once all of the pieces have been placed, the players alternate moving one of their pieces into an adjacent empty space. Diagonal movement is not allowed.<br/><br/>When a player moves a piece to cause three of their pieces to be in a row, that player may remove one opposing piece that is not part of a row of three such pieces. Players are not permitted to make a move which results in more than three of their pieces being in a row. A player wins the game when the opposing player is unable to make a a row of three pieces.<br/><br/>",

It moves as a Rook, except that it must jump over an intervening piece (called a screen) to capture a piece. When it doesn't capture a piece, it merely moves as a Rook.<br/><br/>The Arrow is the equivalent of the cannon but operates on the diagonals<br/><br/>The board is played with a 'river'<br/><br/>As a compromise with Chinese Chess, the Eurasian King may not cross the river.

When the Armada arrived at Calais they anchored off the coast while the army got ready for the invasion. The English used fire ships to attack the Armada. The tactic forced the Spanish to cut their anchors and left them scattered and vulnerable to attack. The English ships pounded the disorganized fleet until they ran low on powder and shot, causing considerable damage. With the Armada low on provisions and blown by an uncooperative wind the Spanish decided to abandon the invasion plan and sail north around the British Isles and back to Spain.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature ships. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.<br/><br/>Concepts covered in the game include cannon fire (front and broadside), fouling, grappling, boarding, drifting, and wind effects.<br/><br/>Colored yarn is taped around the edges of the game table to give a quick visual guide to the effect of the wind based on which color a ship is facing. &ldquo;Green yarn marked the East and South table edges (wind at your back, full speed). Yellow yarn bordered the West edge, and 2/3 of the North edge (close quartered, half speed). Red yarn ran 2.5' south from the northwest corner (can't move directly into the wind).&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WWF Superstars Card Game was sold in double packs featuring two WWF wrestlers.  Each wrestler is represented by a 30-card deck, although the card distribution is identical for each deck.<br/><br/>Players draw a hand of four cards and take turns either playing or discarding a card and then drawing a new one.  Players try to have the highest Takedown card in the center stack.  Break] cards restart the stack.  If a player is unable to play a card, they must discard.  If your opponent discards, you can then play a Pin card, which can only be defeated by an Illegal Hold.  If you are able to play two <i>Pin</i> cards and then a Referee, you gain 3 points, and a new round begins.  Else, if both players' decks run out, the last player to play a card gains 1 point.  The first player to 5 points wins.<br/><br/>Out of the box, the game is for 2 players.  However, a second set allows for 4-player tag team matches.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game.<br/><br/>From Mancala World:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Huroy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Huroy</a><br/><br/>Huroy is a mancala game played by the Mursi people in the lower Omo valley, Ethiopia, at Ulichagi and Bilugu. They live in one of the least accessible areas of Ethiopia and many of them are heavily armed with guns.<br/><br/>The game is a recreation of adult males who play in the shade of trees. The board is dug in the ground.<br/><br/>Huroy was first recorded by the British anthropologist David Turton in the early 1970s who was the first European to visit them. At this time the Mursi didn't even know that they live in a country called Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a two-row board of six holes (holog, pl. hologunya) per row. One end of the board is called saba (&quot;head&quot;), the other end karenni (&quot;downstream&quot;). Initially each hole contains four stones (be, pl. benna, also known as benna huroin = &quot;huroy stones&quot;).<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one by one into the ensuing holes. The move ends after a single lap.<br/><br/>If, at the start of his turn, a player has a singleton and the opponent's opposite hole is occupied, he captures the contents of both these holes. Note that a capture is not effected by alighting in an empty hole.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has nothing to move with. The remaining stones are won by the player who moved last.<br/><br/>The player who has captured more stones wins the game. Winning a game is referred to as &quot;driving a cow&quot;.<br/><br/>Players try to achieve 10 victories called katog uli (&quot;I drive a bull.&quot;).<br/><br/>Huroy Sayings<br/><br/>If a player places his penultimalte stone into his last hole of the saba end and the last stone into the opposite hole, he might say karag saba (&quot;I hit the head.&quot;). At the other end of the board he says karag karenni (&quot;I hit downstream.&quot;).<br/><br/>If a player captures just a single stone from an opponent's hole, he would say kamati lili (&quot;I am eating two holes opposite each other.&quot;). If he captures more, he would remark kamati uro (&quot;I am drinking milk.&quot;).<br/><br/>",
