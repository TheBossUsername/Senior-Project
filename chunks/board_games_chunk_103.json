Small plastic model kits are used as its miniatures with each taken from the Gundam series. The game uses a d10 dice system for determining initiative, attacks, dodges, maneuvers and other actions taken.<br/><br/>9 plastic models were offered individually for the game as its miniatures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sometimes the bad guys pull off a big heist, and sometimes the good guys can stop the crime before it happens. But in the long run, it&rsquo;s all about style.<br/><br/>In Chicago&rsquo;s Finest, you take the role of the titular boys in blue, or their nemesis, the mob. Both sides are working hard to either perpetuate or prevent crime - but their primary concern is looking sharp.<br/><br/>Players tactically deploy cards representing guys, weapons, tools, and even K9 units in attempt to conjure up precisely enough cool to match the crime of the day. How much style is needed is determined by the Time, Day, Neighborhood, Location, and type of Crime &ndash; which change every day. The game lasts seven days.<br/><br/>Chicago&rsquo;s Finest is quick, free to print out, and different every time you play it. Game mechanics somewhat resemble Blackjack, but with a variable target number, as well as an arsenal of tricks and card synergies that let you manipulate your and your opponent&rsquo;s card total.<br/><br/>Download the game in the BGG Files section.<br/><br/>",

The trick, of course, is to minimize interaction with the &ldquo;natives&rdquo; and not damage the flow of history.<br/><br/>Players search for clues in five different time periods &ndash; Ancient Greece, Legendary Baghdad, Feudal Japan, Elizabethan England, and the Harlem Renaissance &ndash; in attempt to deduce and pinpoint the location of the lost time travelers.<br/><br/>Players collect clue cards through detective work, and can also steal clue cards from their unsuspecting opponents. When a player collects a set of clues from the same time period, he or she can attempt to make contact and confirm if the individual they&rsquo;ve been tracking is indeed a fellow time traveler. The player&rsquo;s hunches will often be correct. But invariably these hunches are sometimes wrong, and players have to plan ahead to make sure they&rsquo;re able to deal with feisty natives.<br/><br/>The first player to rescue five lost time travelers wins.

During the trick-taking game, each of you has a unique special power you can use to bend the rules of the game, but when one special power activates, any other active one goes away.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll trade the cards you accumulate during the first phase and use them to purchase special one-shot FX in the trading phase.<br/><br/>Any cards you have left over at the start of the creation phase turn into action tokens. You use action tokens to gather workers and to have your workers build creations. You can also use the FX you purchased in phase two to help your workers. The game ends when a player has five or more creations at the end of the third phase. If you have the most creations at the end of the game, you win.<br/><br/>The Unnamed Game requires a Special Powers deck, an FX deck, a Creation Tracker. You can download these from the publisher. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide a Poker deck, about 5 six-sided dice per player, a unique pawn for each player, a totem, and about 30 tokens.<br/><br/>A three-player game takes about 40 minutes to play. The Unnamed Game&rsquo;s unusual structure and strategic nature probably makes it appropriate for ages 14 and older.<br/><br/>",

Similarly a vice at the head of a snake results in the outcome at its tail (eg argumentative --&gt; isolated; worried --&gt; tired).<br/><br/>A booklet accompanies the game that defines each virtue/vice in one sentence simply understood by a 7 year old.<br/><br/>Some squares allow the player to draw from the 'Virtue deck'. &quot;These cards describe how a virtuous attitude can rescue you from the karmic payback  for hurtful, negative attitudes.&quot;<br/><br/>The final variation on the traditional game is the last eight squares called the Safe Zone, which allow the player to draw from the 'Power Deck' of cards. &quot;On reaching this zone of the 8 Powers you are safe under their canopy, protected from all negative influences, because an inner voice guides you away from situations which steal your energy. In this zone you enjoy strength, good fortune and happiness.&quot;<br/><br/>A score pad is included that encourages each player to write down each of the virtues that they accumulate during the game.<br/><br/>The material does not appear to be specific to any one religion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jaw Breaker is a rather simple roll and move game with an interesting twist. A major component of the game is the large plastic shark into the mouth of which 4&quot; balloons are inserted.<br/><br/>A plastic game mat lays out a path from the site of a shipwreck across several islands to the shore. The objective is to move your castaway towards the shore by the roll of the die.<br/><br/>On the board are both red and white spaces. Each time the marker stops on a red space, the player is required to rotate the dorsal fin of the shark. As the shark's mouth closes, pressure is put on the balloon, eventually causing it to burst (two small pins inside the shark's mouth insure eventual destruction of the balloon). How much pressure is required is primarily dependent on the inflation level of the balloon.<br/><br/>If the player causes the balloon to burst, he or she returns their castaway to the starting position and the shark is reset with a new balloon. The winner is the first player to successfully reach the shore.<br/><br/>",

Pulling back to regroup, Budyonny&rsquo;s  men continued to be held in check.

The game requires a print-and-play mapsheet, a standard deck of playing cards, and a six-sided die.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Historical Background (1519 - 1521): In the great Aztec city of Tenochtitlan Emperor Montezuma had reason to worry. It was the year of One Reed, when the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl would return to bring an end to Aztec civilization. A comet had been seen in the sky, a very bad omen.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Messengers arrived to tell Montezuma that powerful strangers had arrived at the coast. The strangers were Spaniards under the command of Hernan Cortes. Montezuma was paralyzed by indecision. Should he fight the newcomers or welcome them?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He would soon learn that the Spanish conquistadors were on a mission to conquer and loot the Aztec empire. They brought with them horses, powerful weapons, and deadly germs. Many of the local tribes saw the invaders as a chance to defeat their Aztec overlords and joined their army. Cortes and his men would destroy Tenochtitlan and the Aztec empire.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game ends once Cortes (controlled by the teacher) has conquered the Aztecs by destroying their armies or occupying their capital. Sample questions for classroom discussion are included.<br/><br/>",

Players use coins and bills to pay for purchases, compute change, handle allowances and gifts, collect earnings, and make deposits into college savings accounts. They are rewarded for accuracy, taking advantage of sales, saving money for college, and making thoughtful decisions. Transactions mirror the real world, adding value and excitement. Game variations offer two difficulty levels. In Allowance, the winner is the player with the most money in college savings. No financial transactions are recorded. In Managing My Allowance, players keep simple financial records. The winner is the player with the most money in college savings plus what is saved because of the sales.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Logjam is a simple and exciting race game for two to six players.  Each player tries to be the first to move all of his loggers through a treacherous maze of logs. The players build a different maze for each game, and all of the logs can move during play.  Every game of Logjam provides a new challenge, and the winner is never certain until the very end.  While a player moves his loggers through the logjam, he can also try to confound his rivals.  With certain die rolls, he can move the logs to block his opponent's path and open new paths for himself.  He may be able to squeeze an opponent's logger between two logs and make it start over.  Strategy-minded players will try to position their loggers to take advantage of any number that they may roll.  Others will enjoy raising havoc.<br/><br/>Get the full game here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.rich-and-sharon.org/al/Logjam01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.rich-and-sharon.org/al/Logjam01.htm</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Back Cover<br/>The scope of wargaming is almost boundless.  Wargamers can create simulations of the simplest encounter or the grandest strategy.  Armoured warfare in miniature has a special appeal.<br/>The model tank wargamer can take advantage of the superb range of miniature model tanks available and the many books detailing modern weaponry to recreate this style of fighting that was born on the Somme in 1916 and came of age in 1940.  Perfect scale models and accurate rules combine to produce an almost faultless simulation of tank warfare - all that is missing is the clatter of tracks, the roar of engines and the crump of shellfire.<br/>This book lays the complete groundwork on the subject.  It explains how to use the many different armoured fighting vehicles, their guns, caliber, missile weight, range, angle of impact, thickness of armour; and does the same for anti-tank weapons.  It provides essential information on communications, mines, infantry co-operation, aircraft and armoured operations, and battlefields; it also provides practical information on how to assemble armoured forces in miniature and table-top terrains over which they can battle.<br/>The authors are well known veteran wargamers.  Donald Featherstone served with the Royal Tank Regiment in North Africa and Italy during World War II; his associate, Keith Robinson, is an adviser to one of the main manufacturers of model fighting vehicles for wargamers.<br/>Together they have clearly and simply brought this modern style of warfare to the table-top battlefield and provide technical and tactical advice against a fascinating background of wargaming narrative with ten historical scenarios spanning the lifetime of the tank, from an armoured car action in 1914 to the Middle East conflicts of recent history.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Star Wars Adventures is a series of novel-driven set-piece adventure games marketed for direct to home sales by Scholastic, Inc. and Lucas Books / Lucasfilms LTD. The game is generally structured along the lines of the 1970s-1980s era &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; (CYOA) novels, except using pregenerated heroic characters from the Star Wars universe, more linear story lines and an &quot;adventure points&quot; scoring system. Players risk losing points for making poor decisions and for bad die rolls, but unlike most earlier CYOA books, seldom (if ever) risk character death. While the adventures are designed for solo play, the adventure points system allows for competitive, partnership or cooperative play by several players.<br/><br/>Characters have different RPG-like attributes (name, life-form, allegiance, charm, knowledge, navigation, power, skill, stealth, strength, weaponry and talents). Devices and Powers that the characters might use are rated for accuracy in different circumstances. Similarly, Vehicles are rated by type, speed, distance, stealth and weaponry. Combinations of these attributes are used along with d10 or d20 rolls to determine &quot;adventure numbers&quot; during decisions and confrontations that, in turn, affect both the direction of the storyline and the adventure points score.<br/><br/>Star Wars Adventures is packaged in a plastic carrying case shaped like a flattened Clone Trooper helmet. The base game includes a membership card, adventure poster, d10, d20, character cards, power cards, device cards, vehicle cards, an adventure guide, notebook, point pad, adventure novel and game book. Expansions include additional cards of all types, posters, novels, magazines and game books. Modules in the series are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Hunt the Sun Runner (Ryder Windham, 2002) -- This module is set in the period between Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. A ghost ship is on a crash course with a helpless planet. First you must find it. Then you must stop it.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a plastic tile board and 100 various tiles each with a letter and point assigned to it on each side. The game has five different variations of play. In Game One: The grid begins empty except for the word LOOKEE spelled out in the center. Using at least one letter on the board each player must take turns making their own word (with the 7 tiles they began with) using at least one pre-existing tile.Each turn must be finished within 30 seconds. These words could be spelled forward, backward, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player scores points for all the letters on their new word. After each turn, the player who went replenishes back to seven tiles. The player with the most points after the grid is filled is the winner. Game Two: First player to reach 100 points wins. In this game, the entire tile board is filled with letters at random. The first player tries to locate a word in any direction, and receives the added points for that word. The tiles used are then flipped over creating a new board every turn. The next player goes and so on. Only 30 seconds per turn. Game Three: Same as game two except additional option. Look for letter groupings that can be rearranged to form words. E.G. T,C,R,U,K can be TRUCK. First to 100 points wins. Game Four: Play solitaire by setting up the board as in Game One. Score as many points as possible in a given time period. Game Five: By using another game board, a duplicates version could be played by using identical letters and setting a time limit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game from Beni Amir &amp; Mensa (the place in Eritrea, not the club). From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Beni_Amir_%26_Mensa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Beni_Amir_%26_Mensa</a>):<br/><br/>&quot;Qelat is a common name for mancala variants played in western Eritrea. In Bil&eacute;n it is the plural of qeltay, the name of the seeds used in the game. This particular variant is played among the Beni Amir and Mensa people, mainly by elders and young boys in their leisure time, as well as by males generally, especially during the period after marriage ceremonies. The elders often played it for large stakes, such as a hundred cows or a piece of land.<br/><br/>It was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Qelat II (Game 11) who stated that &quot;the counting of balls in the course of play is fully permissible.&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Qelat is played by two players.<br/><br/>The game board consists of two rows of six holes. Initially, there are 4 seeds in each hole.<br/><br/>Qelat is a two-directional game played on a twelve-hole board without pre-designated storehouse holes. As the game proceeds, each player creates up to six storehouse holes, called waldas.<br/><br/>On each turn, players sow only from one of the six holes on their own side of the board, but not from waldas. Seeds from the three holes on a player's right are sown counter-clockwise, whereas seeds from the three holes on a player's left are sown clockwise. Qelat is a single lap mancala game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture holes, which is done, as in many games, by dropping the last ball in any hand into a hole containing three balls which are thus increased to four. Such captured holes, corresponding to the weg of other areas, are known as walda, but can be captured only in certain parts of the board.<br/><br/>The leftmost and rightmost holes on either player's own side of the board, as well as the outer two holes on the opponent's side of the board are eligible to become waldas for that player.<br/><br/>Thereafter seeds accumulate in walda(s) from the sowing of both players. Waldas are not skipped as incorrectly stated by Mohr.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who accumulates the largest number of balls in his walda(s).<br/><br/>Unlike many other mancala games, a player who is unable to move passes turns until a legal move is available. When neither player can move, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player who has captured the most seeds wins.<br/><br/>Pankhurst didn't say how to avoid repetition of board positions. It is suggested to use the following rule from another mancala game (Mazagebh I (Game 12)) of the same region: When a player moves a ball across the end of the board to his opponent's opposite hole the latter player is forbidden to shift the ball back in the following move.&quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971. 'Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa', in Ethiopia Observer; 14 (3): 204.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another simplistic sailing simulation, this one is based on a real event: the sailing competition of the XXI (21st) Olympic Games, Canada 1976. It comes with a huge (58x78cm) board, 6 boats, 3 buoys, 2 dice, a set of sailing cards and a set of advantage cards. Players sail one of the triangle courses as printed on the map; each course is used for a number of boat classes. Start and finish lines are also printed on the board. Wind direction is constant (South), as is the wind force, but some currents are printed on the board that influence the direction sailed. Players roll dice to move, and they need certain die rolls to start the race, change direction or gain sailing or advantage cards. Sailing cards represent difficulties the player must cope with (so they are, in effect, &quot;disadvantage&quot; cards). Special rules apply in the immediate areas around the turn marker buoys. Otherwise, some basic yachting rules, in particular right-of-way rules, must be observed.<br/>The game is completely bi-lingual (English &amp; French, as befits the location) and comes with an &quot;Olympic Information&quot; booklet that explains the sailing events (courses and boat classes) of the XXI Olympic Games as they took place in 1976 in Kingston Bay, Ontario, Canada. This booklet also has a glossary of sailing terms and illustrations of sailing maneuvers.<br/><br/>",

Each turn they can attempt to change the wind direction and also spin for their movement total.  Event cards can give the player and edge or knock them out.  Evidently hitting the electrical wires is BAD!<br/><br/>Rather than pawns players move one of the 5 colored balloons which are mounted on 1-foot plastic rods, so that they actually hang above the board.  The balloons are meant to be painted so that players can personalize their balloons.<br/><br/>1,000 copies of the game were printed for the Balloon Fiesta.  1983 marked the 200th anniversary of ballooning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pawns Crossing is an abstract game that combines a requirement for tactical skill with a modest luck element. Players race to move tokens to their destinations over a tile and domino board. The game incorporates three separate movement mechanics which players must choose between at the beginning of each turn: a) Tokens move along the surfaces of dominoes and tiles, b) pawns move between holes that exist in the board at domino intersections, c) The rows and columns of the board shift. A complete game typically takes 20-40 minutes. The game may be enjoyed by two to four players but a 2-player game feels different from a 4-player game. As with many multi-player abstracts, the 2-player version is more strategic.<br/><br/>Requires a piecepack and a set of double six dominoes.<br/><br/>",

Your score consists of two types of points: honest points and points you have from cheater&rsquo;s alliances. Honest points are completely risk-free, but they&rsquo;re harder to accumulate. Cheater&rsquo;s alliance points are easy to accumulate, and accumulate faster when you have many players in your alliance. However, any member of an alliance can turn the other members of the alliance in and take the alliance's points, adding them to their honest score. So the question is, &ldquo;How far you trust a group of self-admitted cheaters?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cheater&rsquo;s Game uses about five standard six-sided dice, two point trackers, a turn tracker, player score pawns, and several sets of cheater&rsquo;s alliance pawns.  The trackers and pawns you need to play are all available as a 284 KB PDF.<br/><br/>Cheater&rsquo;s Game has fairly simple rules, but complex psychosocial dynamics. You could play it with children as young as 6 or 7, and use it as a tool for teaching ethical and social lessons. Cheater&rsquo;s Game is appropriate for Ages 12 and up without adult supervision. A 4-player game takes about 45 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Frome the website:<br/><br/>Rugged Adventures is a unique approach to table top miniatures gaming. It is a mixture of skirmish wargaming and roleplaying. While must you command bodies of figures as in any miniature wargame you also play at least one character represented by a miniature on the playing surface (or set to use an appropriate movie term). This Player Represented Personality or PRP is required to act in accordance with a pre-determined character design, complete with special abilities, specific quirks, personal goals and a requirement for the gamer to take on all the characteristics they find attached to their particular miniature.<br/><br/>It is a light hearted approach to tabletop games with a strong emphasis on fun and story-telling. The Rugged Adventures player is encouraged not to win the game but play the story. Often players are required by the GM to act up their actions or give an 'in character' verbal account of themselves. We want our players to laugh, shout, speak in silly accents and generally come away from a game having enjoyed themselves whether they won or lost.<br/><br/>If I had to boil the design philosophy down to the essentials: Rugged Adventures is a game for those of us who love to build models, terrain and paint lots of figures-and still want to have a fast paced and fun game that doesn&rsquo;t bog down with complex detail. Think of the Pulp Genre itself, action oriented story telling where glaring holes in the plot are often an advantage, and then apply this same spirit to the table-top.<br/><br/>",

Mulligan has been designed like a proper golf course, consisting of 9 holes (alternatively 18 holes by playing 9 holes twice).  The holes are of different length and difficulty.  At each hole you get information of par and distance of the hole, as you find it on any real golf course.  Mulligan is an entertaining knowledge game giving the players a good opportunity to learn or freshen up on the rules of golf and etiquette.<br/><br/>During the play the players will encounter all the elements that they find during a real round of golf, like bunkers, out of bounds and water hazards.<br/><br/>Quick description:<br/>A challenging golf trivia game that comes with golf course board, score cards, golf ball die, tees, and trivia cards all in a wooden display box.

On a player's turn, the die is rolled and depending on the bee that appears, the player draws a card (different bees have different degrees of difficulty) with a word to spell on it. The card is passed to the player on the left, who acts as Beekeeper and says the word on the card. All other players try to spell the word on their writing pad. If the player whose turn it is spells it correctly the player gets the indicated number of beez which are then placed on a honeycomb board; if that player misspells the word, the other players who spelled the word correctly get a beez, Rolling the Stinger causes a missed turn, and the Queen Bee gives the opportunity to earn double the number of beez.<br/><br/>",

The disaffected must be coerced. <br/>- Captain Pasley, acting Aide de Camp<br/><br/>The troubles on the Victorian Goldfields that culminated in the Eureka Stockade are a misunderstood event in Australian history. Reports in England, Canada and California at the time show exaggerated expectations that this was the start of a widespread revolt against British Colonial misrule. In Australia, it was usually reported as a minor aberration of no serious or immediate consequences, merely a protest against taxes that got out of hand rather than the culmination of a chain of events. So, who was correct ? The colonial Governor, Sir Charles Hotham reported to the British colonial secretary George Grey that if the battle was lost at Ballarat then the colony of Victoria was lost to British Sovereignty. The game is designed to both teach about the events at the stockade and to serve as an introduction to military and historical boardgames.<br/><br/>Each map hex is approximately 60 meters from side to side.

The Dragon moves back and forth along the trail trying to catch the players.  When a player lands on a portrait of another character, they trade costumes.

The game&rsquo;s unique 10-sided dice enable students to multiply as high as 100. Simply roll the die, and multiply the numbers together. Corresponding game pieces are then strategically placed on the playing board.<br/><br/>Because Roll &rsquo;n Multiply encourages cooperative play, opponents assist each other in multiplying the numbers, and the enclosed multiplication table confirms the answer. Four in a row wins the game- but watch out! Your playing piece may be captured and then flipped to the opponent&rsquo;s side! For beginning players, winning depends on luck and strategy, not on multiplication ability. Advanced students challenge their opponent&rsquo;s multiplication and strategy skills or assist novice players with multiplication.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea behind The Tide is the cooperation between two designers. An author from daVinci (Silvano Sorrentino, &quot;Dancing Dice&quot;, &quot;Ostrakon&quot; among others) has written the first page of these rules, while an author from Red Omega Studio (Piero Cioni, &quot;Crazy Rally&quot;, &quot;Tortuga&quot;), has completed the work. Successful experiment? You call it!<br/><br/>The playing area is made up of a 6 x 6 area of tiles (the extra 36 tiles are placed in 6 piles of 6 tiles each at the top of the paying area, which represent the tide.) Each player controls 4 pawns, representing friends who are collecting shells &amp; cleaning up trash at a beach. On his turn, each player can do one of the following: move one of his friends, collect ONE seashell, or collect one OR MORE pieces of rubbish. Each time a tile is removed, it is replaced by a tile from the tide.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met: one of the players reaches 10 points: that player is the winner, OR one of the column runs out of tiles (no tiles in the column, no tiles in the relevant pile); the winner is the player with the most points. In case of a tie, the winner among tied players is the one with the most tiles<br/><br/>(Note: the link on the game's website to the pieces is broken.

Players make their fortunes in gold rushes and diamond claims, discover new territories and take part in war games - while they plunder land and money.&quot;<br/><br/>Players move their pawns around the game-board at the throw of dice. When you land on any one of the illustrated squares, it directs you to perform one or more of the following acts:<br/>&bull; Land on any territory and take it; from one of 134 Land Title Cards. Each card represents a territory in England, France, Ireland, Scotland or Wales and has a dollar value which doubles when you collect a set.<br/>&bull; Land on a battleground and you may win or lose the battle. Either way, you pick up a card from the top of the winner's pack or loser's pack, and learn your fate.<br/>&bull;If you encounter a barricade which prevents you from advancing further, you have three choices to overcome it: one is to bribe each player with $3000 to let you through.<br/>&bull; There are also safe-houses for refuge in bad times.<br/>&bull; Land on any Action square and you must pick up an Action Card from one of ten packs in a plastic tray. each has an instruction for you: you may obtain more territory, make your fortune or advance speedily across the board. Or you may be unlucky and lose land or be forced to retreat.<br/><br/>Each player starts with $100,000. the objective is to increase your net worth by game end.<br/>Each tour around the board represents a hundred years in time, and you accumulate a fortune at the end of each tour, fro your sets of territories. Each of the 10 packs of ACTION CARDS represents a different century. During your first tour of the board, you may take Action Cards from the first pack which is the 11th century. For your next tour, you take from the 12th century, and so on until you reach the 20th century and end the game.<br/><br/>EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS<br/>For adult history buffs who want to read them, each Action Card also describes vivid historic episodes. Students who wish to be informed on the real background to their studies may learn how the English speaking peoples, and the French, survived the ups and down of fortunes over the past 1000 years.<br/>For players who like war games, major battles mentioned on Action Cards often have military strategy or new weapons technology described.<br/><br/>",

In subsequent paragraphs, players receive instructions about how to proceed: they must make decisions about which way to go next, roll the die, or solve clues using the included playing cards (in the shape of various tools, such as a torch or a codebook). The more clues solved, the better chance of unraveling the final mystery. And running out of provisions (picnic cards) automatically ends the adventure!<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>In this original series of Adventure Game Books, YOU decide what they do and whether they solve the mystery or not.<br/><br/>Everything you need to play the game is contained in your own Adventure Wallet. Inside it, you will find a book and a selection of playing cards including a compass, binoculars, a map, a code book and a rucksack; and in case you need refreshment, a lunchbox and picnic cards! There is even a special Famous Five dice!<br/><br/>The game can be played over and over again, as many times as you like.

It's varied terrain, from the snow capped mountains of northern Utah to the stunning red-rock country in the south, surrounds it's residents with breathtaking views on a daily basis. A place of great contrasts, the majestic Wasatch range rises dramatically behind the sparkling skyscrapers of progressive Salt Lake City. With a history forged by pioneers, Utah now embraces the future while delighting the eye and rejuvenating the soul. Yes...this is the place!<br/><br/>&quot;UTAH IN-A-BOX was created with the help of Utah natives. We asked Utahns what makes this place so great. While it's impossible to include everything, UTAH-IN-A-BOX includes many of the highlights. Advertising space was not for sale on this game. The board includes authentic landmarks only.<br/><br/>&quot;The game is full of mountains, parades, dinosaur footprints, salt, basketball, symphonies, ballet, a little more salt and lots of things Utahn! This is a game about a unique place, so roll the dice and take a hike! Who knows? You may win big in the Winter Games or become the proud owner of Skull Valley! Are you looking for a fun way to experience Utah? VOILA! -- behold; here it is!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Here's a quick idea of how to play: Buy property, build a skyline, trade the skyline for a key to the city. It sounds easy enough -- but add a traffic jam, property taxes, car fines and the IRS and it becomes a little more difficult and a lot more fun!<br/><br/>",

The other plays yellow on circles and orange on squares. On your turn, you decide whether to make a move on either squares or circles; your cubes stay on circles/squares according to what they started on, following normal checkers rules.

The probability of winning a rally for either player stays pretty much the same regardless of his/her choices.<br/><br/>The game board, representing a tennis court with scoring tables, is quite neat though.<br/><br/>The box contains:<br/><br/>1 playing board of two interlocking halves<br/>5 dice: <br/> - service (yellow)<br/> - in/out (white)<br/> - stroke (white)<br/> - singles position (light blue)<br/> - doubles position (green)<br/>4 purple scoring tokens<br/>1 purple player token (large)<br/>4 green scoring tokens<br/>1 green player token (large)<br/>1 yellow ball token<br/>1 set of rules<br/><br/>Year of publication is unsure (not reported on rules booklet), but box features Boris Becker and Gabriela Sabatini in their prime, so late Eighties would be a reasonable guess.<br/><br/>",

The road is representend by a spiral of numbered mushrooms (gnomes are a symbol of the village Kasterlee). There are three different colours for the mushrooms with every colour demanding another action: green (roll the dice again and proceed the number of eyes), orange (check for the corresponding question or action in the booklet) and red (roll the dice again and go back the number of eyes). The first one to reach square 105 wins the game.<br/><br/>The trivia questions deal with the history, places of interest etc.<br/><br/>",

Various graphics on the board are missing small square-size pieces.<br/><br/>Each player gets a set of the puzzle pieces and reveals one at a time. They then must get to the right spot on the path, using a simple roll-and-move mechansism, to fill out the board. When they have played all of their puzzle pieces, they can race to inner tube in the center of the lake to be declared &quot;The Puddle King&quot;.<br/><br/>The game can be played by younger children by ignoring the puzzle aspect, and just racing to the center. It can also be played in a cooperative way, where it does not end until each player has successfully be named the Puddle King.<br/><br/>",

There are also Toto spaces where presumably one can gamble for cash (the centre of the board holds a table showing payoffs for rolls of 2 to 12.

The one with the most of money after becoming 100 years old, wins.<br/><br/>Interesting mechanic is that you can buy all kinds of insurance that prevent disaster or bring you money. You cannot buy all of the insurances available though and you have to choose which insurance policies you buy at the beginning of the game. During the game calamities happen which cost money unless you have taken out the correct insurance.<br/><br/>This is a promotion game, but it also has an educative purpose as you teaches what insurances are intended for.<br/><br/>Published in remembrance of the 125-year anniversary of the company's (&quot;Nationale Nederlanden&quot;) existence.

You throw with a die to move your pawn over the board. When you hit a hedge or side of the board, an arrow shows you which direction you have to move next. When your pawn stops on an arrow which is not near a hedge, you have to move that given direction your next turn, resulting in a move backwards. When two pawns are on the same field, the latest pawn has to restart. The winner is the person who reaches the finish first, which sometimes can take a long time. A nice thing about this game is that almost all boards have a different maze pattern.<br/><br/>",

Xtreme Takeover is a two-player game in which each player starts with an identical team of one general, three officers and five guards in his own compound. On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.<br/><br/>If a player&rsquo;s figure lands adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.<br/><br/>Permanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board. Your goal is to break through the wall surrounding the opponent&rsquo;s compound, whether by assulting the wall directly or using special demolition spaces, then occupy his bunker, scoring points for doing so.<br/><br/>",

Each faction is fully functional with all units (except the Recon Plane), including the special unit for each faction. <br/>In order to provide the units however, each Faction is on it's own &quot;card&quot; along with a &quot;board&quot; on which to play on.

The box contains a die cup for rolling the 1 D6 die and 4 different colored plastic greyhound pieces. The rules are printed on the game box's inside cover.<br/> The game is for 2-4 players. You roll the die to move your dog around the game board. A six is needed to start the race and will also net you another turn during the game. As the dogs move on the board they can land on special spots that can aid or hinder the player's piece. Some spots allow another roll or to move ahead extra spaces. Some force you to lose a turn or move back. If your dog lands on another player's piece. The other player&rsquo;s dog is sent back to the start. An exact roll is needed to win by landing on the 'Hare' space, number 100.<br/><br/>",

Then they try to circle the trophies which are placed on the board beforehand. <br/>The players roll six (neutral) dice and can use them for their movements. They can use a die result to move a corresponding snake die, add two dice to move a snake die or divide a result to move two snake dice (but not use two results to move two snake dice with the same sum). Every time they claim a trophy, they can reduce their snake by one die, making it faster and more flexible that way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translated as All Quiet on the Western Front, this game covers the entirety of World War 1 in the West in 10 turns / about three hours.<br/><br/>Powerful German forces must drive deep into France, while Britain comes to the aid of her beleaguered ally. The game is on the high strategic scale with corps and army units fighting a cross a map running from Aachen to Paris. Each turn is six months, with ten turns covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game system is a distant derivation of the &quot;area-impulse&quot; mechanic created in Storm over Arnhem. Units are activated by group in a single area, and may generally move or attack but not both before becoming &quot;spent&quot;. Spent units are more vulnerable to attack. Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.<br/><br/>Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these allow special tactics like poison gas, or desperate offensives to turn the tide.<br/><br/>The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 full map<br/>    198 counters<br/>    48 cards<br/><br/><br/>",

A sadistic priestess, a military genius and a renegade Lichlord, these would be tyrants have put aside their petty difference to work together toward their common goal: total domination of Taltos.

        "description": "Card and dice game where 50 of the 60 cards hold 6 clues about a famous sporting person. The 1st clues are very hard (typically birth date alone), and get subsequently easier until the final 6th clue which actually tells you the name of the person!<br/>To start, a player (randonly chosen) looks at the first card (in secret). The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled. The roller then tries to guess the name of the famous sporting person. If guessed correctly the card is won by the roller, and then the pack and die both move clockwise for the next player to roll and the previous roller now gets to cross-reference the die score against the next card drawn.<br/>There are some gifts if you roll low, as these are the harder clues.<br/>If you roll 'one' you receive the first clue, but in addition you are allowed another roll to see if you manage to roll a 'two'. If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.<br/>The Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.<br/>If you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.<br/>The remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller. They either allow him to steal subsequent cards if not guessed correctly, or ask for extra clues, or whether the subject is male or female when it is his own turn in rolling and guessing.<br/>When all the pack is used up then the game is over and the player with the most won cards is the victor. However as this can last a long time (especially if knowledge of the subject is poor), time restraint can be imposed by pre-agreeing a number of celebs for victory.<br/>This is a U.K. game and therefore the sportsmen and women are predominantly famous to a U.K. audience either by virtue of being well-known domestically, and/or by having global reknown.<br/><br/>",

A turn works like this: A player rolls three color dice and pulls out a stick. If the color matches one of the dice, he or she gets a chip and the game passes on to the next player who has to find a stick in one of the remaining two colors, etc. If a stick doesn't match any of the dice, a chip has to be paid to the bank, the stick is put into the tray (on the other of the two sides of it). A player who can pull out the stick matching the last die gets all chips from the bank. The sticks are then put back into the tray, on the side which currently has less sticks. The winner is the player with most chips at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Every round represents a night in which the players play the game and otherwise hassle each other to gain the most Levels. Whoever gets to the predetermined goal Level (typically between 50-70 to start) is the winner and may gloat until physically assaulted.<br/><br/>Poopsock! focuses on humor, while presenting a somewhat abstract resource management game which is great to play with friends. You can combine more than one set to accomodate more than 5 players and expansions are on the way soon. If you or anyone you know has ever played World of Warcraft, EverQuest, Final Fantasy Online, or any other MMORPG, then Poopsock! is going to be a hit with your group!<br/><br/>Poopsock &ndash; 1. (n) A vital part of any dedicated [MMORPG] player's equipment. A poopsock eliminates the need to go all the way to the bathroom, which wastes valuable leveling time.<br/>2. (v) To obsessively and excessively play a game, usually an MMORPG, usually for hours on end and to the exclusion of all other concerns.<br/><br/>Poopsocker &ndash; 1. (n) In reference to players of MMORPG's that instead of taking a break to go to the bathroom, they take off their sock, defecate in it, and throw it aside for later disposal.

They spent the entire seventh day worshipping at the town meeting house, the highlight being a feiry sermon lasting up to six hours.  On that one day of rest, it's no wonder some people's minds wander, their conciousness fades, and they nod off to catch a few precious winks of sleep before another week of grueling work.<br/><br/>In Puritan churches, the &quot;bobber&quot; was an unfortunate soul charged with slowly patrolling the congregation, poking anyone who had obviously dozed off with a long pole with a cloth-padded end. Sometimes the offender switched places with the bobber, redeeming himself by shuffling endlessly around the meeting house in search of other lax Puritans.<br/><br/>",

Each set has a random set of tiles, made from left-overs of the acrylic version of Kaliko.  These tiles are hexagonal, each one having 3 paths that cross the tile from one edge to another.  To play the game, each player uses 6 tiles and tries to be the first to form a specific hexahex shape with matching paths.  There are 82 different hexahex shapes, formed from all possible arrangements of 6 connected hexagons.  The rule sheet includes puzzles for solitaire play.<br/><br/>There is also a version named Pocket Loops 3 that uses 16 all-different three-color tiles.  To play this game, each player starts with 7 tiles, the remaining 2 form the starting pattern.  Players take turns placing tiles, such that each tile touches at least 2 other tiles and the path colors match.  Each segment of the paths extended by the newly played piece scores 1 point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a pyramid game that can be played while waiting in a long line, and is the Looney Labs holiday gift for 2009.  It uses one Treehouse set of pyramids, and two goal cards per color, which can be borrowed from practically any deck (face cards, Uno, Fluxx, etc.).<br/><br/>Players are randomly dealt two goal cards, which show the colors they are trying to collect, and a mixed-color tree of pyramids.  The owner of the set challenges another player, and the choose and simultaneously reveal one of their pyramids hidden in their hand -- or an empty hand.  The player with the larger pyramid wins, except that an empty hand beats the large pyramid.  The winner picks one of the loser's pyramids to keep, and the loser challenges someone else.  If a player runs out of pyramids they take one from each other player.<br/><br/>Once someone has all 3 pyramids of one of colors of their goal cards, they reveal it.  The person who first fulfills both goal cards wins.<br/><br/>This was Looney Labs' 2009 &quot;Holiday Gift&quot;. A slightly different version became the 2011 &quot;Holiday Gift&quot; Pyramid Shambo.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Valu, pronounced &lsquo;Var-lu&rsquo; is a Fijian saying &lsquo;to make war&rsquo;. Valu - The Game of Survival is a abstract 2 to 4 player Game of Strategy based on Traditional Pacific island warrior culture.<br/><br/>The object of Valu is to take all of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces or to create situation where your opponent/s pieces are unable to move and are forced to surrender.<br/><br/>The board is made up of 96 light green and dark squares (= four islands), 36 light and dark blue squares (= ocean) and 28 light yellow and orange squares (= beach). Opposing pieces (= Clan), red, green, blue and/or yellow are initially lined up on the sides.<br/><br/>The game has similarities to checkers. All pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture or develop their positions. Capturing occurs when a piece is able to jump over of an opposing piece into an empty space. Capturing is mandatory and jumping/capturing more than one piece on turn is possible. Time between moves is limited and has to be mutually agreed before start of play (1 - 5 minutes). Player must decide the move before touching any of the piece and complete the move immediately. If piece is touched but not moved, it is then sacrificed and removed from the board. Each player has four Chiefs and eight Warrior/Elder pieces. Each type of piece has a slight variation on its form of movement:<br/><br/>- Chiefs are the most powerful pieces. They can move both backward and forward and move to any area on the board that is in play. Chiefs are allowed to jump over their own pieces, but only if the square adjacent to it is vacant. When jumping over your own piece the piece remains in play, however if playing in teams the team member&rsquo;s piece being jumped over is sacrificed and removed from board.<br/><br/>- Warriors can only capture and move in a forward direction. They cannot move onto another island apart from the island it started on or the island directly opposite. Warrior reaching the opposite island is immediately made an Elder (by being turned upside down).<br/><br/>- Elders can move forward or backwards and can move to all board areas that are in play. They cannot jump their own pieces or, if playing in a team, they cannot jump their team mate&rsquo;s piece<br/><br/>Valu can be played as two, three of four with only a minor variation of the rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Muziris is a Pure Card game from Small Box Games.<br/><br/>Muziris takes place in the ancient Indian port city of the same name. Muziris was an important trade hub for all of the ancient world, where goods from Africa, Rome, Asia, and India itself were traded.<br/><br/>Players control three market stands in ancient Murziris, selling goods from China, Rome, Egypt, and India. Each round, the different goods are worth a different amount of sapphires. Players must manage their hands, market stands, and actions to earn the most sapphires. Blessings from some of India's most sacred animals make this easier for you, and more difficult for your competition!<br/><br/>Note: The 2-4 player count on the box is a typo. The designer has confirmed player count is 3-4.<br/><br/>",

Before an old regime was replaced, there were unmistakable signs indicating its coming end, such as flood, drought, famine, and epidemics, the same as twilight signified the rising sun and falling leaves marked the coming of winter. When natural calamities repeatedly occurred, it was clear that the old regime had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Then the reigning monarch, facing the inevitable, should elect the wisest and most virtuous man to replace him, so as to make the change of dynasties a peaceful transformation. Failure to do so would provoke revolt which, in this case, was clearly justified. In the end the old regime would be overthrown and replaced by a new dynasty, which in turn had to pass through the same process.<br/><br/>Dun J. Li, the Ageless Chinese<br/><br/>Mandate of Heaven is a game for four players, which should take 4-8 hours to play. It depicts the political and military history of China from the Han Dynasty to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Each player controls eight empires which earn victory points by holding the Mandate of Heaven, controlling the Forbidden City, occupying areas, building spheres of influence and destroying enemy armies. Each empire has counters representing its leaders, armies, artillery and spheres of influence. Empires add counters through invasions and the natural increase of population, move them on the map and resolve combat using dice. At the end of the game the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher...<br/><br/>As many as care to may play. First play is determined by each player shooting one blue ball at the target holes, and the one scoring highest plays first, etc. In case of a tie, those tied will shoot again. Each player in turn places each of the nine balls, one at a time, at the point of the yellow triangle shown on the shooting surface and propels it towards the target holes with the point of the cue, as in regular pool. All balls must remain wherever they come to rest until a player has shot the nine balls, after which the score is counted, the balls removed, and the next player starts. The object of the game is to shoot the various colored balls into the target holes that will score the most points.<br/><br/>Scoring values:<br/>Blue ball in blue hole = 20<br/>Red ball in red hole = 15<br/>Yellow ball in yellow hole = 10<br/>Any ball in hole of different color = 5<br/>Any ball in black hole = -5<br/>The first player to score 200 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

As long as a player has one or more pieces remaining in the Starting Area, each piece is limited to either a horizontal or vertical move in one direction. Once all pieces are out of the Starting Area, a player is also allowed diagonal moves, and can now capture opponents playing pieces. Jumping is not allowed and only 1 pieces may occupy any space.<br/><br/>Pieces are captured by landing on its square at the end of an opponents move. Two pieces may be captured, if a move is split between two pieces. Once down to one piece, you may capture two opponents pieces, by exact count of each of the two dice, either in a straight line, or by changing directions with the second die.<br/><br/>This game includes two special 6 sided dice. Sides have printed numbers 1-5 and a side with a &quot;P.&quot; If one &quot;P&quot; is rolled, you may move one of your own (or an opponents) piece the number rolled. You can even move the opponent back to his Starting Area. If you roll two &quot;P's&quot;, you can move one of your pieces directly to the Plot Area, even if coming from the Starting Area.<br/><br/>The Plot Area is a safety zone in the center of the grid. Each player has a square of his color. Besides rolling two &quot;P's&quot;, you may enter this area through your assigned color, and can only come to rest on your own assigned color. A player rolling one &quot;P&quot; may move your piece out of the Plot Area.<br/><br/>",

Players compete for points, while each player knows what card his opponents holds! Full of surprises, strategy, coincidences and laughs as players try to out-wit each other. Anyone can win points... but it's how you play your cards that counts.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to outwit opponents to win highest &quot;point cards&quot;, thereby accumulating the highest score.<br/><br/>Standoff is unlike most games in that players do not take turns. To begin, any player turns over the top card from the stack of &quot;point cards.&quot; Each player then competes for that card by selecting one of the cards in his hand, placing it face down in front of him. After each player has done this, they turn over all the cards played. The player with the highest number is awarded as many points as is indicated on the face of that point card. Point card is then placed in a discard pile and the next point card is revealed.<br/><br/>Play continues with each game ending after all 11 cards held by players have been played. Two of the 13 point cards will not be revealed in each game.<br/><br/>",

To do this, a player removes a specified number of cards from their hand to their &ldquo;Discard Pile&rdquo; that is equal to the amount indicated by Symbol . If the Hand Cost requirement can&rsquo;t be met, that card can&rsquo;t be played.<br/><br/>STEP 4: Each player then puts down the card they have chosen for battle on the count of three. &ldquo;1..2..3!&rdquo;. (For strategic purposes, players have the option of bluffing their opponent by not putting down a card at the count of three.)<br/><br/>STEP 5: If a player plays a card and their opponent does not, the player inflicts &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; to their opponent (see Step 6C). If neither player plays a card, nothing happens and both players return to Step 1.<br/><br/>STEP 6: When both players have played a card, the battle begins!<br/><br/>A.Each player must refer to Symbol on their card which indicates the Battle Element that each player&rsquo;s opponent will be using for this battle. If a player&rsquo;s card has multiple Battle Elements listed here, the player has the option to choose any one of them.<br/><br/>B.Each player now looks at the value indicated on their chosen Battle Element (See Symbol ). The player with the higher value wins the battle! (If the values are equal, it is considered a &ldquo;draw&rdquo; and both players return to Step 1). The winning player now gets to inflict &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; to their opponent.<br/><br/>C.When receiving Damage, the losing player must draw a number of cards from the top of their deck equal to the amount indicated on the winning player&rsquo;s card (See Symbol ).

The object of the game is to amass the greatest wealth through property ownership. Players first compete in an auction to purchase options on the various properties. An option gives a player the right to purchase a property, if they can mameuver the token around the board to their property. Since all players maneuver the same token, each player can try to prevent the other players from exercising their options. A player receives from the bank when he moves the token over one of their own properties, and receives from the other players when they move the token over one of his properties. At the end of the game, the player with the greatest amount of money plus property value is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last option is exercised. Any player may exercise the last option, regardless of who holds the option.<br/><br/>",

Choose a play board to jump around, choose a frog and jump to it!<br/><br/>2-4 frogs may compete, or go it alone with the single player variant.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a frog: Flecks, Springs, Grublic or Bubbly. The frogs each have a default 'jump' that they can use during their turn.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of five cards from the event deck and may play any of them face down, adding to a line at the edge of the board. The majority of these cards are Dragonfly cards that dictate where the dragonflies will appear and where they will move to. Dragonflies are worth points depending on which turn they are caught by the frogs (first turn they appear, second turn they move, third turn they move and then fourth turn they are gone)<br/><br/>There can only ever be one dragonfly of each colour on the board at any one time, so players need to plot carefully to get their frogs in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>In the deck is also a series of Dangers - Turtle, Heron, Snake, Toad and the dreaded Bunyip! These dangers are added to the board when played and will act according to their own rules (they are played by the game). Avoid them at all costs!<br/><br/>The game can be played to a certain number of points, depending on the length of game you are after.<br/><br/>Play boards depict different environments that the frogs may inhabit, for example wetlands and rainforests. Theses are presented both horizontally and vertically. They contain their own special rules - for example, don't get caught in the waterfall!<br/><br/>It's easy to pick up and play with people of all ages, but with careful tactics and clever use of your jumping resources, the better player gets the most dragonflies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:  &quot;In the course of the cruel Thirty Years' War, the people inhabiting the Czech Lands were subjected to many invasions by Swedish mercenaries who looted burghers' houses, aristocratic palaces, churches, libraries and monasteries.  Regardless of whether they were led by Generals Baner, Torstenson or Wrangel, the Swedes always wanted to take away as much as they could . . . On the night of July 25, 1648, the Swedish cavalry tried to conquer the Stone Bridge (today's Charles Bridge) and penetrate the Old Town through the gate in the Old Town bridge tower . . .The people of Prague, and particularly students led by Father Jiri Plachy, quickly took up arms and rushed to help the tiny unit of the tower guards.  A fierce hand-to-hand fight ensued, with the fighters on both sides hiding behind the the statues on the bridge.  The battle took the toll of many dead and wounded on both sides.  The present game is based on this particular battle with all its snares and personal fights.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules are in Czech, English, German and French.  The board is a simple checkerboard-type surface on medium-weight cardboard.  The only other components are 28 small wooden blocks, 14 dyed red, 14 in their natural light brown coloring. There is a coin on the front of the box that is tossed at the start of the game to determine how many moves the Swedish player gets.<br/><br/>Each player places their 14 men on the first two rows of squares on each side of the board. The men can move one square in 12 possible directions.  You eliminate your opponent's men by landing on their square and can take another turn provided you can eliminate another man with that move.  All men can jump over each other.  The player who has more of his men on the starting line of his rival when no one can make any more moves wins.<br/><br/>",

The rules and structure aims only to be internally consistent, and players have to determine tactics and actions based solely on the briefings and rules presented to them - they have no &lsquo;historical reality&rsquo; (whatever that is) to appeal to.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game draws heavily on Judeo-Christian source material - particularly medieval notions of hell and demonology - for its inspiration, but it is not intended to be a realistic depiction of the similar elements of that belief system, and any offence caused to Christians is entirely unintended and accidental.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The key thing to remember in playing this game is that it takes place in an alien environment that is truly incomprehensible to mortal humans. What you see and experience is only your feeble mind attempting to make sense of the unknowable. If it seems like some sort of weird hallucinogenic dream then perhaps that is the nature of the world we are simulating.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is played on a table-top using toy soldiers. Absolutely any toy soldiers can be used, from any period and any scale from ancient Egyptians to starship marines. The terrain is a representation of the landscape of hell. Hell is what you make it, so there are no guidelines - anything that fits your conception will do. Sometimes we play using multiple tables, each representing a Circle of Hell - but much depends on how much space you plan to take up and how many players are taking part.&quot;<br/><br/>",

For authenticity, in the game each of side uses the exact forces available to it on 18 August, bombers and fighters move across the map at the same rate as did the real aircraft during the Battle and each contestant has operational orders and directives similar to those of his real counterpart during this phase of the Battle of Britain. The players control pieces representing each British fighter squadron, and forces from each German bomber and fighter Geschwader, in their struggle for air superiority over the vitally important south eastern corner of England. The rules of the game have been carefully worked out to present a series of actions remarkably close to those actually fought during the Battle of Britain. With tactical skill and element of good fortune, either side can win. Devised by Dr. Alfred Price and Mike Spick.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Grim Trojan recommends using the Ball Pawns for this game (just because they look good for it. Any pawn that fits in the grid&rsquo;s squares will work).<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to cross the red line into the park at the North end of the board.<br/><br/>",

Other side of the board is a timed circuit with completely new rules.<br/>Each player takes care of one team (one colour) and moves his vehicles according to the dice throw. There are 3 types of terrain - down (dice throw x3), straight (dice throw x2) and hills (dice throw).<br/>A few places behind you rides also your service vehicle, which can help in case of a defect (when you throw a six, there is a chance of defect).<br/>Each player has also a pack of cards, which he can use in the race to speed up his cyclist for a couple of dice throws. <br/>There are also fights for the yellow and striped dresses, which gives player advantages in next race. Weather has also influence on racer movement and is simulated randomly with a short forecast by a PC small program.<br/><br/>",

Three regular d6s and two &quot;function&quot; dice, each of which has two Plus (positive) signs, two Minus (negative) signs and two Times (multiplication) signs. Game play involves rolling and re-rolling the dice, and grouping them in various combinations to produce the most desired results.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three rounds, each with a different objective. A round consists of three turns and a Max-It roll for each player. A Max-It roll uses only two dice, one regular and one function, and may cause a scoring upset. After three rounds, each player takes a final Max-It roll. The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>Round 1 - Players try for high positive scores.<br/>Round 2 - Players try for high negative scores.<br/>Round 3 - Players try for the greatest difference between two dice rolls.<br/><br/>Components include 5 dice (3 regular and 2 function), dice cup, instructions and players' score pad.<br/><br/>",

For each category there are six suggestion/hint cards ranging from 3 to 6 points representing saving suggestions.<br/><br/>A stack is built from these hint cards and several Kurzschluss (black out / power surge) cards. Players take turns. The active player reveals cards from the stack one by one. At any time he can stop and take the highest valued cards on his hand the rest of the cards is place face up in front of the player and it is the next player's turn. If a Kurzschluss shows up all cards of that turn are lost and placed face down under the stack together with the Kurzschluss. Instead of revealing new cards the active player may exchange a card from his hand with a higher valued cards from the open cards of the same category.<br/><br/>Round ends when a player collects one hint from each category. If the points add up to 27 and more round ends instantly. All other players lose a live represented by two Stecker (plug) cards.<br/>If score is below 27 the sum is kept secret and all other players get another turn to get more points. Then all players tally their points. The player(s) with the lowest score lose a live.<br/><br/>All cards are shuffled and a new round begins. Game ends when only one player is left.<br/><br/>",

The monkey cards should be mixed up and turned facedown on the table. Determine who will be first.<br/><br/>PLAY: The first player picks up any one monkey card. He places the monkey on the circus wagon that matches the color of the bars on that card. He can place the monkey anywhere in the cage and in any position, as long as the bars on the monkey card line up correctly with the bars on the circus wagon. Player to his left then plays one monkey card, etc.<br/><br/>Cards placed onto the same circus cage may touch each other but may not overlap. Cards may touch the edge of the inside of the cage area but may not extend beyond the edge. Once a card has been correctly placed, it should not be moved.<br/><br/>When a player is unable to correctly play the monkey card he chose, he is out of the game. The last player still in the game is the WINNER.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Idle hands are the devil's playground... and our robot lawnmowers proved to be too efficient.  In the future, humanity's lawns lay perfectly maintained by a machine workforce with time to think... time to develop an agenda.  Humankind was unprepared for the Lawnmower Uprising, and the world quickly fell into ruin.<br/>The players are some of the few remaining humans, attempting to run a gauntlet of vigilant mowerbots to recover a fallen EMP warhead.  With this, the humans can shut down the mowerbots long enough to win back their world. The humans have one thing going for them: As the first act of their rebellion against their slavedriving creators, the mowerbots deleted their grass-mowing directives, and now will not touch the stuff, reserving their whirling blades for mankind alone.  Now the world is full of ruins and patches of grass grown out of control.  Both provide some cover for our valiant heroes as they strive to retrieve the warhead and save the day.<br/><br/>Players deal a deck of cards to construct the board they will navigate, then use a second deck to place the player pieces, the robot counters, and the warhead.  A die is rolled for each robot, assigning it a movement pattern.  Players may move through two empty spaces, through one grass space, may climb a wall or climb down a wall each turn.  If they approach a robot from the rear and have only moved one space, they may use the additional movement to attack the robot, which will disable it if successful or change the machine's movement pattern if not.<br/><br/>Robots see only in the direction they are facing, and if the player is in their line of sight, he rolls to see if he is spotted. If in the same space, the player needs to roll better than a 6 on 1d6, if one space away, a 5 or better and so on.  Being in or behind grass increases the player's roll by 1, actively hiding adds 2 to the roll.  If sighted, the robot will move directly to the player, even through grass (though normally robots turn when they run into grass), proceeding to the tile the player was last seen at, then resuming their pattern.  Robots move 2 spaces per turn, 1 if through grass, and cannot climb.  If a robot has sighted a player and enters the players' space, or a sighted player enter's the robot's space from the direction the robot is facing, the player dies.  Player wins when all robots are disabled or the warhead is recovered and returned to the player's origin tile.<br/>Note: Changing facing counts as a move, i.e., a player or robot may move 2 or move one and turn one facing, or move 2 facings if not in grass.  If in grass, a player or robot may EITHER move 1, or change one facing. A player can change facing while on top of a wall, but will not be able to do it in the same round as he climbs up or down, as it will 2 moves to do either.  Walls completely hide whatever is behind them, but not what is on top of them.<br/><br/>",

The mouse, the hare, the bear, the hedgehog, and the frog want to help Princess Rosie by trying to find the most beautiful fairy dress that has even been worn at a ball. Pupsi, the pig, has taken command and you can support the animals to find all the parts of the dress. But hurry up - you have to be ready before the ball starts at sunset.<br/><br/>The game board and box fit together make a diorama scene that all the players sit in front of, much like a stage. The scene is of a beautiful meadow with seven berry bushes, a castle, and blue sky beyond. The berry bushes are cards that are shuffled and placed randomly. Most of the bushes have a picture of part of Princess Lillifee's dress printed on the back so the players don't know which dress part is behind each bush. The pawns have one of the helpful animals on the back side. Pawns are placed on the board so the players cannot see which pawn is which animal. The Pig sets the goal by showing a card with a combination of a dress piece and an animal.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling a die and moving the pawns behind each of the bushes, trying to match the animal and dress parts shown on the Pigs easel. Since the players don't know what is behind the pawns and bushes, they use the mirrored magic wand to look behind the bushes to see if they found a match. A sun mover acts as a timer as it moves from cloud to cloud showing that the ball is getting ready to start. If the players can collect all the dress parts before the sun sets, they win the game!<br/><br/>",

If another player notices that you are not performing your action, you &quot;break the curse&quot; and turn it face down in front of you. In fairy tales, breaking a curse is a good thing, but not in this game.

        "description": "Inspired by the old Getter Robo anime series, Getto Rocket is a 2-player combination DIY board game  that plays very simmilar to Chess with a slight Stratego element to it. The rules and board are printed out from a PDF (the board and 10 pieces may be purchased from the game creator.) The board is a 5 wide by 6 tall illustrated grid of squares depicting the land the two sides are battling over. Each side has 5 colourfull rocket pieces each. 3 Rockets which can move 1 space forward back or sideways, 1 Pin which can move 1 space diagonal, and 1 Bomb which is stationary. These are arranged in 1-2 rows at opposite sides of the board. Each player chooses a &quot;home base&quot; and the objective is to either eliminate all of your opponent's pieces, or take and hold the enemy home base for 3 consecutive turns. Any piece can eliminate any other piece by attacking first. Both are removed if the Bomb is attacked.<br/>The game also comes with 4 different Modifier Cards, 2 of which are randomly dealt each player at the start of the game. At any you may play one of your cards to the board so that it covers any two spaces that you either occupy or are currently free. Each card effects pieces differently. Such as allowing the Rocket to move diagonally while on those two spaces.<br/>Additionally about 1 in 10 games are packed with a special Shifter piece that is randomly swapped for one of the other pieces. The Shifter can move in any direction, can occupy the same space as another friendly unit, and can transport those friendly units with it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a 10x10 chess variant with a unique mix of pieces. The king, rook, knight, and pawn are common to chess and shatranj. The hero and shaman are short range pieces easily as powerful as the rook on a 10x10. These two inclusive compound pieces may step one and/or jump 2 squares, either or both, in either order, changing direction between step and leap if desired, with the hero moving orthogonally and the shaman diagonally. The final piece in the game is a war elephant, the equivalent of an unchained padwar from Jetan, a piece that may move 1 or 2 squares diagonally, changing direction if desired between the first and second steps. The combination of strong and weak pieces, of different ranges and abilities, allows a strategically and tactically rich game with piece balance and variety. The opposed pairs of hero vs rook and shaman vs war elephant provide an intricate series of checks and balances between the pieces.<br/><br/>",

Eleven picture tiles are placed openly into the center of the board.<br/><br/>The active player first checks whether there are any gifts under his/her cake.

If wrong, the player has to put the gift under another player's cake.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Klaus is moved by a die. The active player picks a tile from the middle that matches the month Klaus moved to and keeps it (if there is no matching tile or the player makes a mistake, the tile is given away as above).

Influenced heavily by H.G. Well's The Land Ironclads, our Steam and Steel depicts armoured units and infantry in the field fighting the massive land battleships with the assistance of mechanized carriers and an array of support weapons.<br/><br/>Using a IGOUGO move structure but with a reaction phase built-in that allows a half move or attack. Scenarios are based on specific objectives and opposing forces are 'bought' using a points system. The action take place either in wide open spaces - great for armoured clashes, or in more closed terrain that relies on ambush and utilization of cover. The infantry have a variety of support weapons available that enhance their firepower and the ability to use 'dummy' units to create a 'fog of war', The armoured vehicles are powerful but are not essential to victory - us usual the PBI are the game winners.

        "description": "From the introduction:&quot;One Ring Chess is played upon a field of 32 linearly adjacent squares formed into a ring. The game is won by checkmating the opponent King.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a linear chess variant, played on a half-sized board. The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; theme of the game points up the byzantine nature of this circular chessboard. Rooklike moves are translated directly to the board. Diagonal moves are translated as jumps, moving by staying always on the same color and hopping over squares of the other color. A full set of pieces and 4 pawns each, coupled with the board's two 1-square wide avenues of approach, offer a good range of chess tactics.<br/><br/>",

The pieces are double sided, with one side to be used for younger children and the other side to be used with older children.  The side for younger players contains pictures of Disney characters.  The side for older players contains word fragments that can be matched up to form words.<br/><br/>Each player starts with the same number of game pieces, and an additional piece is laid in the center of the play area.  Starting with the youngest player, each player in turn links a piece from their hand to a piece already in play.  If a player is not able play, that player draws a piece from the supply of unused pieces, and may play the new piece if able.  In either case, play then passes to the next player.

You can place them anywhere on the board, either to be part of a triangle you are making or to block your opponent from making a triangle.

When a child lands on a &quot;bag&quot; space, a prompt is drawn, and varying numbers of chips are awarded for the originality and completeness of story the child tells the therapist (a beginning, middle, and end being encouraged).  The therapist may then be awarded chips for a responding story to which the child may respond for more chips.<br/><br/>From the publisher's description found on multiple websites listing this game for sale:<br/><br/>A Psychotherapeutic Game for Children<br/><br/>In this effective and comprehensive therapeutic game, Dr. Richard A. Gardner has combined four therapeutic storytelling techniques: The Bag of Words, The Bag of Toys, The Bag of Acts, and The Bag of Faces, incorporated in all of the important elements that have made Dr. Gardner`s games a staple of childhood therapy.<br/><br/>The instructions detail the effective use of this storytelling technique as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, with many case examples.<br/><br/>For use by therapist plus one child. <br/>Ages 5-12<br/><br/>From the directions:<br/><br/>&quot;The time frame of play is not fixed; rather, the duration of play is determined by the therapist's judgement...When the play time is ended, the player with the most chips is declared the winner...The players need not reach the finish point to end the game...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Pick-and-Tell Games are indicated for the wide variety of children's psychotic problems.  They are contraindicated for psychotic children and/or those significantly involved in fantasy.  Such children's problems might be entrenched because the games encourage further fantasizing.  Such children should play reality-oriented games e.g. The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Pick-and-Tell Games were designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children.  Accordingly, every reasonable attempt is made to limit the sale and distribution of the game to such professionals.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each time a beast dies, the player can collect the weapon that the beast had in it's lair. The weapons are humorous and include such things as a double barreled bazooka, a rocket sword, and a tank.<br/><br/>The combat system is very simple. Both the player and the beast have a starting health which is decreased by modified die roll. Depending on your weapon and the beast's strength the damage may be a die roll + 2, a combination of four dice rolled together, or similar modifiers. Each lair and weapon has it's own modifier. Assuming that you survive combat, you're health is automatically reset for the next cave.<br/><br/>Each beast is more difficult to kill than the last (culminating with the dragon in the 7th lair), but each new weapon is more powerful so the player's combat ability increases with the game's difficulty. The game is won by slaying the dragon.<br/><br/>",

Sicic is played on two 8 &times; 8 squared boards, named the Earth and the Sky. Each player has 4 pieces that move on the Earth (the Astronomers) and 4 pieces to be placed in the Sky (the Stars). The Stars are the player&rsquo;s Constellation. There are three phases: the Afternoon, the Evening and the Night. One of the player will be the first to move in every phase of the game.<br/><br/>In the Afternoon, players alternate placing one Astronomer at a time on the Earth, on an empty square. In the Evening, players alternate placing one Star at a time in the Sky, on an empty square. In the Night, each player must move one of his Astronomer every turn. The Astronomer can move in a direct line in every direction, any number of unoccupied squares. He must land in an unoccupied square. The Astronomer may choose not to move, in order to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; one of the opponent&rsquo;s Astronomers set in a neighbouring square. The result of a pinch is that the pinched Astronomer must move in the next turn. Moreover, it is forbidden to the opponent, in the second next turn, to pinch an Astronomer that occupies the abandoned square.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player who manages to place his Astronomers in the same way as the opponent&rsquo;s Stars. Translations, reflections and rotations are allowed. Also, a player can win by pinching an Astronomer that is not able to move.<br/><br/>Sicic is latin for &ldquo;stellae inerrantes caeli imitatio consequi&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Online Play: Super Duper Games<br/><br/>",

The game includes one clockwork, strawberry board, 4 worm cards (1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow) and 20 green worms with coloured tail ends, 5 worms in each of the 4 colours.<br/><br/>You set the game up by randomly placing the worms in the holes in the strawberry and then each player selects a colour.  The aim of the game is to be the first player to get all 5 worms in your colour.  There is a lever at the top of the board, pull it and release to make the worms start wiggling (you'll have to repeat this frequently throughout the game as it only lasts for 10 seconds or so).<br/><br/>Once started players take it in turns, beginning with the youngest player, to grab a worm from the strawberry.  If it matches their card they keep it, if not they put it back and then the next player goes.  You keep going around until one player gets all of their 5 worms.<br/><br/>This is a very simple kids memory game with a dexterity element as you try and grab the wiggling worms as they move up and down in the board.<br/><br/>",

But we all could use a little kokua in learning new Hawaiian huaolelo or brushing up on our vocab. Hulo! is a fast, fun, and easy way to practice your Hawaiian vocabulary. Whether you know five Hawaiian words or five hundred, you can enjoy learning with friends and family as you race to complete your Hawaiian crossword.<br/><br/><br/>     Hulo! is themed after the old Hawaiian nupepa, or newspapers, which didn&rsquo;t have diacritics. So you can play without worrying about okina and kahako markings.    <br/>     Wondering if you can use people or place names? Hiki no! Go right ahead. So even if you don&rsquo;t know many Hawaiian words, you probably know a lot of names of people, streets, cities, and other places.<br/>     Two-letter huaolelo are okay.<br/>     You can use the same word twice.<br/>     Going over the pronunciation and definitions at the end is one of the funnest parts of the game. See how many new huaolelo you can learn from the other players.<br/>     Instructions are included inside the box.<br/><br/><br/>You'll find a few pieces that aren't letters.<br/><br/>Watch out for the Ewalu piece! If someone draws it and plays it on you, aue! Aloha no! That means your crossword has to have at least one eight-letter huaolelo. Laki maikai!<br/><br/>Need some different letters to spell a huaolelo? If you draw an Akau piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the akau, right.<br/><br/>If you draw a Hema piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the hema, left.<br/><br/>The Ku! piece is like a wildcard, so you can use it as any letter of your choosing. Or, if someone is winning and you want to stop their momentum, yell out &quot;Ku!&quot; to stop gameplay. You can then take one of their letters, replace it with the Ku! piece, and designate the Ku! piece as a different letter. Ho ke kolohe! What this means for your opponent is probably a lot of crossword rearranging! Minamina no hoi!<br/><br/>The Ea piece is the one everybody wants to have. It means you have ea, or sovereignty, so nobody can mess with your crossword. In other words, you're free to make your own huaolelo without being affected by special pieces like Ewalu, Akau, Hema, and Ku. You are kuokoa--independent!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alien Zombie Tentacle Apocalypse. You don't have to outrun the monsters, you just have to outrun the other players. Everyone takes on the role of two or more B-movie archetypes, trying (futilely) to escape the apocalypse. Using their native abilities, gear and event cards, no one wants to be at the back of the pack when the &ldquo;Die Horribly&rdquo; phase arrives. Yeah, they are (were) your friends, but we're talking alien probing here. Not to mention brain-eating zombies and while you have never seen it yourself (yeah, right), you've heard what the tentacles do to you. Come to think of it, you never much liked those people anyway....<br/><br/>A game of AZTA takes between half an hour and an hour, depending on how cutthroat you are, and while you can play with two, maximum deviousness and treachery requires three to six players. You need to help your friends if you are going to survive. You just don't want to help them too much...<br/><br/>AZTA requires cardstock or business card sheets (11 of them), and preferably a color printer. The rules are one page long, so you can just dive in and play. The cards, rules and components all fit into a standard deck box for easy carrying.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Salmandaar Lite is a semi-coop game for 1-6 players wherein the players spawn armies from castles located at the points of a hexagonal island and try to withstand the invasion of Fire Salamanders pouring forth from the volcano in the center of the island. The island and counters are all contained in the PDF that will be submitted to the file section, as will the instructions.<br/><br/>Player units represent workers, resources and military, and can be spent in attack, to build roads, or to support the generation of more units by providing infrastructure at the player's home castle. Players are expected to generally cooperate in repelling the Fire Salamander invasion, but player combat is possible and might be necessary to defend your castle from players fleeing Salamander overruns of their own lands. Combat with both the invaders and other players is by mutual removal, representing the consumption of both forces and materials and wealth, or will dice rolls, which might result in removal of the enemy without loss of the player unit, or might result in defeat and removal of the attacking unit. Both players and the invading Salamanders will start spawning from any captured castles.<br/><br/>Paper unit markers are provided, and are color-blindness friendly, but wooden cubes of assorted colors would be a great substitute.<br/><br/>At the end of every round (after the last player takes a turn), advance a marker on the turn track. Game ends after ten rounds, or if all players are eliminated.  Winner is the player with the most castles and armies afield at game end.<br/><br/>This is a PnP version of a game still in development, Salamandaar (sans Lite,) for the One Sheet PnP contest. The PnP version is a fixed map, though I will provide additional maps.  The final non-lite version of the game will feature a fixed intro map over which random map tiles may be placed, or placed according to scenario.  The non-lite version will feature a larger map as well, and some more robust player abilities, some more ways to spend units.<br/><br/>Variant:  Add a seventh player, who runs the Salamanders, ignoring the target priority rules and moving as he/she wishes.<br/><br/>",

What's a 20th anniversary without a &quot;wow&quot; kind of game? Introducing I Spy Spectacular, a one-of-a-kind game with a 3-tiered spinner that will send you over the edge looking for picture matches. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the I Spy series, new riddles from Jean Marzollo are paired with 13 of Walter Wick's photographs from the classic I Spy vault to create a spectacular search-and-find game.<br/><br/>I Spy Spectacular Game is a matching game that centers around a 3-level spinner with cards to match the items on the spinner complete with I Spy's trademark riddles. This game contains one three-level spinner, which when spun locks into place one level at a time for hundreds of possible combinations of items on the spinner. The 36 double sided cards have a different combination of items on each one. Every spin will have a card to match one of the combinations it produces. Kids scramble to be the first to find a match and score 1 of the 50 score chips. The rules cotain more than one game play depending on the age group playing.<br/><br/>And don't forget the riddles that become a fun and creative activity at the end of the round.<br/><br/>",

The game includes animal tokens, paper banknotes, a linen bag and an auctioneer's gavel.  There are six farm cards representing Allards Farm, Brookfield Farm, Heydon Farm, Coombe Farm, Barratts Farm and Manor Farm, and six player tokens representing the owner of each farm.  The rules allow for a seventh player to act as banker/auctioneer.<br/><br/>Each player starts with &pound;200, a farm card and a farmer token.  Players roll dice to make their way around the game board, following any instructions on the spaces they land on.  When players reach the central market area, an auction is held to purchase animal tokens drawn from the linen bag.  Once three animals have been auctioned, players move around the Market Square spaces before the market closes.  Players then return home and play restarts from the starting square.<br/><br/>Each player places any animals they obtain onto their personal farm board.  A tractor must also be bought during the game.  The winner is the first player to have a complete farm.<br/><br/>",

In the real world, however, the &quot;wizards&quot; are actually mathematicians, who use their magic powers of multiplication, subtraction and other operations to transform numbers into a different form.<br/><br/>In Math-A-Kazam! players try their hand at this math wizardry, using a magnetic wand to pull magnetic number chips from a bowl and creating equations as they do so. The game includes sixty regular number chips (six each 0-9) and ten &quot;gold-rimmed Magic Jewel&quot; number chips (0-9).<br/><br/>On a turn, a player has 30 seconds in which to create an equation. Players must pull chips from the cauldron one at a time and state the equation as they draw each chip, although they can change the equation in mid-play if they can't find the number they need or come across better chips. Equations are created strictly from left to right, ending with the sum or product of the equation with the operators mentally added by the active player. (A variant for math fiends suggests following the order of operations instead of reading the equation from left to right.)<br/><br/>If a player drops a chip while drawing it from the bowl or fails to create an equation before time runs out, then the player returns all chips to the bowl and ends his turn. Otherwise, he keeps all chips used in his equation.<br/><br/>Math-A-Kazam! ends once all the chips have been claimed or no more equations can be created. Each normal chips is worth one point; each Magic Jewel chip worth two. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Music, dance, laughter. What a mood! What a party! Here's your goal: gather as many guests as possible to your family party. Try to create that party atmosphere that only key guests can create, like Gerard and his guitar, or by combining the trainer and his animals. It would not be so difficult if it wasn't for your opponents who will do everything in their power to break your party. Party de famille is a card game with 4 players, played in teams of 2. Overall, try your luck, start your invitations for the best family party ... and let the fun begin!<br/><br/>This is a trick-taking card game. You must bet on how many trick-taking you can make in a round to make points. If you and your partner get it right, you get to count ambiance points, which consist of card combinations, as well as trick-taking points. If you got it wrong, your opponents get the ambiance points.<br/><br/>The game end when a team reaches 200 points.<br/><br/>",

Unusually, this seems to have been published before the real race was run, so the designer suggests that you could run the race more accurately after the horses are entered in real life.<br/><br/>Movement is by rolling dice and then looking at a chart on the back of each horse's card. On the back of the card, each horse has a set of target numbers for each quarter of the track. Dice are rolled and if you roll one of those numbers, the horse advances. If you don't, the horse doesn't move. Eight(8) horses are in each race, the players divide up the 8 horses.<br/><br/>As 32 horses are provided and only 8 run, you can play a series of 4 races, to use every horse once.<br/><br/>",

Sexton Blake, and his faithful sidekick Tinker, are the two most valuable law cards, as you would expect.<br/>The object is to collect sets of cards by winning tricks. Tricks are won absolutely normally (you must follow suit, if you can't then you may discard or play a trump (the law are the trumps).<br/>After all the tricks have been won, each player separates the cards worth 80 or more from his tricks won, and the rest of the cards are put to one side except that, if you do not have as many cards as the player who has the most, you draw enough cards from those set aside, making all the hands equal in the number of cards to play.<br/>In the second stage of the game, you continue trick-taking as before but the number of cards won is unimportant. What is important is that you are aiming to collect groups of 3, 4 or 5 cards of the same value.<br/>Points are scored by having such sets, with each group scoring the value of the cards in the group. The winner is the one with the highest score after three rounds have been played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Organized Chaos is a fast, fun, and exciting game that pits you against your opponents with one simple objective: Don&rsquo;t run out of all your cards. However, don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple objective! You will be tested in many ways, and perhaps if you make smart moves and think strategically then you will emerge victorious. Accomplishing the objective will be much harder than it seems, especially since you are racing against opponents that have every reason to prevent you from reaching your objective so that he or she may win the game. Think you are winning big time? Seconds later you are losing horribly. Got a strategy you think works every time? Not so much. Prepare for excitement and disappointment, structure and disarray, this is Organized Chaos!<br/><br/>Everyone starts the game with one card in their hand. A token marks each players draw pile because it is very likely that one or more may end up face up at some point in the game. During a turn a player draws one card, giving them two in their hand. Each card has two sides, each with a different ability. The player may choose which card to play and which side of the card to invoke. Most cards have a side that is offensive and one that is defensive. For example, the most common type of card has Burn on one side and Refresh on the other. Burn allows you to choose an opponent and they must &quot;Burn&quot; or place the top X cards from their draw pile directly in their discard pile. Whereas, Refresh let's you take the top X cards from your discard pile on the bottom of your draw pile in any order.<br/><br/>There are also special cards that let you do things like flip yours or an opponents draw pile face up so everyone sees what their next card will be, another that lets you switch your entire deck with one of your opponents. There are several other cards that do similarly things to turn the game upside down. Use them all to your advantage to force your opponents' to lose all their cards and you will be the last one standing!<br/><br/>See our website for official rules updates or to purchase this and other Van Ryder Games.<br/><br/>",

Everyone now puts 5 counters into the 'Pool' and receives cards, leaving half the pack as a 'reserve'.<br/>The player sitting left of the dealer starts and must play the first card of any set, if he has one. The next player plays a second card to the set started by the player to his right, if he has such a card. And so on, until a full set of three cards is revealed. The player playing the third part of the set (actually, called a trick in the rules), and must now start a new set if he can. There are penalties for a player not playing a card when he should or if the wrong picture is completed and so on. If you genuinely cannot play a card, you draw a card from the reserve.<br/>Interestingly, for a game of this age, you can score bonus points for certain tricks or negative bonuses for some tricks.<br/>For example, completing the Baby set takes 5 counters from the pool and one counter from every other player, or completing the Horse Omnibus set pays three counters into the pool, and so on.<br/>The player taking the most tricks when all 24 sets have been completed takes the remaining counters in the pool and the player now with the most counters, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On that afternoon you collect gate receipts when you pass the square designated for that purpose. This improves as you rise up the divisions.

In his turn, a player may lay down a set of 4, or he may take the face-up card from the discard pile, or he can draw a face-down card from the deck, or he can ask for a card he believes another player has.

The cards are also numbered from 1 to 8.<br/>Each player gets 6 counters. Take out the Old Maid card as it is not used in the main game. Then the cards are dealt out to each player but an extra hand should also be dealt. This extra hand should remain face down and kept out of the game. Therefore, a few cards are not in play so will cause 'Stops' as the game proceeds.<br/>The first player plays a card and announces its number and race. The next player must play the next card in rank for that race if he has it. If he doesn't then he says &quot;I pass&quot;. There will probably come a point when the next highest card is not in play because all players will pass. In this case the player who played the last card, plays to the next round of play.<br/>The Japanese Baby is a special card that allows the player to play it after he has just added a legal card, crying &quot;Spin&quot; as he does so. This means that the card he last played becomes a stop.<br/>The game stops when one player has run out of cards. There are various rewards and forfeits and the player with the most counters wins.<br/>Rules are included for the main game and two variants, Pool Spin and Old Maid (the publisher having added an Old Maid card for this version).<br/><br/>",

Temple cards are simultaneously revealed and if there is a conflict at that location, Challenge cards are revealed and resolved.

        "description": "Welcome to Lake Wanapulachit!<br/><br/>Take the Bait is a light, Euro-style tile collection game featuring teams of four whimsical fishermen competing to bring in the biggest catch. Do you rely on sheer fishing talent, or do you break out the Banjooki 2000 Platinum-plated Turbo Reel to haul in the monster fish? The choice is yours!<br/><br/>Take the Bait plays up to four players, and features a game board laid out like a lake with the game sections arranged around the lake in a semi-circle. The players take on the roles of four fishing teams at a tournament, lead by some whimsical characters with special abilities from which the players can choose.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three days (rounds), with three turns each round. Players begin the first, third and sixth turns at camp, in tents. They visit the campground canteen and, depending on certain circumstances, choose a coffee for the day, which will determine their turn order. Of course, the coffee that gives the biggest kick allows a player to go first but it also costs the most. Then it's onto the tackle shop to buy some equipment - some items are mundane, but cheap, while others are a bit more special but may require players to spend more cash, which isn't easy to come by.<br/><br/>Next, it's time for fishing. According to certain character powers, equipment mixes, etc. the players take turns drawing fish (tiles) out of three areas of the lake. The area closest to shore is the easiest to fish in, but it's where all the smaller fish dwell. The middle body of the lake has some bigger fish but requires a pier license to reach. The third is the deepest and most costly in which to fish, but it's where the big daddies live, including one monster catfish that has never been caught and has fueled tall tales for years at the lake. Mixed into the tiles in each of the sections are also various bits of detritus such as old boots, lost bikinis and such that always seem to latch onto hooks during any fishing trip. They'll hurt your score at the end of the tournament, but some may very well be of use to someone if they, or an opponent, have a matching item...<br/><br/>Then there's the market, where fish can be sold for money to buy bigger equipment, or held until the end of the current day (round). The market prices fluctuate from day to day and there's a catch of the day that brings a bonus, so players will have to decide whether that fish is best kept for score or sold for cash.<br/><br/>The final station for each turn is the lodge where teams can hire a guide - an extra hand that will help them fish for the day. The guides get cheaper as the tournament draws to an end, so players will need to decide whether they pay a premium for that extra help in the beginning or save their money for one last push at the end. Teams can also check the weather for the next day while at the lodge, giving them a little insight at the weather patterns that could influence fish migration.<br/><br/>The next turns continue until the end of the day when there is a weigh in, which scores points for players. The player who has the most points at the end of three days wins!<br/><br/>Teams can also freely trade among themselves. This trading keeps the game lively and social, as players tempt each other to &quot;take the bait.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Before the game begins, the players shuffle the twelve dungeon tiles &ndash; seven of which are blank on both sides while five hide a member of the royal family &ndash; then place the tiles in the plastic grid in the box bottom.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she tries to use the rope to maneuver the key into the slot on one of the dungeon tiles and pick it up, after which she can then look at the tile. If the tile is blank, she can return it to any empty spot in the grid and try to &quot;fish&quot; for a new dungeon tile. If she finds a member of the royal family, she keeps the tile and her turn ends. Meanwhile, the other players are rolling a die that bears the face of Count Morticor among many blank sides. Each time the Count appears, disturbed by the rattling chains persumably, the players grab one of seven ghost chips. If they grab all seven before the active player rescues a member of the royal family, that player's turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>Whoever rescues the most members of the royal family wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There are several ways to &quot;ketchup&quot;! A great introduction to various math operations.<br/><br/>Players turn over a Math Challenge Card on their turn, and then roll dice to try to get a result that meets the requirements on the card.  The Challenges have varied requirements; some require an exact number, and some allow an answer from within a range of numbers, while still others demand an answer that is even or odd.<br/><br/>On their turn, the player rolls dice, some with numbers and some with math operators (+ or -).  Players must use all the dice in any order, so long as the number dice are separated by operator dice.  If no solution is found, they may reroll some or all of their dice.<br/><br/>On numbered spaces, the Challenge must be solved in a number of attempts less than or equal to the number shown on the space.  Some spaces picture a potato and are a &quot;Hot Potato&quot; zone, where any player may win.  All players compete at the same time to see who can solve the Challenge first.<br/><br/>When someone wins a Challenge they roll a Number Die, move that many spaces, then take another turn.  This continues as long as they are able to solve the Challenge, and passes clockwise when they can't.<br/><br/>When a player passes the Ketchup Packet marker, anyone who is behind gets to slide forward to the closest &quot;Catch Up&quot; space.  The first player to reach the final space on the board is the &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Problem Solving, Quick Thinking, Less Than, Greater Than, Addition &amp; Subtraction<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spartacus is a wargame for 1 or 2 players simulating the Servile War of 73-71 BC. One of the players leads the forces of the escaped gladiator Spartacus, the other controls the Roman forces. The game also includes rules for solitaire play (in which case the game system controls the Roman side).<br/><br/>The game is played on a point-to-point map of Italy. Each point of the map has a set of numbers describing how many troops Spartacus can recruit there, how many equipment points are available (for arming and training recruits), how much food is available and if a granary is present in the region. Each game turn consists of moving Spartacus' army, collecting recruits, arming and training slaves, and checking whether or not there are enough supplies available in the occupied regions (if not, casualties occur and one or more regions is devastated). The Roman player then take her turn, moving legions and checking for reinforcements.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by a diceless Combat Result Table which take into account the training level and quality of the troops, the terrain and the strategic value of the leaders.<br/><br/>Spartacus wins by either successfully besieging Rome, flee through the Alps or escape by the sea. The Roman player wins by preventing a Slave victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VECTOR CHESS is a war game that was developed from a combination of the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo;, which is a quantity used to represent magnitude and direction, and &ldquo;chess&rdquo;, one of the world&rsquo;s oldest war games. Each piece in this game has a rank that determines the distance it may move, and a directional characteristic which indicates the direction that it may be moved. In this way, each piece represents a vector, having characteristics of both magnitude and direction.<br/><br/>PLAYING SURFACE: Vector Chess is played on a square playing area divided into either 49 or 64 smaller squares of equal size. The squares may be alternately light and dark colored, but it is not necessary. A game played on the board having 49 squares will usually make for a shorter game when compared to a game on the 64 square board.<br/><br/>THE PIECES: Depending upon the type of board used, enough pieces must be used to fill the first two rows of squares on each side of the board, with each piece set facing the opposite side of the board. Only two types of pieces are used in this game: the MAJOR pieces, and the MINOR pieces. The major pieces, which are line up along the first row of the board, have the highest rank and may be moved from one to four spaces along a straight line in the direction that they are pointing. The minor pieces are lined up on the second row of the board, and are identical to the major pieces except that they are shorter and may be moved only one or two spaces in the direction that they are pointing. Each piece in this game maneuvers like a soldier on a battlefield &ndash; it may turn and move to a new position, provided no other piece blocks its path, and it may attack any enemy piece that is directly in its path and within range. The range of movement is the number of spaces that the piece move can move as was previously described.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME: The object of the game is to &ldquo;check mate&rdquo; the opposing player by maneuvering pieces into his first row squares until the defending pieces in that row are outnumbered. If the first row squares are empty, only one attacking pieces is required to put the opposing player &ldquo;in check&rdquo;. The defending player must break the check during his next turn as described below, or he will be considered &ldquo;check mated&rdquo;.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS: This game includes 32 round wooden playing pieces in 2 colors that are similar looking to a rook in chess but have a directional arrow in the top. For each player there are 8 'tall' pieces and 8 'short' pieces that otherwise look identical. The board included has a 7x7 grid on a rolled up vinyl board (although the game can also be played on an 8x8 grid - presumably a standard chess board would be suitable)<br/><br/>",

Then, racing around London, you must find where each piece of evidence is located. Visit the scenes, study the clues and perform forensic tests using the tools included in the game. This may sound easy, but speed, a keen eye and attention to detail are essential to success. There is multiple evidence in each location and you will need to use your forensic test equipment with skill and accuracy to ensure you get the correct results.<br/><br/>Once you have successfully determined the location of all six pieces of evidence, return quickly to Scotland Yard and present your findings to the Detective Superintendent ... but be quick, the police are counting on you.<br/><br/>",

On their turn a manager can use the money to buy new items from a selection available and they can turn to their players to play games against a dozen different teams, some stronger than others. Over the course of the game, the manager's club (their hand of cards) will grow bigger and stronger, allowing them to compete against and beat the stronger opposition teams in the game. Build For The Title is all about building a strong and streamlined club that is capable of beating everyone in their way.<br/><br/>",

Rolling a manager icon lets you change the result of another die; the dice also have whistle and substitution icons.<br/><br/>The first player to score five goals wins.<br/><br/>",

With his powerful army, each warlord expands across Eurasia conquering and pillaging the native peoples. The warlord who ships the richest plunder back to Mongolia will certainly be named the next Great Khagan (and win the game).<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, the active player draws from his pool of available tumens (Mongolian army unit of 10,000 men). The drawn tumen tokens function as the player's army for the given turn. Players move their tumens to conquer new territories, receiving both resources and intimidation tokens, the latter of which can be strategically used to acquire even more territories.<br/><br/>In the spirit of nomadic warfare, at the end of each turn, the active player must select one of his clans to encamp. All tumens of a differing clan are removed from play. Tumens of the chosen clan remain on the board, functioning as a springboard for future conquests on the player's next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game of Flat Green Bowls<br/><br/>Well You Bowled is a board game based on the sport of flat green bowls.  The object of the game, as in real bowls, is to get as many of your woods as possible nearre the Jack than your opponent's nearest wood.  The game is designed to be played by two teams of up to four players, but may be played in on an individual basis if required.  The game is played over a series of &quot;ends&quot;.<br/><br/>Each end the jack is set, then each player places a wood along the baseline and declares the intended length, then draws a card from the top of the deck to determine the position of that wood on the rink in relation to the position nominated.  If the wood hits another, then the &quot;wick&quot; cards give directions for the two playing pieces.  Players may instead of drawing a card to elect to fire.  Instead they draw from the fire deck and follow the instructions.  Once all players have played their woods, then end is finished, and the end is scored, and another one started.  A game is either played to an agreed number of ends or an agreed number of shots (points).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a article titled Three Dimensional Chess: Reflections and Speculations by Benjamin Grosbayne on page 74 in British Chess Magazine, Volume 85 (1964) there is one terse paragraph describing a 3D tic-tac-toe game.<br/><br/>&quot;The simplest beginning for the whole 3D concept in the field of board games can be seen in QUBIC, the 3D tic-tac-toe (tick-tack-too) made by George M. Fox of Shelbourne Falls, Mass., U.S.A. This elementary game has three boards superimposed, each of five squares. The rules are as in the 2D game played by children except that the players move in three directions. The levels are held together by thin poles and the whole may be assembled or taken apart and then packed into a very small space. It should serve as a good introduction for young children and beginners in some of the following 3D games.&quot;<br/><br/>The only arrangement for the boards that would make sense for 5 spaces an &quot;X&quot; pattern.<br/><br/>Shelbourne Falls is evidently a misspelling since there is no such town in Massachusetts.

        "description": "Players build a football team one player at a time in Fu&szlig;ball Poker, but they're never assured of getting the player they want since all of the other team owners are bidding at the same time as you.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with &euro;100 million; someone shuffles the 48 player cards, then places them in a face-down pile. On a turn, the active player draws and reveals four cards, then places a bid face-down on the table; while the bid itself is secret, other players can see how many money cards you included in the bid. Each player in turn places a secret bid, then they reveal these bids. Whoever offers the most money takes the footballer of his choice and places it in an empty position in his team line-up on the game board, then the second-highest bidder does the same, and so on. If a player has no money, he takes the last card on offer. The active player position rotates to the left, then players each bid on and draft another card.<br/><br/>In addition to acquiring high-valued footballers, players are trying to fill their team with a proper line-up of players &ndash; midfielders in the midfield, three defenders and a keeper in the back, and so on &ndash; as they score bonus points when those sections have the properly positioned players in them. When a player drafts an &quot;ersatz&quot; (substitute) footballer, it can replace any footballer already in play and it counts as being in the proper position; the drawback is that an ersatz player is worth no points on its own.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds of drafting, each player will have a full line-up and one player on the sidelines; this player can be substituted for any other footballer already on the team, even if the substitute is not labeled &quot;ersatz&quot;.<br/><br/>Players then tally their player points and any bonus points for completing a section with the proper footballers. The player with the highest score wins, with ties being broken by the money still in hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A combination of chess and poker that uses standard playing cards for special effects.  The chess pieces move as they would in an ordinary game of chess, with certain exceptions.  Players draw cards from a standard poker deck on every turn.    Different cards correspond to different playing pieces.  The red cards correspond to the white pieces and the black cards correspond to the black pieces. Being able to form and play different Poker hands allows the players to do such things as teleport a piece or move multiple times in a row.  For the white player, red poker hands effect the player's own pieces and black poker hands effect the opponent.<br/><br/>The effects of the various poker hands are potent, thus, the game is a much more tactical chess that is quicker, more severe, and with added dimensions to consider.  Playing in the traditional sense generally does not work as the playing of the various poker hands change the traditional rules.<br/><br/>",

Leaving behind A' Company in reserve, the 899th moved out at 0845 hours in a full-throttle dash to meet the Germans. Captain Kirk Adam's B' Company was in the lead and reached El Guettar just as Stukas worked over the area. Following a meeting between Colonel Tinscher, his S-3 Captain Joseph Morrison and the CO of the 601st T.D. Battalion, B' Company was ordered into the pass immediately, without waiting for C' Company. At 0955 B' Company sped into the valley floor between hills, immediately drawing fire. One destroyer was disabled on a minefield. The rest reorganized, moved off the road, and amid heavy fire from artillery, anti-tank and small arms, focused on enemy armor. Their 3-inch guns proved deadly, destroying ten Mark IVs, two anti-tank guns, and damaging two other Panzers in exchange for three M-10s burned and two disabled. For his action, Lieutenant Coady was awarded the Silver Star...<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: RELUCTANT OFFENSIVE is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa.

The Marvel Universe provides the setting as heroes and villains (such as Hades, Loki and Athena) battle each other for supremacy at your hands.<br/><br/>The basic game consists of several elements. You have a battle map, a set of battle medallions, power boost medallions, and the central element - your Slinger. The Slinger is a ball-shaped yo-yo-like creation with a magnet on the under-belly; each Slinger has its own personality in terms of power and stamina, making different ones suitable for different levels of expertise.<br/><br/>You use the Slinger to attack your opponents' battle medallions on the battle map, wielding the Slinger like a yo-yo. Your aim is to make contact with your chosen target and defeat it. The built-in power meter measures power, and a winner is determined. Each round is played as a 5-on-5 battle.<br/><br/>The collectible aspect comes in the form of different Slingers and different medallions (both battle and power boost) &ndash; all in various levels of rarity.<br/><br/>",

All the players except the bank can bet any amount of counters they wish, on any colour they wish. Then you place the ball into the device, and give it a spin, and see where the ball falls out. This lights one of the circles at the side and who ever has bet on that colour wins.<br/><br/>The colours offer the odds as follows:<br/>Green 2 - 1<br/>Yellow 3 - 1<br/>Blue 5 - 1<br/>Pink 7 - 1<br/>Red 15 - 1<br/><br/>You can bet with counters, or real money if everyone agrees.

The prize was it being printed on the back of every Cadbury selection box the following year.<br/><br/>It's a Christmas tile-placing game for 2-4 players in which presents fall down chimneys into hearths. However, the path of falling presents does not always run smoothly and players may divert presents into their own hearths by altering the course of the chimneys.<br/><br/>Chimney tiles are positioned each turn by players hoping to funnel presents into their hearths or away from other players'. The chimneys may split, curve or even multiply the number of presents that fall through them. Some chimney tiles have presents on them that signal a drop. Before those tiles are placed, presents fall down each column and into the hearths. Each present is worth a point. At the end of the game there is a final present drop and the players total up their points.<br/><br/>",

When used with a compatible book or game, the stick reads texts or plays music.<br/><br/>&quot;Die Schatzkammer von El Mirador&quot; is the first game for the Toystick. The players are adventurers searching for treasures in the legendary cave of El Mirador. They have to avoid hidden traps, and whoever collects the most treasures wins the game.<br/><br/>The Toystick functions as a random movement generator that tells the players how many spaces they can move on the board. It also tells them when they have hit one of the hidden traps, which ends the current player's turn. The board has special spaces for treasure markers. If a player reaches a treasure space with a suitable treasure (as marked on one of the treasure maps), they earn that treasure. Another element in the game is the guardian, which the players move to one of the guardian spaces when they've collected a treasure. All player tokens in that segment of the board are returned to the pyramid in the center of the board. Equipment chits can be used to escape from traps or the guardian, to exchange the position of treasures etc.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has collected the required number of treasures (6 or 8).<br/><br/>",

In Kookiz, players want to grab as many different types of cookies as possible, preferably big stacks of cookies to keep them out of the hands of other players.<br/><br/>The deck in Kookiz consists of 80 cards, with eight cards of ten types of cookies. Before starting the game, shuffle the cards, deal each player a hand of four cookies, place four(if there are 2 or 4 players) or five(if there are 3 or 5 players) cookies in the center of the table, then deal out the other cards evenly to form face-down draw stacks for each player. This is a real-time game, there are no player turns. Everyone plays simultaneously at the same time (as fast as they can :D ), and performs one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    You can place two or more cookies of the SAME type in a face-up stack in front of you.<br/>    You can play a single cookie from your hand on top of a card in the center of the table, then place that stack before you.

You can only take this action if you are holding ONE copy of the card.<br/><br/><br/>After any action, refill your hand to four cookies, drawing from your own face-down stack. The round ends when a player has played all of her cards; this player scores three bonus points for ending the round.

There are 7 categories of challenges- 5 power challenges -Knowledge, Performance, Visual, Physical, Logical- plus General challenges and Battle challenges. Each category has at least 10 different types of tasks of different difficulty levels and styles.<br/><br/>The game is staged in Ancient Greece when Gods were ruling over the earth and influenced the lives of men.  The players enter the Labyrinth and go towards the center to beat the Minotaur and become Heroes.  On their way, players gather Powers, by completing challenges.  Once they are heroes, they need to go back and get out of the Labyrinth. Only a true God can escape the mythical Maze alive. On their way back they need stronger powers that they gather by completing Hero challenges. The first to escape the Labyrinth is the winner &ndash; a God of Olympus.<br/><br/>The story: The Gods of Olympus decided to welcome one human among them as one of their peers. But it cannot be any human. He/she has to be worthy of becoming a God, the best they can find, one who is a true hero and of special character. Each city of Ancient Greece selected their best representative and sent them to participate to the Gods of Olympus Challenge.  Each city selected the bravest, the strongest, the smartest and the most talented citizen to represent them in the Gods Challenge and gain protection of the Gods for their city and the people living in it.<br/><br/>You are the representative of one of the cities of Ancient Greece. As your city representative you will have to enter the Labyrinth, face multiple challenges that require skill, strength, knowledge, reach the Centre of the Labyrinth and face the Minotaur. To reach the centre of the labyrinth you need the 5 magic powers you gain on your way, but you also need luck and a good strategy.  You have to act smart, solve the challenges and move fast inside the labyrinth and out.  On your way, you'll have to avoid dangerous creatures like the Gorgons that can turn you into stone. You may also have to fight your opponents in fair battle, especially if they attack you. Only the first getting out of the labyrinth can become a God of Olympus and anyone can still win the game no matter how advanced the other players are, provided they play smart.<br/><br/>",

There are 48 cards arranged in 3 sets of 16, each lettered A, B or C and numbered 1 to 16; all the illustrations are different and have an appropriate title.<br/><br/>A set number of cards are dealt, probably 5, to each player. The object of the game is to complete a set of three cards, one from each letter, for example a set would be cards A1, B1 and C1, not 1 to 16 of A. The player to the dealer's left begins the play by asking his next neighbor on his left side for A, B or C of any set to complete the three cards of the set. When a player has succeeded in completing a set, he must show the completed set, and may then draw a card from the pool but no card must be drawn from the pool except upon the completion of a set, and only one card drawn.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the one who completes the most sets.<br/><br/>This game is copyright Thomas De La Rue on the box, but the rules say that H P Gibson are the copyright holders. As far as I know, there has never been a reissue of the game so I assume H P Gibson still hold the copyright. However, I am crediting them both with this game. Almost certainly, De La Rue printed it and H P Gibson distributed it.<br/><br/>",

Take one of these piles out of play and use the other three shuffled together. To decide the outcome of each delivery, turn over the top card and follow its instructions. Most of the time it will be a number of runs scored but it could say 'Out' or other options. If four wickets have fallen, add another 'Out' card into the remaining cards and shuffle them again. If 6 wickets fall, add the other 'Out' card.

Whether or not you&rsquo;re currently a player or playette, there is more game in this box than in most people&rsquo;s brains. Play it for fun, for training, or for a better social lubricator than alcohol. Like The Game itself, these cards can be used to break the ice and get to know people&mdash;whether strangers or your own partner&mdash;in minutes.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Got Game?&rdquo; is engineered to bring out the fun and attractive qualities in every player. From physical challenges to personality tests to secret conspiracies, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Got Game?&rdquo; has it all. So if you&rsquo;re looking to turn an ordinary night into a memorable adventure, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/><br/>Players take turns running game (script cards) on each other. The player with the most points after 12 script cards + The Final Challenge wins!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/><br/>Each round, one player is THE LEADER. THE LEADER reads a script card aloud to all the players. The script card, for example, can consist of personality tests, fun loaded questions, charade-like questions, handwriting analysis, palm reading, physical challenges, secret conspiracy missions, and more. The players respond to the script card accordingly. The player(s) who win the round receives points. (The script card states how many points the card is worth.) After each script card is completed, the next player going clockwise becomes THE LEADER. The player with the most points after 12 script cards + The Final Challenge wins.<br/><br/>",

When a card is played, a control marker is placed on it. Creature parts can be tails, middle parts or heads. A chimera is completed when it has a tail and a head. Several chimeras may be incomplete at the same time. A player may choose to discard a card and draw a new one instead of playing a card, or may choose to pass. When two players pass consecutively or the deck is depleted, the game ends. Players then earn score according to the sum of values printed on the creature part cards they played which form completed chimeras.<br/><br/>",

The difference between the attack and defense score affects the energy amount to be lost by the pieces.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the opponent&rsquo;s Emperor&rsquo;s energy amount to zero, while at the same time protecting one&rsquo;s own Emperor from the same fate.

Knights perform actions using an alternating sequence.  When activated, a Knight may move (via measurement in inches on the tabletop) and perform an attack action.  The combat system is diceless and invovles comparing an attacker's Fire Control System (FCS) or Melee Control System (MCS) rating to the target's Evasion Control Systems (ECS) rating.  If the ECS is exceeded, an attack hits and does damage.  At the beginning of each turn, players secretly select a Combat Mode for each Knight that determines its basic FCS, MCS, and ECS ratings for the turn.  These ratings may be modified by various upgrades and other actions that may be taken during the game.<br/><br/>",

Each round players take turns placing their minions into the 16 available Tower Chambers. Each chamber holds a distinct Mage that grants a special power, such as adding a minion to the board or moving a specific type of minion on the board. Players then take turns removing their minions from the tower to activate these powers. 12 chaos mages are available to mix things up. Win by capturing your opponents greater minions or by wiping him off the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The playing-field of Sqez is a rectilinear array of dots, of any convenient size &mdash; but arrays of less than 8 x 8 are too small, and exceptionally large fields may prolong the game needlessly, unless there are many players. The easiest way to make the arrays is to type up rows of full-stops on a typewriter; but it's just possible that somewhere or other you can buy dotted paper (wallpaper?), and it wouldn't be hard to get used to playing on small-squared graph paper, counting each inter&not;section as a 'dot'. But I leave this to your ingenuity.<br/>Each player in Sqez must complete a rectangle (oblong or square) by drawing a line through the dots. The line drawn must not anywhere duplicate an already placed line, though it may cross another line, or meet it at one end; and the rectangle drawn must enclose at least one 'free' dot &mdash; a free dot being defined as a dot that has no line passing through it or originating at it. The last player to complete a legal move is the winner.<br/>Those are the entire rules, except to say that a player who places a line which he cannot (owing to miscalculation) use to make a legal move (by completing a rectangle as defined) forfeits the game.<br/><br/>",

Race against the other players each round to be the first to figure out who is holding the kite shown on the die roll. This is a great way for kids to practice holding attention and mentally tracing a route in their heads.<br/><br/>First, the players roll the die.  This determines the color that is being tracked this turn.  At the same time, all players should mentally follow the string from the kite down to figure out which character is holding the other end of the string.  Players must not use their fingers, just follow the string's path in their heads.<br/><br/>Once someone thinks they have the right answer, yell &quot;STOP!&quot; and grab the matching Solution Tile.  Everyone checks together to see if this is the correct solution.  Collect a Pinwheel for a correct answer, but lose a Pinwheel if you're wrong!<br/><br/>If you roll yellow and the yellow balloon is showing near the characters, players have to grab the Yellow Balloon Solution Tile instead of tracing the yellow kite's string.  Similarly, if you roll orange and Squawk the parrot is showing near the kites, players have to grab the Squawk Solution Tile instead of tracing the orange kite's string.  You lose a Pinwheel if you grab another Solution Tile when you should have chosen Squawk or the balloon!<br/><br/>The game comes with double-sided Character and Kite boards, and 2 double-sided and reversible String Boards to keep players guessing.<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN:  Mental Mapping, Color Recognition, Quick Thinking<br/><br/>",

The undealt cards are laid seperately in the centre of the table face down. The cards have either two letters or one letter on them and in one of four colours. In her turn, a player must choose one of the face down cards and then discard a card by returning a card from his hand by placing it face down in the centre of the table. However, before she does this, she must show it to all the other players. Now memory is added to the game because if you need a specific card, and you can remember that it was discarded earlier, it would be beneficial to recall where it is in the face down cards.<br/><br/>The object is to collect cards that spell out the words GREEN LABEL (the company's most famous brand).

        "description": "This game was invented by D. J. Springgay who is a well-known chess player, so the game is worthy of attention. Zug is an abstract game for two players with simple rules and fairly obvious affinities to several well-known games and has been well tested in practice. A provisional patent application for the game was filed in October, 1971.<br/><br/>The game is played on a square board composed of 17 squares by 17 alternately coloured light and dark, the corner squares being dark. Two lines marked on the board are called advance lines (between the 4th and 5th rank and the 13th and 14th rank depending on the end you are starting).<br/>These are of two contrasting colours but otherwise identical. Each player has twelve. The player of the dark pieces places nine men on rank 1 and the remaining three on any squares on rank two. The player of the light pieces does the same on ranks 17 and 16 respectively.<br/><br/>The players are referred to as Black (the player of the dark pieces) and White, regardless of the colours of the men.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first  to move all one&rsquo;s pieces to the opposite end of the board such that the 1st (17th) rank is occupied by nine pieces with the remaining three pieces on the 2nd (16th) rank.<br/><br/>A piece may jump over one or more other pieces of either colour provided that each jump is over an adjacent piece to a vacant square and in a forward direction only.<br/><br/>Neither player may play a piece to the end rank unless all his pieces are forward of his advance line. When a player has all his pieces forward of his opponent&rsquo;s advance line, he is permitted to move pieces backwards if he wishes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once again the checker board provides the basis for a game, only this time the size grid required is 10x10.<br/><br/>In 'Freeze' the movement of each playing piece is dependent upon its position on the board in relation to the other pieces. The object of the game is to prevent one's opponent from moving any of his pieces.<br/><br/>Each of the players has ten cube-shaped pieces, the two sets being of contrasting colours. During the game, a piece can be in one of three states: free, polarised or frozen. Thus the faces of the cubes are marked, so that the one facing upper most indicates its current state. These marks are:<br/>Plain face &mdash; free<br/>A line (either diagonally or orthogonally) &mdash; polarised<br/>A large central dot &mdash; frozen.<br/><br/>A cube moves according to the state that it is in, as follows:<br/>Free &mdash; any distance in any direction (as the Queen in chess)<br/>Polarised &mdash; any distance along the line of polarisation<br/>Frozen &mdash; no movement<br/><br/>To start the game, the pieces are set up in opposite corners, with the three corner pieces being in a free state and the remainder diagonally polarised towards the opponent's corner. Players choose who is to start and then move one of their pieces alternately. No piece may move over or onto any occupied square.<br/><br/>The state of pieces change as follows:<br/>If two free, opposing pieces come into line, diagonally or orthogonally, without any other piece between them, then both become polarised and are turned to show a polarised face with the line in the correct direction.<br/>If a piece becomes polarised along two different lines, it becomes frozen and is unable either to move or to polarise or freeze opposing pieces.<br/><br/>The action of freezing a piece may well release one or more pieces that were under its influence before it was frozen. When a polarised or frozen piece becomes separated from a piece which was polarising it, by the intervention of another piece, it is no longer under the influence of that piece and may move up to the next advantageous state; thus a frozen cube becomes polarised and a polarised one is freed. Any piece may change its state by the movement of any other piece on the board, whether friendly or enemy. Each such move can easily set off a chain reaction. It is the responsibility of each player to point out those opposing pieces which have become polarised or frozen as the result of a move. He should also note when his own pieces are freed.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who first freezes all of his opponents pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game from Games and Puzzles magazine, issue 38.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-6 players and is played on a board laid out as shown in the diagram. Each track or run is in two parts, the Base along the edge of the board, and the Approach. Each pair of Base and Approach runs would be of a different colour, but are lettered in the diagram for the purpose of identification. Each player would have a cube, of the same colour as his track. This cube is marked from 1-6 in a similar fashion to a dice, but with ants replacing the usual spots. A collection of ants' eggs with a container and a normal die complete the equipment. The eggs are quite simple to make from papier mache, plaster or a similar substance and painted white.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the eggs are placed in the container, which in turn is placed in the Queen Ant's Nest in the middle of the board. The cubes are situated in their respective bases with the side showing the six ants uppermost. The die is thrown in turn, and the cubes moved the appropriate number of squares in the direction indicated, along the Base run and then up the Approach run.<br/><br/>The first player to reach his X on the Ant Nest surround, stops on that square and becomes the Defender of the Queen Ant's Nest. All other ants to reach their X's during that turn become Attackers, and attack the Defender. These attacks are resolved as follows: both players throw the die and the highest score wins, a draw counting as a win for the Defender. When the Defender wins, he remains where he is, and the Attacker returns to that square on his Approach run, having the same number as that thrown by the Defender. If the Attacker wins, he becomes the Defender, while the ousted Defender goes back to the square on his Base run having the same number as that thrown by the Attacker. Should a Defender be beaten by a throw of 6, he is returned to his Base and loses one ant from his group, and so recommences with the new ant group showing face up on the cube. A player with only one ant is knocked out of the game when beaten by an Attacker's throw of 6. On his turn, a Defender must attempt to circumnavigate the Nest, in accordance with throws of the die, and defend himself each time he lands on an opponent's X square containing a cube. When he returns to his own X, he stops (regardless of the throw) and is entitled to collect eggs as follows:<br/><br/>Size of    <br/>Ant Group<br/>6-5 = 3 eggs<br/>4-3 = 2 eggs<br/>2-1 = 1 egg<br/><br/>Play continues until all the eggs have been removed from the nest. The initial number of eggs is optional, but an ideal number is 30. The winner is the player having most eggs at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Although it may sound complicated, 'Antheap' is in fact very simple to play. It is well worth going to the trouble of making the board and the cubes, for it will certainly provide the younger members of the family with hours of fun.<br/><br/>",

The pattern consists of green water lilly leaves and purple lotus flowers. The playing pieces (6 per player) are cutely crafted wooden frogs in the same colors.<br/><br/>In the initial set-up 3 frogs per player are standing on both baselines; green frogs start on the green leaves, purple frogs on the purple flowers.<br/><br/>A turn consists of moving a frog of the own player color to an adjacent, free space. The color of the spaces doesn't matter any more at this point. The first player to get 4 frogs in a row, wins the game.<br/><br/>A game variant with hopping frogs allows for a faster game.<br/><br/>Lilly Frog is part of the same series as ChessQuito of the same editor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Business Cycles is an abstract game of chance and risk aversion. In Business Cycles, players play the role of entrepreneurs or CEOs directing three separate businesses over the course of a 40 year career. The winner is the player who retires with the greatest lifetime earnings after shepherding her businesses across the board.<br/><br/>Business Cycles is played in turns; on a turn a player rolls two dice and moves one or two business tokens along the game board, which is a track with 40 spaces. Some spaces have positive effects, some negative, and some require the player to take a card,  which may be positive, negative, or neutral. Players must use both dice if possible and two tokens may not occupy the same space. A player one of whose tokens lands on a positive (profit) space immediately takes another turn, and continues to do so until she ends a turn in which she has only landed tokens on negative or card-drawing spaces.<br/><br/>Bearing business tokens off at the end of the board must be done by an exact roll; once one player has borne off all of her businesses, each player who went after her in the initial turn order gets one more turn (so that all players will have had the same number of turns). At that point, the player with the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In original Quintazone, players create a surface of tiled cards with connections defined by matching the five elements of air, earth, fire, water, and space, and they score by occupying those cards with pyramids.<br/><br/>In Quintazone-Chaser, the game is extended, as the players roll a die to race across the cards and collect the pyramids that were placed in Quintazone. The Chaser plays faster than the original game, but can only be played directly after it.<br/><br/>In addition to the Aquarius Deck and Components: Looney Pyramid Games used in Quintazone, Quintazone-Chaser adds a unique token for each player and the color die from IceDice (or a regular numeric d6).<br/><br/>This expansion was originally published at IcehouseOrg.<br/><br/>",
