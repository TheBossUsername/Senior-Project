        "description": "FISH! Bass Lake is a fishing tournament board game for 2-4 players ages 6 and up. The game is beautifully illustrated with over 12 different types of fish in various sizes. Players start by purchasing fishing tackle (using tackle tokens) based on their game strategy. On a players turn they have a limited number of actions such as... moving their boat to a different fishing location, casting for fish, selling fish for tokens, buying more tackle, etc. When a player rolls FISH!, they draw a FISH! card and, if they have the right tackle, they get to keep the fish! If the player does not have the right tackle, the fish must be placed back at bottom of fishing location's deck. The winner is the first player to reach the tournament target in fish.<br/>This game is well-balanced between strategy, skill, &amp; luck. Players with good memory &amp; bluffing skills will do best. Perfect game for family get-togethers (young &amp; old) or playing ruthlessly against friends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kombination is one of several horse racing games created by Swedish designer Jan Jang&ouml;. He would later combine elements from this game with an early 1956 incarnation of J&auml;gersro to produce Glada galopp.<br/><br/>Kombination is a mechanically fairly simple game where players roll and move horses (which are not controlled by individual players) around a linear, looping track. After moving, a player may purchase a bet on a specific pair of horses, if they both occupy spaces indicating a value. The price of the bet is the sum of the values of the spaces occupied, those values increasing towards the goal spaces.<br/><br/>Once one or more bets have been acquired, a player must &quot;score a combination&quot; by moving the horses corresponding to a bet into goal spaces. (This may require some amount of rolling and looping, since any other player can move a horse past the goal spaces on their turn.) Once this is accomplished, the player scores a point and turns in the bet, again making it available for purchase.<br/><br/>There are several modes of play suggested depending on number of players and desired game length, but in the basic game, the first player to reach three points wins, obtaining all funds used to purchase bets (which may be just a flavour statement or hint at a possible metagame or gambling proposition).<br/><br/>The length and width dimensions given are for the folded board, while the depth is that of the folded board (0.6 mm) plus that of the box (2.2 mm). The width and length of the box itself are 17.3 x 13.7 mm.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Nominally there's an actual race, although this isn't really consistent with the leisurely sightseeing described in many events and use of contemporary passenger airliners. With its flavour texts and other enclosed information, the game is clearly meant to promote geographical knowledge as well as interest in commercial aviation.<br/><br/>Starting from Stockholm, each player colour has its own path connecting to the main circuit around the world. The spaces on the individual and common paths all have flavour texts, game instructions and/or point gains or losses associated with them. This information is found in player folders and the rules booklet, respectively.<br/><br/>Although most of the time players have no say in what happens, some spaces allow choices such as whether to gain a few points or move a step forward, and in a few spots, players are given small tasks such as drawing a llama, using an enclosed nomogram to calculate travel time, or explaining the significance of the International Date Line, which may gain or lose points as arbitrarily judged by an impartial scorekeeper (termed Traffic Controller) and/or the other players.<br/><br/>In addition to points gained from passing by or stopping in various locations, players also gain points based on the order in which they return to Stockholm. The player with the most total points is the winner. A variant to play the game purely as a race with no scorekeeping is also suggested.<br/><br/>Although only six players can fly planes, the rules include the role of scorekeeper in the player count.<br/><br/>ABA stands for AB Aerotransport, a Swedish airline which was folded into SAS just a few years after the publication of the game.

It&rsquo;s a large city with mud hovels and stone palaces surrounded by the crops of a rich civilization. This is Egypt in 300 B.C.<br/>The Hyskos, invaders from the northeast, have plundered and pillaged along the Nile from their base in the city of Avaris.

In the wake of these intrigues are others; priests, merchants, and military commanders jostling to attach themselves to the nobles who they think will come out on top.

It is important that the &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; side is face up so that other players don&rsquo;t see the answer when they open the Door.<br/>     The Wood Box passes to the next player on the left to open the Door and make his/her choice. The player places his/her Choice Card in the bottom section of the Wood Box with the &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; side facing up. All players are trying to correctly match what decision the Room Owner will make, not what they would do. To win a Pillow Card, players must match the response (Choice Card) that the Room Owner selected.<br/>     Play continues clockwise until all players have opened the Door and chosen the Choice Card that they think the Room Owner selected.<br/>     Once the Door has been passed to all players and returns to the Room Owner, he/she opens the Door and takes all of the Choice Cards out. Each player who matched the Room Owner wins a Pillow Card. If all players match the Room Owner, then the Room Owner also gets a Pillow Card.<br/>    . The Wood Box is then passed to the player on the left (the next Room Owner) who takes out the prior Image Card and secretly reveals a new Image Card so that other players don&rsquo;t see the image. (The Image Cards are all stacked in the Wood Box, so when the prior Image Card is taken out, a new one will be revealed.)<br/>     The Room Owner then selects his/her Choice Card and puts it in the Wooden Box with the Do Not Disturb side up. Play again passes to the left as each player again chooses a Choice Card and places it inside the Wood Box.

These mechanics will be repeated until a player accomplishes their secret mission or all players have turned into zombies at which point everyone loses.<br/><br/>THE AREA BOARD:  A 12 X 12 hexagonal grid with each hexagonal space representing different topographies and symbols that provide provide benefits or introduce restrictions.  The board is also marked with grid areas designating areas of cities and buildings.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:  All of the areas and hexagonal spaces of the board are utilized in conjunction with the secret missions.  Upon roll of the dice, the production phase begins and players decide on their tactics according to the secret mission they were given at the start of the game.<br/><br/>ATTACKS:   Attacks are optional and are resolved by dice role.  Depending on the number of units (maximum of three), dice are rolled and an attacking roll of 4, 5 or 6 is considered a hit while a 6 rolled by the defender is considered a successful defense with the defender winning any ties.<br/><br/>THE GOAL:  Avoid being annihilated by other players or turned into a zombie and be the first to complete your secret mission.<br/><br/>",

Beware, the temperature is on the rise, which could spell doom!<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>Roll the dice and assign the results to<br/>Harvest the food that grows so well in your village,<br/>Build a sled sturdy enough to carry drivers and goods across the ice,<br/>Or drive sleds to make trades and return with the goods!<br/>Plan your route carefully, because you can only pass over the ice so many times.  Will you have enough space for the goods on the return trip, or will you leave a worker behind to rest? In any case, time is of the essence as the ice melts and jeopardizes your sleds.<br/><br/>Icy Dice requires six standard six-sided dice at minimum, but we recommend two sets of six standard six-sided dice, with each set in a different color. Components include one player sheet per player, and a shared sheet per game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The 72 picture cards contain a multitude of pointers to these.

At first round, each player get 3 tiles from their pile and than draw one each subsequent round, maintaining 3 options to play at almost all time. In your turn, you must place one tile (considering that you cant extend the panel mor than 7x7 tiles away) and optionally rotate 90&ordm; clockwise another placed tile (only if the rotated tile is not forming a circle pattern yet). The turns goes until the 7x7 panel is created.<br/><br/>You score one point creating circle patterns with absolute majority of your colour and 3 points if the circle created has only your color. You also score bonus points (1 for each circle) if the scored circle is created only by your pieces.<br/><br/>Ar fisrt glance, Azzelij seems to be a simple tile placement, but as the game flows players faces lots of hard decisions to make: May I get a point or avoid another player to get a better position? May I close the 7 piece limit to stop opponents to grow at one edge or stay creating my pattern? May I risk to get a full-colored circle of mine or get two or more majority-only circle points?<br/><br/>As the game flows, the decisions ar harder to take and the panel gets its 7x7 piece formation, that increases the difficulty and fun!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The second edition incorporates an expansion that was formerly only available as a print &amp; play. This expansion introduces task cards with patterns. Placing your tiles in a way that they form these patterns will score extra points.<br/><br/>",

A large map assists with the colorful airplane placement for each player on their turn each round.<br/><br/>A designated &quot;flight captain pilot&quot; is a player as well but is also nominally in charge of each game - their extra duties include controlling the game, assisting with the flight milage sheets, map and ensuring correct logging of milage by all players as well as assessing penalties for logging false data. They also determine at the start of the game how many rounds the game will comprise - 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.<br/><br/>Player rolls may result in no milage for a pilot's turn due to fog, illness, hijackings, FAA inspections and more, as described on their individual flight schedule. On the last round after everyone has had their turn, the pilot with the most logged miles wins the game!<br/><br/>",

You bust if you draw 3-of-a-kind (they were overwhelmed by a group of the same type of enemy). Gameplay begins with all players being dealt a hand of 3 cards. On your turn you first draw a card from the deck and can then choose to lock your hand in by placing their cards face down on the table. You also have action tokens that let you do all sorts of things to help yourself and trip up the other players.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a quick push your luck card game with enough special powers to keep things fresh.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In turn, you roll a dice and walk so many steps along the playing field. After that, you do what is written on the box you have landed on. It may be, for example, that you may place a proposal in one of the Riksdag's committees and mark the relevant sectors of society with a marker, or move the proposals from the committees to the Riksdag's chamber pending a vote that occurs when someone lands on a box marked with a vote.<br/><br/>As soon as there are markers in all sectors of society on the opposition part of the playing field, a government can be formed. The party that has the most markers in the sectors of society is given the task of trying to form a majority government or minority government together with another party.<br/><br/>Every three years there is an election to the Riksdag (represented by the fastest player having reached the start after three laps). Which may lead to the formation of a new government depending on the conditions of the markers in the sectors of society.<br/><br/>Before the game, the player decides how the winner will be chosen. It can, for example, be the party that succeeds in pushing through the most proposals in the Riksdag, the party that after a certain number of rounds has the most points or the party that has managed to stay in government for the longest time.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to be able to make the recipes that the game proposes, using money to buy food in the different stores that the route of the board has and buy only the exact amounts of each ingredient. This game invites you to train mathematical operations at two possible levels of difficulty. Awarded for &quot;Let's Play Together&quot; in the inclusive game design contest.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to first get all the food that your recipe needs. You can play two levels: on the first level, the missions propose you to get food according to its value (additions and substractions); on the second level, the weight of each food is also added (multiplications and divisions).<br/><br/>On each turn, the player will throw the dice. When they fall in a store, they can buy everything they need for their recipe. Calculations should be done by the player, for younger kids there is a multiplication table to help. Each lap on the board, the player earns $50. The player who buys everything needed for their recipe, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two players compete to reach 100 on opposing but not completely identical tracks. The theme of the game is deep-sea diving with a beautiful and apparently quite large illustrated board. The visual interest is much of the natural appeal of the game, which is a simple roll-and-move race.<br/><br/>It's a nearly straight drop for the first 25 to 30 spaces on either side. Landing on circled spaces, which become more frequent from that point on, send a player back three spaces. There are a couple of obvious &quot;log jam&quot; areas on either side where players may find themselves circling for several turns.<br/><br/>The game is undated but likely comes from 1910&ndash;1920. Brian Love's &quot;Play the Game&quot; (1978) suggests one player is red and one is yellow (matching the tracks on the board), but we do not know if this is supported by the original designers.<br/><br/>",

Experience adventure with 12 unique Heroes as you navigate through dozens of guided Encounters with dangerous Monsters, intriguing Scenarios, and mesmerizing Locations; all with plenty of Loot and ever-changing Qualities to ultimately face the deadly Boss waiting at the end of the Round. No session is quite the same with dynamic, journey-altering gameplay and creative Quests. There's no time to waste, gather your party and embark on your own Hero's Journey!<br/><br/>The game is played with cards, dice, and tokens in a series of Rounds with a set number of Encounters in each and concluded with a Boss fight. Each player takes a turn as the Revealer, to flip an Encounter card face up to resolve combat with a Monster, make decisions in a Scenario, or feel the effects of a new Location. Play then continues with a new Revealer each Encounter until ultimately facing a Boss at the end of the Round.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, Qualities and Loot will play a huge part in the success or failure of the Party's journey. There are intangible Qualities that provide new active Abilities or passive Positive/Negative Traits with lingering effects. Additionally, there are physical Loot objects with powerful one-time or on-going effects. Players can never be too comfortable with their load-outs as these elements of the game are constantly changing.<br/><br/>This is a new take on the well-loved fantasy RPG genre allowing for solo or group play with up to six players who may all enjoy the experience simultaneously. The self-narrating story provides an opportunity for everyone to be a part without a game master or hours of preparation. The design allows for simple set-up and a low learning curve including jump-in-jump-out play without compromising on the amount of depth the experience provides. With 148 cards in the base deck and character perma-death, you'll never play the same adventure twice thanks to the well-thought out rogue-like mechanics.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to solve those problems. Each turn a player spins a spinner which has 4 outcomes:<br/><br/>     Solve a problem: To solve a problem a player has to choose one of the solution tokens that is a dedicated solution for one of their problems - it is checked by flipping the token and check if the number on the other side match the number on the problem tile. If correct, the player flips their problem to the solved side. If not, nothing happens, end of player's turn.<br/>     Solve a big problem: If a player has a medal, nothing happens, end of turn. If not, an opponent draws a big problem card and reads to the active player. There are always two questions with answers beneath them. If the active player replies to both questions correctly, they receive a medal.<br/>     Change a problem: Player changes an unsolved problem tile for another one from the pool.<br/>     Lose a solved problem: Player loses on of their solved problem, if any.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to solve all 5 problems and get a medal wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

They start on their own separate tile beside the game board. Each turn the players roll 2 dice, and send their pieces circling around the abstract gameboard. On their way they might land on specific spaces which might give out trivia questions from the show, random events inspired from episodes, spaces which gives you benefit if the right character land on them or the Mot i Br&oslash;stet-space giving you a Mot i Br&oslash;stet-token. These spaces might give different benefits, and the Mot i Br&oslash;stet-token can be used in a variety of ways. Once a player have gotten all their pieces one round around the board and then into the center up each characters own path to the goal, they win.<br/><br/>",

There are only 2 or each, so only 2 can choose the same. Then the players need to manuver the house moving spaces to the question space on their chosen room, where another player can freely chose a trivia question from the trivia manual. If the player chose correctly, they can move back to the sofa to win. If not, they need to move back to the sofa and pick a new task.<br/><br/>If player chose to take certant detours to their task, they can aquire a detroy chip.

The set includes 20 cards with numbered and beautifully illustrated slots, six standing figures of &quot;Sailor boys&quot;, bifold instructions, spinning die called a teetotum and box.<br/><br/>The game is played by first laying out the cards in order to form a track. Each player chooses a sailor boy, paying five counters into the pool. Players spin the teetotum and place their sailor on that number, and continue to move him along the board based on the teetotum numbers thrown. When a player lands on a picture, they must follow certain rules, such as: 1 &ndash; Enter the Royal Navy and join the training ship. Receives one counter from each player. 50 &ndash; is tried by courtmartial on a charge of drunkenness on duty, and sentenced to lose five years seniority. Pays three counters into the pool and goes back to 39.<br/><br/>The box measures 3 13/16&quot; x 4 3/4&quot; 1 1/4&quot;. The cards (track) measure 3 5/8&quot; x 2 1/8&quot;.

The Kaiser is bringing the world to its knees. This is a war where anything is possible and anyone can become a legend. It is here where your journey begins.<br/><br/>Dark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of campaign-style adventure games and tactical customizable card games and wraps them all up into an in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle, they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor, and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.<br/><br/>In Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in a real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sombreros is a basic shedding and bluffing game. The main components are 25 plastic sombrero-shaped hats, each concealing a sticker in one of five colours.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players are dealt a set of hats and three hats are placed on the table. The player in turn to play may conditionally peek at the colour of a lone hat, and must then place one of their hats on one of the three piles, calling out a colour as they do so. Stating a colour is purely psychological though, as the player is only required to match colours with the hat underneath and whatever is said is disregarded entirely when confirming this. It is also possible to pass at the cost of taking a hat from the &quot;deck&quot;.<br/><br/>Another player may challenge a placement, at which point the newly placed hat and the one underneath are inspected to see if they match. In typical bluffing game fashion, whichever of the challenged and challenging player is in the wrong is penalized by having to pick up the entire pile in question, and the other continues play by beginning a replacement pile.<br/><br/>The goal of each round is to be the first player to get rid of all hats, at which point the other players get penalty points based on the hats they still hold. The player with the least penalty points after three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher game submitter<br/><br/>",

All this in one product called, &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot;.  The core set will consist of 90 cards divided into three subsets: Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror.  Each subset of 30 cards will bring forth an intense story line on the backs of these cards.  Corresponding with the storyline will be a specially designed game concept never before seen in this format.  All the art work for the core set of 90 cards has been exclusively produced by internationally known Game Illustrator, Ed Beard, Jr.  Ed began this May of 1992.  All work on the 90 card core set has been painstakingly created to the exact specifications of the storyline.  This is the first and only &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; Collector card set and Game of its kind.  March 1992<br/><br/>This never before seen concept will appeal to the traditional role playing gamer due to the highly realistic and detailed fantasy art work, as well as the graphic novel like backs to the cards.  In addition the game has a fresh new approach that allows the player to engage in a quick and fierce battle based on the storyline concept.  There are a variety of alternative ways to play depending on which you prefer.  Uniquely designed random elements decide the games fate to assure fair play.  Destini Productions is most proud to be able to guarantee that in each box of &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; the customer is rewarded with not one, not two but three complete core sets.  We have gone to great extremes to collate this product this way for an affordable product.  That means three different game themes times three complete sets, all for the price of a traditional fantasy card set.<br/><br/>- From the &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; promo sheet<br/><br/>Set contents:<br/>30 Fantasy themed cards (numbered 1-30)<br/>30 Horror themed cards (numbered 1-30)<br/>30 Science Fiction themed cards (numbered 1-30)<br/>2 Checklist cards<br/>3 Rules cards<br/>10 Puzzle cards (9 puzzle pieces and 1 overview card)<br/>12 Gallery cards<br/>3 special insert cards (1 bonus Rule card and 2 signed Gallery cards)<br/>7 promo cards (5 bonus Rule cards and 2 promotional cards)<br/><br/>An unnamed expansion set, bolstering the character roster and adding official multiplayer support alongside more supplemental rules, was planned but never published.<br/><br/>",

Matchplay was inspired by a centuries old Scottish golf competition that paired players in a challenge match where each hole contested was worth up to one point. In keeping with the time honored Scottish tradition Matchplay is designed to recreate that competitive format by offering non-stop strategic decision making opportunities.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a traditional tabletop card game or as an online game. The online option allows players to choose from three different opponent options.<br/><br/>MatchPlay is simply about winning more holes than your opponent. Players compete for the lowest score on each hole. If a player records a lower hole-score than their opponent they receive a one point advantage. If both players record the same score, they tie the hole and neither player receives a point. Players use any scorecard for an 18-Holes match, contest 3- Holes per deal, and try to outpoint their opponent.<br/><br/>",

Build mechs, buildings, &amp; defenses, produce resources, use research labs to earn new tech, and fight off various monsters, including a giant final boss at the end of the game. Will your organization come out on top in defending New Osaka? Time to see if you have what it takes!<br/><br/>Background: In the year 2055, a Great War raged across the globe against the vile forces of Max Von Fury. Max was a mad genius bent on taking over the world with his AI infused robotic creations. He very nearly succeeded. Allied forces discovered his home base in the Old Osaka Prefecture of Japan and that was where Max&rsquo;s last stand took place, destroying much of Old Osaka in the process. In his defeat, his final act of defiance was to open portals to another dimension within Neyagawa, Yao, and Ikoma, unleashing great monsters into our world. After a time, other portals started appearing in various nations, small at first, but slowly getting bigger.<br/><br/>Now, major organizations fight for control over New Osaka, the great bastion standing against the first major source of the monsters. Whichever group proves they have what it takes to defend New Osaka against the monster threat will earn major contracts around the world when the other portals start becoming a threat. Untold power and control awaits the organization that proves itself worthy!<br/><br/>Gameplay: You have 'motor cars' and characters you use to activate buildings on the map. You have battle mechs you can move around to take over research stations and take on monsters (rolling dice to beat the monster level). Beating monsters produce special resources and points. And you also have production mechs that you can move to factories to produce resources that let you upgrade buildings, mechs, and earn points. The final round, all players fight a giant monster. Players generate points for how they do all of these actions and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each die roll/region affects different types of dragon in different ways (for example, on a roll of 2, IceWing dragons move to a kingdom of their choice.  All other reroll).<br/><br/>Some regions are kingdoms.  When a dragon visits a kingdom, it collects a token.<br/><br/>When dragons are in the same kingdom, they can trade tokens or fight to try to steal tokens from the other dragon--high roll wins.<br/><br/>The first dragon to collect all seven kingdom tokens wins.<br/><br/>This game was included as a tear-out insert in one or more books from the Wings of Fire series.

Players experience and learn about the law as they make their way through law school, past the bar exam and into their own law practice and the courtroom.<br/>    <br/>The board is divided into 62 spaces. Players proceed through law school; the nitty gritty of running a law practice (hiring a secretary, paying office rent); and the ups and downs of bringing a case (preparing papers for court, going to trial). Players also land on spaces, where they are directed to pick cards describing all sorts of interesting and amusing (and family-friendly) case scenarios.<br/><br/>When a card is chosen, a player must decide whether to accept the result or appeal it. On an appeal, a player may double or even triple his award -- or lose some or even all of it.<br/><br/>Instead of advancing when it's their turn, players may also choose to settle a case by drawing a Settlement card. Like appealing, settling a case can result in gaining -- or losing -- part or all of one's winnings.<br/><br/>Players may also double the stakes by buying into a partnership. All awards and costs are doubled for partners. Whether or not to become a partner is therefore a key strategic decision, and adds to the suspense and intrigue, as everyone wonders whether it will pay to have become one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The designer writes:<br/><br/>&quot;Dilemma is a two player strategy game that is easy to learn and its fast-paced action creates extreme adrenaline pumping excitement. Dilemma has been designed to be played at a swift pace which calls for instant decision making, when players are faced with the Dilemma of attacking their opponents advancement or running for Home Base.<br/><br/>Dilemma is unique, a completely new concept unlike any other board game. From strategies taken from the worlds leading board games, chess and backgammon, comes 13 years of development to create the fast-paced, quick thinking, adrenaline pumping board game Dilemma.&quot;<br/><br/>In reality this is a dice rolling game seemingly targeted at children (Ages 7 and up). Two players have three kinds of pieces on an abstract board: Attackers, Beacons and Guardians. The Attackers are numbered 1 to 5 and each turn a die is rolled - the Attacker with that number may move. The Attackers take two steps each to surround a Beacon, which, when surrounded by three Attackers is destroyed and one of the Attackers teleports to another board to attack the opponents Guardian. You win by either surrounding the opponents Guardian by three Attackers in this manner of moving your Guardian to Home Base. The Guardian can move whenever you roll a 6. Alternately on a roll of 6 you may remove one your opponents Attackers from around one of your Beacons. On 6 you can advance or defend - this is apparently the dilemma.<br/><br/>In this manner you roll dice, move, roll, dice, move until someone wins. The strategy content is literally zero and there seems a reasonable chance the game won't end at all (as it is less likely to roll the numbers needed to advance than to hinder your opponent).<br/><br/>The pieces are elegantly cast out of soft plastic and the board is attractive in a spacey abstract kind of way.<br/><br/>The game was published on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was probably never widely circulated in spite of the designers claim:<br/><br/>&quot;Social Championships and World Championships are to be played using the same rules. The rules are: You must declare you are playing for the championship title. The best player over three games only is the champion. If you lose to the champion you cannot challenge again for twelve months, The only way you can challenge before that time is if the champ loses the title to another challenger, you may then challenge that champion. It is advisable not to play for the championship title until you are confident that you have played enough games to learn all strategies involved in winning the game. The longest title held by a champion (as at December 1994) is 23 challenges over 1 year.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Sept. 26, 1942, the last German effort north of the Terek river in the Caucasus began. This time it was the 5th SS Wiking conducting the attack through the narrow Altar valley near Malobek. The object was to reach Grozny and its oil or to move south to force the entrenched Russians to retreat. Facing the SS were a collection of Soviet forces well dug in and supplied with artillery on the 1000-2000 ft hills surrounding the valley. Their armor amounted to mostly British Valentine and American M3 tanks. The SS plan called for the infantry to clear the towering hills overlooking the valley while the 50 Panzers and SPWs raced through the narrow valley filled with defensive positions and AT trenches. The SS Commander, Steiner, had strong reservations about this attack and for good reason.<br/><br/>The game comes with over 270 counters, rulebook, playing aid, one 11 x 17 map. Game scale is company/battalion, 800 yds a hex, daily turns.<br/><br/>",

On landing on one of these squares a question is asked corresponding to the colour of the square.  A successfully answered question allows a player to roll and move again.

It is here recognized that persons vary as to their level of psychic awareness and belief in spirit worlds.<br/><br/>No claims are made with this kit as to results.  The ritual has been modified to assure beneficial spirits. Use of the kits for other purposes is beyond control of the maker.<br/><br/>Use the kit in fun and stay within the confines of the spirit indicated.  These spirits are good and will serve you well.  And, you may have fun as your mind and spirit relate to these forces.<br/><br/>Convert the image to malevolent spirits at your risk. Remember Crowley's warning that the textbooks of magic are all that are required to conjure any spirit.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Be the first around the board rhyming your words before the timer runs out and you win.  On each move, a player rolls the die and selects a card from the appropriate deck.  They then have 30 seconds to list words that rhyme with the word on the card.  The number on the die indicates how many rhyming words they need to name, and if the succeed, that is how many spaces they move ahead.  The cards for adults have more difficult words.  Manufacturers recommend the game for ages 5 through adult.<br/><br/>",

Kanji symbols are visual representations of words, word fragments or entire ideas.  While there are as many as 50,000 Kanji in existence, Japanese people use only about 2,000 today.<br/><br/>For 2 to 4 players ages 5 and up.<br/><br/>THE OBJECT:  To be the player to collect the most points by the end of the round.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:  The Kanji game has three levels of play.  Set up the double-sided playing board according to the level of play you choose.  Divide the 176 cards into four card groups:  GO, 1-2-3, Kanji and Dot.  Give the arrow a spin and let the race begin.<br/><br/>A card is drawn and players must think and react quickly as they learn how to speak, read and visualize Kanji symbols.  The first player to find the card's exact match on the playing board (matching color and symbol) and to place his or her pawn on the match wins the card.  Did you draw a Kanji Samurai card?  Now you must draw the Kanji symbol, the final step in putting it all together!<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points at the end of the round wins that game!  Sounds easy?  Think again!<br/><br/>What are you learning?  Not only are players learning the elements of a foreign language, they are also building the skills necessary to improve mathematics, memory, concentration and visual relationships while actively being motivated to think, respond and learn!<br/><br/>",

I didn't want that people forget about this very important moment for Croatia. The game is meant for 4 players, and each one has it's figure and throws the dice. Depending on the dice result, player takes over the fields on the board, and the start position is in the area of Croatian Kostajnica (pron. as &quot;Ko-staay-nee-tza&quot;). All along the line where Croatian army passed are drawn tanks, Serbian soldier and Croatian soldiers, that are shown as bigger and stronger. The winner is the first one that reaches Knin&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Beneath the drawing is a cryptic clue to look for something in the drawing - for example, the drawing might be of two boxers fighting, and the cryptic clue might be, &quot;spot the drink&quot;. The answer is &quot;punch&quot;, which is something depicted in the drawing and which is also a drink.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is for each player to see all 18 cards, and solve as many of the clues as they can within a set time.<br/><br/>Good production values - cards are heavy duty and well printed - but limited replay value, as once you have worked out the clues on each card there is no point in playing the game again as you know all of the answers. Simple pleasures for simple folk.<br/><br/>",

It is a game of pure luck, with three dice for two or more players.<br/>Each player receives a decided number of chips (e.g. twelve) and puts half of them in the center of the board. The first player then throws the dice. The combination of the three values of the dice can be found on the board and the instructions written underneath each combination must be followed. If, for example, the field says &quot;bezahlt&quot; (or, in the mediaevel version, &quot;bezalt&quot;, meaning: paid), the player has to pay the specified number of chips into the center of the board. But, if it says &quot;nimmt&quot; (or, in the mediaevel version, &quot;nimbt&quot; meaning: take), the player takes the specified number of chips fromt he center of the board. If a player cannot pay sufficient quantities of chips, he places the remaining chips from his/her stash into the center and drops out of this round of the game.<br/><br/>The game lasts until only one player is left with chips, or until any one player has thrown three sixes. In this lucky case, she/he gets all the chips fromt he center of the board and is thus the big winner of the round. Then, a new round can be started.<br/><br/>",

This game has been effective in increasing the availability of user-friendly information regarding the transportation planning process. It has also enabled the tribal community to understand the challenges associated with highway planning and to become more engaged in transportation planning projects in their community. The game describes the various stages involved in reservation road planning including: Develop a Plan, Indian Reservation Road Inventory, Funding, Preconstruction, and Construction. An overview is also provided regarding the various public involvement options associated with each planning stage. The game utilizes scenarios to explain the challenges associated with each stage. Some of the lessons learned that will be featured include the utilization of user-friendly techniques for communicating the transportation planning process, the importance of tailoring information to meet specific needs of the tribal community, and the use of interactive techniques to engage the public in the transportation planning process. The board game was available by request at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.roadplanner.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.roadplanner.org</a>, but the site is now defunct.

The game components consist of a 3 inch cube which has a 3 by 3 array of holes in each face, a set of pegs (which fit in the cube holes) of 4 different colours and a black bag.<br/><br/>Along with the normal meaning of adjacent, pegs are considered adjacent even if round the corner on an adjacent face.<br/><br/>The following are the rules to one of these games, &quot;CuColours&quot;<br/>14 pegs of each colour are put in the bag. On their turn players draw one cube from the bag and place it in a legal hole on the cube if possible. Pegs may only be placed if adjacent to at least one other peg and no peg may adjacent to a peg of the same colour as that peg. The winner is the player who placed most pegs.<br/>The other games are CuMolecula, CuSnakes, CuMatch and CuCombat.<br/><br/>",

The purpose is to create a gust of wind with the intent of flipping over one or more cards on the table.  If a card is flipped, the player gets to keep it.  The game continues until one player has won a set number or all of the cards in the game, and this player is the winner.<br/><br/>Menko cards are often decorated with images of power and military from the time.  They continue to be made today in Japan.<br/><br/>It is assumed that Menko was brought to Hawaii at some point during the early 20th-century and eventually evolved into another popular and similar game, Pogs.<br/><br/>",

Players roll and move along the board, automatically purchasing visited properties, drawing chance cards, and performing monetary transactions until someone runs out of money. Properties are a selection of characters and other features from the Bakugan franchise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A promotional game from Infraserv H&ouml;chst. There is a game board depicting a central and eight outer planet, connected by paths. Players roll and move over the field, trying to reach the outer planets to collect one tile from each planet. On the way, players reach special fields where they can draw cards which speed up movement (or slows it down), or occasionally have other effects. Barricades can be used to block other players' ideal path. When a pawn steps on the same field as another pawn, it can steal a tile from that player. <br/>The first player to collect all eight different tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>",

When all badges and treats have been knocked off the carousel the players add up their points and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>(Game play is similar in style to Hungry Hungry Hippos.)<br/><br/>From the website:<br/><br/>Paw Patrol is on a roll!<br/><br/>Spring into action with the Paw Patrol Pups In Training Game! Your mission is to collect as many treats and badges as you can from the spinning target ring. Set up is easy, just place the treats and badges on the target ring and give it a spin. Then get behind your favorite Paw Patrol Character and press the Pup Flipper.<br/><br/>When you knock off a badge or treat hold on to it, each one is worth points. The player with the most points at the end wins!<br/><br/>(No batteries required.)<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to prepare a foothold into an uncharted territory and sustain your war effort. Find and defeat the Prince of Despair, his majesty, the Worm Emperor, by breaking the three magic seals which protect his fortress and challenge him to a deadly duel.<br/><br/>Lured by the promise of earthly riches and eternal knowledge in an uncharted region of the realm, the party of Heroes must battle chimeric creatures, flesh and dark thoughts mingled together by magic and molded into fierce monsters born from the depths of a dreadful mind, complete trials which will reveal the very fabric of their soul, fight, scavenge, loot and trade to survive the journey and ultimately face the abominable overlord, the Master of Lies and Prince of Despair, his majesty, the Worm Emperor. <br/><br/>Replayability : The core of the game is entirely player driven. Heroes decide (individually or as a group) where the game is heading, from fighting an epic monster down to trading and building new dwellings in the castle they settled in. Many paths lead to victory.<br/><br/> Automa System:  You move, his majesty, the Worm Emperor and his acolytes are moving as well. The enemy army is already on the march to conquer the regions and consolidate the domain of despair. Sooner or later, your armies will meet.<br/><br/>Castles and Outposts: A game within a game. You may start the adventure from any sub-region on the outskirts of the adventure map. Once settled in, you can build new dwellings, trade in the market for items, recruit creatures, complete puzzles and more.<br/><br/>Unique Adventure Map: Divided into three major regions and a fourth special inner region (controlled by the Worm Emperor) and counting more than 65 independent sub-regions the party of Heroes will have the freedom to explore a uniquely designed map with one-of-a-kind characteristics. Conquer cities, acquire resources, uncover mysteries and secret locations.<br/><br/>Modular Battlefield: Constantly changing its configuration depending on the sub-region you are exploring. The setup is randomly created each time your party clashes with a monster or a group of monsters. Terrain obstacles, power-up spots or de-buffs areas will hinder you or help you win the day.<br/><br/>---description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Not to be confused with a savory, uneasy and wholesome legume.<br/><br/><br/>     Each player gets 10 of the sick and twisted cards, enough voting cards as there are players, and 10 green chips.<br/>     On your go pick one of your cards and say a clue about the card. The clue can be anything like &ldquo;This is something Dave would do.&rdquo; or &ldquo;If my wife caught me doing this then she would probably join in.&rdquo; or &ldquo;This card is like something from Jurassic Park.&rdquo; or if you don&rsquo;t have much imagination then you can just say &ldquo;This is very painful.&rdquo;. The clue shouldn&rsquo;t be too obvious or too obscure so finding the perfect balance is crucial.<br/>     Place your card face down on the table. All other players then choose one card from their hand that closely matches the clue. All cards are placed face down on the table and shuffled together.<br/>     All cards are then dealt face up on the place holder cards which are lettered A-F (for up to 6 players).<br/>     Once all ridiculous cards have been read out it is then time for all other players to choose a letter card and bet some chips on which card you think the initial clue was about.<br/>     Once all players have placed their bets with the somewhat strange betting chips the original card is revealed by placing the bottle opener on it.<br/>     All players can now reveal which card they thought it was by turning over their letter card. The players that guessed the correct card win the same amount of chips that they bet.<br/>     The players that guessed incorrectly have to give all of their bet chips to the player who played the card that misdirected them.<br/>     The winner is the player with the most chips!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "I know some of you might be saying, another &quot;dudes on a map&quot; game, a &quot;Risklike&quot;, but Verralia: Kingdoms at War stands out for several reasons. One, its sheer simplicity, the core rules is summarised in just two pages, while the Special Ability Keywords, one can say the meat of the game, is summarised in a single page. The game itself plays rather fast for the genre of game it is, as a strategy board game, not in the least due to its simplicity. You get your finances at the start of the game, you build Units to fight and explore with, then you build further Cities and Forts, Cities for monetary income, and Forts for advanced positional deployment of your men. It is as simple as it gets for a strategy board game, with games taking from 40 minutes to an hour, even with a 10 Rounds system.<br/><br/>At present, there are six Kingdoms in the game, each with their themes and strengths. Elindrian have strong defence and good ranged support, Zhongdi are all-rounded, Yishitarian are a glass cannon, Morlain win through attrition, Sarcrean have the cheapest and most numerous troops, with the strongest economy, and the Golgorth, who are very fast and have strong staying power.<br/><br/>Each Kingdom has two Technological Upgrades they can pursue, as well as having certain Special Actions that can be taken for four of the Kingdoms, the Spells of the Elindrian Wizards, the Chants of the Yishitarian Sohei, the Commands of the Morlain Centurions, and the Prayers of the Golgorth Sacred Clowns. There are also rules for alliances and terrain, and Units can begin concealed, with so called Hidden Movement, so the game is both tactical and strategic.<br/><br/>We feel that how Verralia: Kingdoms at War stands out on is its simplicity, with a low entry level, and despite that, a rich strategic and tactical depth to your decisions, as you attempt to conquer the lands of Verralia. Add on to that Kingdom-specific technology you can research, and the varied unit special abilities, what which framework is a very simplified system, becomes complex. Verralia: Kingdoms at War uses a simple rules system that relies on unique asymmetric unit abilities to provide a challenging experience every game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

During exchanges, players may also earn Silk Road Cards, which can give you the opportunity to descend upon your opponents and their resources or to defend yourself from any attacks. Trading is also one of the main centerpieces of the game: while trading might give your opponents the ability to move ahead quicker in the game, trading can also help you maintain your production lines much longer. While earning high amounts of Crypto might be beneficial at first, it won&rsquo;t guarantee that you&rsquo;ll come out on top.

The route is a minefield of detours. The only consolation is that the players get to control 2 pigs rather than 1 and can decide in which order the beasts shall be moved nearer to the finish enclosure. You roll two dice and then determine which one will move .  Both of your pigs must get to the finish line in order to win. If your pig gets to a field marked IN it must enter the field and go through it until it gets back to the out gate. Once 1 pig has reached the MARKET you can only roll one die for the remaining pig.<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach the bridge wins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I see no &quot;special corridor&quot; spaces that lead to the bridge, so this game is broken right from the outset.<br/><br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>In fact, this is a misprint on the cover and in most copies of the game board that I've seen (including my own). There is supposed to be a &quot;ladder&quot; of three spaces between the TURBO-ELEVATOR space and the Bridge image in the center of the board making up the &quot;special corridor&quot;, as (admittedly) very vaguely described in the last paragraph of the rules. (Seeing as how the rules DO specify starting on the REC DECK space, which is just to the left of the TURBO-ELEVATOR space, this presumes that movement around the board is in a clockwise method--something again NOT specified in the rules.)<br/><br/>This missing &quot;corridor&quot; can be drawn in with a white or metallic-ink paint marker as shown in the photo of the board in the IMAGES section. Apparently, someone caught this toward the end of the book's run, and some of the gameboards have this fixed.<br/><br/>A revised set of rules to clarify these points are also available in the FILES section.<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach #60 wins and gets 2/3rds of the kitty the second place player gets the rest.<br/><br/>Objective: be the first arriving at target space 60, moving by turns.

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Race to be the first player to collect 39 points. You may need to be sneaky - You may need to out-bluff the others - You may need help from the Man in Black - Yet to win, you must collect 39 Clue Points first. May the cleverest Cahill control the world!<br/><br/>Players work to achieve 39 clue point by playing in turns. The turn consists of a player playing one of five types of cards (family, clue, transportation, block/unblock, or person). The cards must be played in a certain order in the &quot;stack&quot;. With the exception of the block/unblock cards which can be used to stop a stack from progressing or to unblock a stoped stack. Once the pre-defined order is met the player that completed the stack gets to score the clue points from the stack. Sound easy?  It's not! When it is time for a player to score a stack, all players, including the player who finished the stack must subtract points from thier score equal to all clue points in their hand. Conversly whom ever has either Amy or Dan Cahill will score one point for each card even if they did not finish the stack.<br/><br/>Game play typically lasts 20-30 mintues.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Linknotize is the first ever board game to integrate the use of online information and tools into more traditional off-line game play. Linknotize asks players to roll two color-coded dice and then pick two, corresponding color-coded topic cards.  The topic cards are chosen from six subject areas: History, The Arts, Sports, Geography, Entertainment, and Science. By using a device like a smartphone, tablet, SmartTV or computer, the player or team must &ldquo;link&rdquo; the two topics by traveling through the embedded links within an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia. The player or team has three minutes and/or a maximum of ten clicks to &ldquo;link&rdquo; the starting card topic to the destination card topic with the object to accomplish it both the fastest and/or with the fewest number of clicks. The first to combine online search and discovery with offline traditional board game features, Linknotize allows players to capitalize on their general knowledge of a wide variety of cultural and historical topics along with their web browsing skills to connect two topics online while racing the clock.<br/> Linknotize forges a path for a completely innovative category of gaming that juxtaposes technology with more conventional play. The result is the perfect party game that is designed to entertain all audiences. Testing knowledge of categories ranging from pop culture to geography to history to sports, the game is as much about quick thinking as it is about strategically analyzing relationships to link seemingly unrelated topics.<br/><br/>Playing on the &ldquo;six degrees&rdquo; phenomenon, Linknotize, proves the idea that everyone and everything can be connected. While it may not seem obvious on the surface, our lives are truly a &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; of related concepts, interactions and ideas that lead to common destinations.<br/><br/><br/>",

Also see the companion trying to stay in balance on one feet in 'tree pose' can be very fun too, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Memory: A part of the game mechanic requieres to remember the tokens position, so the players stimulate the memory and concentration.<br/><br/>Emotional Inteligence: Another important par of the game is learning to recognise the emotions and express them.

Survive an early emotional onslaught and later an assault on your disciplines as you search for doors into the entity&rsquo;s psyche. Traverse three progressively challenging sectors in your hunt for the final sector and Ruling Entity.<br/>Ghost Star gives you control of a highly disciplined mind, access to an incredibly vast labyrinth and a cunning, unpredictable enemy. <br/>Ghost Star provides the framework and context for your imagination, the story ultimately plays out in your mind.<br/><br/>Captain Meghan Ohtani<br/>You play the mind of one incredible human being. Probably the best representative of humanity for this type of challenge.<br/><br/>Exploring the Labyrinth<br/>Players traverse the station by choosing main navigation cards (North, South, East and West). Each card describes what you experience and displays the available content and exits. There are also Missions posted in secondary navigation (North East, South East, North West and South West). Each mission rewards greatly for success. As you explore you will be haunted by flashing images, scenes and entities that will attack your emotions to get in your head and pick you apart. Or assault your disciplines to cripple your offense or drive you mad. There are 3 levels/sectors of Sentinel Entities and each level has 5 options. There are 5 possible Ruling Entities that have a main attribute card and 4 possible sub-traits. You reveal the Ruling Entity and sub-traits randomly during game play. These sub-traits add unique abilities to the Ruling Entities.<br/><br/>Battle<br/>You will use Telepathic Strikes to &quot;Unravel&quot; Entities using combinations of scenes, imagery, emotions and disciplines. Keeping the mind &ldquo;sound&rdquo;/&quot;balanced&quot; is critical for success.<br/><br/>Memory<br/>Memory is access to past experience. Every action requires Memory and when an Emotional Defense is depleted you lose 1 Memory for every turn it stays at 0.  You can spend Critical Thinking to increase Memory. If you run out of Memory your Mind is separated from your Psyche which is a fate worse than physical death.<br/><br/>Weapons of a Sound Mind<br/>Critical Thinking<br/>Critical Thinking accesses your sub-conscious allowing you to perform multiple actions while only spending 1 Memory point.<br/><br/>Empathy<br/>All Entities aboard the ship despise Empathy because their psyches are based in conceit. The thought of anything trying to understand and sympathize with them lights the furnace of their emotions. Stronger Entities require Empathy to unravel them and the strongest require Empathy and other support to Unravel of them.<br/><br/>Informed Decisions<br/>The Captain is rewarded with Informed Decision making after successfully defeating Entities. Informed Decisions can be used to increase any of the other attributes including Memory.<br/><br/>Reason<br/>Under such incredibly crushing circumstances it takes a lot of reasoning to make it through this labyrinth. Reason is required to unravel all Entities.<br/><br/>Scales of Discipline<br/>Judgment<br/>We all know what happens when we are too quick to judge and act on it. It usually ends up bad. Manage your Judgment because if it gets to 0, you can no longer use Critical Thinking.<br/><br/>Conscience<br/>It is important to confide in your conscience, don&rsquo;t let the Entities disconnect your mind form your conscience or you are nothing but a serial killer and become an Entity yourself.<br/><br/>Tribalism<br/>One of Man&rsquo;s greatest weaknesses; being pulled towards the ideology of the Tribe. It is easy to lose perspective under such an overwhelming circumstances and submit to pounding of the tribal drums. If your Tribalism hits 0 you can no longer use Reason.<br/><br/>Emotional Defenses<br/>Fear, Sorrow and Anger<br/>Your enemies attack your most triggering emotions: Fear, Sorrow and Anger. The goal is to get them to 0 causing you to lose Memory every turn.<br/><br/>How to win<br/>Keep your mind Sound through 3 progressively challenging Sectors of Sentinel Entities and Unravel the Ruling Entity in the 4rth Sector. Ruling Entities are randomly selected and strengthened by your decisions along the way.<br/><br/>",

Presents range from pop culture taboo items to a multitude of adult humor items. You will spend more time laughing about what present you just had then you will playing the actual game. Additionally we include one blank card so you can add your own family members and terrible gifts to your game. Pass the cards, laugh with each other, and whoever has the winner gift &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the game once all the foolish presents are opened.  Enjoy!<br/><br/>One card in the game is labeled as the &quot;Winner&quot; and one as the &quot;Loser&quot;. Roll the die, pass your crap however the die tells you to then, when the last player opens their present by turning it face up (unwrapped) the game is over. Whomever has the &quot;Winner&quot; card is the winner of their great, exciting, and fantastically crappy game. If no player has the &quot;Winner&quot; card, then the player with the &quot;Loser&quot; card is just the big loser.<br/><br/>",

You bet!<br/><br/>2 to 6 players spin a paper spinner to move about the board and may claim a monster if they land on it.

        "description": "Player rolls dice and moves their gamepiece across the gameboard - which is a stylized map of the Caribbean on a backgroud of varied hues of blue. The players goal is to visit / collect a pre-determined number of islands from a scorecard of 160 Caribbean Island destinations.<br/><br/>Islands are added or subtracted to individual scores by landing on island squares on the gameboard or by landing on the Island Card or Ship Cards squares on the gameboard, and taking the top card from the appropriate deck. These Island and Ship cards (approximately 400 total) reveal information about the islands and their people, cultures, foods, carnivals, languages, art and design, beaches, scuba dives, tropical rainforests, exotic animals, multicoloured fish and corals and much more.<br/><br/>The Cards also feature information about the Cruise Experience - shipboard activities, shoreside excursions and the wonder of awaking to a new destination aboard your floating luxury hotel with it's multi-national staff and crew.<br/><br/>Designer Notes<br/><br/>In designing this game, I have gone against the grain in accepted board game strategies where the norm is to win at any cost; destroying, trivializing or bankrupting other players along the way to a so called victory. The main theme of this game is of the Journey ~ not the finish, and it is hoped that in playing this game people will be encouraged to take a real journey, maybe to the beautiful islands and waters of the Caribbean or maybe further afield where they can interact with others, break down barriers and fears, find new life-paths and celebrate the world in a more spititual and humanitarian light.<br/><br/>The Game is packaged in a clear polycarbonate Captain's Chart Tube ( a virtually unbreakable and watertight container, adding to the nautical theme ). To repackage Game ~  roll up all game contents in the laminated gameboard and slide game back into chart tube. Gameboard may also be left out of tube and bluetacked to wall as a poster between uses.<br/><br/>",

The board is an 8x8 array of holes, and the pieces are gates - effectively a line between one hole and an orthogonally adjacent one, with one end attached to a hole, which it can rotate around.<br/>The object is to have an unbroken series of your gates connecting two opposite sides of the board.<br/><br/>It's possible to capture opposing gates by surrounding them with yours and possibly the edge of the board.<br/><br/>The key gimmick is that, as noted, the gates can rotate.  On your turn you can rotate a gate instead of placing one, and if you can win or capture by rotating gates you can rotate any number of them at once.<br/><br/>",

Mary really needs help to keep herself from blowing her top or doing the wrong thing with her daughter. In this cooperative game, two to four players (twelve years and up) play cards from their hands to help Mary manage the anger she feels.<br/>The game consists of 21 turns, at three time periods for seven days. Each turn an Event card is played to reveal the stressful challenge Mary faces that provokes her anger. The player can then play a Response card to reduce the impact of the event. Chance cards are also revealed to introduce unexpected events for Mary, both negative and positive.<br/>If the players can keep Mary's stress and her relationship with Julep from reaching a blowup point, then they win. If not, everyone loses. This is a challenging game that will play different every time because of the random events that plague Mary both at home and at work.<br/>The game board and three decks of cards are all in full color on quality stock. Cards will have to be cut from larger sheets.<br/><br/>",

And the right hand (circular) board where the players move and take control of the drugs. The aim of Drugopoly is to control the majority of the drugs using your dealers. The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that drug and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the drugs can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the police, jail, gang land shootings and rehab players take control of the ten different drug squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the drugs they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more lucrative drugs in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players. This can be played using any unit price (1p, 5p, 10p &pound;1 etc) Create your own Drugopoly with no care for the consequences. Control the majority of the board and you win! Taking the cash and the glory&hellip;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game for 2 to 8 players. The aim of the game is to form a lifeline using matching symbols. The first player to form a lifeline when he places his last stone is the winner. Chinese sticks (dinner-things) are used to allow fate to determine a lifeline. Anticipation and planning largely determine the chance of success. The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance. Every object has its opposite, or if you like its complementary element. Black and white, man and woman, water and fire. In short, Yin and Yang. It sounds floating but it isn&rsquo;t. Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.<br/>It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it. But after a few times of playing you will find the pleasure of this strategic game.<br/><br/>",

From the lid description above, it would appear to be a strictly anti-drug game. Yet, curiously, actual game play comes across more as a &quot;beat the system&quot; game than one of social value education.<br/><br/>Two to six players compete, with the object of the game being to accumulate the fewest arrests. The game ends when all players have successfully made it from the &quot;START&quot; square to the &quot;HOME&quot; square. Along the way, players gain and lose money in various drug deals, and must try to avoid a stint in the Criminal Justice system that costs them money and sends them back to &quot;START&quot;.<br/><br/>The joke of the game, of course, is that it is almost impossible to go from START to HOME without getting sent back to START.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Counter Punch, designed for the real fight fan, is a game that combines the excitement and strategy of boxing.  Counter Punch is a game where everyone has an equal chance to win. As in an actual boxing match, this card game requires strategy or you could find yourself on the seat of your pants or, even worse, KO'd!<br/><br/>Counter Punch is a 2 player card game. There are 49 cards total, on which appear numbers and punch words. Example: Jab-1, Body-2, Hook-3, Overhand-4, Uppercut-5, Combo-6 and Power Punch-7. The higher the number, the harder the punch.<br/><br/>Before each round of play, 12 cards are dealt to each player.  The last player to win each trick, throws out the next card first.  Whoever played the highest card wins the trick.  After the end of each round (each has played their 12 cards), scoring is as follows:<br/><br/>6 to 6 = even round<br/>7 to 5 = Out Pointed Opponent<br/>8 to 4 = Opponent was Hurt<br/>9 to 3 = Knocked Opponent Down<br/>10 to 2 (or better) = Knockout (instant victory)<br/>3 knockdowns in one bout = a Technical Knockout Victory<br/><br/>",

As a warband led by the Archangel Michael you could battle to defend the divine order from jealous usurpers or wage war as Lucifer and fight to take the position in the cosmos that is yours by right. Stain the Gates of Heaven with the blood of those who dare question the Will, or rend asunder those that dared to cast you from the light of the upper planes into realms of black stone and sulfur.<br/><br/>Lucifer's War uses the Goalsystem mechanics made popular by West Wind's previous skirmish games, SuperSystem and Chaos In Cairo. Battles in Lucifer's War can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as the players desire. There are two basic types of models in Lucifer's War: Angelic or Demonic Orders and Minions. The Orders are the immortal creatures that occupy lofty positions within the Celestial Hierarchy. Minions represent the lower classes of servants or constructs employed by the Orders in their struggles for power or vengeance.<br/><br/>",

More than an exciting game based on Transactional Awareness, TAG is a revelation of the constant interplay of human interaction at all levels and movements.  Accepting acknowledged insights into the nature of interpersonal behavior, TAG identifies and summarizes the 16 basic interactional styles, from the authoritarian &quot;Director&quot; to the acquiescent &quot;Follower&quot; to the headstrong &quot;Individualist&quot;.  By understanding how every person's own style interacts with the style of others, the player can better understand the roots of empathy or antagonism experienced in relationships.  Through TAG, the player discovers more complementary transactions and avoids stifling ploys and fruitless struggles.  Beyond discussing the dynamics of relationships, TAG provides ethical norms for transactions designed to equalize and bring them to greater fulfillment.<br/><br/>",

Each player, or &quot;Risk Manager&quot;,  starts out with $3,000,000.  Movement around the game board, via rolling of the die, allows for the opportunity to buy and sell insurance (certificate of insurance cards).  There are also spaces where an &quot;occurance&quot; ...umm, occurs.  At that time you take an &quot;occurance card&quot; whereupon one of your insureds has made a claim.  Hopefully you bought the right insurance and the &quot;occurance card&quot; does not affect you, otherwise you'll end up paying some of your (ahem) hard earned cash.  Play continues around an endless loop (similar to Monopoly, say).  Risk Managers decide at what point they choose to withdraw from the game, as the rules explain: &quot;when frustration level or boredom so indicates.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A Bible-centered word building game for ages 9 and up.&quot;<br/><br/>A Scrabble-like board and letter tiles is used by a &quot;Leader&quot; to form five to eleven words related to the Bible, face-down except for the first letter.  Each square on the board has one, two, or three dots.  Players have tokens that move around the letters of the alphabet that encircle the board.  These letters have a numerical value associated with each, with (like Scrabble) the less often used letters having a higher value.<br/><br/>On their turn, players guess a letter in a single word, but are restricted to guessing the letter their token is on or one of the next seven letters.  The Leader moderates.  Players get points based on the value of the letter correctly guessed times the number of dots in the square it rests on.  Players may move their token ahead seven letters around the board instead of guessing, to get within range of a letter they want to guess.<br/><br/>The Leader keeps score, and the leading scorer when all the words are guessed wins.<br/><br/>",

The set comes with 30 cards that use the topics of nutrition, exercise, sleep and personal hygiene. The game doesn't have a board. Rather, the cards can be set up in any pattern you wish, winding around the room, under tables, in and out of doors, etc. The children move forward by rolling the large foam dice included in the game. For example, &quot;You rode your bike, move ahead three spaces.&quot;, and &quot;You sat in front of the TV set all day and didn't get any exercise, move back to the square.&quot; This educational game is a great way to promote the values of good nutrition, exercise, healthy sleep habits and personal hygiene.&quot;<br/><br/>",

A topic of ancient lore for historians to explore and subject of horror stories told to the young children of a hundreds of civilizations for thousands of years.<br/><br/>But the Quo-Ti are indeed real. Originally bioengineered by the great Ucharian Republic to help them confront their many powerful enemies back at the dawn of known history. The Tygernians, Empire of Froth, Gra-Nari Emporium, the Darks, the Old Ones; one and all, none could defeat the Quo-Ti. At least until the day the Quo-Ti Queen led her people in revolt against their Ucharian masters. The ensuing conflict nearly bought the Ucharian republic to its knees and led to the near extinction of the Quo-Ti as a race.<br/><br/>Over a hundred thousand years have passed. The Quo-Ti, once exiled from the Milky Way and hunted across the Universe, have risen to dominance. They have multiplied and spread out among a dozen galaxies, gaining dominion wherever they go. Now a single Clan has led its people back to its origins and established itself along the outer rim of the Alpha Quadrant. Are any of the humanoid races safe? Will the long forgotten Ucharians resurface once more to confront their greatest nemesis?<br/><br/>This 5 page PDF includes the spaceships, fighters and Pods belonging to the Quo-Ti Clans.

The sheriff is placed in the middle of the board. The start fields for the pawns are on the edge of the board.<br/><br/>Aim of the game is to get your pawns as fast as possible past the sheriff to their destination field. Each player gets 4 pawns of the same color.<br/><br/>When on your turn you don't have a pawn on the road, you can roll the die 3 times in order to get a &quot;6&quot;. If you succeed in rolling a &quot;6&quot; you can put one of your pawns on the first field of the road and you get an other roll. The pawn moves accordingly to the die roll, but for each &quot;6&quot; you roll your turn continues. On crossings you can choose to take the short trajectory across the center or to stay on the saver loop. When you end up on an occupied field, you can throw that first pawn off the board. This pawn has to start all over again.<br/><br/>The sheriff can reach all pawns on the fields within the loop. If a player rolls a number that allows the sheriff to take one or more pawns, the sheriff has to be played. All pawns that are caught by the sheriff have to restart. The sheriff never beats the pawns of the player who has made the sheriff active.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player has his 4 pawns on his destination field.<br/><br/>",

The playing grid is a larger 15 by 22 playing area that contains both land and water squares. The forces of both sides contain ships for the water squares, gun batteries for the land squares, and air formations that can occupy either type of square. Players alternate shots by calling out grid locations. The objective is simply to seek and destroy the opposing force before your own force is destroyed.<br/><br/>",

Game components is composed of 2 dice, 1 hourglass, 8 plastic chips, play money, and a rule sheet.<br/><br/>Players are divided into two separate teams (Red and White) that must compete in answering questions from cards randomly drawn with the use of a dice.  There is a plastic hourglass included in the game to set a time limit on how long each team can answer a question.  Correctly answered questions allow that team to win play money and to have another turn.  So there can be a chain of turns for a team until a question has not been answered correctly and the time runs out.  The gameboard acts as a scoring track and for separating the question cards based on its points.  The team which earned the highest score and grabbed the most in prize money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Listed in American Games, #4186.  1946, Sports, Football, Board game.<br/><br/>This two-player football game featured a folding game board (football field), 36 play cards, a metal football, a first down marker, and wooden markers to track the down, quarter, and score.<br/><br/>Play begins with the play cards shuffled and placed face down on the board.  The player on offense calls a play from a limited menu (long pass, short pass, end run, line buck, punt, field goal), and the top card is then turned over to determine the result of the play.<br/><br/>There is a good variety of play outcomes, including fumbles, intercepted passes, and penalties.  However, the game was designed in an era when single wing formations dominated, passing was relatively rare, and offenses were often &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust.&quot;  As a result, long advances from scrimmage are rare.  The longest possible gain is 41 yards on a long pass.<br/><br/>Defense does not come into play, and the player on defense simply must hope that the player on offense fails to achieve successful play outcomes.<br/><br/>One pass through the card deck constitutes a quarter of football.<br/><br/>This game might have nostalgic value for those who played it as youngsters, but there are far better football games available today.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lord Yar issued the command with a wave of his hand. With a surge his mounted knights leaped into the charge, their lances lowered, ready to trample and pierce their goblin foes under heavy warhorses.<br/><br/>With a scream the Warlock&rsquo;s dragon plunged out of the clouds above the battlefield, dropping down onto the charging knights. Flames and death followed as the mounted warriors charge was broken by the great beast of scales and wing. The victory did not last long though, as the high lord Wizard cast a mighty lighting bolt to strike the dragon dead, it falling out of the skies and crashing into the front lines of the goblin hoards.<br/><br/>Lord Yar cringed at the carnage that was already sweeping over the battlefield. The two great mages would both continue to throw their forces at each other, cast spells and counter these magics with their own powerful spells. By the end of the day, Yar doubted that anyone would be left alive.<br/><br/>This is Mage Wars, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. Mage Wars is a fast, fun game of magical conquest and war. Can your forces defeat your rivals before they grind you under their boot? Fully expandable, the system will showcase two new mages with each edition, as well as new hex boards, troops, magic and more. Gathered together, these different editions will create a massive game system which will devour hours of your time, so be warned, this game can be additive.<br/><br/>This first set covers the forces and magic of the Arch-Mage and the Vile Warlock Lord. Each set comes with enough counters, map tiles and goodies to play, and when combined with other sets you can create a massive game system where several players can struggle for control of the magical realms of Mage War.<br/><br/>",

I have included this game (dated from 1924) for completeness. The games information comes from the AGPC Archives of Games.<br/><br/>&quot; Happy Children are found whenever they are grouped around the new board game of LITTLE BLACK SAMBO. If the eager child listens in open-mouthed wonder to the story of how Little Black Sambo met all those 4 tigers in the jungle, gave up and then won back from them his little red coat, the pair of beautiful blue trousers, the green umbrella and the purple shoes with crimson linings what do you think he will do when given a handsome game board on which he and his little friends play out the story. There is Little Black Sambo himself, he is pursued by the 4 great tigers with the clothes as forfeits,  when he is overtaken and of course returns home at the end. The game board is handsomely lithographed in colors. There is a separate carton which contains the substantial spinner and the men.&quot; Each game comes in a separate wrapper and is attractively labeled and sells for $1.00 per game.

Players roll the dice and move on a board to various colored spaces and attempt to answer corresponding questions.  The questions are directed at educating and testing children's knowledge on various safety issues such as water safety, strangers, bicycle/vehicle safety, etc.  When a player answers correctly, he receives a black velcro piece representing a jail bar that is affixed to the player's card.  When the player has accumulated sufficient jail bars to lock up &quot;Wacko Weasel&quot; and &quot;Pud Possum&quot; (pictured on the cards), he wins.  A player may also be sent to a &quot;Danger Zone&quot; space which requires the additional answering of a question or other penalizing action.<br/><br/>The game has an interesting feature which allows children to play even when there is not an adult available--a cassette tape which has a voice reading questions and answers than can be used instead of the cards.<br/><br/>",

Learn about miracles, teaching, and famous journeys and where to find them in the Bible.<br/><br/>Beginning at Nazareth, players start out on a journey to other places on the map. As each place is visited an event card is taken from the pile which refers to an event in Jesus&rsquo; life which occurred at a certain place. The basic idea is to match up event cards with places visited.<br/><br/>Once you have visited 7 places and you have an event Card for each of those places, you immediately begin your journey to Jerusalem. On arrival you have one minute to memorize the information on your 7 cards. You score one point for each piece of information you remember, with a total of 3 points per card, making a maximum of 21 points. The winner is the one who ends the game with the highest score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An educational board game made to illustrate the destructive nature of addiction.  Its mechanics are described by the author as a reverse of games like Monopoly; instead of acquiring wealth, the players lose money, their job, and their possessions throughout the course of play.<br/><br/>From the author's own description:<br/><br/>&quot;Up to [seven] players play at being heroin addicts... the last to lose all his assets is the winner... It was meant as a kind of teaching aid for people who worked for drug programs, or wanted to learn that sort of thing.<br/><br/>&quot;Three to five [players] is ideal...  You roll dice and advance to heavier habits ($10/day, $20/day, etc.)<br/>as you spiral inward.  There are Hassle and Wisdom cards, when you land on red or green squares, kind of like Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly.&quot;<br/><br/>When the player loses his or her job due to varying circumstances, hustles help replace player income.  These could be described as variable player powers, because in a sense, different hustles earn a player income in different ways.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players are likely to acquire more expensive habits which require more money to maintain, as well as suffering the loss of their job, arrests by law enforcement, and negative conseqences of board spaces.  The player who survives the longest is declared the winner, though the true goal of the game is to show that getting involved in the real-life junkie game is always a losing proposition.<br/><br/>",

In the game, players compete to spend all of their money and return to Washington with no money in hand. The challenge, however, is to avoid collecting new funds from the Treasury on the Road to Inflation, which means that a player's best chance to win is both when his own funds and the Treasury's are exhausted.<br/><br/>As with many political games, more attention is paid to the political statements being made than to producing a playable game design. The only choices a player has in the game are whether to keep a roll of doubles or to re-roll the dice, and when to take the Road to Inflation to try to win the game. All else is driven by the dice and the spaces on the game board.<br/><br/>",

Players start as bondsman and attempt to ascent ranks, with the goal to obtain ministry positions at the court of the kaiser. Each ministry equals one vote. The objective of the game is to gain enough votes to assign the new emperor after the old kaiser died.<br/><br/>By managing workers, building new buildings, trading with cities, raising taxes, diplomacy and using political influence, cultural development, population growth, and military actions, each player tries to reach specific conditions which qualify him/her for either secular or religious ascension. Moreover, each player has to guarantee the continuous existence of her/his dynasty by getting offspring and marrying offspring with the offspring of other players.<br/><br/>In each round, every player plans ahead 5 actions which, in most of the cases, can be played simultaneously. Seven different kinds of actions are possible (diplomacy/intrigue; get influence cards; income/trading; build; development; expansion; action upgrade), each of which can be improved up to five levels (except for &quot;action upgrade&quot;). <br/>The population size determines the number of workers a player commands. Workers are necessary for military expansion, operating buildings, trading with cities etc.<br/><br/>",

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Unee_Tugaluulach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Unee_Tugaluulach</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Unee Tugaluulach (Mongolian: Үнээ тугалуулах, &quot;let the cows calve&quot;), also spelled Unee Tugaluulax, is a mancala game played by Kazakhs in western Mongolia near the Chinese border. It was described by Namzhildorzh in 1963 for the first time. Although a very small board is used, the game is challenging for humans (not so much for computers) because it usually takes more than 150 moves.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board (kh&ouml;l&ouml;g) of 2 x 3 = 6 holes. Initially each hole contains six dungballs (khorgol), excrements of camels, goats and sheep are recommended.<br/><br/>At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, in a clockwise direction (viewed as the male direction in Mongolia). The first ball must be dropped into the succeeding hole.<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped into one of your own holes which then contains four balls, you capture the contents (four balls).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot move or the board position repeats.<br/><br/>If a player cannot move, the remaining balls are captured by the player who was able to move last. The player with most balls wins.<br/><br/>The traditional rule for what happens when the board position repeats is unknown. In other mancala games, counters that continue to circulate around the board are either divided between the players (Oware) or they are not counted (Cross-Wari). It is also possible that the game is considered to end without result (Aw-li On-nam Ot-tjin).&quot;<br/><br/>",

Four &quot;scratch&quot; cards are drawn to remove 4 horses and replace them with penalty horses. The deck is then reshuffled and players are dealt a hand of cards from the 44. Players are given an equal amount of 5 point chips, and they each ante into the Winner's Circle. Roll the dice and move that horse forward one space, if you roll a penalty horse you pay the penalty in chips. The race is over when one horse crosses the finish line. Every player with that horse's number takes an equal share. If you hold more then one, you get multiple shares.<br/><br/>",

The game was published by an insurance company for that occasion.<br/>The game comes with a board which has two different prints on both sides several colour coded memory cards depicting events of the city history, pawns, dice and a rule book.<br/>The game allows for four different variations. Two of them are roll and move while the other two require knowledge of the city history.<br/>Variant 1: The players alternate in rolling dice. If they can exactly move their pawn on a field featuring the same colour as the topmost of the cards they can gain it. Whoever has the most at the games end wins.<br/>Variant 2: A team game. Two players each play together. Unlike variant 1 it is only allowed to move one space. The rules for collecting are the same. One team wins if they have six of a colour.<br/>Variant 3: Like variant 2 but you only get the card if you can answer the question printed on the backside.<br/>Variant 4: Not really a competitive game. On the backside of the board are squares to hold each memory card. The cards are randomly shuffled into the squares and the players alternate in trying to put the right card into the right square until all cards are sorted.<br/><br/>",

The tiles may be oriented any way but they must be placed next to each other in a horizontal line.

They each takes turns dropping their dice on the tile from no less than two inches up. Any dice that fall or roll more than half off the tile are removed and are not re-rolled. Leave all dice on the tile until both players have finished rolling as they can be knocked off as more dice are rolled.<br/><br/>Now compare the results to the locked side (the side touching the next time), there are three numbers on this side. The player that has the most dice still on the tile with these numbers has successfully 'picked that tumbler' and takes the tile.<br/><br/>In the case of a tie, both players begin rolling one die at a time, the first player to roll one of the locked side numbers wins the tile.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>First player to win three tiles wins.

But beware the Mummy, who seeks to foil the Heroes, stalking them across the board to steal their treasure!<br/><br/>Movement around the board is unusual in that a spinner is used to randomly choose one of eight symbols, and the player then moves to the nearest space displaying that symbol. Landing on certain spaces results in a question being read from a deck of question cards, if the player correctly answers the question they are rewarded with an extra turn and possibly an Element Coin (the collection of which is the key to winning the game for the Heroes).<br/><br/>The Mummy Hunters is a board game included in a box set &quot;The Mummy Collection&quot; along with a 6 DVD set of the three Mummy movies (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor) as well as a &quot;pictorial movie book&quot; of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.<br/><br/>",

Drawing new dice is done by activating catalysts in the dice playing area. Dynamo dice can be used to alter the dice-tile faces showing in a players hand and their opponent's hand, resulting in additional strategies and adds a strong adversarial component to game. During the game, groups of micropul of the same color will get formed. These groups can be claimed using dynamo dice and will be worth a lot of points if they are closed at the end of the game; however, the special power of that dynamo in the new dynamo action is sacrificed as a claim is made.<br/><br/>This game is based upon micropul, but uses dice instead of tiles and has an additional action (making it more adversarial) and adjustments to hand size and core size to take the dynamo effects into account.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or competitively.<br/><br/>",

It is a game of questions and discoveries with no right or wrong answers.<br/><br/>&ldquo;There are life questions and deeper philosophical questions,&rdquo; says the creator Alan Gratias. &ldquo;The game gives us permission to reveal ourselves by answering questions we have never been asked before.&rdquo;  For example, one card picked at random asks the following: How much is enough? What do you wish your mother understood about you?  Who is riding in your sidecar?  These questions and 426 others make up the inquisitive game of Gravitas.<br/><br/>The rules are straightforward. The player with the birthday closest to the date of play asks the first question. The opening questioner selects any card and picks one of three questions. Each player answers that question.  Then the questioner decides which player has the best answer and awards that person the card.  The first person to win three cards in a short game, or five in a long game, is the winner or the &lsquo;Gravitarg&rsquo; of the occasion.<br/><br/>Gravitas is available online at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gravitasthegame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gravitasthegame.com</a> and retails for $39.95.<br/><br/>",

The game was developed by Pasin Pelit in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>The game can be played with dice only, or a combination of dice and nine action cards. The action depends upon the roll of the die (action 1-6) as well as the cards are situation-specific, e.g. if you're batting you use one card, or if you're between first and second base you used another card to decide what happens. The objective of the game is be the first to get five runs, a run completed by going through the 53 points on the board.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 board depicting a playing field<br/>1 die<br/>4 playing figures<br/>9 cards<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The area the Australians had taken on July 10th included the coastal ridge from Point 26 up to Point 33 and extended from the coast, south to the railway line. The surrounding terrain was flat and open, offering little or no cover.  In such a flat expanse, ridges and rises a mere twenty or thirty yards above sea level give commanding vantage points to their occupants. The height advantage is so slight that one can scarcely appreciate it until actually upon the feature. The 26th Brigade began the difficult task of digging in while reinforcements of artillery, anti-tank guns and machine guns were quickly brought in. Rommel now gave his inevitable response; an all out counterattack to retake this vital ground using threadbare units. Over the next five days, holding this salient would prove extremely tough, with some places changing hands several times. At times the shelling on Tel el Eisa itself made it too hot for either side to occupy.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each turn is 12 hrs, with 400 yard hexes. Units are company and platoons for AFVs.<br/><br/>After the Australians had nearly ruptured the Italian line on July 10, Rommel diverted many of this available troops to stop the hemorrhage as it threatened his rear area. However, the coastline ridge of hills and the Hill of Jesus (Tel el Eisa) barred their success. Once the Australians had secured their advance and held the hills, Rommel had no choice but to try to seize them back and from the 10th through 15th, this is what he did.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The concept of the game is to translate the abstract number range of 1-10 into a number landscape, where children can grasp and comprehend numbers as something concrete. The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&rsquo;s &ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:<br/><br/>Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6<br/>apples, 3 pine cones).<br/><br/>Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).<br/><br/>Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)<br/><br/>Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).<br/><br/>Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NanoVenture: The Nanotechnology Board Game explores the connections between science, specifically nanotechnology, and society. In this game, players become leaders of a new country. The leaders are challenged to make decisions regarding their country's use of nanomaterials and nanotechnology for industrial expansion, military applications, economic security and basic scientific research, while maintaining a high approval rating from the citizens of the country.These decisions require players to carefully analyze the interplay of technological advances, regulations, public perception and risk, while also learning about the emerging field of nanotechnology.<br/><br/>It is best to play NanoVenture with four to five players. However, teams can be used if there are more than six players.<br/><br/>Each game includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Game Board (1)<br/>     Game Rules (1)<br/>     Glossary of Terms (1)<br/>     Player Tokens (6)<br/>     Dice (2)<br/>     Population Chips (30)<br/>     Yellow $5 Million Chips (200)<br/>     Blue $1 Million Money Chips (150)<br/>     Budget Management Cards (6)<br/>     Decision Cards (15)<br/>     Development Cards (18)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was developed in 1997 by the Lockheed Martin Ethics Awareness Training Development Task Force in cooperation with United Featured Syndicate.  The game is a component of employee ethics training.<br/><br/>The game uses a game board, character figures based on the Dilbert comic strip and a team guidebook.<br/><br/>Players are divided into 2 to 6 teams of 3 to 7 people and are led through a series of ethical case studies.  A simple ethical situation is presented along with 4 possible responses.  The teams must decide which is the correct response and present it to the group.  Answers provide that team with movement points between 0 and 5 -- better answers grant more points.  The teams then use their points to move their figure around the board an collect reward tokens.  After 5 cases are answered, the game is over and the winner is the team with the most tokens.<br/><br/>The real objective is &quot;to stimulate thought, discussion, and analysis of the issues that we all must deal with in our work.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;In the middle of the 21st century, a world-wide television company decided to use its newly purchased genetic engineering division to design a new breed of combatants for an Arena based Reality TV show. The scientists chose 10 creatures of legend from around the world, and created these monsters for the show. A Bigfoot, the Wolfman, the Yeti, the Chupacabra, Loch Ness, the Mummy, a Skeleton, a Zombie, Frankenstein, and a Vampire were genetically designed in a lab. Once these monsters were born, they were trained in the habitat from the tales to become the perfect fighting machine. Monsters VS. Monsters is televised live and streamed through the internet in over 130 countries. Even though the show is loved the world over, it still ranks as the 2nd most watched show on the planet.&quot;<br/><br/>Combining the simplicity of War, with the exciting elements of a dice game, MvM allows players to play an addicting game where loss can be defeated with a lucky dice roll. Each deck was designed to be a 1-2 player experience.<br/><br/>Monsters VS. Monsters was designed with one goal in mind, to be a low-cost fun and engaging game for children ages 5-18.<br/><br/>",

Want to Create an Evil Empire, bringing Chaos, Death and Destruction? Want to Bash pitiful, useless Heroes? Welcome to the Unofficial Dungeon Keeper Card Game.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You've got lands (Rooms). You've got Creatures. You've got 20 LifePoints. Just like in magic. Different Rooms are needed to Summon more Creatures, or to research Spells or to build Artifacts, and in general to be more Powerful.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But there's come the fun part. Creatures can't be anywhere: they must be In a Room. To represent this, you need to put your Creatures near the Rooms they're in. A creature in a Room can defend it, but cannot defend a different Room . . . So be wary not to expand your Dungeon too much, or you will be unable to defend it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A Creature in a Room can also use the Room. So, for example, your Warlock in your Library will be able to research a Spell (or to defend the Library). If you want him to defend the Lair, instead, you can move him in the Lair (in the appropriate Turn Phase), but then he will be unable to research a Spell (as he need to be in the Library to do so).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can win in two ways: 1) Kill the Avatar when he's attacking your Dungeon (The World Will Be Mine! Victory), 2) Kill the other Dark Lord (BWHAHA ! Victory).&quot;<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game each player chooses his truck in his preferred color. Each color is linked to a regional department and the player will start in the capital of that department (Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Nice or Brest). Each player also receives a starting capital of 62000 French Franks. Then the players draw a card that indicated what good they have to transport, the weight and to which city. As a return they get a reward if they deliver the goods in time but the trucks can be delayed along the road and they have to stop for gas or food as well. The player with the most money at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

If you are on a 1, 2, or 3 space, move your marker forward or backward that many spaces depending on if you won or lost.  If you are on a Billy Lee square and you won, move your marker that is farther behind up to the one that is ahead.  If you lost, move the marker that is ahead back to the marker that is behind.  First to get both of their markers to the finish space is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Pressing a button launches one of the tokens in the air and players attempt to catch it.  There are three tokens in each of four colours and a 13th black horse.  If a player catches a coloured horse they keep it but if a player catches the black horse they are allowed to steal a token from another player.  If a player collects all three horses of a colour these cannot be stolen.  The black horse is not kept but is replaced on the carousel.  When all the coloured horses have been won and the black horse is the only one remaining, the game is over and the player with the most horses wins.<br/><br/>From the box: &quot;Spin &amp; win - how many horses can you catch?&quot;<br/><br/>",

You need to trade your card with another, to make a set of three. In case you can't remember what to do, the cards are in three colours (and you need one of each to complete your set), and they are numbered 1, 2 or 3 (you need one of each to make a sentence. The sentence starts with the blue card text, then the red card text and, finally, the green card text. The sillier the sentence, the more chance you have of winning.<br/><br/>Once you have one sentence of nonsense, then you start collecting another sentence. At some point during the party, an end to the game is called and the collected sentences are read out.

It is said that he saved the lives of four knights and ridiculed the army of the great King Charlemagne by jumping hills and rivers from Spain to Germany. Like Bayard, you must use strategic skill to avoid the opponent's soldiers. Bayard, a game easily learned, is an exciting and challenging way of increasing your reasoning.<br/><br/>The game plays very similar to checkers but with some twists.<br/><br/>Object of game - capture all opponent's soldiers and Bayards.<br/><br/>The board is 10 rows of 5 circles with lines connecting them.<br/>The players set up their 20 soldiers (glass beads) on opposite sides of the playing mat. Like checkers, each soldier can only move forward one space. Unlike checkers, each soldier can capture a piece by jumping forward or backward. If a soldier reaches the opposite side, it becomes a Bayard, and a different colored bead is used to represent it.<br/><br/>The Bayard moves and jumps like a King in checkers. However, unlike checkers a Bayard piece can move several spaces at a time. Also, can capture pieces by jumping even if there are several spaces between the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is actually in two parts which together make the whole game.<br/> In game 1 a team of 11 players is built up by moving round a 4 lane track in monopoly like manner, acting on the instructions on the square in which you land. At the start of each turn you decide which lane you will start your move in and if you are blocked by another player you stop in the square immediately behind him(thus giving a bit more control than in Monoply). The object is to built the best team of 11 players that you can.<br/> In game 2, using the team created in Game 1, you play soccer on a 22x16 pitch which is divided into 10 player areas corresponding to player positions. You move the ball by die throws which can be mitigated by skill cards obtained in game 1.<br/> The object is to score the most goals in a set time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Hamsterdam is the best dam game around.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The flood waters are piling up and the noblest of creatures are all that remain to protect us.&quot;<br/><br/>How to play: <br/>Create a &quot;dam&quot; made up of a line of cards numbered 2 through 12 and distribute your hamster cards (20 regular + 2 special) on top of the numbered cards.  Take turns rolling the dice to see which spot in the damn is weakened.  If a hamster is on top of that number, that hamster is used to plug to the hole and is placed to the side in a reserve pile to come back into play in the next round.  If a hamster is not on that number, a flood token is placed there until the end of the round, at which time it can be removed by taking a hamster card permanently out of play.  If a flood token is already located on a number that is rolled, another flood token is placed in a special pile of tokens belonging to that player which cannot be removed.  As flood tokens pile up, your stock of hamster saviors dwindles, and flood tokens pile up all the faster.  The game ends when any player accumulates 10 flood tokens (counting both those in the permanent pile and those currently on the dam).  The winner is the player with the fewest flood tokens.  In the case of a tie, the player with the most remaining hamster cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Each two of these regions are connected by the Alpine crossings of Mt. Cenis/Fr&eacute;jus, the Gotthard, the Brenner Pass and Karawanken. At each round, traffic increases. Within ten rounds, regions must try to contain the consequences of traffic by taking actions in the fields of economy, tourism and the environment as well as by implementing measures for transport regulation.<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>The player with the most intact region at the end of round 10 - that is, the player who has obtained the highest scores in Environment, Economy and Tourism and therefore has managed to govern the traffic volume - is the winner.<br/><br/>Course of the game:<br/>The game is played over 10 rounds, in which the following three stages are repeated:<br/>1. Drawing of traffic and event cards and execution of tasks<br/>2. Investment of money<br/>3. Determination of consequences.<br/><br/>Regions can invest only the money they have collected. Players can decide to impact on Tourism, Economy or the Environment and move the corresponding game piece of one field per money invested.<br/>Also, they can play the action cards with traffic regulating measures. The prices for these actions are indicated on the corresponding cards. Some cards can only be played with other regions. <br/>Other cards affect the traffic in neighboring regions and therefore these players must find the right countermeasures to control this new &quot;unwanted&quot; traffic otherwise the situation get`s out of control and the environment is ruined loosing many points.<br/><br/>",

The rest of the players, who hold cards with nouns on them, must play the card they think you would choose for that adjective.

There will always be one other player in the group who is acting out the same role. Each player must find his/her match quickly, link arms, and sit down on the outside of the room to be safe for the next round. In each round, the last two players standing are ELIMINATED! Play continues as such until there are only two players left and those two players are crowned the Rolemasters for that game! Play several games for a full night of laughs!<br/><br/>The game plays quickly. Averaging about one minute per number of players! You can play it with as many players as you wish. In fact, the more the merrier! Unlike other player-elimination games, Rigmaroles is such a blast to watch, and the rounds go so quickly, that nobody minds being eliminated.<br/><br/>Although players must know how to read to play, there is a variant that allows even non-reading children to join in on the fun. So players of all ages will enjoy Rigamaroles!<br/><br/>",

Along any rod there will be a number of football players.<br/><br/>When the ball is in play you can twist a player so that he 'kicks' the ball. Of course, your opponent is trying to do the same thing at the same time so play becomes frenetic from the start. The onject is to kick the ball into your opponent's goal.

Originally proposed by Angus Lavery in a Games and Puzzles magazine in 1994, the only known source as of now is an instructables article by &quot;Kiteman&quot;<br/>The game consists of a line of 10 tokens in 2 colors that are arranged alternately. On her turn a player takes 3 tokens out of that line from any position and puts them back at any end of the line in the order they were taken. At least one token of the players color must be among these 3 tokens. The gap is closed by pushing the tokens back together. The goal of the game is, as in the original connect four, to form a line of 4 tokens of your color.<br/><br/>",

Besides their schemes and secret agendas, they fight a power struggle for the most valuable resource that is known to sentiment beings: Crystallium. This substance fuels all Magitech, an invention that grants godlike powers by fusing magic and technology. Mighty legions and armadas of spaceships became obsolete within the blink of an eye, as the Technomagi tapped into the possibilities of Magitech. In the far away future, battles are fought and decided by a selected few instead. Accompanied by their Minions, Technomagi strive for nothing less than ultimate rulership over the universe. And Crystallium is the key to victory...&quot;<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PLAY<br/><br/>In &quot;The Magitech Wars&quot; - players take the roles of mighty Technomagi - competing to claim  Crystallium Sources on the plane, through skirmish battles. Using customized Vaults of cards, a hex-tile gameboard, six sided dice and tokens, they let their minions fight  to become the emperor of a fictitious multiverse. From turn to turn the players summon Minions and move them around the board to let them battle. Players gain crystals by putting some of their Minions into the crystal zone, and win the game through gathering six victory points. Those points are scored by controlling the most Places of Power on the gameboard, or by banishing enemy cards.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The first player who scores six Victory Points, wins the game. This is done in two different ways:<br/><br/><br/>     Control Places of Power.<br/>     Banish enemy cards.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This two player print and play game is actually inspired from a variant of Fire from the Sky. This game depicts the battle between two small armies of 9 soldiers each in a board of 25 grids(5 rows and 5 columns.) Three dice are also used. Each player takes the control of an army.<br/><br/>All the soldier tokens are placed in the board, one token per square. The soldiers are imagined to have both melee weapons(sword or mace) and ranged weapons. The players can throw up to three dice per turn to determine an action to be taken on the war field (board). The number of dice thrown are determined by the number of soldiers he has left on the field. Nine to seven soldiers means he can throw three dice. Six to four means he can throw 2 dice and three to one soldiers means he can throw just one die.<br/><br/>Out of the dice he can choose any one as a row number and the other as column number. (means more the number of soldiers he has more choices at his disposal). If the grid on the field selected using this row and column has an enemy soldier, the enemy soldier is removed. If it has the player's own soldier, he can move one square and can capture an enemy soldier if there's one in that square.<br/><br/>If the user threw six, he can use it to destroy an entire row(chose a six and a row number ), or an entire column (chose a six and column number) or a combination of both (when he chose a double six for row and column), killing enemy soldiers and maybe his own soldiers as collateral damage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Interesting card game that marries Poker to a team-building football game. There are 54 cards in four 'suits' of eleven and ten reserve cards. The 'suits' are four football teams - Red Rovers, Blue Devils, Green Goblins and Yellow Dwarfs. A team consists of 1 Goalkeeper, 2 Full Backs, 2 Half Backs and 5 Forwards.<br/><br/>Each player receives an equal number of counters. At the start of every hand, a player must pay i unit into the Big Pool (a 'pot' that is taken by the winning player). Everyone then get five cards and can chooseto keep the hand or to discard any number of cards and receive replacements. Once this has been done for everybody, each player may discard the hand or support it. If he does indeed support it, he must pay three units into the Small Pool After everyone has had the chance to discard or support their hand, the hands left in are revealed and the winning player takes the Small Pool. The hands are valued as in Poker, except that it is possible to have five of a kind.<br/><br/>The winning player of each hand may take from his winning hand any cards that he might be needing to form his team. For example, if he was collecting red players and he won the hand with cards Red Full Back x 2 and a red forward, he may take those three cards and lay them out in front of him. When any player has all 11 players of the same colour, he has won. Reserve team players can be in the team, substituting for actual red player cards.<br/><br/>If you run out of units, you are out of the game. The player who first builds a complete team wins and takes the units in the Big Pool. The units seem only to be interesting if you are playing for real money. If not, their only function is to remove a player from the game should that player lose all his units.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Biblebanz is a game that when played will increase Bible knowledge, vocabulary, and perhaps the faith of all who participate. There exist many card games for enhanced learning. A unique feature of this card game is that it consists of plastic adjustable headbands worn on the foreheads of each player. This feature makes it fun and exciting to learn about the Bible. More specifically this game relates to a method of learning about people, places and things found in the Bible in a fun and unique way. It has been said that a family that prays together stays together. I would also like to think that a family that plays together stays together. Therefore, it is the purpose of this game to bring goups of people together in the form of family, friends, or other small groups to learn about the Bible in this fun unique way, increasing ones Bible knowledge, vocabulary, and their faith in the Bible and in God. Churches and Sunday school teachers are always looking for new, fun and creative ways to teach their students about the Bible. This game will satisfy that need.<br/><br/>Each Biblebanz game comes with 6 headbands, 94 Bible cards, 6 blank cards, 24 chips and a timer.<br/><br/>This game is a game for the whole family for ages 7 and up. It is for 2 to 6 players. The Biblebanz Game Cards features things found in the Bible. Examples are: animals, food, people and bible objects. Examples are: Jesus, Noah, Ark, Fig tree, apple, church and so forth. The cards are simple enough for the whole family to join in on the fun. Each round only lasts one minute. At the start of the round you have to start the sand timer. As the time runs out, the player whose turn it is must ask yes or no questions to figure out what his card is. This will help to increase your Bible knowledge and Bible vocabulary. It's very entertaining to say the least. There are 6 blank cards to be used with a dry erase marker. These blank cards are great for young children who need easy words or Bible schoolars who want harder words to figure out. You can write whatever word you want out of the Bible on them. You will never run out of words to use this way.<br/><br/>Rules Of The Game:<br/><br/>The rules of Biblebanz are simple. Each player is dealt a single card and three chips. The player&rsquo;s must then place the card on their headband without looking. The youngest player goes first. Then, play passes to the left. Set the one minute timer. Next, start asking questions in yes or no format. If you've found out your identity, you just ask, &ldquo;Am I ________?&rdquo; Fill in the blank with what you think you are. For each identity that you guess correctly, you discard one of your chips. If you guess your identity before the one minute timer runs out, take another card and put it in your headband. If you do not guess your identity before the timer runs out, then keep it and continue to guess on your next turn. The person to get rid of all of his or her chips is the Biblebanz winner! It's so much fun!<br/><br/>Great for birthday parties, bridal showers, Christian retreats, sleep overs, children's church, youth groups, Bible study groups, and more!<br/><br/>Biblebanz is a trademark of Christian Book And Toys LLC. &copy;2012 Christian Book And Toys LLC.

        "description": "With a great deal of support, a coalition within the Spanish Military (called Nationalists) declared their revolt in July 1936. The Nationalists allied with Conservative, Fascist, Monarchist and Catholic groups to &ldquo;save&rdquo; Spain. The democratically elected government of Spain (called Republicans) gathered Left-wing Republicans, Socialists, Communists and Anarchists together to fight these &ldquo;Nationalist&rdquo; insurgents. The Nationalists were primarily supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the dictatorship of Portugal. The Republicans were primarily supported by Communist Russia and Mexico. Other countries remained neutral and followed official policies of non-intervention. Many neutral country&rsquo;s citizens however made their way to Spain to volunteer in the International Brigades and fight for Republican Spain.<br/>In Spain the sides are clear. Can the red tide be stopped in Spain? Can fascism be given its first real defeat here? Whatever happens, the conflict in Spain will echo on into the coming war that will likely engulf the world.<br/><br/>Winning the War:<br/>Every territory has resources of men and material to gain or lose until final victory is in sight. On your turn you build, maneuver, and deploy your land and air forces to gain territory for yourself, and deny it to your enemy. In a civil war you fight until one side surrenders. In Spanish Civil War: The World War of Spain, this is the case. You fight until one side surrenders or until one side controls every province of mainland Spain.<br/><br/>",

Played on a board divided into 3 separate areas for temporal jumps (Giza, Egypt 2560 BC, Holy Roman Empire 1248 AD, and Central Europe 1945 AD), and 1 area where soldier reinforcements can be acquired by each team. Located in the center of the board is a time-travel port that transports soldiers through both time and space to engage in battles.<br/><br/>The primary object of the game for the Axis Powers is to finish their two-stage plot to rid the world of the human race in 1945, then time-travel to the future in 1946 to start a supreme human race. The primary object of the game for the Allies is to locate the time-travel port, battle Axis forces to gain control of it, and shut it down before the Axis Powers finish their two-stage plot. If either stage of the plot is finished, the dynamics of the game changes drastically with battles in both time and space.<br/><br/>Players control and move soldiers of different ranks and powers in an attempt to battle and control element cards used in the Axis Powers&rsquo; two-stage plot, with movement and battle results determined by dice rolls. There are multiple successful strategies that could be used to win, and both sides have an equal likelihood of winning.<br/><br/>Created by award-winning video game designer and artist Ray Shingler, utilizes lessons learned from a 15 year career in video game and virtual world user interaction.<br/><br/>",

For example Pishop gets 5 Victory points if all other players' final scores are not too far apart (difference can't be bigger than 6).<br/><br/>Unique aspects of the game include that all deals are binding, meaning they are enforced by the game rules.

        "description": "Z. is a 2-4 player card battle game that pits Survivors against the Fallen (zombies). It combines elements of Magic: The Gathering and other card/tabletop classics with video game sensibilities and a horror movie atmosphere.Each new match allows the players to create and live out their own zombie horror film. Every card in Z. is a high quality image featuring real people and real horror makeup/effects in place of 3D art or illustrations.<br/><br/>In Z., the Survivor and Fallen players take turns playing new cards from their hand, which are drawn from their deck. These can include new characters, weapons, traps, etc. Additional resources needed for playing cards are generated automatically at the beginning of each turn, but may also be manually increased or altered through various gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/>(Since the Fallen cannot &ldquo;think&rdquo; and strategize per se, the Fallen player not only controls his or her units directly, but also acts as a sort of director for the overall events of the game . Many of the Fallen&rsquo;s cards and especially Killstreaks can modify the core rules of the game.)<br/><br/>In the middle of the play field are three Location Decks, each one representing a unique setting (Cabin, Police Station, Hospital, etc.). Everything in Z. revolves around these Location Decks:<br/><br/>-Survivors must send out characters (units) to search the Location Deck for Supplies, items, other units, and objectives.<br/>-The Fallen must simply wipe out the Survivors before they complete their objectives, regardless of what mode is being played.<br/>-Survivor and Fallen units that occupy the same Location can encounter (attack or use abilities on) each other.<br/><br/>The cards found in each Location Deck are also themed after that Location, adding a greater variety to the gameplay and types of cards available. Not all Location Deck cards are Survivor-friendly, however. These Locations are usually overrun with Fallen, as well as other dangers and obstacles.<br/><br/>The Z. Year One &quot;Core Set&quot; includes over 450 cards, with all six Starter Decks for the Survivors and Fallen, plus the first Location Set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DexQuest is a family fantasy dexterity game in which you roll a specially weighted ball down a ramp, down a series of 3D steps made from the large box and a series of smaller boxes inside. The ball is weighted to stop when it slows and even very young gamers (5+) will soon get the hang of stopping it exactly where they want as it&rsquo;s quite a bit easier than flicking.<br/><br/>Your rolls down the steps relate to movement and actions on the map. For example, if you want to move to a river location on the map, you will need to roll the ball to stop anywhere on the middle &lsquo;river&rsquo; step. You might also catch a fish or find a gold coin in the water if the ball stops on one of many special icons spread across the steps. Be careful, though &ndash; if your DexBall finishes out of bounds or on an ambush icon there will be consequences!<br/><br/>The map locations are seeded at random with purple event cubes which players can travel to and undertake quest challenges. In true fantasy tradition these quests might be instant treasure chests, challenges, or monsters. All challenges and combat are completed by aiming for different sections of the 3D steps, which include many different &lsquo;zones&rsquo; in which you must land to win gold. The game ships with 10 exciting and varied adventure cards, increasing in difficulty, each containing a short story and 20 quests. The game can be played PvP competitively (up to 4), co-operatively, and solo - the different adventures are tailored to these different game types.<br/><br/>In the Standard game the launcher location changes between 5 positions each turn to make aiming the DexBall that little bit more challenging. In Easy mode the launcher stays in its central position meaning you can aim with real accuracy every turn. Beginners are also allowed more rolls.<br/><br/>The game really comes to life when players have collected enough gold to buy an upgrade from a choice of 16 on their player mat. Upgrades include LEVITATION: being allowed to move the DexBall&rsquo;s finishing position by one ball width; FISHING ROD: which allows you to collect fish when landed on, which can then be eaten for bonus re-rolls and travel rolls, and SECRET MAP: allows you to use the shortcuts on the map meaning you can move faster and track down more gold quicker. Other upgrades give you more control choosing quests, faster map movement and extra gold bonuses. Upgrades must be made left to right in sequence on the mat making for some painful decisions as you will want them all!<br/><br/>Early adventures are very easy and designed to help all players acclimatise to the idea of rolling on the steps then moving on the map to travel and collect goodies. Later adventures are more challenging, with tougher monsters to fight and traps enabled on the 3D steps. Your opponents will take on the role of monster each time, making rolls to add to the monster&rsquo;s base strength, meaning you never quite know how tough the next growling beastie will be.<br/><br/>DexQuest&rsquo;s art and design and manufacture is by Isla Tetra and Isla Tetra 2&rsquo;s Will Sargent and will be published by Solway Games in Jan 2019. Reserve your copy of the first collectible 300 now. A Kickstarter campaign will follow if anyone is remotely interested in the game ;)<br/><br/>",

In the short version of the game, the winner is the first person to do so whereas in the long version, the role of Prime Minister can change hands and the game is said to be won by &quot;the last person to remain in the game after all the other players have tired of the Prime Minister's leadership&quot;.<br/><br/>Players roll and move their way around the board, trying to pick up Vote cards and debating other players if they land on the same space. In the short version, such debates are decided by rolling dice but in the long version the players must act out their side of the debate and the winner is chosen by a vote of the other players.  Players must also face &quot;chance&quot;-like Affairs cards when they roll doubles and may end up in Jail or Hospital where they must roll dice to be set free.<br/><br/>Players consecutively work their way through the Town Hall, Parliament and Ministry spaces to reach Number Ten. They are paid a higher salary for reaching each of those levels but then require a greater number of votes to proceed to the next.  In the long game, the current Prime Minister can influence this process by exercising special powers such as awarding a government grant to a player or sending someone to Jail.<br/><br/>",

Our country's complete <br/>leadership over the past 200+ years packed into one game.<br/><br/>This game is easy to learn and fun for all ages young old and with so many card <br/>combinations, this game has unlimited replay value and should never be the same <br/>game twice. Each card represents a different time and era in American history<br/><br/>Rules of War<br/><br/>2 Player<br/><br/>Each player chooses their favorite die- Republican, Democrat or Independent (red, white or blue)<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck and deal each player 22 cards. -Do not look at them- Place them in a pile face down in front of you. Both players turn over the top card on their pile and battle. If your card wins the battle you place it on the bottom of your pile for future use and if your card loses you put it in a separate pile, this card is no longer playable. A player wins when they successfully defeat their opponent's entire army.<br/><br/>1 player<br/><br/>Choose between 1 and 6 cards from the deck either by random or by choice and these will be your battle cards. Play through the deck to see how many presidents you can eliminate before you are taken out. Keep track of your score on score pad.<br/><br/>Rules of Battle<br/><br/>Each player rolls their die at the same time. The player who rolls the higher number gets the strike. The damage= difference in dice. Opponent then must subtract it from their battle card. The battle is over when one card loses all their hit points or an eagle is rolled.<br/><br/>Example - If player 1 rolls a (7) player and player 2 rolls a (1)......Then player 2 must subtract 6 from their card.<br/><br/>Battle Dice- 10 Sided- Numbered 2-9 with 2 symbols<br/><br/>Eagle- If you roll an eagle, you steal your player's card and place it on the bottom of your pile.<br/><br/>Shield- If you roll a shield you defend your opponent's attack and they must subtract their total roll from their battle card<br/><br/>",

Fun and fast paced, Toplshteyner can be played for money or just for fun.<br/><br/>Object of the game: To be the last man standing!<br/><br/><br/>    Each player starts the game with three lives. Each life is represented by an amount of money agreed upon before the start of the game (50p or 50c a life for example). If playing for fun, just exchange the money for three of anything you can get your hands on. Poker chips, matchsticks etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Determine who is going to roll first by each rolling a die. The highest number rolls first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The first player rolls the dice. They will have either rolled a &ldquo;point&rdquo; or a &ldquo;consequence&rdquo;. All double rolls (1-1, 2-2, 3-3 etc.) are consequence rolls. Every other combination, except those that equal seven, acts as a point roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Consequence rolls have different effects on the game. See the &ldquo;List of Consequences&rdquo; section for full details.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If a player rolls a point, they must attempt to re-roll that point before they roll a seven. If they manage to re-roll their point, their life is safe and the dice go to the next player. If they roll a seven, they lose a life and the dice goes to the next player. Note: Seven NEVER acts as the point. If a seven is the first number rolled, the player must continue to roll the dice until a valid point or consequence has been rolled.<br/><br/><br/>List of Consequences<br/><br/><br/>    1-1 &ldquo;Snake Eyes&rdquo; &ndash; Player loses a life. Valid only once per turn. If rolled first the player will lose a life then their point will be two. Rolling double one for the second time will save you a life, not cost you one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    2-2 &ldquo;Saving Grace&rdquo; &ndash; Players life is safe and their turn is over. Play moves on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    3-3 &ldquo;Threes&rdquo; &ndash; Even if a point has already been set, if 3-3 is rolled, the point is changed to six. The player must then attempt to re-roll a six before they roll a seven, but if they do so by re-rolling 3-3, ALL lives are lost and they lose the game entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    4-4 &ldquo;Crazy Eight&rdquo; &ndash; Point is set or reverted to two. The player will not lose a life by rolling 1-1. But their odds of re-rolling their point before rolling a seven have vastly decreased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    5-5 &ldquo;High Fives&rdquo; &ndash; Elect a player to lose a life. If rolled first it acts as both the point AND the consequence. Valid only once per turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    6-6 &ldquo;Trick Sixes&rdquo; &ndash; Extra Life to a maximum of four lives. Extra lives earned can be reclaimed from the pot if the player has less than three lives. The fourth life is optional because it must come out of the players own pocket. Note: If playing for fun, the fourth life can be taken from the pot also.<br/><br/><br/>",

Recruits and Substitutions are allowed.  Watch out for penalty calls! Fun for the entire family!&quot; -- From The Manufacturer<br/><br/>Using a card drawing mechanic, players attempt to complete their &quot;team,&quot;by assembling player cards for each position (of the same color). Different cards represent the different positions -- Forward, Midfield, Defensive Line, and Goalie, as well as special cards which cause different game effects, and wild cards which can replace other player cards on your &quot;team.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A box you say? Yes, an official box for your Meepile!<br/>Since the first edition of Meepile did not come in a box, we decided to create one. Yes, we've created a nice little home for your beloved Meepile. Now your Meepile no longer needs to be dusted before play, and can rest snuggly on the shelf, between your other Simi Game Knights small box games.<br/><br/>While we are at it, we might as well add some bits. Because you can never have too many bits.<br/><br/>Oh, and a few cards, because there was still a little room in the box.<br/><br/>How about a new way to play? Because you can never have too many ways to play with your Meepile.<br/><br/>Bits - <br/>Each player has a collection of 6 interestingly shaped wooden bits to place on the Meepile. Each player also is given a deck of 6 cards that represents each of their 6 wooden bits. The cards are shuffled and on a player's turn one is revealed. The player then is required to place that piece.<br/><br/>As usual, all pieces knocked off of the Meepile are gathered into your stockpile, so if you turn over a card and you have more than one of the matching shaped bits, you may attempt to place all of them. Work your way through the 6 cards and then shuffle and start again, until someone has placed all of his/her stockpile and wins the round.<br/><br/>Additional way to use these bits and cards are included in the game box.<br/><br/>",

Every player gets a sheet with a matrix of 9 cells, divided in 3 rows of 3 cells each. On his turn a player throws 1 die and notes his result in one of the cells on his sheet. Doing this he should try to achieve a result of one thousand (or as close as possible) when making a final addition if the matrix is full (by considering each row of 3 cells as a number and adding those 3 numbers). The player closest to thousand is the winner. Attention! If one of the diagonals shows 3 same numbers, this number may be multiplied by 10 and used as a bonus to come closer to thousand.<br/><br/>",

At one point, in early October, it actually seemed possible to reach Moscow before the winter because there was little to halt them. That chance was wasted and the weather turned against Hitler&rsquo;s forces. By the time this game takes place, both sides were like mighty but weakened warriors. The German strengths on average had been reduced by 50%- a division was now only a regiment in strength. Panzer divisions were lucky to have 50 operational tanks. The Russians were no better off, they simply had more weak units to toss in the way, Weather made the fighting bitter and the Germans did not have winter clothing. Fuel and ammo Corps&rsquo; depots frequently had only enough for one division on a limited basis, not 3-4 divisions, which was the norm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game board is a 4D HYPERCUBE or TESSERACT with four inch sides, projected onto 2D space. On this game board all coordinates are in units and chess pieces (zees) are used as game pieces. The first number in each coordinate is how far from the game board Origin (0000) in the X direction (right/left), the 2nd number is how far from 0000 in the Y direction (diagonally upward); the 3rd is how far in the Z direction (up/down); the 4th how far in the T direction (diagonally downward). Point 4204, for example, is 4 units in the X direction, 2 units in the Y direction, 0 units in the Z direction, and 4 units in the T direction (from 0000). There is every 4 digit combination of 0, 1, and 2 making an 81 coordinate grid (3^4 = 81). Other &ldquo;Noonka Boreds&rdquo; are 4&quot;, 6&rdquo; and 8&rdquo; sided Tesseracts where coordinates are 4 digit combinations of 0,2 &amp; 4, 0, 3 &amp; 6, and 1, 4 &amp; 8 respectively.<br/><br/>Zees are arranged on the grid of this game board to play variant forms of games such as Checkers, Chess, and Solitaire with up to 8 players; however the board is very versatile in that many games can be played with modifications and enough different styles of zees. Role playing games can be played in 3D space with 3 different time periods. There are enough zees with each basic game board to play 8 player 4D Checkers (or 4 player 4D Chess). JetEyes are caps placed onto the zees to indicate an increased status including moving forward and backwards rather than just forwards around the 4D grid board. A jetEyed Pawn is a King.<br/><br/>Games can take between 15 minutes and 3 hours depending on the game, number of players, and their experience levels. There are many ways to modify the games so that it takes more or less time, or to accommodate different experience levels. Note: the game has an abstract feel to it that appeals more to the math-geek. The beauty in the board is that it helps you visualize four dimensional space-time. Think of the grid as a 3D cube on a time-line, with 3D cubes at T=0, T=2 (red cube), and T=4. There are also 3D cubes where Y=0, Y=2 (green cube) and Y=4, Z=0, Z=2 (blue cube) and Z=4, and X=0, X=2 (brown, light blue, or yellow cube on website and poster sized boards), and X=4. In fact, because there are midpoints on each of the cubes, there are also 96 smaller 3D cubes on this board. You get so caught up in the geometry and numbers that time passes and you are &ldquo;Never Bored&rdquo; (Noonka is Spanish for &ldquo;Never&rdquo; (misspelled from &ldquo;nunca&rdquo;))!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this exciting, fast paced card game, players are competing against each other to acquire as many cards from their opponents as possible! Some cards are worth more than others though, so be strategic about which cards you decide to &ldquo;Swipe&rdquo; from your foes!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, and in one single round only four &quot;Master Points&quot; are available for players to win, either splitting the points between the players, or one player winning them all. Rounds continue until a single player reaches five Master Points, in which they win the game. The four Master Points in any given round consist of the following: 1) Master Number Point 2) Master Color Point 3) Master Shape Point and 4) Master Total Point.<br/><br/>The game starts out with the dealer revealing the &quot;Master Card&quot; for that round (which is a Power Card that gets placed in the center of the playing field). The Master Card will have a number (1-10), a color (red,blue,purple,green), and a shape (X,O). Whatever the elements might be are what dictate the four ways to earn the &quot;Master Points&quot; in that round. For example: If the dealer reveals the Master Card that has the number 7, the color red, and the shape X, then players must steal cards from each other that have any of those elements (7s, reds, X's) and always high numbered cards. At the end of a round, players will reveal to each other all of the cards they have acquired throughout the round. In this example, the player who acquired the most cards with the number 7 wins the Master Number Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the color red wins the Master Color Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the shape X wins the Master Shape Point, and the player who acquired the highest sum after adding up the numbers on all acquired cards wins the Master Total Point.<br/><br/>There are only two main types of cards in Swipe it!&trade; There are the Power Cards (cards with a number, a color, and a shape; one of these cards gets promoted to master card at the beginning of the round) and then there are the Swipe Cards which have an &quot;S&quot; and a swipe arrow . Players need to combine one of each type of cards in order to initiate an attack against another player. Players can only acquire Power Cards from each other in order to gain points, where Swipe Cards simply allow the player's Power Cards to make an attack. In Swipe it!&trade; a combined pair (a Power Card combined with a Swipe Card) can always freely attack a lower numbered Power Card or enemy pair. Example: a 10 on a Black Swipe Card can freely attack an opponent's 9 on a Black Swipe Card). Now the intensity rises when you are using a combined pair to attack a higher numbered Power Card or enemy pair. This is where the dice and rock-paper-scissors comes into effect, where essentially the attacker is wagering their lower numbered Power Card in a series of battles against their opponent's higher numbered Power Card. If the attacker loses, their opponent acquires the attacker's Power Card in play. This is especially huge when the attacker is risking their Power Card that happens to match the &quot;Master Number&quot;, &quot;Master Color&quot;, &quot;Master Shape&quot;, or is a high numbered card like a 9 or 10. On the other hand, if the attacker is wagering a Power Card that is low like the number 1 and does not match any of the Master Point categories, then who cares if they lose to their enemy right? The attacker may as well take the risk with that type of card in order try and win a great one.<br/><br/>There are also three different types of Swipe Cards (Black, Silver, and Gold) each one offering unique abilities; such as the Gold Swipe Card raising your Power card by +2 when it is attacking and by +1 when on defense, or the Silver Swipe Card granting the ability to &quot;Punish&quot; another player's Swipe Card, or being able to &quot;Reassign&quot; a combined pair with a different Power card (if you had a 1 combined with Silver Swipe Card, you can switch it to lets say a 10 on the Silver Swipe Card allowing you to attack higher numbered enemy cards for free). There are also some special rules too, such as &quot;merge&quot;, &quot;master merge&quot;, and &quot;cash-in&quot; which can help players out of some sticky situations. A &quot;merge&quot; allows you to combine two Power Cards that share the same number (such as combining a 9 with another 9), forcing the combined cards to act as if it were a Black Swipe card, giving you the ability to combine a third Power Card to it to make an attack. &quot;Master merge&quot; is the same as a &quot;merge&quot; with the exception that the combined cards match the &quot;Master Number&quot; in play, forcing them to act as if it were a Gold Swipe Card. Lastly, the &quot;cash-in&quot; action allows a player to discard two alike Swipe Cards (such as discarding two Black Swipe Cards) to receive one new card from the dealer. This action can only be done once per turn, so if you were hoping for a particular card, you will not be able to cash in another pair of Swipe Cards until the dealer makes its way around to you again.<br/><br/>The round ends once the dealer has dealt the last card, and the player dealt the last card takes their final turn. All players discard any remaining face up cards.

Otherwise there is no way to win the game.<br/><br/>Cards can be pieces of the Armor of God, or action cards. Action cards include :<br/><br/>     Drop 1 and Reverse - the targeted player needs to discard 1 piece of the Armor of God failing which they will miss a turn. Then the direction of play is reversed.<br/>     Drop 2 and Reverse - Similar to Drop 1 and Reverse except 2 cards need to be discarded.<br/>     Jumper - This card can be played at any time and takes precedence over all other cards.

Race the rising flood waters and other rats to the top. But beware! Your opponents will try anything to slow your progress and beat you out!<br/><br/>Rats! is all about friendly competitive play. You and your family will have hours of fun leading your rats to safety. Use well placed cheese and holes to stop and slow your opponents down before they do the same to you!<br/><br/>In Rats! players have three moves to move their rats from room to room. Cards players gain can increase the number of moves they have and also can be played on other players to slow them down. Rats can only go up a level when they find a ladder after exploring the doomed ship.<br/><br/>After each round of play, each player rolls a die to determine if they can flood the ship. Each flooded space is removed from play, along with any rats trapped inside.<br/><br/>To score points, players must escape the five levels of the ship to safety. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>Chaos Stone the Board Game is a game inspired by the hit-classic, Nexus Ops, this is a first ambitious attempt by a rising designer in the scene, Calixtus Ashley Wee, with aid gained from his friend and first employee, Matthew Zhao. One of the core differences from the game of its homage, is the main issue of having entirely symmetrical playable factions remade into asymmetrical ones. The four factions in the game are fighting for control of the large deposits of Chaos Stones, the namesake of the game, in a moon at the centre of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each have different methods of engaging the enemy, with The Civilisation of Humanity boasting superior technology and the ability to promote your ordinary troops into higher elite ranks, maintaining its theme of being focussed on defence, as reflected in its regard for the maintenance of the precious lives of humans, as part of the enlightened doctrine that represents the utopian ideas of this advanced Civilisation of the future.<br/><br/>The second faction in the line-up is The Animagusi Coven, a very powerful sect of spellcasters who are adept at wielding magical powers, for which they use the potent concentrate of energy held within the Chaos Stones as fuel for these spells, to commit feats that even the Science of the technologically advanced Humans can barely achieve, for which they have resided in secret within the laws of their society, hidden from knowledge. They are arguably the most interesting of the factions to play, not to mention challenging and the most complex, given your need to manage two decks consisting of either Energetic State Cards, that determine the success rate of spells, or Magical Element Cards, for which are used in combinations in order to synthesise the various magical spells that form their arsenal, to destroy the enemy. Biologically speaking though, they are just a different group of humans with separate goals, but the focus of all factions is eventually the seizing of complete control of the moon that contains these precious Chaos Stones. The Animagusi actually take their names from the shapeshifting powers of their original members, able to transform into different animal forms.<br/><br/>The third faction in this sequence is called The Evolved Bionids. As the name suggests, they have characteristics that puts them in similar categories to the Zerg of StarCraft, or the Tyranids of Warhammer 40,000. They are a very interesting race that is focussed on the macromanagement aspects of a board game, centrally about managing your economy to produce and upgrade your Strains in huge and various amounts, and have the most diversified and myriad of all unit choices, given each Base Strain can be mutated into two Divergent Strains, with distinct and separate utility between their abilities, although you are not restricted from morphing both. The Bionids in fact have management of a secondary resource, as an emphasis of their distinct playstyle focussed around fuelling the pump of this living engine of war, to outproduce and overrun by sheer production of numbers.<br/><br/>The fourth and last, although designed second in order, is The Great Rhuds, the natural residents of this moon that is being contested over. And this moon, which we can call the Lunalode, is prized over precisely because of the presence of its great wealth of Chaos Stones. These powerful objects have a close symbiotic relationship with the Rhuds, in fact the cause for their sentience in the first place. Being rather primitive and unevolved compared to the other sentient beings in the galaxy, they make up for their lack of formidable technology by relying on the Chaos Stones for power, so in comparison to all other factions, they are the ones to utilise the power of the Chaos Stones most directly and efficiently, and depend on them as a technology to engage on par with the other races, for nearly all their weaponry and warfare. A large focus on the Rhuds, or The Great Rhuds as they refer to themselves, since they are arguably the least advanced, they have a reliance on cheap and numerous troops, the usage of speed and mobility through interconnecting tunnels they can create throughout the board, and the potent yet risky power they harness, presented by Chaos Stone Tech Weapons. The sheer power of the Chaos Stones, of which among the four factions, The Great Rhuds are the only ones to tap most directly into with raw effect, and access its potential in the way that it can ultimately or best achieve, make them the most able users of that particular technology.<br/><br/>If you read the categories and mechanics that the game falls under, you will realise it is an ambitious synthesis of many elements, some inspired and taken from other board games, into a complex and elegant whole. How the factions almost have their own mini-game within the mechanics of how they play, and the focus of each separate mechanic makes for very different playing experiences, and differing tactical and strategic approaches to winning the game.<br/><br/>Above all else, to know how the game is like, it is best experienced and played. It is my belief you will enjoy it, and with your support, you can expect the possibility for three expansions already planned.<br/><br/>",

The set is based in the Fallen from Grace Fan Fiction, the Grakkan's Union &amp; Grakkan&rsquo;s Union Revised Fan Fiction and various official Storylines that took place in the OutWorlds region. The set also brings more Ophidian League Gladiators that weren&rsquo;t part of any Fiction, but are showcased on the Ophidian League Bios on the Main site.<br/><br/>The OutWorld Revelations also features 2 New Card Types:<br/><br/>Managers<br/> This card type works like the Reinforcements, but they will have 0VP, and may be played at the beginning of the first wave. The Managers have Life, Rage &amp; ADMG values, but they mostly do not interfere in the Wave. Their special abilities may change the n&ordm; of cards in the hand, the n&ordm; of CP, and other skills, like giving some additional abilities for the Team of the manager (for Teams see above).<br/><br/>Sponsors Cards<br/><br/>You may play 1 Sponsor at the start of the game, after playing your Gladiators. This card is not part of your deck, and cannot be discarded, nor placed out of play. Some sponsors will override the standard rules of CP, VP, Cheer, Hand Sizes, Bonus Cards, and Victory Conditions.<br/><br/>And a brand new Mechanism:<br/><br/>Team affiliation<br/><br/>Some Gladiators cards will include a new keyword that will indicate that they belong to a Gladiator Team. Example:  The Gladiators Freakshow, Striking Dragon, Ryla &amp; PK have the keyword indicating that they belong to the Team Machine, as seem in The Saga showcased in the Main site.<br/><br/>",

Either games skew too young, and parents get bored... or the games engage only adults and are way too complex for a child.  So this one has a lot of references aimed at the 20-40 year age range, but is totally family-appropriate for most kids 8 and over!<br/><br/>The gimmick is that each player brings a pile of real sweets (or a candy substitute of your choosing) to fuel their warriors in battle against each other, with a &quot;Land Card&quot; mechanism that keeps it from becoming &quot;pay-to-win&quot;.  Its perfect for gatherings with a lot of snacks, or for the holidays when there are lots of sweets to be divided up!<br/><br/>Why would you want to win a giant pile of candy?   Candy is awesome!   Who doesn't want first dibs on a giant pile of candy!?  Plus, you can share it with your friends and family, silly!<br/><br/>",

Each starting on the nearest &lsquo;Start&rsquo; space to them the players must successfully negotiate their way around the coloured squares on the board answering TV trivia, ad break questions as well as questions on the Goggleboxers themselves to try and win Gogglebox tokens. Each player takes it in turn to roll the die and move onto the appropriate space, different colour spaces represent different types of question or activity. Landing on a yellow space can mean having to return some of your Gogglebox tokens or steal some extra ones! The TV Trivia includes questions such as &lsquo;Who called the Queen a &lsquo;top bird&rsquo;? and &lsquo;Name the island where Father Ted is set&rsquo;. The Gogglebox space means it&rsquo;s a multiple choice question on the Goggleboxers themselves! This fun-packed game is perfect for after dinner entertaining or just for playing with friends and fans of the show. It is certainly guaranteed to test your TV trivia knowledge!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dutch word samenspel has the meaning of: working together towards a common goal. A bit odd, considering that samen means together, but spel means game, not work.<br/><br/>The game was published in 1987 and given to employees of the AZU (Het Academisch Ziekenhuis Utrecht or the Academic Hospital in Utrecht, the Netherlands) as a Christmas / New Years gift.<br/><br/>In 1989 the AZU, part of the Universiteit van Utrecht (University of Utrecht) moved to a new building. The construction of that building started in 1981 and in 1986 the first preparation were made towards the movement, which required all patients to be moved in only two days.<br/><br/>This game was published in 1987 and given as a Christmas / New Years gift to the employees. The name of the game (SamenSpel, working together) is a reference to the effort of the individual employees to make the moving a success.<br/><br/>SamenSpel is a game about collecting pieces of illustrations related to the hospital and the moving to a new building. This is done by moving a pawn on a board one step in any one direction (somewhat like a rook in chess) and taking the piece (one quarter of the full image) from the board.<br/><br/>The game has one pawn, one gameboard and 12 complete images (each to be divided into four segments) but no dice. The pieces are shuffled and randomly distributed over the board, putting two pieces on each area of the board, the board has 25 spaces (the center space has no image). Whoever collects the compete images first, wins the game. When moving the pawn back to the center space, a player can &quot;claim&quot; a segment of an image of another player, provided he/she already owns at least one segment himself/herself.<br/><br/>",

It represents the chain (the Dutch word &quot;keten&quot; means &quot;chain&quot;) of organizations and how the inter operate with each other to get criminals convicted.<br/><br/>Naturally, it is a simplification of reality. It only has the main portion of the process to show the general working.<br/><br/>The game was published in order to help the general public understand the working of the Dutch Justice Department better.<br/><br/>Apart from a custom playing board, there fifty-five &quot;strategy&quot; cards and fifty-five &quot;question and answer&quot; cards, a custom six-sided die and twenty pawns.<br/><br/>The pawns are in four colors, one for each player. Each color has five symbols, representing the five &quot;chains&quot; in the game, namely (1) civil law, (2) juvenile law (sub-divided into youth civil law and juvenile criminal law), (3) criminal law, (4) administrative law and (5) immigration law.<br/><br/>The fifty-five &quot;strategy&quot; cards are similar to &quot;Chance&quot; cards in the Monopoly game, they are &quot;events&quot;, things that happen either in favor of the current player or in favor of other players.<br/><br/>The fifty-five &quot;question and answer&quot; cards are used in a Trivial Pursuit style. Every throw the player is asked a question on one of the cards. If the answer is correct they may move the pawn (according to the number on the die) and choose to throw again. If the answer is incorrect, they ends their turn.<br/><br/>The single six-sided die has only three possibilities. There are three sides with a single dot, two sides with two dots and one side with a capital &quot;S&quot; on it. If the player throws either a single dot or two dots, he / she has to answer a question. When the player throws the &quot;S&quot;, he or she gets to draw a &quot;strategy&quot; card.<br/><br/>The main target of the game is to educate people about the working of the Dutch Justice Department. The way to win the game, is to have your five pawns move along their respective paths and complete each of the tracks first.<br/><br/>",

The second game involves more strategy, harder questions, more advanced vocabulary, and more opportunities for negotiation.<br/><br/>A &ldquo;Teachers Guide&rdquo; with complete lesson plans for both versions of the game is included. Students practice reading skills (reading the cards) and math skills (handling the point certificates). Students are challenged to use critical thinking in answering questions and in forming their strategies for playing the game.

        "description": "At the start of the 19th century, the exploration and exploitation of the African continent began in earnest. During this deplorable period in world history, the major European powers &mdash; Britain, Holland and France &mdash; would mercilessly explore, colonize and fight over its many resources for a hundred years. Naturally, native populations would come to resent and rebel against their foreign exploiters and seek independence, and so it is in this swift-playing game for two, where you emulate a European nation and compete for a continent.<br/><br/>Players get a hand of cards in four types: Explore, Colonize, Exploit and Conflict. Some cards are restricted to a region, others to a single area. Exploration leads to colonization, which leads to exploitation, and sometimes to a conflict between the rival powers. Hand management and timely card play is important in this game.<br/><br/>If more colonists arrive in an area than it will accept, a native uprising will occur. The roll of a die and simple charts settle uprisings (and conflicts) quickly. Choosing the right time to initiate negative action against your opponent can be crucial.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a turn drawing a card and performing the Kings action described on the card.  Any players not required to drink earn a point for that round.  After each action is complete, lay the card on the table in rows to form a pyramid.  The bottom row will have five cards and the top row will have one card.  Once the pyramid is complete, move the remaining three cards in front of all players.  Each player will choose one of the cards (multiple players can choose the same card.  Now flip over the three player cards.<br/><br/>Pyramid &ndash; each player takes a turn flipping over a card, starting at the bottom row of the pyramid.  If the flipped card is higher than the player&rsquo;s card, the player drinks for one second and keeps the card.  If the flipped card is lower than the player&rsquo;s card, the player gets a point and keeps the card.  If the flipped card is equal to the player&rsquo;s card, the player drinks double and keeps the card.  Play continues into the second and third and fourth rows, with losing cards resulting in drinking for two, three and four seconds, respectively (still for twice as long for an equal number).  After the last card at the top of the pyramid is flipped and drinking or points are resolved, it stays on the table face up.  The players claim the player cards, so that all players have roughly the same number of cards.<br/><br/>Circuit &ndash; each player puts his cards into a face down pile.  Players take turns flipping their top card and laying it next to the last card on the table.  If the card is the same color or same number (the white bordered number nine cards are wild), the circuit continues, the player gets a point and does not have to drink.  If the circuit is broken, the player takes a drink and play continues.  At the end of the game, keep the longest circuit on the table face up.  Put all of the other cards in a face down pile.<br/><br/>The Long Road Home &ndash; each player gets one chance to walk the road (which was the longest circuit).  Starting with the first card on the road, the player says whether the top card on the pile is higher or lower than the face up card.  If he is correct, he moves to the next card on the road.  If he is wrong, he takes a drink and has to start over.  If he completes the road before the deck runs out, he gets five points.  Every player gets the same chance to walk the road.  The highest total score after this game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>We are in the English county of Devon in 1830. The rivers Plym, Yealm, Erme, Avon and Dart, along with its many creeks and estuaries, lead to the rise of river transportation by building canals; but also it helps the steam railway expansion across all England. Tycoons and investors will struggle to impose the conveyances most prestigious (and, of course, valuable to them).<br/><br/>In this context, several companies are founded: the Tiverton Canal Co. strive for boat transport and canalization, the South Devon Railway Co. puts its efforts on the railroads and Dartmouth Steam Co. (also known as 'the Independents') diversify in building railways and canals at the beginning of this exciting race to dominate the transportation of passengers and goods in the region.<br/><br/>Both players start with a pile of 9 tiles each one and a common starting tile. They will expand a modullar board (made up alternating tiles and hollows). Each hollow closed by four tiles will be awarded with a victory point at the end of the game to the player with the most connections pointing to this that gap (all vertical and horizontal projections of the board count!). In addition to its own meeple, players have the valuable help of an external company that may be outsourced... but be careful of not to abuse this option because it can stop working in the area permanently.<br/><br/>When the last player places his last tile, representing the end of construction of the region of Devon, victory points will be distributed following the scoring criteria. The player who gets most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>From the publisher (Spanish):<br/><br/>Nos situamos en la regi&oacute;n inglesa de Devon en el a&ntilde;o 1830. Los r&iacute;os Plym, Yealm, Erme, Avon y Dart, junto con sus numerosos arroyos y estuarios, propician el auge del transporte fluvial mediante la construcci&oacute;n de canales; pero el vapor tambi&eacute;n ayuda a la expansi&oacute;n del ferrocarril por toda Inglaterra. Magnates e inversores pugnar&aacute;n por imponer el medio de transporte que m&aacute;s prestigio (y beneficios) les puedan reportar.<br/><br/>En este contexto se fundan varias compa&ntilde;&iacute;as: la Tiverton Canal Co. apuesta por el transporte en barco y la canalizaci&oacute;n, la South Devon Railway Co. pone toda la carne en el asador por los caminos de hierro y la Dartmouth Steam Co. (tambi&eacute;n conocida como &lsquo;The Independents&rsquo;) divide sus esfuerzos en la construcci&oacute;n de v&iacute;as f&eacute;rreas y canales en el inicio de la contienda por dominar el transporte de pasajeros y mercader&iacute;as de la regi&oacute;n.<br/><br/>Los jugadores, con un mazo de 9 losetas cada uno y a partir de una loseta inicial com&uacute;n, ir&aacute;n expandiendo un tablero escaqueado (formado por losetas y huecos). Cada hueco cerrado por cuatro losetas otorgar&aacute; un punto de victoria al final de la partida al jugador que m&aacute;s conexiones de su color est&eacute;n apuntando hacia ese hueco (todas las proyecciones verticales y horizontales del tablero cuentan). Adem&aacute;s de sus propios meeples, los jugadores disponen de la valiosa ayuda de una compa&ntilde;&iacute;a externa que podr&aacute;n subcontratar... pero mucho cuidado de no abusar de esta opci&oacute;n, ya que pueden dejar de trabajar en la zona definitivamente.<br/><br/>Cuando el &uacute;ltimo jugador coloque su &uacute;ltima loseta, que representa el fin de construcci&oacute;n de la regi&oacute;n de Devon, se repartir&aacute;n los puntos de victoria siguiendo los criterios de puntuaci&oacute;n. El jugador que m&aacute;s consiga ganar&aacute; el juego.<br/><br/>",

You can avoid dangerous misadventures by collecting and holding onto the right supplies, like the fanny pack!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each player's turn, they must draw an action card that they must play..the island gives them no choice! Players then take turns rolling a 4-sided die for the actions they can perform. During their turn they can choose from 5 different actions: Gathering, Exploring, Stealing, Attacking, or playing a card's action from their hand! To perform these actions, the player must roll the 20-sided die and get a 10 or higher (for attacking, gathering, or exploring) to be successful, or a 15 or higher for stealing! As the game progresses, the players must collect all three relics and keep hold of all 3 to win! It's either holding the relics, or be the last survivor standing.<br/><br/>",

The current player reads a question from their card (in Sami).<br/><br/>4. Each other player in turn selects and reads a statement from their card (also in Sami).<br/><br/>5. The current player decides which other player had the most fun or appropriate response, awarding them a point which is tracked by setting aside a card. The next player clockwise will then read a question.<br/><br/>6. Play continues until a certain number of points has been reached or a certain number of questions has been read, at which point the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game is sold as a box with a book and three decks using different forms of declension, or as a single deck.<br/><br/>",

First the player rolls the 3 white dice to determine the length of the jump. If one die shows a &quot;0&quot; the jumper has fallen. Then the 3 black dice determine the posture grade. The Result of each jump is marked on the game board by plaques with the starting numbers of each player.<br/><br/>2. Langlauf (cross country skiing)<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll the 2 white dice with the single digits and move their figures. The first player to reach the finish gets 240 points, the second gets 235 points. Each arriving player gets 5 points less than the one before.<br/><br/>For the nordic combination, the results from the two first games are combined to determine a winner.<br/><br/>3. Der Abfahrtslauf (downhill skiing)<br/><br/>On the square grid route is marked with 20 red flags which have a distance of 5 squares from each other. The players roll the 2 white dice with the single digits and move their figures. The players have to pass each flag on an adjacent space.<br/><br/>The second player starts after the first one has rolled and moved three times and so on. The player who completes the route with the fewest rolls wins the game.<br/><br/>4. Der Torlauf (Slalom)<br/><br/>This is played like game 3, but the flags are placed as gates in a slalom track.<br/><br/>The back of the rules includes the number sequences &quot;111/9/105&quot;, &quot;144&quot; and &quot;0742/1/73&quot;, which may or may not indicate the time of publication and/or a product number.<br/><br/>",

Players can enjoy a full 9 innings or set a score and play only the 9th.<br/><br/>The emphasis in on the heart of the game - pitching, with timely hitting sprinkled in and solid fielding (except for the occasional error!)<br/><br/>TOBG moves along smoothly and quickly, with the time of play dictated by the time to pitch. Meaning you can take your time or play fast - it's up to you. There are special rules for stealing and bunting; and old-fashioned score boards keep track of the count and score, for that Authentic feel.<br/><br/>Pitching: The pitcher has 7 pitches to choose from. The pitching happens in 2 stages with the batter saying 'Take' or 'Swing' at each pitch. The result is a ball or strike. As the count goes deeper, the batter gets the advantage and knowledge will prevail over luck.<br/><br/>Hitting: When the batter swings at a Strike he gets a potential hit - he flips over a batting card to reveal a single, double, triple (or home-run!), hit to various areas of the ball park. (There are also infield flies.)<br/><br/>Fielding: The fielding team will select which fielding card to turn over to make the play. Results are Out, Hit or Error.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts from their &ldquo;home&rdquo; tile with a team of three photographers one boat and one driver. Photographers are dropped off in eight different types of locations that are home to eight different types of mythical creatures.<br/>You and rival photography teams have traveled to this remote area at the foot of the Pyrenees mountains in France to capture shots of Yetis, Chupacabras, giant sand worms, shadowy lake creatures and more. The first player to get a convincing portfolio back to their publisher wins fame and fortune, and the game!<br/>The remote area makes long-distance communication impossible, so you are very much on your own. Technology is limited to film cameras and walkie-talkies. The creatures can overwhelm members of your team and rival photojournalists are looking to thwart your efforts.<br/>The board is comprised of pentagonal location tiles with a four tile lake in the middle. Each player starts their turn by moving their vehicle up to four times, dropping off and picking up their photographers and boats as they go. Each player ends their turn by drawing the top card for the creature deck. The deck has been shuffled and contains six cards of each monster and four identical &ldquo;full moon&rdquo; cards. When the full moon is drawn, the next three creature cards are drawn before the next player takes their turn.<br/>If one creature emerges on a location you occupy, you capture a picture token when you successfully leave that location. If that location activates twice, that photographer or boat has been, gulp!, overwhelmed&hellip;<br/>Pombie Lake is fast paced and presents many agonizing decisions as players try to balance speed with safety. Players need to be alert as everyone is possibly affected by everyone else&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>Along with the base game, an expansion is included that grants each team a special advantage. The expansion is a small stack of 6 tiles.<br/>Each team randomly draws 1 at the beginning of the game.<br/>Advantages include:<br/>1. Harpoon Boat<br/>    Boat will be sunk by three creatures, not two.<br/>2. Telephoto Lens Photographer<br/>    Can capture shots from adjacent tiles. Must be placed on joining edge of    adjacent tile to capture. Will not die if adjacent tile is activated twice, they are not in harm's way.<br/>3. Turbocharged vehicles<br/>        Five moves per turn.<br/>4. Larger photography team<br/>    Fourth photographer on your team.<br/>5. Creature Descendant Photographer, <br/>        Not killed by creatures EXCEPT UFO.<br/>        Special Power (kin warning/hex): disable one location tile<br/>    by laying red square token.<br/>6. Motorcycle Meeple DISCARD ONE PHOTOGRAPHER<br/>        Able to move anywhere on land, will be killed by 3 creatures, not 2.<br/><br/>",

The rules for each game are consistent and apply to this game also.<br/><br/>You will need all three boards (side by side in that order) and tickets plus each player will need three sets of wagons (one for each board).<br/><br/>You will start with your markers at zero on each board.  Begin play on one island (Rodrigues, Mauritius or R&eacute;union) and, if you wish, stay on that board throughout the game.  However, when you reach the coast, you may take a ferry to another island &ndash; now you may still play on that board or you may continue your journey from the port of arrival on the next board.<br/><br/>You may travel in any direction from board to board, always travelling to a part-island and then moving to the same port on the main island.  Or stay on one or two boards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Depression-era game involves manipulating a string to move cardboard dogs. There is a sheet of very thick cardboard that is folded into a three-dimensional row of four kennels with a starting ledge in front of them. A thick cardboard dog is attached to each kennel by a string.<br/><br/>Players stand in a line equally distant from the kennels and with strings of equal length. They line up the dogs by leaning them on the edge of the starting ledge, and then wiggle or shake their strings so that their dogs move toward them across the playing table. First dog across the finish line wins. Any player touching a dog is disqualified.<br/><br/>",

During his travels, the bear-like wrestler created dozens of folk stories and rumors. The Sasquatch? Just Vitamir taking a stroll through the woods. The abominable snowman? Just Vitamir lost in a snowstorm.&quot;<br/><br/>Fan favorite Vitamir is a force unto himself. A giant of a man, he has some of the best movement and action points of any WEIGHT 3 wrestler. He's got great stats and high damaging special abilities. His Man Against Wild ability does extra damage when targeting Feral Den or Forest Soul wrestlers, which makes him the perfect Kaiser's Palace wrestler to add a little extra oomph to a Heavy Pounders team.<br/><br/>",

The game was inspired by the diagrams of Mark Lombardi, and by the idea that every way can be represented by a series of colors, a concept we named WayDNA. At every turn, players try to spot low budget travel routes with two stops and to visit new attractions around the world. They can also use an online companion app to win missions and money. The game has over 10 different types of missions and 1000 trivia questions for all ages. It is an intuitive and fun way to learn about geography, low budget travelling and graph theory concepts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swimzania is the unique interactive family board game that&rsquo;s all about swimming. Created by ASA qualified swimming instructors, it&rsquo;s an exciting, fast-paced tabletop game that gets children learning more about swimming as they play.<br/><br/>The board is the pool, the counters are swimmers. Players throw the dice and race each other up and down the lanes. Land on a SWIM QUIZ space and answer a question card; land on DO IT to complete a challenge. Try to avoid getting CRAMP or a STITCH and you might just be the one to lift the trophy!<br/><br/>Swimzania has been carefully researched and developed by ASA qualified swimming instructors, taking inspiration from the lessons taught in the pool. It embraces competitive and cooperative play, and is a brilliant way to reinforce kids&rsquo; (and adults&rsquo;!) knowledge of swimming and water safety awareness.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We wanted to develop a board game that would appeal to both children and their parents. So Swimzania is not only fun to play, it also has important educational benefits,&rdquo; says Vladimir Scepunov of Swimzania. &ldquo;We have developed three levels of difficulty so that gamers of all ages can play and enjoy it, and we&rsquo;ve combined question cards with interactive challenges to get the players having fun and feeling good.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;We firmly believe in the power of learning through action,&rdquo; says Vladimir. &ldquo;Swimzania supports everything our students are taught in the pool, so it&rsquo;s a brilliant way to reinforce and strengthen their understanding of swimming. And they have so much fun while they&rsquo;re playing!&rdquo; <br/> Swimming and water safety are now included in the National Curriculum, so there is no better time to get kids playing a game that boosts their weekly lessons. A recent survey by Swim England reported that an overwhelming 94% of parents believe it is important for their child to be able to swim competently by the end of primary school. Playing Swimzania will help them to reach that goal even faster!<br/> &mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's very simple to play, with any number of people, and everyone has the chance to be a match winner.<br/><br/>In Match Fishing Dice, each player begins by rolling the &quot;Peg&quot; die to determine if their final score will be doubled, halved, or left as is. Then players take turns rolling the other colored dice in a set sequence to determine the daily fishing conditions, whether their cast was successful or not, which species of fish was caught (if successful), and how many pounds (victory points) were reeled in. Each set of 6 unique fish a player catches will earn a bonus of 10 pounds. After a minimum of 15 rounds, players tally their total pounds caught, adding any set bonuses, and then doubling or halving their score if necessary based on their initial Peg roll. The winner is the player with the highest score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game introduction:<br/><br/>Head to Head Soccer is a game played with cards and two dice.  A schematic board may be used as well.  Using the cards, players manipulate the position of the ball on the playing field and attempt to shoot at the opponent's goal.  Dice determine the outcome of shots, corner kicks, free kicks, and so on.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Head to Head Soccer was designed to support in-person as well as postal play (play-by-mail).  The time noted here (30 - 40 minutes) assumes in-person play by experienced players.<br/><br/>The board is presented as a schematic to visual play but need not be used as an actual play surface.  It is divided into the familiar zones of soccer with letter designations for the zones.  The game is played between two players who alternate taking turns.<br/><br/>Players begin by drawing eight cards from a standard pack of French playing cards; three cards are revealed and five are held.  Cards may be played from the hand or from the tabled three.  Not all game actions require a card play, but played cards move to the discard.  Cards determine what types of passes, defensive plays, fouls, and shots may be attempted - the correct card must be available to make the desired move.  A series of tables enumerates which card values, or greater, must be played to attempt various moves in or from various zones.  Because some cards are visible to the opponent, some candidate plays also are known.  Each player's hidden cards, however, complicate planning and anticipating.<br/><br/>A few specific actions - for example, making a corner kick - are determined by die throw rather than cards.  This method prevents &quot;certain&quot; scoring in various situations, replacing a card play with an element of chance.<br/><br/>Head to Head Soccer was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 69 - Nov 1980).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ukai is a historic form of fishing at night on rivers in Japan, using cormorants to dive for fish. The fish caught are usually ayu (sweetfish). A rope on the bird's throat stops them from swallowing the fish they catch. Once they have caught enough fish for the fishers, the birds are fed.<br/><br/>The most famous location for Ukai in Japan is on the Nagara River (Nagaragawa) in Gifu province. The fishing people go out in long wooden boats, with a large wood fire raised up on the boat to light the way.<br/><br/>In this game, players move up the river, a tableau of cards laid face down. As the fishers move up river, the diving birds reveal cards. Some have sweetfish (1 to 5 points), others have hazards, such as the bird striking a rock. Some cards have special effects too. The game ends when all the 'bonfires' in the game are exhausted, meaning time is out. The player with the highest score in fish is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is published in a tiny matchbox box (no striker), with a deck of small cards and includes matches. It was recently shown on Twitter as the smallest doujin game in Japan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sokhazania is a unique game of chance for the whole family, designed to simulate a football match in 15 minutes of game time. It is easy to learn the rules and start having fun immediately.<br/><br/>Sokhazania works on the rule that you will always lose the ball when rolling a 1 or 2, and you will always be able to pass the ball to one of your players or take a shot at goal. If the dice lands out of the box you lose the ball to the other player for a throw-in.<br/><br/>Shots at goal must be defended by the goalie by rolling the dice. If the goalie rolls a 1 or 2 the ball is lost to a corner and the attacking player gets a chance to strike again. If the goalie rolls a 3 or 4 the goal is scored and the game restarts from the centre. A save is made the goalie throws a 5 or 6 and the game restarts from the Goalie Dot.<br/><br/>The player who scored the most goals in 15 minutes is the winner. Extra-time can be played on a draw or the game can be decided with a Penalty Shoot-out.<br/><br/>",
