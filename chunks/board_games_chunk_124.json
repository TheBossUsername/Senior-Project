        "description": "This game is hard to get any details on... It was commercially produced and is in the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy Aviation Museum extension at Dulles Airport.  Given its age and craftsmanship, I have placed the age at 1925.  The airplanes actually similar the Spirit of St Louis, but the game bears no resemblance to trying to cross the Atlantic.  You use magnets to &quot;fling&quot; an airplane against another magnet on the &quot;wall&quot; at the far side.  In the 4 photos (to be uploaded) are the board and shots of the suspended magnet used in flying the airplanes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CARDS FOR POPULAR BOARD GAME<br/>ADD THESE CARDS &amp; GET LUCKY!<br/><br/>Mafiopoly is not a stand-alone game, but a deck of cards and set of optional rules to be added to Parker Brothers' Monopoly board game.  Players are given the option of playing as a Mafia player (Mafioso) or a regular player (Citizen).  Citizens play by the normal Monopoly rules while Mafiosi draw from the Mafia Card deck every time they pass Go.  Mafiosi also have other special rules, such as the ability to grift $50 from the bank every time any player passes Go.  These advantages are somewhat balanced by the innate dangers of the profession: the Mafia Cards may cause a player to fall under investigation by a Federal Grand Jury or fall victim to as assassination attempt.  One of the other Mafioso players may even put out a hit on you!<br/><br/>There is an interesting optional rule that allows any Mafiosi to cheat, as long as they don't get caught.  If they get caught, they must pay 10% of their holdings to the bank and 10% to the player who blew the whistle.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Monopoly<br/><br/><br/>",

Certain spaces allow a player to go again, while others make the player miss a turn.  Reach the goal by an exact roll.<br/><br/>Single-file is a single-pawn-per-player Pachisi variant, using a different pre-defined board layout.<br/><br/>The &quot;title game&quot;, Geese and Daisies, uses only the goose tiles and daisy tiles, each type in its own stack.  The player rolls the die; if its value matches the number of geese and/or daisies, the player takes the tile(s).  The player who gets the most tiles this way wins.<br/><br/>Although the three games suggested are merely pastimes, with no choices for the players, the rules finish up by offering ideas for other games you might wish to invent, using the components.<br/><br/>Selecta Spielzeug 3544<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This unpublished prototype board game was originally in Sid Sackson's game collection before it came into my possession.<br/><br/>The game shows some similarities to Parker Brothers' Six Million Dollar Man game and may be a very early version of the game.  The mechanics are more complex than the average children's roll-and-move game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of four cards at the start of the game and draw one card at the start of each turn.  There are several different types of cards in the deck:<br/><br/>- Bionics Cards (Cards for Steve Austin's Bionic Eye, Bionic Arm, and Bionic Leg abilities)<br/>- &quot;Wild&quot; Bionics Cards (May be used as any type of Bionics)<br/>- Move Opponent<br/>- Set Obstacle<br/>- Remove Obstacle<br/><br/>Some of the spaces on the board are marked with one or more bionics symbols that represent cards the player must use to get past that particular challenge.  For example, you may need to use a Bionic Eye card to spot an enemy airplane or use one Bionic Arm and two Bionic Leg cards in order to swim across a treacherous river.  A player landing on one of these spaces must discard the needed cards before being able to move again.<br/><br/>The obstacles are balanced by the paths that the player can take across the board.  The shortest path from start to finish is densely populated with some heavy challenge spaces (requiring up to four cards to get past).  By contrast, the longer routes have a smaller density of challenge spaces, usually with one to two card challenges.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the players move by the difference of a roll of two dice.  Roll two dice and subtract the lower number from the higher to determine how far you move.  This means that rolling doubles means you get zero; you don't move.<br/><br/>The rules I have are incomplete.  They do not explain how to use the Move Opponent, Set Obstacle, or Remove Obstacle cards.<br/><br/>",

The town of Rauma, on the west coast of Finland at the Bay of Bothnia, is a historical maritime town and seaport now known mainly for it's paper and pulp industry, close south to the town of Pori (also featured in the series) - and in many instances a rival to it!<br/><br/>Kaupunkipelit is a series of games, each of which is basically a light version of Monopoly localized to a city/region of Finland. The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.<br/><br/>The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:<br/><br/>-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.<br/>-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.<br/>-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.<br/>-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.<br/><br/>",

Your decisions as manager will make the difference between winning and losing.<br/><br/>--From Rules Sheet<br/><br/>The goal of Shoot Out is to select a team of footballers whose values out-score your opponent's.  Players secretly select 3 lines of players (Goalkeeper + Defenders/Midfielders/Strikers), each with a value of 1 to 4.  The total of each line is calculated, with bonuses given to players of the same team sharing the same line, special abilities, or simply playing in their proper position.  Strikers totals are compared to opposing Defenders totals, and Midfielders are compared to one another.  The side that wins 2 out of the 3 point comparisons is the winner.  This game is collectible, with player cards available in booster packs.

A &quot;Nullo&quot; is a No Trump bid to take no tricks.<br/><br/>Teams score points (40 to 520, depending on the suit and number of tricks bid) for making their bid, or lose points if they fail.

With every step taken, a small droplet of toe-sap would ooze from each toe.  This, of course, was a constant source of shame to the tribe members.<br/><br/>Then one day a young man named Johnny discovered two important facts that would change the island forever -- the toe-sap was actually quite delicious and each tribe member produced a different flavor.  Johnny was hailed as a hero and soon toe-sap became the island's number one export.<br/><br/>Tribe members spent long days gathering toe-sap, however it soon became apparent that the tribal leaders could influence the toe-sap market, making some varieties more valuable.<br/><br/>As members of the tribe, players take turns collecting varieties of toe-sap.  They can also offer cows to the tiny sea-going Cownivores in order to collect toe-sap more quickly.  At the end of the game, the players influence the tribal leaders using shells and their remaining cows to dictate the price of each variety of toe-sap.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an educational game, endorsed by the Rottnest Island Authority and (heavily) sponsored by Agfa Film.  It's a standard Roll and Move game with a single path and a start and end.  The first half of the path is by boat from the mainland to the island, the second half is by bike on the island itself.  The main theme, not surprising given the sponsorship, is photographing wildlife.<br/><br/>As usual with these sorts of games, various points along the path cause things to happen, mostly drawing a card of some sort.  You win by getting a photograph of a quokka and getting to the end of the path.  There are a group of six quokka photo squares, such that you can't possibly miss it on the way through.<br/><br/>The main educational content of the game is a small brochure with (tourist) information about the island.<br/><br/>",

Each player is also given a figure which represents his aeroplane. The object of &ldquo;THREE POINT LANDING&rdquo; is to cover all cities listed on your destination cards and then return to the starting place, namely &ldquo;LaGuardia Field&rdquo; New York City, before your opponents. Whoever returns first is the winner, before beginning study your route cards, and the map to determine the shortest round trip route, and arrange your cards accordingly. The players spin the dial in turn, and moves along the desired route, advancing the same amount of spaces as the spin. He must land on every city listed on the cards even though he spins a greater number. (Example: if he is three spaces from one of his cities and spins a six he still only advances three spaces to the city and then waits his next turn.) If a stop is made at a space with a &ldquo;FORCED LANDING&rdquo; or a &ldquo;MOTOR REPAIRING&rdquo; picture - ---in red clolor---the player must return to the last numbered town, it is necessary to spin the exact number of spaces to LaGuardia Field, New York City in order to land there at the finish. (Example: if there are three spaces left to the field, a three must be spun in order to land there.) The cities on the map have numbers that correspond to the numbers on the destination cards, so that small children will have no difficulty in identifying the position of the cities on the map.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes their turn of spinning the arrow indicator on the dial. The player who spins the highest number starts the game. The others follow clockwise.<br/><br/>To release each pawn from their home field, players in turn must spin a &quot;+&quot; numeral on dial, and advance their pawn according to the number indicated on the dial. For example, if &quot;+5&quot; is spun, they may advance their pawn 5 points. Pawns in home fields cannot be put into play if a &quot;-&quot; numeral is spun, but a pawn on the playing field can be advanced or set back the number of spaces the arrow indicates. Only one pawn can be moved at a time.<br/><br/>In order to reach home base, the exact &quot;+&quot; numeral must be dialed, and when added to the numeral on the playing field on which a pawn in play is standing, the total must add up to exactly 40.<br/><br/>All four pawns can occupy the same position on any numeral on the chart. In addition, there are rewards and penalties that appear on the playing board.<br/><br/>The player who succeeds in getting all of their four pawns to their home base first is the winner!<br/><br/>",

You can follow the track around the 3 rungs with the Clowns and the Ringmaster. You can build the various circus acts - the animal acts, the trapeze acts, the tumblers, the jugglers and others. There's a prize for each act you complete and whoever gets the most prizes, wins. Let's play!&quot;<br/><br/>This game uses a simplistic card drawing and set collection method to move players around the board. Movement around the board seems to serve no purpose other than to kill time, as all the game mechanic is from drawing cards and placing cards on the game board to make sets. Points are accumulated when sets are completed, or when indicated by the type of card drawn at the beginning of the player's turn.<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>The object of the game is to win the most Emmett Kelly Prize Disks. A Prize is won when a player <br/><br/>         Plays a Circus Act Card that completes and Act.<br/>         Draws an Emmett Kelly Prize Card<br/>         Stops on an Emmett Kelly space in the game board track.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Place the Emmett Kelly Prize Disks in a pile to one side.<br/><br/>Mix up the action cards and place them face down in a pile near the game board<br/><br/>All players select a colored Playing Piece and place it on the matching Ringmaster space on the board. the player that chose Green goes first and then play proceeds to the left<br/><br/>Each turn starts by drawing an Action Card from the face down pile.<br/><br/>ACTION CARDS - WHAT THEY MEAN<br/>Circus Act Cards. Each Circus Act card has a picture matching a part of an Act in the Circus, menagerie or Side Show. When Drawn, the player looks on the board for part of an Act it matches and places the card on it. The player also moves the playing piece the number of spaces shown on the card. moves are always in a clockwise direction.<br/>Whenever a player draws and plays an Act Card that completes an Act, he takes one Emmett Kelly Prize Disk.<br/><br/>Emmett Kelly Cards.

When drawn, the player moves his playing piece the number of spaces shown on the card.<br/><br/>Red Clown Cards. When drawn, the player moves his playing piece the number of spaces shown in the card. Also if any player (whether the one drawing the Red Clown Card or not) has more Prizes than the others, that player returns one Prize to the Prize pile.

        "description": "The board is a rectangle with a colored square in each corner, representing the corral for each player. 20 &quot;cattle&quot; pieces are placed in the middle of the board. The cattle are affixed to colored bases that match one player's corral. Each player has corresponding pieces: 1 bull (worth 10 points), 3 cows (worth 5 points) and 1 maverick calf (worth 2 points).<br/><br/>The players take turns using a lasso made of a length of string to lasso one of their cattle. A player gets three tries to successfully capture one of the cattle before their turn ends. Once a piece is successfully lassoed by the player, the player must drag  the piece using the lasso to the appropriate place on the board.<br/><br/>Bulls and cows must be pulled through the gate into the player's corral. Once in the corral, the pieces are scored and removed from the board.<br/><br/>Maverick calves are first taken to the Branding Pen and left for a turn, before it can be lassoed again and taken to the corral.<br/><br/>The board has obstacles (like cacti) which must be avoided while dragging the cattle, or the player's turn ends. If a player's lassoed cattle tips over while dragging, the turn ends.<br/><br/>The player may &quot;rustle&quot; another player's cattle. If a player has already captured one type of cattle, the player may try to rustle another player's cattle of the same type. If the cattle tips over while dragging the piece to the corral, the rustler must return the tipped piece and an extra of the same type of piece from their own corral which they had previously successfully lassoed.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Listed in American Games, #4193.  1946, Western, Board game.<br/><br/>",

Retro graphics adorn the board with characters like the Saturn Saucerman, Mars Batman and Giant Robot Space Master. Players travel from Terra (Earth)via Saturn and Luna (the moon) to the Zero Gravity Space Station. From there players continue via Mars or Venus to Jupiter. The pathway that players travel along is called &quot;Spaceways&quot;. The Spaceways are under the control of the Interplanet Patrol System of United Planets. Each spaceship has a Cosmic Space-o-gram receiving set and when a player lands on a space marked &quot;Take Space-o-gram&quot;, the player takes a Space-o-gram Card and follows the instructions. <br/>All ships must stop at the &quot;Zero Gravity Space Station&quot; and when leaving if a player spins an even number they go to Jupiter via Venus, and an odd number via Mars to Jupiter. Players cannot stop on the Asteroids as the nears Jupiter but spin a larger enough number to carry across the Asteroids. <br/>The First to reach Jupiter wins.

It appears this was designed to be played to pass the time during long flights. Each packet contains a blue slider sheet with 10 square holes with corresponding top/bottom slits, plus 1 cardboard strip listing 24 categories, and 10 strips each containing all the letters of the alphabet (A-Z). The strips are designed to slide through the top &amp; bottom slits, so that only 1 letter (or category) is visible through the square hole.<br/><br/>The first player holds the slider sheet horizontally and selects a category. They slide the category strip vertically into the slider sheet until the chosen category is visible. Then, they mentally choose a word for the other players to guess. They slide 2 letter strips vertically into the slider, so that only the first and last letters are visible. The other players in clockwise order call out letters they believe will fit this word. Letters called that do NOT appear in the word score 1 point against the caller. Correct letters are positioned in the proper slots. When any player guesses the original word correctly, he wins 1 point and becomes the next word/category selector. The game ends when 1 player wins 10 points.<br/><br/>Listed in American Games, #4213.  1971, Travel, Advertising, Ad game for Airline, Board game.<br/><br/>",

As the stones flew into the mist filled night they stopped their flight and hung before the young wizard, spinning about each other in a magical dance. With the Runes now ready, Jord called the spell to mind and began to chant the rites of summoning. With a blast of multi-colored light and a puff of foul smelling smoke, a green furred wolf leaped out of the magical doorway the rune stones had opened. Standing nearly as tall as the short mage, the wolf growled and then bowed its head in obedience to its master.<br/><br/>Turning, Jord commanded the great wolf to leap at his foe, a minor conjurer who had challenged Jord to a duel. Jord only hoped that the wolf he had just summoned would be enough to finish the other mage off, as that was the last of Jord&rsquo;s runes stones and so the end of his own magic.<br/><br/>This is Runes, a game of magical battle, spell casting and summoning. Can you out fight your foe, using the mystical rune stones and your chosen field of magic. A new and innovative game system, the Rune&rsquo;s game system is fully expandable and compatible with other Runes games. So why wait, go out and find some adventure and play Runes.<br/><br/>The first set of this exciting game covers the magic of Sorcery and the elemental power of Water.<br/><br/>Do you dare step into the mystical worlds of Runes&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Salus is the Latin word for &quot;well-being&quot;. The game consists of 26 pairs of cards, giving a total of 52 cards. Each pair shows an everyday scene which could cause an accident. One card of the pairs shows the wrong behavior in red, the other marks the corrected situation in blue.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 7 cards and tries to collect as many pairs as possible. The player who ends the game by emptying his hand first gets a bonus and all card remaining in the hands of the other players give minus points. Winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Each round, a player can choose to take a card from the stock or from the discard pile if he has a matching pair to one of the cards in the pile. But in case he chooses the latter, he must take all cards lying on top of the matching card. This small rule gives a real twist to that else wise simple card game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slahal (pronounced sle -`hal) is an indigenous very old, Pacific Coast Indian Gambling Game. The game is also called the &quot;bone game&quot;, &quot;stick game&quot; or &quot;hand game&quot; and is still played today by many in the Northwest. It is played, either as a two player game or as a team game. It originally used small pieces of animal bone as game pieces but now many kinds of substances have replaced those bones. Pieces of antler having both a rounded side and a flat side were used while a grouping of separate sticks serve as the score keeping method. Each team begins with a set number of scoring sticks. The two game pieces (acting almost like dice) are picked up by a player and secretly arranged on a flat surface. This is done to the accompaniment of Native Music. The object of the game is to correctly guess where certain game bones are located in the opponents hand. During the playing of the music the pieces are arranged in different patterns, either both flat pieces down, both round pieces down or 1 going each way so that there are 4 possible combinations that can be accomplished. The opponent or the leader of the opposing team will motion to the other leader that they are ready to guess the direction of the unmarked bones. He uses a set of hand signals to make his guess. Each time he guesses incorrectly, he must throw one of his score keeping sticks to the opposing team. The team that eventually wins all of the opponents score keeping sticks wins the match<br/><br/>Nothing in this description was intentionally taken from the Elliott Avedon Museum &amp; Archive of Games, a public funded Museum in Canada who would not give permission for the Museum's description of the game to be used. This compilation is taken from numerous other sources found.<br/><br/>This game was re-created by Bill Kuhnely in 1981.<br/><br/>",

Each player acts as Chief of the Homicide Squad and as each new fact is unearthed he/she must choose the next step to take in his/her investigation. In doing so he may win money from his fellow investigators or he may lose to them, sometimes Heavily.<br/><br/>The game comes with paper money, some of which is distributed to the players,  and a sheet which tells the background of the crime. The background is either read to ones self or read out loud to the entire group. Then the first page of the crime case is read. On the reverse of each case players will find 10 possible courses of action that he/she as investigator may take. After carefully considering all the given facts and without consulting any other player each investigator checks the two courses of action that he/she feels should now be taken.<br/><br/>After all players have decided on their particular course of actions a blue sheet is read which gives both benefits and penalties to each player depending on what decisions they have made.  If both of the choices that an investigator makes are good the player will collect money from the kitty, if both are bad ones the player will pay into the kitty, if one is good and one is bad there will be a net plus/minus total which will create a small gain or loss.<br/><br/>Now the next page of the crime is read and the another set of 10 possible actions will be given from which each player can choose two courses of action. This continues until final evidence is presented and each player will be asked &quot;Who Killed Gloria Don? Being correct pays off, being wrong costs you money. At the end of the game all players who have more money than what they started with sort of win with the player with the most money being the overall winner of the game. Many cases were available !<br/><br/>",

It will usually start from the home town.  It can end anywhere.  If you live in the north, you may want to go to Florida and back. If you live in the east, you may want to go to the west coast and back.  The maps provided cover the entire United States on a scale so large that all but the smallest towns are shown.  They are the latest and most accurate maps that Rand McNally can provide.<br/><br/>Each may follow a different route or all may follow the same route, but success may depend on who selects the shortest and fastest route.<br/><br/>The first player spins the arrow on the spinning board at least on complete revolution and proceeds as directed, sticking his pin/auto into the map to mark his position.<br/><br/>Delays, accidents, and detours affect only the player involved.  Other players proceed according to their own directions as indicated by the luck of the spin.<br/><br/>Really, directions are hardly necessary.  The game is so like a real TREK that once you get into the spirit of the thing and use the imagination, you will meet the emergencies as they arise.<br/><br/>",

Each player is provided with 10 pawns, which have movement rules similar to bishops in chess. An element of chance is introduced through dice rolling as well.<br/><br/>The box title is TAK TICS, while the Rule Book is labeled TAC TIKS<br/><br/>",

For adults, the game provides better strategies to help the Black Community.  The winner is the player that does the most for the Community.  This is determined by the player with the most chips.  The white chips represent economic power.  The red chips represent political power.  The black chips represent power in the Black Community, and the blue chips represent 10 black chips.<br/><br/>A player may cash in his chips at any time with blue chips worth $100 each and the other worth $10 each.  A player may borrow money or chips from another player, but a player may not borrow money from the bank.  A player may also trade or sell chips.<br/><br/>A player may move to the Suburbs or Inner City, but that player will need two players to help him move or pay part of the player's salary.<br/> The rules state that if everybody cooperates, then everybody will prosper.<br/><br/>One version of the box cover states that up to 7 player can play this game and that the game is appropriate for those Ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>Internet information states that the game was created around 1973. The game was developed in 1973 when Malik Ali was working with high school students in Buffalo in an after-school program. He wanted to teach them how the black community works in a quick and entertaining way.<br/><br/>",

There are also four strips showing four guests or items needed for the party.<br/><br/>The first game is a cooperative matching game in which all players try to match all the items on all four strips.<br/><br/>The second game is a simple &quot;concentration-style&quot; memory game where players take turns trying to match a pair of pictures on the bottom of the disc.<br/><br/>In the third game, players each take one of the four strips and attempt to be the first to find all four items displayed on their strip.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spider-Man 3 3D Skyscraper Game is a modular roll-and-move game given away in packs of Ovaltine 3-in-1 (a powdered chocolate flavoured malt drink). Each pack had 20 sachets and came with one module of the game. There are four different modules, each module consisting of a booklet of thick cardboard pages, which are to be cut up and assembled into skyscrapers and structures. The modules can be played individually or put together to form one big city - New York (structures include the Statue of Liberty and the Chrysler building). <br/>The game is for two players, and one can choose to be either spidey or black spidey. The object of the game is to race around the city and the first player to reach the 'Winner' space wins. The path winds through the city and up and down the sides of the skyscrapers - the pieces can fit into slots in the walls. There are also spaces that allow a player to draw a card and follow instructions like, &quot;Drink Ovaltine, get more power, Jump two steps forward&quot;, or, &quot;Strong wind, all players go back four steps&quot;. A feature is that the die for the game is also included in each module - but you have to cut it out and assemble it yourself.<br/>The text for the rules and on the cards are in Thai and English and the manufacturer of the drink is Thai. Besides Thailand, the packs were distributed in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player whose ball is closest to the jack. The Team achieving first 13 points wins the match.<br/><br/>In this boardgame adaption you roll out the flexible map and soon opposing and own balls group themselves around the goal ball &quot;jack&quot; and the players stand before the decision, depending upon game situation, whether to aim or to shoot.<br/><br/>To determine if your action was successful or not you will use a  two-pieced plastic ball with a pointer and two scales. In a dexterity depending action you shake that ball trying to get that pointer pointing at the right position. At first you won't succeed very well but with more experience you will find that this process is not only luck but also controllable.<br/><br/>",

In each round the players roll the dice and advance their car. During the game the players can enter in sports events (they pass them on their track and they include a ski event, horseback riding, tennis, sailing or golf). These events cost 50.000 francs to enter but can earn the player points. The players can also encounter bad luck during their journey (flat tire, accident, they can even end up in hospital). In the end the player who completes the track first with the most points wins the game. This game was created in 1955 by the same designer as 1000 Bornes.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to turn your blocks until all 5 of them have the same number appearing along the row of sides facing you. The first person to accomplish this calls out &quot;Hi RO&quot; and receives a score determined by the size of the numbers that he/she lines up.<br/><br/>The 5 blocks are set up to that all blanks appear at the top then the tray is passed around the table. The first player moves the center block 3 spaces. That in turn will reveal a number on the top block. That number determines the number of spaces that the next player must turn and so on. Each player must turn the center block with his first play.  After that he may move any of his blocks in an attempt to line up 5 faces numbered alike. The top side of each block last turned controls the move of the next player but you try to score the sides facing you.<br/><br/>",

The game has six levels of play ranging from beginner to advanced.<br/><br/>Each player receives 6 playing pieces of the same color, one for each of the trigonometric functions. There can be 2 to 6 players.<br/>Players will learn the names of the six major trigonometric functions: SIN, COS, TAN, COT, SEC, CSC. Advanced rules provide you with concepts of the four quadrants and the signs for each function in each quadrant.<br/>Players will learn the ratios of the sides of a right triangle for the six major trigonometric functions. The triangular playing pieces are specially designed to show the direction of rotation for your playing piece around each triangular path.<br/><br/>The simple rules for the novice is called the &quot;Beginners Game&quot; In this game you will learn the names of the six functions and what constitutes a triangle.<br/>In the &quot;Direction Game&quot; a player will find that there is a clockwise and counterclockwise direction of movement.<br/>The &quot;Function Game&quot; requires you to start your playing piece such that it moves onto the numerator for the trigonometric ratio of your playing piece and then onto the denomator for that playing piece.<br/>In the &quot;Many Triangles Game&quot; a player will make use of smaller right triangles to shorten the distance of travel.<br/>In the &quot;Quadrant Game&quot; the player will find that there are four quadrants on the playing board with a specific sign for each trigonometric function as represented by the playing pieces.<br/>In the &quot;Function Sign Game&quot; the player will need to observe the sign for each playing piece for the quadrant it is in.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This version of baseball was produced in 1941 by Milton Bradley. It is a physical dexterity game that uses a thick cardboard bat about 3.4&quot; long, with a wood semi-circle glued to the underside about 1/3 in from the handle, and with a small hole near the tip of the bat. There are 8 small glass balls, 4 white and 4 black. The cardboard playing field is inset into the box bottom, and is punched with a variety of holes.<br/><br/>The rules on the side of the box say that when batting, a player puts the bat about 2&quot; from the home-plate corner of the box, mounts a ball of his color on the hole in the bat, and then brings down his finger with a sharp blow to the bat handle. This launches the ball up and onto the playing field. Falling into one of four large oblong holes around the pitcher's mound is a strike. Dropping into the round hole near each fielder  is an out. Dropping into any of the numbered holes is a safe hit of that many bases. There is a home run hole in deep center field. If a launched ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a ball. Three strikes cause an out, while four balls of course generate a walk. Successful hits are marked by putting balls into holes on the appropriate bases before batting again.<br/><br/>The game can be found listed in &quot;Baseball Games from Antique Baseball to Modern Baseball Sims&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The simple, easy to follow instructions enables players to practice these important skills:<br/><br/>Color matching - players roll the color die and move to the space that matches the color rolled.<br/><br/>Memory - if they land on a space that pictures an object, they must try to find the chip that contains the matching object.  In order to be successful, the player needs to remember where certain objects are hidden!<br/><br/>Taking turns - a child's first game experience teaches cooperation and consideration for others.<br/><br/>Following in sequence - to be successful, the players need to follow their given path and get Maisy to her favorite place.<br/><br/>Cooperating, winning and losing graciously - an important lesson to learn early in life!<br/><br/>There are 3 versions of play that vary in degree of difficulty.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;    In Endless Monsters Upon Japan! you direct an unstoppable stream of monsters from your home city towards either Tokyo or Hiroshima. One player seeks to reduce the major cities of northern Japan to rubble; the other is against southern Japan.<br/><br/>The monsters are very active, and cause little trouble if allowed to run from city to city. But if delayed at a city they stomp about in frustration and cause great damage. True to the ideals of collectible monster games, the monsters enjoy fighting each other and grow in size with each victory. Moreover, the theme of collectible monster games also led the mad scientists to create three colors of monsters, each of which has an advantage against another.<br/><br/>The game is easy to learn and quick to play. Two playing boards are included: a chart makes learning the game simpler, while a map of Japan is prettier to use. There are numerous strategies, some of which will be discovered quickly by an adult player and others of which are more subtle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game uses a Monopoly-like path around the board's outer edge allow random events in a way that carefully prohibits luck from overriding strategy.<br/><br/>Players use wise resource management and strategic construction of new buildings to expand their colony. Resources are not only traded among players but bought and sold with the Empire in a market with varying (and manipulatable) prices. The colonies also build up military strength to use at the conclusion of the game when the colonies jointly declare independence and the Empire responds with an invading army. &quot;<br/><br/>",

All games came in the same box under the title of Big 6 Sports Games.  This is a simple spin and find the results game. Also included in the box with this game was; Mickey Mantle's Big League Baseball , Gardner's Stock Car Race   , Gardner's Championship Golf, Verne Gagne Wrestling, and All Star Football<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score the highest number of baskets and free throws. To setup, you shuffle the Referee's cards and place in a pile, face down. Players determine which side of the board will be HOME and which is VISTORS. Play begins with a jump ball in the center circle. Players spin until both arrows point to the same team (innermost circle) to determine the Offensive player. The ball will move in the direction of their target basket. Offense player spins again and places the ball in the color position on the Court matching the color indicated by the arrow. Players both spin reading the numbers on the outer edge of the spinners. Ball movement will occur based on the numbers spun by both Offense and Defense. The possible outcomes are: the ball moves in the direction of the error on the board, ball is intercepted, ball is stolen, or a basket is made. If Defense ever spins a 4, the Offense picks up a Referee card and follows it instructions. Player is allowed 3 spins for a free throw shot.<br/><br/>Players determine length of time by agreement on time limit or number of points.<br/><br/>",

The player in lane #1 spins and moves that many spaces forward on the track, followed by the car in lane #2, and so on. To change lanes, the car moves sideways (not diagonally) on the track. If a player spins or lands on a &quot;Draw Card&quot; space, they draw a card from the &quot;PIT&quot; deck and follows the directions. To overtake another car, players must drive around the car ahead unless their spin lands them directly on the same space. In this case, the overtaken car moves back one space and the passing car takes their position. Use the score pad to track the number of laps. After 6 laps, the game ends and the winner is the first car to pass the finish line.<br/><br/>",

Also included in the box were Verne Gagne Wrestling, All Star Football, Mickey Mantle's Big League Baseball, All Star Basketball,   Gardner's Stock Car Race  .<br/><br/>Players take turns teeing off by spinning the spinner and rolling the color die. The inner circle on the spinner indicates the zone the board and the color die indicates the colored space in that zone where the ball lands. After all players have teed off, the player furthest from the hole plays first. Players reference the Shot Chart corresponding to their zone/color to determine where their ball lands next. A combination of Zone VI, Red, means the ball landed in the hole. If you receive this combination on the tee off, you earned a &quot;hole-in-one&quot;.<br/><br/>When all players have landed on the green, the Putting Green, Zone VI chart is used to determine the number of putts to hole out. Individual scores are tracked on the score pad (each move counts as one &quot;stroke&quot;). Play 9 or 18 holes of golf. The player with the fewest total strokes across all holes is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are four bridges from the Outside Land to the Island. Two trolls move among these four bridges. Play cards to take and use the magic wands: if you have the proper magic wand you can move a certain-sized goat or a troll. Also, if you have just the right combinations of cards you can stir the dragon, who will swoop down to eat one of your rival's goats. Who will be the first to help three goats get to the Island?<br/><br/>This is a children's game because strategy can be neglected for straightforward play and the way in which players compete for the magic wands is childishly simple (I'm taking it... No you're not... Yes I am... No you're not...). Adults would probably enjoy this game as much as children only when tired or inebriated.

When landing on different spaces, children are posited situations to which they must respond or a coping skills card. When a player responds to a card in a suitably acceptable way, he or she receives a victory point chip. Theoretically, at the end of the game, the player with the most chips wins.

The Helping, Sharing, and Caring Game is a derivative of the therapeutic instrument-- specifically designed for children, their siblings, their parents, and other adults with whom children may be involved.

An accurate and exciting game that could be played anytime, anywhere, with any teams of your choice, past or present - that produced its own realistic statistics.<br/><br/>You begin the game with the visiting team up first.  Each shake of the dice represents a pitch.  Proceed around the game board until there are three outs.  Leave your game piece on the 3rd out of each inning as you will begin from whatever space your third out is for the rest of the game.  Keep track of each man's at bats, balls, strikes, outs, hits, etc., and enter the total hits, runs, and errors, (if any), of each inning in the designated innings on the score card.  The Home Team does the exact same thing in the bottom of each inning.  Be sure to remove all base runners left on base at the end of each teams ups.  As in real baseball, the game is played for nine innings to determine a winner of the game.  If the Home team is ahead after 8 1/2 innings of play, the Home team wins and does not bat in the bottom of the 9th.<br/><br/>In the game rule book, there are 3 versions of game play that can be played from this gameboard.<br/>Basic version is approximate 30 minutes playing time.<br/>Intermediate version is approximate 30-60 minutes of playing time.<br/>Advanced version is approximate 60-90 minutes of playing time.<br/>There are also optional variations of play with each version.<br/><br/>",

Its Willie Mays' Own Baseball Game, An Oliver Game (c) 1954 by Toy Development Co., Inc.<br/><br/>Later published as Willie Mays &quot;Say Hey&quot; Baseball Game by Centennial Game Co. in 1958.<br/><br/>Game comes with three spinners, one for the pitcher, one for the batter and one for the fielder. If the pitchers spinner indicates a strike or a ball then the batter can either take the pitch or swing at it. If he decides to swing he uses his spinner to determine if he in fact hits the ball and where it was hit to or if the batter misses it. Then the fielder has the opportunity to catch or field the ball. If the ball is in play a batters dial decides if the hit is a single, double, triple or home run.<br/><br/>There are rules for trying to bunt or steal. Things like wild pitches and passed balls are posible.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, English consonants are assigned to the numbers (written in an auxiliary area, not in the grid). After that, each player looks for words that can be made from chains of adjacent cells snaking in any combination of directions, ignoring vowels and allowing a single letter to stand for a double letter.<br/><br/>Each player writes down their word on paper and then, on their turn, writes the appropriate consonants on the cells used and challenges their opponents to guess the word. A successful guess gives the points to the opponent, otherwise the player gets a point per cell used. In either case the used cells are out of play.<br/><br/>There are a few further wrinkles, including one where, if a player manages to enclose an area with his or her color and the edge of the board, he or she may claim all the enclosed spaces.<br/><br/>",

Combat has many options available giving players the option to make mobility kills and flanking shots among other things.<br/><br/>The game is really more or less designed for small skirmish style ground combat although air to air and air to ground rules are covered very briefly.<br/><br/>",

Each of the games is a bit more challenging than the last so once they master one game they &quot;graduate&quot; on to the next.<br/><br/>Initially the child simply counts. Later the child uses an included ink stamp to make a number of marks equal to a die roll.  Later, players have different colored pencils and take turns coloring parts of the picture.  They must figure out the number that they can color.  The player coloring the most wins.  So children are learning counting while they think they're only playing a game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An application for a U.S. patent was filed in December 1927 by James M. Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old. The patent, for &quot;Electric Baseball,&quot; was granted less than a year later, and Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, under a variety of titles and in a variety of forms, would go on to a production run of more than thirty years.<br/><br/>Prentice initially sold, or at least licensed, the rights to his invention to Parker Brothers, the game-publishing giant of nearby Salem -- probably to help fund his college tuition at the University of New Hampshire, whence he graduated with a degree in mathematics. Parkers produced Electric Base Ball Game, arguably the first electrical boardgame ever, in the very early 1930s.<br/><br/>Despite the enduring popularity of the fondly-remembered Prentice games, their more than two dozen variations and their chronology are poorly documented, and Prentice himself (1910-2005) seems a mysterious figure to most.<br/><br/>Prentice regained control of his patent by the mid-1930s and set himself up in business as Electric Game Co..  One of the first products of The Electric Game Company -- perhaps the very first, and among the simplest of all Prentice baseball games -- was Electric Base Ball &quot;version D02,&quot; featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot;  Prentice evidently got rights to Parker Brothers' graphics as well.  He told the Union-News that in his first year of production, he sold about a hundred games at five dollars each.<br/><br/>Very similar to both the D02 and the Parker Brothers game, another of the earliest varieties of Electric Base Ball was the &quot;version DD24,&quot; also featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot; The &quot;D&quot; and &quot;DD&quot; clearly denoted editions using a single D battery and two D batteries -- perhaps the last obvious indicia in a long list of cryptic Prentice codes. The games were personally assembled by Prentice and a few assistants.<br/><br/>Another early-looking version of Prentice electric baseball is Wonder Baseball Game. The illustrated batter would be reused in later variations of the box lid.<br/><br/>Not only is Wonder again similar to the early models above, the promo literature included in the box trumpets both the Wonder game and Electric Base Ball Model D02, as well as Electric Football, and identifies all as available in 1938. Oddly, the Wonder gameboard indicates &quot;patent pending,&quot; despite the 1928 patent used on much later models.<br/><br/>Wonder Baseball had an edition packaged in a slip-cover sort of box and apparently devoid of battery compartments, control buttons, and lights. It seems to be a non-electric model, perhaps a wartime revision.<br/><br/>Prentice saved a little money by providing box lids but no box bottoms for his games, leaving many vendors of second-hand games today to think that one part's missing. It's not. Adding to some latter-day confusion, Electric Game Co. box lids and gameboards do not always match up.  Prentice was not one to waste a nickel, so it's very likely that, even while new gameboard models were being designed, produced, and sold, old box-lid inventory was being used until it was exhausted, and only at that point would new and redesigned box lids be printed.<br/><br/>The lid most often associated with the earliest 1930s versions of Electric Base Ball is a red box with the batter illustration above the title.  Two words on the gameboard, &quot;Baseball&quot; is one word on the box.  The source of the illustration -- the same batter seen on Wonder Baseball Game -- remains unknown.<br/><br/>Slightly later editions of the lid added the phrase &quot;Big League&quot; above &quot;Electric Baseball&quot; -- all in a new font -- and are in fact usually seen covering <br/>Big League Electric Baseball Model B-4, which was produced from about 1938 through 1941.  Prentice's All-American Electric Football and Collegiate Electric Basketball also debuted by 1938.<br/><br/>Like the earliest versions, the B-4 measures about 16x14&quot; -- the standard dimensions of all Prentice Electric Baseball games until the Super De Luxe editions of the early 1950s.<br/><br/>A fourth edition of the red box replaces &quot;Big League&quot; with &quot;Jim Prentice.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, probably from about 1940, sports a version of the cover illustration on the gameboard itself.<br/><br/>The legend added to the fifth red box variation reads &quot;This Game Operates Electrically Or Mechanically.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model, is a little lighter on the bulbs and wiring and the need for batteries, hinting that this too is not just post-1940 but a wartime product.<br/><br/>A slightly simpler version of Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model (had two knobs, no illustration). The two Dual Control models are the only versions of Electric Baseball so far found carrying a different patent number -- confirming not only their 1942 invention, but also that they were not a Prentice design.  George P Alderman and Herbert H Fredrick had been the people granted the patent on that gameboard.<br/><br/>The patent was later licensed to a company called Mastercraft, which produced the game as Prolectric Baseball in 1951.  Mastercraft also turned out Prolectric Football and possibly other games in the '50s.<br/><br/>The famous &quot;alligator-finish&quot; white box is assumed by many to be early 1930s vintage, but this box lid is almost always seen with Models E120, 68-B, 48-B, and 63-B, all verifiably from the late 1940s. Model E120 dates to 1947. The cartoon of the swinging batter is based on an early-'30s painting by noted illustrator J. F. Kernan.<br/><br/>(Source)<br/><br/>",

One page of rules, fantastic graphics on the map, 20 plastic miniatures, dice, and hours of simple war gaming fun.<br/><br/>This game is not designed to simulate, it is a game.  Fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, and even mothers with children will love the simplicity and speed (most games last less than 30 minutes).  Old school gamers will also love it as a quick fix game.<br/><br/>It is 1940.  Players choose the Allies or the Axis to play.  The board has preset armies for both side that begin on the board.  A game last 15 turns unless a clear winner before then.  Some turns have preset first phase players, some the players dice for initiative.  On those turns player get to go first automatically, they also receive reinforcements.  Essentially, the allies must hold out until mid-game or they are going to loose.  The Germans must win quick, or the allies will eventually overwhelm them.  Hey! Just like the real war...<br/><br/>The game uses very simple mechanics for movement and combat, and it is in no way a simulation.  The idea is to provide a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game for those who don't have time to play a more involved wargame.<br/><br/>The concept behind the Battle Box series is simple and fun:  Play when you can.  The game is perfect for introducing young would be generals to wargaming, as even as early as 10 years old the rules and concepts are easily grasped.<br/><br/>Available at  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.flamingmonkeygames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.flamingmonkeygames.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Champion Game of Baseball was published by the Proctor Amusement Company of North Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1889. It consists of a baseball field printed on the bottom of the box with a metal spinner in the middle, a rules sheet, and an envelope with nine blue and nine red cardboard disks.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of strategy in this early game - each team uses the spinner on its turn to bat. Most of the results are either outs or hits (spaces for single, double, triple and home run), but there also are spaces for strikes, balls and base on balls. It is therefore possible but unlikely to get three strikes or four balls. There is one space for a foul ball, and any spinner stopping on a line is considered a foul as well.<br/><br/>The one strategic option open to the batting team is whether to have base runners try to steal. In this event, the stealing team spins again, but uses an outer ring where the results are divided between &quot;out&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;sacrifice&quot; (where the runner advances but the current batter is out). An out result always picks off the lead runner.<br/><br/>* * see corrections in Community Wiki below<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There were a few more real life dictators in the world when this game was published in 1939.  Very little information can be found about this board game.<br/><br/>Update - The game comes with many lead minatures (8 Aviators representing each player, 12 submarines, 8 Battleships and 16 aeroplanes). Definitely the king of game play pieces by weight alone.   The map contains a circle of spaces surrounded by 3 territories which hold the game's key resources- Manchukuo (Iron), Dutch East Indies (Oil) &amp; Ukraine (Wheat).  The game play spaces have actions (like collect $4 million or capture enemy plane) or consequences (sub sunk) and even political events (revolt, coup or treaty - which are separate cards).<br/><br/>The center of the board represents the armament factory and all the minatures begin there to be bought by the player as they build up their forces. The players move around the circle by the roll of the dice collecting and losing money, armaments and political cards to be used in the game.   The goal of the game is to collect military forces so that you can control the 3 territories (1 at a time or if you are strong enough, all at once). The players move military units into and out of the territories on their turns, conquering weaker opponents (and taking their units).   If you have the required military units in the territory and you have earned a propaganda card (by landing on the right space) you gain the resource of that territory.  Having all 3 resources wins the game.<br/><br/>It is believed that even copies in very good to very fine condition, used copies that may even be missing a part or two, were worth between $500 and $600 as recently as the year 2000.  For those looking for this game, it comes in a long red box with the word &quot;Dictator&quot; written across the front in red lettering on top of a curved white stripe.<br/><br/>",

According to the score sheets, you tally each, plus add the number of side trips made to the Blessing column and it looks like the highest Blessing score wins.<br/><br/>Knowledge cards get you Blessings or Trespasses. Free Agency cards quote verses from LDS scripture. Corner spaces are significant: Go on a Mission or to the Tree of Life; these are the good squares. The bad ones are Temptation and Sin City. It looks like Sin City is like Monopoly's Jail square. You must roll to get out and the longer it takes, the more Trespasses you get.<br/><br/>",

Two, three or four people can play.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Action takes place on a board with traditional checker-squares on it, separated so that red squares touch red squares at diagonal corners and similarly, white squares touch white squares at diagonal corners.  Moves by players are made diagonally.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The object of the game is to capture opponents' men by leap-frogging over them until the checkers of only one player remain.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It will be noted that there is a big square area in the center of the board.  Wings extend in four directions giving the playing area the shape of a cross.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;CHECK-O is a direct descendant of the ancient game of Checkers, devised over 5,000 years ago by the Egyptian Pharoahs (sic), so history tells us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When the Roman soldiers conquered Egypt, they took home many souvenirs of their exploits in North Africa.  Among these was the game of Checkers.  Even in ancient times, moves were made in the same way - diagonally across the board - and each player faced his opponent with twelve men.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;CHECK-O, though similar to Checkers, is faster-moving and gives more opportunity for strategy.

Two opponents maneuver their battleships across the ocean while the opposing player attempts to find and torpedo them.  A red light comes on when a hit is successful and a small magnet is placed upon the &quot;damaged&quot; ship.

        "description": "On October 14, 1920, the last major White offensive took place. It would become Wrangel's Kursk, a precursor to that more famous WW2 battle at Kursk but this happened at Kakhovka, a small town astride the Dnepr River.<br/><br/>Unique for it was only the second time in the RCW that a mass tank attack would occur (the first was in the Summer of 1919), fully supported by DH9A bombers and infantry against a very well prepared Red defense consisting of three consecutive trench lines, mines and barb wire. WW1 was in effect &quot;revisited&quot;. General Wrangel placed his blind faith in the tanks he had procured from the British, His tankers were well trained. He had even developed a combined arms approach. His forces, though outnumbered by 2 to 1 or more, continued to fight the &quot;good fight&quot; and had busted out of the Crimea in June, sent the Reds fleeing backwards for hundreds of miles with mass tank attacks and the ideal flat land. However, Wrangel was unable to secure the town of Kakhovka. The town had little real tactical value except for the fact the Reds held it. In September, several battles had been fought for it, each time the Whites were repulsed. Oct. 14th would be the last one.<br/><br/>The Reds had created antitank formation consisting of MkV and FT-17 tanks and a unique American weapon, the Maklen 37mm AA gun. True, they only had a few of them , but the weapons ability to penetrate armor at very long distances was a stopper. Artillery units in AT mode also had been created. In manpower, the Reds had overwhelming strength if they did not flee from the tanks as they approached.<br/><br/>The stage was set for the massive tank assault (in RCW terms) and for the final show-down between White and Red.<br/><br/>Game scale is 1 hr turns, 800 yd a hex, company level, individual MkV, Whippet, Ft-17 tanks, Austin Armor Cars, DH9A Aircraft. The system never plays the same as once never knows how many units they can activate.<br/><br/>",

Then, they may set aside any number of those dice and roll the remaining dice a second time.  They may again set aside any number of dice and re-roll the remaining dice for a third time.  Dice you set aside previously may be re-rolled if you wish, and you may end your turn at any time if you are happy with your current roll.<br/><br/>Once the rolling is done, your score is the total of all dice, with a few special rules:<br/><br/>1. Fours are free, so you do not add those to the total.<br/>2. If you have four dice showing the same number (except four), you subtract that many from the total.  Five dice of that number does not count.<br/>3.

Balance and co-operation are the ways to win in Xephyr.<br/><br/>Xephyr uses a dice; the latter is unusual for Fleur Designs games but it doesn't mean the element of skill is missing. The whole game is based on your skill of balance; can you get your first piece to its goal whilst keeping your second under control? If you can't then you can lose badly.<br/><br/>",

This electric action game features 4 Sprinter racing figures. There are two different kinds of tracks on the field (board). One features the regular running events like the 100 yard dash, the 220, the 440 and the mile run. A separate track was used to run the low hurdles. The low hurdle track had bumps on it so that at least in theory the runners actually jumped over those low hurdles as they came down to the finish line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the National Museum of Play Online Collection:<br/>&quot;One of the most popular children's games of the late 19th century was called &quot;Peter Coddles and his trip to New York,&quot; or some variation of that title. The games true origins have been lost but it is thought that it was first developed by McLoughlin Brothers in New York, though nearly every competitor produced one or more versions. Some, such as this version, bore completely different titles but followed the same method for play. It is a very simple word game best played with a large group of children, so it lent itself to social gatherings, parties, or holiday functions. The game consists of cards, usually small printed strips, with word groups printed, usually nouns. A leader reads the 'story' supplied with the game and when he/she encounters a blank, the first player to the left supplies the words from the card drawn. The play advances around the table, with nonsensical humor increasing with each blank in the story. Versions range from simple to deluxe--with quite complicated printed stories supplied. The game relates to other word games of its time such as Anagrams and to contemporary word games such as Boggle and Mad Libs.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The first is a campaign game where the players are national leaders engaging in politics and moving forces across a map of Europe divided into areas with differing economic and strategic value.  The second is a set of miniatures rules for simulating battle from 1660 to 1715.  The rules may be used exclusively of the campaign system and vice versa.<br/><br/>The rules do not require re-basing from other rules systems.  The units are standardized with infantry battalions consisting of 12 castings, two cavalry squadrons are 4 castings each.  The number of castings per stand varies with foot and cavalry types.  Armies are organized into commands and orders are issued to commands and groups.<br/><br/>The book includes several campaign scenarios set for different periods beginning in 1660, 1680, 1690 and 1701.  There is also one battle scenario for the Battle of Utrecht, 1676.<br/><br/>",

There are 49 army lists that themselves provide a rich source of information and cover the important armies of Asia as well as those of Europe.

If a player runs out of turtle tokens, he is out of the game.<br/><br/>There are 4 variable conditions that help or hinder population growth.

Players alternate as the DRAWER and try to get their team to guess what they are drawing.<br/><br/>Both teams may guess every round. If the DRAWER's team guesses correctly then they move ahead one space. If the opposing team guesses then the DRAWER's team is blocked. There is no time limit for drawing/guessing. If nobody can guess correctly the DRAWER will choose a new 'Type Of' card to draw.<br/><br/>The board is made up of 5 Greek Letter - Pi, Delta, Theta, Sigma and Omega. Depending on which Greek Letter your pawn is on determines the 'Type Of' clue to be drawn.<br/><br/>The first team to the 'Omega' WIN space is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of strategy and memory, and suspense for two players, with unusual material.<br/><br/>The players create their block-pawns and their starting zone. They receive 12 block-pawns, 18 pawns of their color, 6 pawns of the opponent's color, and 12 neutral pawns. Players secretly insert combinations of 3 pawns in each block-pawn: 1 pawn of their visible color in the window; and 2 pawns of their choice. At the same time as the placement of the block-pawns on the board, the players build their starting zone by positioning the stems. The game begins with 12 blue block-pawns against 12 red block-pawns. The unfolding game will reveal neutral block-pawns, playable by the 2 players.<br/><br/>With each color a direction with displacement and catch is associated. The catch of an opponent's block-pawn consists in turning over it and replanting it on another stem. According to the internal combination of the block-pawn and the height of the stem, this action involves a modification of color, due to the translation of the pawns. No block-pawn is eliminated materially from the plate, it is transformed. As soon as a neutral block-pawn is present on the play, the players can turn the board a quarter of a turn, to counter their adversary, or to prepare their next blow: another vision of the play arises. The part is finished as soon as a color (Blue, Reed, Neutral) is represented more only by 7 block-pawns on the plate. The players count their respective block-pawns (Blue, Red). That which has some more gained: it is the rule of the 7.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.plimil.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.plimil.fr/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Boardgame News:<br/><br/>If the Scrapyard Wars title sounds familiar, that might be because it combines the names of Scrapheap Challenge&mdash;a British television show in which teams compete to build working machines out of scrap parts&mdash;and Junkyard Wars, the short-running U.S. program with the same set-up.<br/><br/>Now, instead of watching others transform junk into functioning junk, you get to assemble a few machines of your own&mdash;robots, to be precise, and preferably robots that will withstand some punishment. &ldquo;Scrapyard Wars is a unique take on a combat arena style game in which players seek to build the best robots they can and then keep them alive long enough to get the most value out of their creation,&rdquo; says designer Steve Sisk.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can add a piece of scrap to his hand (either drawing randomly or exchanging a part in his hand for a face-up one), build a robot, add parts to a robot already in play (to earn more VPs), or retire a robot (to protect the VPs already earned by that bot). &ldquo;Robots are worth VPs depending on the quality and mix of parts used to build them,&rdquo; says Sisk. Robots hold up to four VP tiles worth 1-3 VPs each. &ldquo;The longer the robots are around, the more VP they&rsquo;ll earn&mdash;but the VPs for a robot may be lost if the robot is defeated or destroyed by another robot.&rdquo;<br/><br/>During set-up, seven parts tiles are included for each player, and the game ends when a players takes the final tile. Adds Sisk, &ldquo;With more players, there&rsquo;s more risk of a more powerful robot being targeted by everyone else, so players must be careful when building. A very powerful robot will earn the most VPs, but will be more at risk of being destroyed. Players become more interested in trying to slip a less powerful robot under the radar of other players and build VPs slowly.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed for use with The Magic Tent, this second volume brings a brand new story and an all-new adventure full of mystery and imagination. Hank, Stella, and Cody camped out one night in their grandfather's mysterious old tent. When they awoke the next morning, they were in another part of the world. It's up to you to solve the mystery and help bring them home again! This time the adventure takes place in Australia. As kids read the story inside their own Magic Tent (not included), parents will hide clues around the house. During key points in the story, the kids will read a hint, climb out of the tent, and race to find the hidden clues. When they do, they'll put them together to reveal a secret message that helps them to solve the mystery! It's an exciting activity for groups or individual kids. It combines reading, imagination, problem-solving, active play - and it's just plain fun! This kit comes with a 58 page adventure book, 7 secret clues, and a smart card with instructions and additional information for parents. For use with The Magic Tent - sold separately. 1 or More Players, Ages 7 and up.<br/><br/>",

The evil is the spawn in human form, Wilbur Whately [sic]. To win, the investigator player must find and destroy him before or after he transforms into the spawn.<br/>Player #2 represents the spawn and the cultists that worship and protect him. This player must eliminate all professor, police, reporter, and detective counters from play. At any point that he achieves this goal, player #2 wins the game. In the process of this, player #2 attempts to have Wilbur kill enough people to gain the energy he needs to transform into the spawn. Once Wilbur is the spawn, it will be much easier for him to attack and win.<br/>Wilbur must transform into the spawn by the end of the last full moon phase on the turn track or his opportunity will pass until next year. Should he fail to transform into the spawn by the end of this phase, the game ends in a stalemate.<br/><br/>",

Each row has a start value of ten and four spaces to fill, except one space marked (+), resulting in fourteen spaces in all to fill. Each player has 10 stones to place: four square value stones (4, 3, 2, and 1), three round arithmetic symbol stones (the minus sign, the division sign, and the multiplication sign), and 3 tall round scoring markers (two in their own colour and one in their opponent's). Players take turns to place one stone of their own choice from their own supply onto the appropriate spaces. After all stones are placed, the scores are determined. Each player scores all the rows that are marked by the tall scoring stones of their color (one of which is placed by the opponent), and the score for each row is the outcome of the simple formula that players have created with the stones. Whoever gets the most points overall is the winner.<br/><br/>Adam Riese, in the title, refers to the great German mathematician Adam Ries, better known as Adam Riese (1492-1559), whose work contributed to the phasing out of the impractical Roman numerals in favour of the Arabic numerals that we currently use, and who made it his life's ambition to bring the basics of mathematics and algebra to all people. For that reason, he wrote his science books in German, rather than in Latin, the language of the scientific elite, and was one of the first to do so. The German phrase &quot;nach Adam Riese&quot; (according to Adam Riese) is still used as an expression in the German language to emphasize the obvious correctness of a result of simple arithmetic.<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the most ants when this occurs wins the game!<br/><br/>During your turn, you lay tiles to build the tunnel system your colony thrives in, or play special cards to harvest food and water so you can multiply faster than your opponents.

Following generations of tyrannical monarchy, the fledgling republic of Rome has become a political battleground for a few old and powerful families, each now vying for control and influence. As the city grows so do familial ambitions.<br/><br/>Change is inevitable and the Republic will soon fall, only to be replaced by an empire the likes of which the world has never seen... but a great empire needs an emperor of great conceit and wiles. With the rules, alliances, and strategies ever changing, it might not be who you think.<br/><br/>The Republic is a game of political intrigue and city building for three to six players. Although tile placement and economics are important considerations, the true focus of the game is on the politics. Each round, players are required to vote on laws that drastically alter the way the game is played, often affecting players in radically different ways. The winner of the game is usually the first player to collect a set amount of Imperium, a resource which can be earned through well-planned construction or lawmaking.<br/><br/>",

These scenarios can range from a simple brawl in the streets to a battle of wits between two masterminds, or anything else you can think of, making this much more than just another game of superhero combat.<br/><br/>As of November 2008, no further information on this game is available, and the homepage is no longer registered.

A clever and imaginative advertisement is fundamental to winning the game.<br/><br/>In the constant role-change between investor and inhabitant the players together create their own place of fantasy and strategy. Communication is very important! The end the election for the &quot;Citizen of Honor&quot; decides the win.

Orville is an 8 inch wide metal Octopus with flasher eyes. He balances on a center post in his seascape background. Danny Diver a metallic deep sea diver with a magnet embedded in his feet is suspended on a rubber string connected to a rubber ball. Treasure pieces in the form of gold balls, coins and anchors are scattered on the sea floor. The object is to pick up as much plunder as you can but if you get too close to Orville he spins around and, with a sickening metallic ping sound,  he grabs Danny.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starship is a fairly elaborate tactical simulation of a contact between two starships, each of which has an mission that is unknown to the other ship.<br/><br/>One player's ship is designated as the &quot;intruder&quot; and the other is the &quot;intercepter&quot; (sic). At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a mission. The possible missions vary depending on the player's role, intruder or intercepter.<br/><br/>The missions include reconnaissance, space exploration, piracy, raid, and patrol (under either a &quot;cold war&quot; status or active hostilities). Each mission provides conditions for a &quot;strategic victory&quot; (such as capturing the other vessel, making peaceful contact, etc.) and orders which, if violated, will prevent the player from gaining a &quot;command victory&quot; (e.g., a player might be ordered to not fire first). Victory points are given for strategic, command, and tactical victories (the latter being based on ship damage), and these are compared to see who won (if anyone, as a possible outcome is that neither player wins).<br/><br/>The game takes place in three-dimensional space, but the hex map is only used to show the relative positions of the ships. Markers placed on the map show a ship's vertical distance above or below the plane. A small map can be used because at the start of each turn the map is effectively rotated to put the Z-axis at the center along the line between the ships.<br/><br/>Players write down and execute their movement and firing orders simultaneously. The main concern in battle is preventing one's systems from overheating, which can occur due to acceleration/deceleration as well as combat.<br/><br/>While the game's envelope gives the publication year as 1976, all the components say 1975. It seems possible the envelope was added to the game after the first copies were produced.<br/><br/>",

Between 20 and 40 players (this is obviously a classroom game) participate in a simulation of real-world political struggles and conflicts that will raise fundamental issues about Central America and the role of the US in the region.<br/><br/>The game consists of four 15-minute periods of activity followed by a debriefing and policy discussion. Players are divided into five teams: the Guatemalan Government, the Army/Wealthy Class, the Guerrillas, the Peasants/Workers, and the US Government. An initial 15-minute Strategy Session within each team is followed by three 15-minute months of an electoral campaign involving discussions and negotiations among the teams.<br/><br/>Each team presents a brief Position Statement to start the action. Over the course of the campaign, each team may use means ranging from moral persuasion to military force in pursuit of its goals. The Army/Wealthy Class and the Guerrillas may opt to launch offensives. The Army can take over at any time, and they also have the option to &quot;silence&quot; members of any of the other Guatemalan teams. At the end, the team in power has the option of holding an election. All Guatemalans except silenced members and guerrillas are eligible to vote. Peasants/Workers have two votes; others have one. Guerrillas may vote by joining the Peasants.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a box that houses five card horses and riders: Tom, Dick and Harry &ndash; Gert and Daisy as well. The horses are attached to a spindle by cord that winds around the spindle when turned.  The horses are set up on the table, the handle turned, and the horses approach the winning post.  The speed of the horses depends on the way the cord winds, giving the chance of a different winner each time.  The game components are all cardboard or cord<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HISTORY: Ivan III the Great came to the throne of Muscovy as its Grand Prince on the death of his father Vasily (Basil) II in 1462. Through his cunning diplomacy and well-timed military actions he was responsible over the next 43 years for expanding the state of Muscovy enormously, conquering, annexing, or marrying into the lands of Rostov, Yaroslavl, Ryazan, Novgorod, Vyatka, Tver, and a substantial piece of Lithuania, while forming sturdy alliances with Pskov, the Crimean Tatars, Kazan, and Denmark, and at the same time having to deal with religious controversies and the periodic treacheries of various boyars and even of his own family. His son Vasily III and grandson Ivan IV (the Terrible) extended his remarkable gains even further. Essentially, Ivan single-handedly created what we now know as the Russian nation.<br/><br/>During most of his reign, his most powerful rival was Casimir IV, Grand Prince of Lithuania, although, despite much peripheral conflict, Muscovy and Lithuania did not go to all-out war until 1500, some eight years after Casimir&rsquo;s death.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME: In brief, Muscovy is trying to gain control of or subdue as many countries as possible before the big war with Lithuania, while maintaining high levels on the Ivan's Prestige, Russian Orthodox Church, and Victory Point charts. Some of these countries will become full allies, others will just be reduced so as not to cause serious trouble in Ivan&rsquo;s rear later on. Once the war with Lithuania begins, Muscovy will try to take over as much territory from Lithuania as he can. (Military success may possibly make up for any shortfalls in the three charts.) The Lithuanian player is simply trying to throw as many monkey wrenches as he can into Muscovy&rsquo;s plans by keeping up pressure on various fronts, military and geographical (the map) as well as political (the charts).<br/><br/>There is a 22-turn campaign game, and there are five shorter scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a beautiful old spin-and-move racing game from Milton Bradley that was first published in 1873, clearly to latch on to the fame of Jules Verne's novel Around the World in 80 Days, published in the same year. Unlike the voyage of Phineas Fogg, the game's track is strictly by sea.<br/><br/>Both the game equipment and rules are more complex than usual for a Victorian spin-and-move. The key difference is that winning does not mean who completing the 93-space spiral track the fastest, but doing so in the fewest days. In addition to spaces that move players forward and back, many of them apply time penalties. Each player has a card that tracks the number of days taken - one per pip on the five-space teetotum and one more for each penalty day. With absolutely perfect spins, it is possible to complete the journey in just 76 days, but this is highly unlikely!<br/><br/>Each player card has one metal arrow on dial that counts up to 50 days, and another on a smaller quarter-circle dial that tracks multiples of 50 to a pessimistic maximum of 450. On the back of each card is a &quot;Record Tablet&quot; with a space for the days taken for each stage from New York to: Equator, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn, Equator, San Francisco, Sandwich Islands, Hong Kong, Anjer, Mauritius, Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Equator and back to New York. The 1873 edition includes a global map showing the voyage track that is formed into a sleeve wrapped around the player cards.<br/><br/>",

He then deals the answers round, an equal number to each player; after this is done, he shuffles the pack of Heads, and placing the whole pack face downwards on the table, desires one of the players to take the uppermost and read aloud the name of the king, when he was born, died, etc. The president then asks the question from this little book, connected with the card turned up and whoever plays the proper answer, receives one counter from the pool; but if the answer is wrong, one counter must be paid to the pool. The next player then takes a Head and the same rule must be observed till all of them are read. When a player has forfeited all his counters, his remaining cards must be given to the player on his right hand. Should the pool become empty, each player must contribute one counter.<br/><br/>The game is decided in two ways, either by all but one player having forfeited their counters, or by all the heads having been turned up, in which case the remaining players are to reckon their counters, and he who has the greatest number wins the game. The winner takes the contents of the pool, and claims the office of president in the next game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the patent description:<br/>&quot;A multiple player word forming game is disclosed. The game uses a board, a cup and a plurality of cards. The cards are randomly transferred to and from the players. The players use the cards to form words. In the best mode, a game board defines a flat surface bounded by a peripheral wall upon which the cup freely travels about. A player begins a turn by spinning the cup, which eventually lands upon a card transfer space. The card transfer space dictates whether the player either draws or passes cards. The player transfers cards either from the deck or to a discard pile or to or from another player during a turn. Then the player attempts to spell a word by selecting cards in his hand and laying them face-up in front of him. Opponents may challenge the player's word. Any player who transfers all of his cards during a set becomes empty-handed and may not challenge words. The number of points earned by each player is dependent upon their performance both in forming words and in manipulating the number of cards in their hand. Preferably, a chance card multiplies the number of points a player can get. The set ending player's total score is doubled if the player ended the set with the chance card. Other player's scores are multiplied by zero if they held the chance card when an opponent ended the set.&quot;<br/><br/>In English, players use a cup shaped spinner that will move around the 5x5 board to determine card movement between the players. Players have to build words from their available cards and score points displayed on the cards.<br/><br/>",

The first part is played on the green part of the board, and it is a dice game. The sprint of the race is played on the  velodrome (blue) part of the board and uses the aleatory record.<br/><br/>An aleatory record (also known as &quot;multitrack record&quot;, &quot;magic record&quot; or &quot;puzzle record&quot;) is one that has some separate tracks cut in exact step with each other, so that upon lowering the needle the track is selected at random. On the game's record, the beginning of the narration is the same in all tracks, and just the result of the sprint changes. Each side has 10 different tracks with every cyclist having its chance to win, naturally. Every time you play the record you get a different result, so you'd better listen carefully who won the race!<br/><br/>",

The game is a race from the bottom of England to the top of the mainland of Scotland with progress made by the roll of a dice. Players have to abide by the instructions on the board which may aid or hinder progress.<br/><br/>The game is based on the Lands End to John O'Groats cycling competition which is not strictly a race but a time trial competition. The cyclist pictured on the game box is Sir Hubert Opperman (known as Oppy), considered as one of Australia greatest sporting heros in the 1920's and 30's. In 1934 is set a new record from Lands End to John O'Groats cutting more than 4 hours of the previous time.<br/><br/>At least 2 versions of the game box exist with a smaller rectangular box and a larger more square box. Both versions have the same game board layout and rules and a photo of Hubert Opperman on the game box, although the photos differ.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These are a couple of games, made in Singapore, which come together in the same box. The objectives of these two games are to inculcate good social behaviors and habits.<br/><br/>The eponymous Our Town Sparkles is a simple roll and move boardgame. The first player to get to the end of the track by exact count wins. The Social Responsibility Game has a circular track (in the sense that you go round and round the track) and players follow instructions on the board where their pieces land. There are Social Responsibility Quotient (SRQ) cards worth up to 20 SRQ points. Players can also earn and lose money depending on their social behavior. There are red penalty cards, drawn when a player lands on a 'Penalty Square', and green cards that a player picks up after landing on a 'Good Social Habit Square'. The game ends when a player runs out of money, or there are no more SRQ point cards. The player with the most SRQ points wins. A curious feature of the game is the role of Social Responsibility Judege (SRJ) - the SRJ administers all penalties, rewards or awards.<br/><br/>Graphics and illustrations by Rolling Art Pte Ltd.<br/>The year of publication is based on a discount coupon (for Popular Bookstore) that came with the game and was valid only till October 2005.<br/><br/>A version of this game, called Tampines Our Pride, combining the Social Responsibility Game and Tampines Our Pride Game (a roll-and-move game, like the Our Town Sparkles Game) was created for the Tampines Town Council. The differences are in the roll-and-move game (different track and events) and the Social Responsibility Game has some slightly different artwork - for example, there's a picture of the Tampines Changkat Community Club on the board. The board itself is made from cardboard and not as thick as the mounted board used in Our Town Sparkles.<br/><br/>",

Not only do you have to select and achieve your military objectives;  you also must maintain enough support for your campaign to keep resources flowing to you.  Will you support ground offensives? Build currently available aircraft or invest in technology? Order your fighters to stick close to the bombers  or sweep the sky for interceptors?  Attack immediately with what&rsquo;s in the air, or combine your fighter groups?  Defend each target as it&rsquo;s attacked or wait and launch a huge strike against one raid?

The game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 pawns per player. If you wish to play a shorter game you may choose fewer pawns to start with. If you wish to play a longer game you can start with more pawns. Players take turns rolling and moving their pawns around the board. The game includes a Bumpback die that can be rolled when you land on a space that is occupied by another player. The Bumpback die sends pawns back to their start position. Each space has six dots on it and the number rolled on the Bumpback die applies to any pawn resting on that numbered dot. The game can get very exciting with 4 players and 32 pawns on the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Our Great Game is a board game which simulates the game of Australian Rules Football.<br/><br/>The game was probably first published in the 1920s by the National Game Company. Several versions exist. Two versions are produced on a thick backing either 36cm x 36cm or 48 x 31cm. Common to all versions is the wording 'Our Great Game' on the inside board.  The box or board covers have various titles, including 'The National Football game', 'Our Great Game' or 'The Game of Football'. All but one version has the playing field angled across the board. Later copies were printed on thin card, boxed with the logo (but not on the board), including those published by Westley games.<br/><br/>As with the real form of the sport scores are kept for two teams (Yellow and Red team in the game) and 4 quarters are played with the duration decided by the players. The scores are 6 points for a goal (through the tall posts) and 1 point for a behind (number 31 in the game). Play starts by the sum of two dice. A disc (ball) is placed at that players feet that corresponds to the number. (i.e If 6 and 2 are rolled, player 8 Red team has the ball) If the player is in the defensive zone (closer half of their opponents goal) the next roll of the dice must be subtracted (i.e If player 8 (Red Team) rolls a 1 the next player to receive the ball is 8 - 1 = 7. If the red team is still in possession they keep rolling the dice but if the number turns it over to the yellow team then its their roll of the dice. When the player is forward of their center line, then they are deemed to be in attack. In this case instead of subtracting the dice roll they must add. (i.e Player 7 (Red Team) is forward of center so they roll say a 3 - the next player to receive the ball is 10 (7 + 3). Movement and scoring is done in this way. If a behind is scored the ball is placed on player 29 of the opposing team to kick out. The highest score after 4 quarters is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are 2 sets of cards - 1 with trivia questions you must answer and the other with items you must collect to ensure you look your best for your big night out!<br/> The 1st game involves getting yourself ready to go out - visits to the hairdressers, beauty salon and clothes shops.  Where you go for your preparations decides how good you will look for your night out - obviously you would rather go to a designer hairdresser than the &quot;Pudding Basin&quot; salon - likewise &quot;last weeks socks&quot; are not as desirable as &quot;straight off the catwalk&quot;!<br/> You travel around the board trying to pamper an primp yourself for your big night out.  This game ends and is won by the person who achieves the highest value of collected items.<br/> The second game takes place inside Peter Stringfellows' Club.  The object is to try and get next to your favourite star who is in the nightclub.  But be warned - there are many pitfalls!  You need to work your way past the stars, personal assistants and bodyguards or minders and your knowledge of celebrity trivia, drinks, dancing and music will be put to the test!<br/> The game ends when all the celebrity counters have been collected off the board - the person with the most celebrities around them is the winner!<br/><br/>This is a game intended for adults (suggested age is 18 and over)<br/><br/>",

COMET - Crete 1941 focuses on the action around two of the German objectives &ndash; Maleme airfield and Souda (COMET was the German codeword for the western assault).  The German player&rsquo;s aim is to obtain a foothold so that follow-on forces can land and take permanent control of the objectives.  The aim of the Allied player is to prevent the German reinforcements from landing and subsequently to defeat the assault forces.  The game is played in alternate turns each player being able to move playing pieces and make attacks against their opponent in succession.<br/><br/>",

Players wear numbered vests that match their cars and the cars are moved around the track as players choose their gear, speed, whether or not to risk corners, and manage their tires.  To a certain extent, players are also able to manage their cars' condition as they choose whether to drive conservatively, competitively, or press.  Pressing will increase a car's speed, while also increasing the chance of mechanical problems cropping up in the car.<br/><br/>Games last 5 - 24 hours, that's no joke, players schedule 24 hour games.  In &quot;short&quot; five-hour games, players race independently.  In 8-hour games, players drive in 2-man teams, and while &quot;driving&quot; players are not afforded food, drink, or bathroom breaks!

The players are the difference that decides the outcome.<br/><br/>The other chapters provide historical data to enrich the game. The original game has grown to be a one stop info source for the vessels of the ACW.

        "description": "Kate Smith, the famous singer and radio star from the 1940's (she also sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; at Philadelphia Flyer Hockey Games during the 1970's), is on the cover of this war-time game that reeks of patriotism. It was produced by Toy Creations Inc. of New York, and a signed dedication inside the box lid promised to donate all royalties to charity.<br/><br/>The game comes with 144 thick cardboard tiles: 48 states divided into four color-coded regions; 48 state capitols; 30 primary industries; 10 &quot;favorite sons&quot;; and 8 American flags (wild cards). There are four cardboard racks for holding each player's tiles (neatly designed to create red-and-white stripes when laid sideways in the box next to the blue-starred covered rules).<br/><br/>The tiles are shuffled face down on the table between the players. Each player draws a hand of 12 tiles to start. Each in turn then draws a tile and then discards a tile (the same or another). As in mah-jong, the player must announce the discard. The next player may pick up either the discard or a blind tile, but any player may claim the discard if it completes a partial set. He must reveal enough tiles to prove the set (e.g. two other states of the same color), thus revealing part of his strategy, but play then passes to the seizing player's left, with any in between missing their turns.<br/><br/>There are eight potential scoring combinations. The easiest, scoring 5, is a hand with three states in each of the four regions. The most difficult, scoring 30, requires three states each with their capitols, one of their industries and a favorite son. (Since some industries have only a single tile, and only 10 states have favorite sons, this can be very difficult indeed.) However, the 8 American flag tiles can be used as wild cards.<br/><br/>If a player needs information (such as a state's favorite son or industry), he may ask questions out loud, and pays 5 into a bonus pot for each question. As soon as a player completes a winning hand, he calls &quot;America&quot; and collects the value of the hand from each player as well as anything in the bonus pot. Cardboard discs in four colors are supplied, with their values to be assigned by the players.<br/><br/>",

However, charging bull moose, ferocious Grizzly bear, raging rivers, ice flows and frost bite (sic) await all those who quest for gold. Only the most experienced gold-panners emerged from the wilderness unscathed with gold in their pockets. These SOURDOUGHS were the toughest of the tough, and would literally risk an entire year's earnings on the flip of a card in a poker hand.<br/><br/>Would you be willing to bet everything you have on a bluff, or will you play it safe. This is a game of strategy, luck and skill, where the game dramatically changes with the personality of the players.<br/><br/>The easy to play game includes:<br/><br/>1 Board of Alaska (the game track is superimposed on a satellite picture)<br/>1 Deck of standard playing cards<br/>100 Silver and Gold coins (Poker Chips)<br/>100 $1 Dollar Bills<br/>6 Playing pieces<br/>1 Die (d6)<br/>27 Adventure cards (15 gold, 12 silver)<br/>6 I.O.U. Cards (4 gold, 2 silver)<br/>Rules<br/><br/>The game begins as a simple roll-and-move mechanic with various spaces giving rewards or penalties. There are also spaces that can trigger a round of poker between the players - winner take all monies bet. The players must accumulate wealth enough to buy transportation to the gold fields and then find the motherlode (Big Vein). Once there, a final hand of poker is played and the person at the mine must have $500,000 remaining after the hand.<br/><br/>The components are of high quality and it presents an interesting twist on a mundane night of poker.<br/><br/>",

Many of the games require additional components, be it a deck of cards, counters, a hand drawn board, or a combination of all the above.<br/><br/>A common mechanic used in many of the games has players roll a number of dice and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the results in order to reach a target number.<br/><br/>The included dice are black with white pips, with a square of bones runs along the perimeter of the faces.  4 of the dice have a standard configuration, while the fifth depicts a cartoon skull in place of the '6', and has additional meaning in some of the games.<br/><br/>The games presented in the book are:<br/><br/><br/>    Spider Legs<br/>    Pirate's Watch<br/>    Picking Through The Pumpkin Patch<br/>    Ghoul's Place<br/>    Haunted House<br/>    Ghost's Grave<br/>    Sitting on the Picket Fence<br/>    Broomsticks Up!<br/>    The Devil's Arithmetic<br/>    Skeletons in Your Closet<br/>    Witches' Brew<br/>    Lucky 13<br/>    Stomping Through The Graveyard<br/><br/><br/>Sequel:<br/><br/>    Spooky Scary Math Games<br/><br/><br/>",

It summarizes the many dice that have been found in sites of antiquity around the world.  The history then moves into various efforts to outlaw or tax gambling with dice.  There's also a chapter on dice cheating and another on modern dice.  The book is peppered with interesting stories and legends that revolve around dice.  If you ever wondered why many bone dice are hollow, it's explained.  If you want to know where the best museum exhibits of dice are, it's also covered.  The origins and evolution of many dice games are covered as well.<br/><br/>The book is heavily illustrated with drawings and photographs.<br/><br/>The copy I read was a complimentary copy published under the auspices of Dice &amp; Games Ltd and translated from the original Dutch.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This roll-and-move game features a winding yellow track on top of a green (grassy) background.  It's &quot;a jolly game for 2, 3, or 4 players.&quot; From the Powerhouse Museum &quot;The game is significant because it uses scenarios familiar to Australian country motorists during the first half of the twentieth century, when Australian roads were largely poor, gravel sections and steep hills made conditions treacherous, and cars were unreliable. The poor road conditions sometimes saw cars needing major repairs to axles and springs. Another very Australian obstacle on the road was a flock of sheep. The game reflects the poor state of the roads and the uncertainty of arriving at your destination without some mishap occurring. The aim of the game is to progress from the petrol station at the 'start' and travel to the gate marked 'home' via 100 squares numbered 1 to 100. Players move from the start to finish as quickly as possible by taking it in turns to throw the dice. Along the way various motoring obstacles, calamities, and misadventures including punctures, collisions, wrong turns, road blocks, flocks of sheep, bridges under repair, gravel on the road, broken springs, steep hills and axle trouble must be negotiated. These all require the player to miss throws or return to the start.<br/><br/>There is several versions of this game and several board sizes produced. The earliest version was registered in 1910 and most likely continued till the late 1930s or early 1940s. In the first version the designer cryptically placed the date of publishing in the number plate of the car closest to home.<br/><br/>",

His arm is pulled back behind a lever and the ball (marble) is placed on a stand in front of the bowlers right arm. Place the ten wooden pins on the ten markers. Now you aim and pull the trigger to release the bowlers arm and hopefully you've got yourself a strike! You score the game exactly the same as you would a real game.<br/><br/>",

The money has to be earned during the race.<br/><br/>You can do this by reaching different spaces on the racecourse or by playing one of the 50 action-cards at the right time, on top of throwing the right number on the die.<br/><br/>These cards allow weird actions, such as throwing a hay bale (come with the game- although in plastic...)in front of another cart or hauling it in with a lasso! For certain situations you can even earn a gold medal.<br/><br/>Winner is the player with the most points for the best kart, the most money, the most rounds in the lead, the best actions, for holding the gold medal etc.<br/><br/>There is also a variant to play as an elimination race, the last one staying upright is the winner !<br/><br/>",

When you open it, you see a hole in an insert cardboard mask, also depicting a parrot. Below this mask is a two-sided ramp with a plateau in the middle, where you notice a circle.<br/><br/>If you find one or more parrot-puzzle-piece(s) touching the circle, you can take them to complete the parrot on your mat.<br/>Pieces you already claimed before are put back in the box.<br/><br/>The completed parrot is worth different points, regarding how much different colours it contains (the more the better).<br/><br/>",

Examples include:<br/><br/>King of the Hill:  Roll the dice and move one pawn either the number of spaces shown on one die, or the total of the two dice.  Keep rolling and moving until a six is showing on either die, or doubles other than ones are rolled.<br/><br/>King of Battle:  Roll the dice.  Not only are you attempting to get your men to the goal line, but you are also shooting at them in an attempt to hinder their progress.  Wounded pawns are removed from the board, but can be re-introduced later.<br/><br/>Virtually Golfing:  Each track is a hole, and are played sequentially.  Roll the dice, and move your pawn the lower of the two numbers towards the goal.  Roll double ones and you hole out.  Any other doubles mean a swing and a miss.  Par is 5 for each hole, and the lowest score after all holes are played wins.<br/><br/>Game includes 12 pawns (6 of each color), two dice, rules, and a game board.  The rules and game board can also be downloaded and printed from the <a target='_blank' href=\"http://game.peopling.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://game.peopling.net/</a> website, and played using your own pawns and dice.<br/><br/>",

Next time your move has to start from there, such restricting your further moves.<br/>Aim of the game is to go for the bonus cherries counting points at the end.<br/>You can earn them being the LAST one harvesting a tree or by being the one with the most cherries and leaves harvested from a certain tree.<br/>As the trees have three different sizes, there are different amounts of bonus cherries to gain.<br/><br/>This is not a game for children, you have to twist your brain for the best moves !<br/><br/>",

Such games combine the visual appeal of miniatures gaming with aspects of role-playing games, allowing the players to control the actions of tough private eyes, seemingly-helpless dames, brave explorers, and all the rest.<br/><br/>The rules are made for simplicity and fast play. The game is meant for use with miniatures, but you can download a set of paper minis for free. All you have to provide is a few six-sided (d6) and ten-sided (d10) dice. The game is meant for two or more players, but it can be used for solo gaming as well.<br/><br/>",

The dealer goes first and flips over his top card from his pile onto the center of the table.  The other player flips over his top card onto the played card. If the player places on top of the pile a card with a number (Officers), he captures the pile unless his opponent can recapture them. Recapture is achieved by the player flipping over an Officer card in the amount of turns of the previous displayed numbered card. For example, if the player placed a &lsquo;Cop&rsquo; card which is numbered 3, then the opponent would have 3 turns to try and place on top of that card another numbered Officer card.  If he cannot recapture, his opponent gets to take all the cards in the pile.<br/><br/>Stop Thief consists of 32 cards.  There are 20 thief cards and 12 officer cards.

All scales can use the rules: micro to 1/35th. Large number of vehicles will use the main rules and the few specially for that scale. 15mm to 1/35 will probably be infantry combat with a few supporting vehicles. These will use the main rules, the few rules for the large figures and the matrix for receiving wounds. The matrix is designed so a man might be hit, wound and live to fight some more.

It was published in the Swiss gaming zine &quot;AHA&quot; two months later.<br/><br/>The game is somehow a derivate of Poker - with less cards, less combinations, but more interactions between the players.<br/><br/>The card deck consists of only 24 cards; 4 suits of 6 cards, numbered from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>There are only 3 combinations with a little strange names: <br/>- Wortklauberei (logomachy): 2 cards with numbers directly adjacent each other<br/>- Redeschwall (flood of words): 2 cards with the same numbers<br/>- Phasendreschen (to rant): 2 cards, 1 showing an &quot;1&quot;, the other a &quot;6&quot;<br/><br/>Each round is played with 4 cards per player; there is no possibility to exchange any of them. The first player, who thinks he has a good hand, starts the game by playing 1 card and any number of chips on it. This bet can be attacked by any player. The attacker can choose, if he wants to attack alone or with the help of another player. That means, that the original better can be forced to play against 2 players! An important restriction is, that a maximum of 3 cards can be used on each side, which would form 1 or 2 combinations.<br/><br/>The game ends after a preassigned time and the player with the most chips is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Godzilla waits outside the board.<br/><br/>The Godzilla player is dealt 6 cards showing the 6 colours of the weapons. He is immune against 4 of the 6 weapons and to document which ones, he secretly keeps 4 of the 6 cards.<br/><br/>During a turn, the Tokyo player must move 3 of his tokens by 1 space, the Godzilla player moves Godzilla by 2 spaces. Godzilla can destroy houses, but not Tokyo tokens or monster-immune houses.<br/><br/>The Tokyo player wins, if he can move one of his 2 tokens with a &quot;sharp&quot; weapon on the space where Godzilla is.

        "description": "This game uses a space exploration theme to teach players about number bases (binary, octal, decimal, etc.).  Each player starts play with a &quot;matrix card,&quot; a supply of plastic chips and a &quot;flight sheet&quot; for scoring.  Gameplay consists of five flights, each containing two phases: &quot;Blast Off&quot; and &quot;Establishing a Flight Path.&quot;  After five flights have been completed, the player with the highest total score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>During the &quot;Blast Off&quot; phase, the player voted mission commander draws and announces cards from a special deck of playing cards containing the standard four suits but only the numbers 1 through 9 (Ace is replaced by 1, and no face cards are included).  Players place chips on their matrix cards, Bingo-style, until every player has at least one complete row or column of chips.  At this point, players choose from among the 3- and 4-digit numbers filled in on their cards to establish &quot;flight numbers,&quot; which are written on their sheets.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Establishing a Flight Path&quot; phase, players are dealt cards from a second deck of &quot;base cards.&quot;  Some of these cards contain game-balancing bonuses and penalties which apply only when drawn by players holding specially-marked matrix cards.  The remaining base cards list a planet of the solar system, the number base that the planet represents in the game, and a list of digits which are valid in the planet's base.  For example, Mercury represents binary (base 2), so only digits 0 and 1 are allowed.  The player replaces all illegal digits in his or her flight number with zeroes, then converts the resulting number to decimal using a special base conversion wheel included with the game (except for landings on Pluto, which already represents base 10 and requires no conversion).  The final result is added to his or her score.<br/><br/>The game includes two sets of rules -- &quot;Brief Instructions&quot; which get players started in just two pages, and a 10-page &quot;Guide Book&quot; which includes more detailed instructions, game variations and mathematical background information.  The game was filed as U.S. Patent 3,618,952.<br/><br/>",

It is a challenging game about the confrontation between the police and the protesters during a fictive demonstration.<br/><br/>The game includes 15 demonstrator tokens and 4 leaders of protest marches on one side; 10 policemen, 10 anti-demo troups, 3 police cars, 3 anti-demo cars and 1 water gun on the police side, but only some of those tokens are placed on the board, when the game begins:<br/><br/>- the 4 protest march leaders start from all 4 corners of the board, 8 demonstrators are place anywhere on the board.<br/>- the 10 policemen and the 3 police cars are placed on the 3 police headquarters.<br/><br/>Each turn, 1-4 demonstrators enter play - if there are tokens left outside the board (demonstrators can be arrested in prison for 2 turns). The anti-demo tokens enter play, when the demonstrators have succeeded to win some morale points and the Morale Index has reached a value of 9.<br/><br/>The so called &quot;Morale index&quot; is a scale from 1-15 points. The game starts with a Morale index of 6. Successful actions (winning fights, repulsements of opponents, finished protest marches, imprisonments and others) change the index by 1 or 2 points.<br/><br/>The game can be won either by eliminating all opponents or when the Morale index reaches 15 (demonstrators victory) or 0 (police victory).<br/><br/>",

In turn, a player rolls the dice and advances one&rsquo;s pawn along the path the total value of the dice. A player may stop short to conduct business in a city. Some spaces between cities force a player to draw a chance card. Some routes between cities only allow one-way traffic.

There are also a number of (initially) neutral minor powers countries such as Spain, Belgium, Ireland etc etc. Each country has two key properties: Military strength and Political strength. The territory held and political points value of a country determine its military strength.<br/><br/>One of the key features to the game is ability to influence a minor power using your political points. If enough are used then there is a chance the minor power will be come friendly (allowing passage through their territory) or even allied (allowing use of their military).<br/><br/>Like Diplomacy, orders are written down and executed simultaneously. In 1930! the orders include everything from movement to application of political power. Conflicts that arise are resolved according the combat strength of the forces involved with a simple percentage roll. In between turns it's time to make and break alliances with the other major power players.<br/><br/>From the game designer:<br/><br/>'1930! is my attempt to produce a game that retains a set of simple rules and the personal interaction found with Diplomacy, but extends the game play to include aircraft, the political or economic power of countries and many more neutral countries.

Players have contrasting sets of tiles, and each turn they place tiles on the board or move existing tiles, four at a time, on squares of their own color.  Each set includes one X and five each of N (which can be rotated to form a Z), E (which can also be used as M or W), and O.  The object is to get an X to the last rank, or to capture the opponent's X by surrounding it.  Moves can only be made adjacent to previously placed tiles, and all of a player's tiles must form words diagonally at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>(Description from Nov. 1984 GAMES Magazine, p. 33)<br/><br/>",

Player camps, weapon directory, and storehouses are also on the board.<br/><br/>Up to 2 Mammoth herds (4 at the start of the game) enter the board every turn and travel along their trails.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 20 tribesmen and 5 x 5 weapons of 5 different types. The well armed tribesmen go out to hunt some mammoths, which are needed to feed the population. The weapons used to kill a mammoth are removed from the game, that is they represent more a consumable arrow than an bow, that can be used all the time.<br/><br/>Every second turn, it is checked to see how many tribesmen can be fed  (with half a mammoth per man).  Men who are not fed are flipped over and all their abilities are halved for the next turn. Subsequent non-feeding will result in the elimination of the men.<br/><br/>While hunting mammoths is relatively easy at the start of the game, it gets harder and harder, because players must manufacture new weapons and pitfalls and thus only some of the men can be used for hunting.<br/><br/>The game ends, when the first player has lost all tribesmen. Winner is the player who has the most surviving men on the board at that time.<br/><br/>",

The player then traces a path ('reaction') through as many pieces of the opposing colour as he can. A path is a continuous line passing from a piece of the player's colour to one of his opponent's. Once the path is established, the opponent's piece is flipped over and the piece rotated in such a way that at least one of the lines on it joins up to the path. If there are now no lines on the new piece that point to another opposing piece, or if the flipped piece is a Burn-out, the 'reaction' is over, and the player's turn ends.<br/><br/>The objective is for each player to have the most pieces showing his colour at the end of the game. If there are an equal number of each, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tumble-Numbers is an interesting dice game similar to Shut the Box except that instead of a box with fixed numbers (1 to 9), it uses a set of ten red six-sided dice with non-standard numbers (as high as 10 and including blanks) to generate the numbers that have to be eliminated by rolling a pair of ordinary green six-sided dice.<br/><br/>The blanks can be used to represent any positive number but must always be removed together with another red die not showing a blank.<br/><br/>A player keeps on rolling the green dice and removing red dice that add up to the total on the green dice at each turn. When the player cannot do this, they take the sum on the remaining red dice as their penalty score (blanks count 20 points). When the player manages to get rid of all red dice, they subtract 10 points.<br/><br/>When a player reaches 100 points or more, he/she has to drop out. The last surviving player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

For a while a 5th Columnist spy may escape detection and cause much damage and many heartaches&hellip; but from the days of old... No 5th Columnist Spy has yet escaped.&quot; Excerpted from the rules section A Word About Spies by James Boyle - Former Special Investigator.<br/><br/>5th Column  Spy Hunter is a point to point movement game for 2 teams.  Players act as either the 5th Columnists or the Spy Hunters and move around a map of the United States based on Official Number Code from the Decoder (a spinner).  The spinner provides moves based on a separate &quot;code&quot; list for 5th Columnists and Spy Hunters.  5th Columnists score points for ending their moves on designated spots (for example: air naval or army bases to steal documents), the Spy Hunters get points based on failures by the 5th Columnists.   The winner is the first team to 15 points.    Both teams are expected to record their routes so that a second game can be played to crown the &quot;Champion Spy Hunter&quot;.  The teams exchange routes and take turns listing the order of the states they entered and their capitols.  Points are awarded for correct answers. Mistakes cost a team their turn.  The Champion is the team with the highest score.<br/><br/>",

With the game My House children can playfully tell how things are organized at their home. It&rsquo;s all about telling about their experiences from home. Becoming aware of the arrangement of things at home and thus familiar in their own house.<br/><br/>It is interesting and fun to hear for the parents, hearing their children talk about how they think about the arrangements at home. The children for their part become very resourceful in substantiating their ideas about the location of the objects. But My House offers even more. The older children can play memory games with it or call forth all their linguistic skills in a game of &ldquo;Linguistic Happy Families&rdquo;. Thus the game co-develops along with the development of the linguistic skills of the child. Ranging from story telling up to in their own words finding synonyms to complete their set of &ldquo;Happy Families&rdquo;!<br/><br/>",

The object is for one player to establish a World Empire and eliminate all other players from the game.<br/><br/>Parts include 6 pawns representing each country, 20 Markers for each player, 48 resource cards and 48 armament cards with values of 1 or 5 representing Air, Navy and Army units.<br/><br/>Players start in the start box and move from point to point around the world map, landing on free territories (gaining a resource card), colonies (placing a marker to control and taking resources) and blockades (if owned then 2 resources are owned to the controlling player).  Resources can be converted into armaments, 3 resources for 1 randomly drawn armament.  Once all colonies are taken a colonial war begins and as players land on opposing colonies they may choose an armament class and announce an attack. The player with the highest strength wins the battle and takes the colony.  If he loses he loses resources equal to the colonies values.<br/><br/>The final stage is total war when all armaments are gone.  The first player back to start challenges the other players to war and compares values for all armaments, winner take all.  Last man standing wins.<br/><br/>",

The playing pieces are colored pottery balls which are moved from hole to hole - some holes are larger than the balls - should a die roll or an event (explained in the box's lid) bring your piece to such a hole, your ball falls through, rolls to a chute on the lower end of the board and you will have to start again.

I wanted a simple, flexible game - and I wanted to add in Construction - something never in SFB. So here we are.<br/><br/>'I thought about several ways to add realism to the game, and while that goal is laudable, it does not always render a usable game. While some things are in the game for realism, others are in it just for fun. One goal was realistic movement of some sort. I have tried to give a CONSISTENT movement system, at least.<br/><br/>'I would like to have fighters as much as the next guy, but my sense of reality would not allow them to dominate Space Warfare as much as some would prefer.'<br/><br/>",

As such, it is an excellent gateway game for younger players on the verge of discovering more involved games like Settlers and Tikal.<br/><br/>The game is designed in the low-cost tradition of (James Ernest's company), with pennies, nickels and dimes used for treasures, and tokens from other games used as the game pieces, and with a great amount of humor in the cards.<br/><br/>Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard is currently in playtesting and is expected to be available in 2008.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This trivia game is based on a popular radio quiz show from the late fifties, aired on the National Broadcasting Corporation of Iceland. The game comes with ten envelopes (categories) containing 20 questions each, with categories like arithmetic puzzles, literature, who advertises like this?, the bible, old Norse religion and more. Also included is a booklet with the answers.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play the game, Double or nothing (where you get 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 points if you answer the five questions from chosen categorie correctly, or zero points if you answer incorrectly). Another way is Who knows what? where you mix the questions and you get 2 points for correctly answered questions (1 point if you answer a question someone else failed to answer).<br/><br/>",
