If a player cannot move they take one of the played chips.<br/><br/>When a player has occupied enough photo spaces phase two begins on the second board; the player ending phase one gets to transfer their markers to this board, which block the other players.

Advanced Premier Soccer upgrades and expands the game system developed in the original Premier Soccer by including factors such as shot location, man marking, individual defensive ratings, professional fouls, and revised durability and fatigue rules for league play.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of the manager - choosing a tactical formation and playing style, selecting a lineup, determining marking priorities, making changes in personnel and/or tactics, and dealing with the issues of player discipline and fatigue. The basic unit of play is the possession - defined as a period of extended control in the opponent's half of the pitch that may result in a shot. A typical game features 30-40 possessions and takes about 40-45 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>All team and player ratings are based on actual statistics from the 2019-2020 EPL season. Team sets for 2020-2021 will be made available following the conclusion of the current season.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The historic estate of Mansfield Park has fallen into ruin. Franny Bertram, a descendant of some of Jane Austen&rsquo;s most beloved characters, has turned a few rooms into a bed and breakfast and is trying to restore more of it, but she needs your help to find small antiques she can sell to fund the project.<br/><br/>Search the rooms of the mansion to find the valuable items and collector edition books before a hotel developer makes it up the walkway and inside the house. If she does, she&rsquo;ll take over the mortgage and tear the mansion down. Then Franny&rsquo;s dream will be no more. There is a secret passage which could help in the search, but you have to find it first.<br/><br/>You get to make choices in how you conduct your search. The item tiles are scattered throughout the rooms face down, and their location changes each time you play. With a list of what you need, you can roll the dice to move throughout the mansion, picking up items when you find them. Each time you look at an item in a room, whether you collect it or not, you&rsquo;ll draw an action card which may take you to a different place, and that may change your strategy for your next turn. The action card may help the hotel developer move forward to the front door, and that puts the pressure on you and the other players to complete the search before she makes it inside.<br/><br/>Since you also need to put together a set of collectible books, all of which are piled in the attic, it&rsquo;s your choice when to go there instead of rolling the dice. And then there is the location to the secret passage. Each player has cards that offer clues, but you&rsquo;ll need to know who has what to narrow down the possibilities. If you are the first to work out where it is, you&rsquo;ll be able to move freely throughout the house, but you&rsquo;ll have to decide if it&rsquo;s worth it to spend your turn on the search for it, or if your time is better spent in other choices. Players who are familiar with Jane Austen&rsquo;s books will recognize characters and situations, but no knowledge of them is required to play. It&rsquo;s all about the search!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

His close associates include his trusty mechanic, his unethical doctor, and his gold-digging girlfriend.  And there are also side-betting spectators.<br/><br/>Franco earns money and glory from completing jumps. The other players earn money from the cards they play. Every player has their own agenda. So the game can change from a co-op game to a screw-your-neighbor game in a second.<br/><br/>Each player has their own deck of cards and play cards during a turn. The cards might earn you money, or affect the next jump, or help/harm another player. Some cards are LD cards and laid down and then have benefits for every turn. The most important card is a players Hold card. It is placed face down and is a player's end-game strategy. Are you betting on Franco landing a great jump, or trying to profit from his fiery death.<br/><br/>Every few turns/seasons Franco will perform a jump. It could be a luck jump by rolling a die, or a skill (dexterity) jump by sliding his vehicle token up a ramp and onto a target. Bad jump landings result in damage to Franco's vehicle and injuries to himself. His mechanic will need money to repair Franco's vehicles, and his doctor will try to double bill for any hospital visits.<br/><br/>Each turn is a season of the year. So a game could last all 40 turns/seasons. However, the game could end abruptly if Franco dies or is forced into retirement because of excessive injuries. When the game ends, the player with the most money or glory wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each round, a new programme card is revealed, clutter and energy is distributed across the three locations and the Vocational Guidance Councillor is moved.  Players then allocate their action cubes to clear the clutter and collect energy cubes in order to obtain new programme cards.<br/><br/>The programme cards contain a mixture of VP, common actions as unique actions.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to have the most VP by the end of the last round.

The little mice quickly climb the apple tree to hide. In order to get to the ripe apples in the meadow, the mice climb up and down: The little climbing mice hang onto each other and rappel down the tree. But who is the fastest and grabs the most apples from the meadow?<br/><br/>Two dice depicting different colors are rolled in turns. The main task for the players is to pay attention and react fast by finding the matching color combination of double-colored mice tokens by putting their hands on them.<br/><br/>Whoever gets the right mice first may take them - and either hang them on his branch of the large apple tree in the center of the table or - if they don't match in color - keep them for a later turn.<br/><br/>When a wind icon is rolled, the mice on the branches may be re-sorted and can be put together with the same colored sides, hanging from a branch in a domino-like fashion. If the chain of mice reaches 5 tokens, they get to the ground and players may pick up an apple token. The player, who gets to 2 apples first, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Or will the NVA player triumph and hold their ground? Get ready to re-live or re-write history in the battle for Hamburger Hill!<br/><br/>The Battle for Hamburger Hill lasts 11 turn-pair game-days (with a night turn each game-day also).  Each turn, players alternate moving and attacking each other&rsquo;s forces on the game map, which is divided into hexes.  Combat can include small arms firefights between adjacent units or fire missions that target hexes with artillery, airstrikes, helicopter gunships and mortars.<br/><br/>At the end of each combat phase, once all fire combat is complete, adjacent units may conduct close quarters combat (CQC) to decide which force will occupy contested hexes.  Each game-day, after all movement and combat is completed, both sides draw cards to determine special actions for the future day&rsquo;s turns and may get reinforcements according to card events, history and the roll of the dice.<br/><br/>As the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) player, your goal is to hold hill 937 and hill 916.  If, at the end of the last turn, the U.S. player does not control both of the summit hexes, you have won.<br/><br/>As the Allied player, your goal is to control both summit hexes at the same time.  Whenever the U.S. player has accomplished this at the end of a game-day, the game ends with a U.S. victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flip &amp; Phrase is a game that allows children to use Chinese words flexibly, make sentences by association, and makeup stories creatively. In the first half of the game, children do not need to write, so they can focus on their creation. The second half is &quot;writing&quot;, using associative memory, writing out keywords, and recreating the scene of the story. In the game, there are 200 frequently used words from the Chinese primary school vocabulary list. The vocabulary list requires children to master the dictation of the words and be proficient in basic Chinese words. Using the form of &quot;oral composition&quot; and &quot;extract keywords&quot;, the game lowered the difficulty of the composition and raise the children's learning interest in this subject. The game also makes full use of the means of &quot;listening, speaking, reading, and writing&quot;, combined with a real-time feedback mechanism that children can fully use their imagination to break the shackles of thinking and master the skills of composition.<br/><br/>Game setup: Each player takes a player map and its corresponding scoreboard, a pencil, and a sheet of notepaper. Each player draws 5 word cards. Hold them in the hand and don't let other players see them<br/><br/>To start the game: Reverse the hourglass for timekeeping. All players have 30 seconds to prepare an impressive story with the 5 words on the card. After 30 seconds, all players place the cards face down on their map from left to right, starting with the first player and telling each player's story in a clockwise manner. To end the game: When all players have finished telling the story, invert the hourglass and wait 30 seconds, then write down the other players' words in order on a sheet of notepaper. When one player has written all the words can be remembered, place the paper in the center of the table and turn the hourglass around again. The other players have another 30 seconds to continue to recall and record words.<br/><br/>After all players submit their answers, the words will be revealed by the order of storytelling. Players will give their scoring marks to the player who first turned in the notepaper with all words in a correct manner. 1 point for each correct word (correct order and spelling), 2 points for each player who memorizes 5 words from your story, 2 points for each score mark earned from another player, and -2 points for the player's own score mark. The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If a player picks up a poem card that doesn't match any keywords, the player should put all the poem cards taken from this round in front of them with the frontside of the cards facing up.

        "description": "In this game, at least four players try to get rid of their hand cards by discarding either the matching color, number or symbol on the discard pile.  But since everyone wants to win, there is of course the possibility of repeatedly putting a spoke in your fellow player's wheel. Action cards can be used to attack them and prevent someone else from playing their last card first.<br/><br/>Up to this point, the principle sounds familiar to many, but in &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot; (German for &quot;DOUBLE OR NOTHING&quot;), some things work a little differently: For example, it is possible to defend yourself by deflecting the attack on a fellow player, who in turn has the same option to defend himself. In this way, it can hit anyone and you can never be sure to reach the goal without being disturbed.<br/><br/>Constant action is therefore the order of the day and does not end with the cards. Those who are willing to take risks can, sometimes under full physical effort, gain an advantage in this card game. Through interactive, cognitive or coordinated tasks it is possible to prevent the drawing of penalty cards. However, one should then think twice, because whoever fails the task receives double the penalty. The deal is: &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The optional Winter Map expansion provides a winterised rendition of the map and covers the Soviet counterattacks in December 1942 and January 1943.<br/><br/>The factory was the third of the large industrial sites in the north of Stalingrad - the other two being the Red October and Red Barricades factories which are covered in MMP's Red Factories module.<br/><br/>The area is the usual city terrain with rubble, debris and shellholes amongst factories and buildings, together with gullies leading down to the banks of the Volga.  The Germans will be trying to blast stubborn Soviet defenders from their positions using flamethrowers, demolition charges and close combat.  Meanwhile the defenders will be fortifying locations, setting up crossfire, using the sewers to infiltrate behind the attackers and generally be as difficult to root out as their real-life counterparts were.<br/><br/>As a module, it is not a complete game in itself but requires ownership of the Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rulebook and Beyond Valor module as a minimum.<br/><br/>There are 11 scenarios ranging from small engagements to larger battles which will enable players to experience the struggle whilst attempting to capture (or defend) a significant industrial complex.  The Winter Map expansion adds a further 4 scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Many leaders believe it is because carnage germs and infections allow for rapid mutations and the easy spread of disease.  The Zombie outbreaks over the centuries are misreported or are simply covered up.<br/><br/>Lock 'n Load Tactical: Zombie The Final Enemy brings Lock 'n Load Tactical system into the world of Zombie horror and a different type of conflict.<br/><br/>The scenarios are designed around various missions and will have a different style.  Many objectives will be straightforward. Other times, you will be searching for food, weapons, and events that will change your mission objectives.  many times you will be going into situations where you do not know what or who you may find.<br/><br/>We have designed a Zombie Outbreak system allowing you to play with your current Lock 'n Load Tactical games and have the possibility of having a Zombie breakout during your battles.  The scenarios span from World War II all the way to the modern-day.<br/><br/>The game includes eight scenarios with a high degree of re-playability.

The fateful night the sisters were offered a bargain with Yurei, the others readily accepted the power they would gain but Hikari stood firm and refused, knowing the bargain would never be anything but a yolk around their necks and a pathway to evil. The bargain was offered only to the whole coven so her sisters murdered her and accepted the bargain as three Yuta. Hikari is still powerfully linked to them so her sisters raised her as a Kairai and forced her to obey their commands but sometimes she finds the will to fight free.<br/><br/>Hikari&rsquo;s unique connection to the Yuta means she offers even more flexibility to the Yuta box and, importantly she can use the Chaos Bolt Ki Feat and automatically win the opposed Ki test since she is Soulless. Choosing when to throw off her undead nature and assert control is key to making the best use of her profile.<br/><br/>Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can be literal, creative, or quirky in your interpretation of any given theme&mdash;as long as you delight the &quot;Fashion Judge,&quot; who awards style points to each winning outfit. Think of it as &ldquo;Apples to Apples&rdquo; with a fashion twist!<br/><br/>What if you don&rsquo;t have the pieces in your wardrobe needed to pull off a great outfit? Play one of your &ldquo;Fashion Emergency&rdquo; cards to improve your collection or bamboozle other players. But be careful&mdash;timing is everything!<br/><br/>Fashion 101 was invented in 2017 by 10-year-old Elsa Brandt. In 2020, her mom began working with her to bring the game to fruition as a way to combat boredom and create a fun learning experience during the Covid lockdown in Seattle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The full box consist of 500 cards with 160 Topic cards, 320 Reason cards, and 20 Debater and Peer cards.<br/><br/>Each round the Debater and Peer cards are handed out to randomly identify who is debater 1 and who is debater 2. All other players will become the Jury of Peers and select the argument that feel is best. Both debaters will receive the same Topic such as &quot;Hot Dogs Are A Sandwich&quot;. Each debater will then receive a Reason such as &quot;Penguins&quot;. The debater will have 90 seconds to explain why the Topic, &quot;Hot Dogs Are A Sandwich&quot; because of, such as, or like the Reason, &quot;Penguins&quot;. After each debater goes the Jury of Peers will award a single point to the player's argument they felt was best.

Yes, because it meets the common definition of what is considered a bird. It has feathers, a beak, and lays eggs. Though they can not fly, which is a common trait of a bird, penguins are still birds. The common definition of a sandwich is an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread, in this case a bun, with meat, the hotdog, cheese or other filling between them. Therefore, if a penguin is still a bird, a hotdog is a sandwich if it meets the definition even if it doesn&rsquo;t appear to.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Life in the Yukon is simple, so long as hiking up mountains, canoeing down rivers, fishing from frozen lakes, mining gold, hunting bears, moose and deer is simple; which never seems to be the case for the average frontiersman or frontierswoman. Use your survival skills to do all of these things while maintaining the strength and stamina necessary to keep going. With enough perseverance and instinct, the frontiersman or frontierswoman can eventually build a homestead to live the simple life.<br/><br/>The Great Outdoors is a 2 to 6 player euro/strategy game that places you in the heart of the Yukon as a highly capable Frontiersman/Frontierswoman that specializes in their own trade or profession. You will venture out into the unforgiving wilderness to perform actions such as gold mining, cutting down lumber, hunting, fishing, trapping, trading, building, and above all, resting. Actions that involve collecting resources, such as gold mining, trapping, hunting, fishing, and logging, use dice to determine the size of the gold nugget you panned for, or the animal that got caught in your trap, or the one you shot, or the size of the fish you caught, or the amount of quality timber you cut down. Your dice rolls can be improved by purchasing or building tools, boats, and weapons. Use the fruits of your labor (resources) to build up your homestead with various amenities like sheds, wells, windmills, water wheels, and much, much more. Your victory points are determined by the value of your homestead and the crafts you collected throughout the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

This... is... Bodyslam!<br/><br/>Bodyslam is a wrestling-themed dexterity game, where players compete by attempting to knock wrestling figures out of a ring. At the start of the game, each of the four countries&mdash;France, Japan, Mexico, and the USA&mdash;receives a special scoring card to determine how points are awarded for their wrestlers at the end of the game. Each country's team has four of a uniquely-shaped wrestling mask, representing that country's wrestlers&mdash;these are all kept together in a bag. Set up the game by flipping over the box, placing the wrestling mat on top, and placing three random wrestling figures onto the mat.<br/><br/>To play, players choose one wrestler at random out of the bag and throw, drop, toss, fling, or launch it at the other wrestlers already in the ring. Knock off other wrestlers to add them to your pile, but be careful&mdash;if the piece you throw falls off as well, everything that fell returns to the bag. Signature Move cards restrict the way players can throw; successfully pull off a signature move to get another turn right away.<br/><br/>Once a player has thrown and collected any wrestlers that fell out of the ring, they make sure there are at least 3 wrestlers in the ring; if not, they draw more from the bag to place however they want into the ring. Then the next player goes, and the round continues until there are no more wrestlers in a bag. Each wrestler a player has in their pile is worth one point, with extra points awarded based on how their wrestlers relate to each country's score card. The winner of a round earns a belt; earn two belts to win!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fighting Class! Battle of Aircraft Carriers is a war game that reproduces &quot;Aircraft Carrier Battles&quot; by fleets centered on aircraft carriers that occurred in the Pacific War.<br/><br/>Each unit is one warship or one aircraft squadron (nine aircrafts), however, the damage is in units of one aircraft. Bombs and torpedoes are also handled in units of one shot. 4 hours per turn (aircraft operation unit is 1 hour). In addition to the &quot;Operation Maps&quot; (90 nautical miles per hex) used for fleet movement and search, there is also the &quot;Tactical Map&quot; that is rare in Japanese aircraft carrier battle board wargames.<br/><br/>Operation Maps are prepared for each of the Japanese and Allied forces, and it is divided by &quot;partition&quot; so that the opponent's fleet is not known where it is (this is called &quot;double blind system&quot;). In order to search for this invisible enemy fleet, each aircraft squadron unit is flown from the aircraft carrier or base to search for enemies.<br/><br/>At this time, there was a problem in the conventional aircraft carrier wargames that &quot;if you tell the opponent where you are looking for, your whereabouts will be revealed&quot;. Therefore, in order to avoid this problem, the &quot;fan-shaped search&quot; that was carried out in the actual carrier battle could not be done, and the players had to carry out a search pattern different from the actual one. However, in &quot;Fighting Class! Battle of Aircraft Carriers&quot;, you can search for enemies without exposing your whereabouts by using cards together. As a result, it has become possible to carry out search enemies based on the same thoughts as in actual aircraft carrier battles, such as &quot;fan-shaped search&quot;.<br/><br/>In addition, a system that reproduces the &quot;resources invested (in the case of aircraft carrier battles, the number of aircraft for searching and the time spent on searching) and the amount and accuracy of information that can be detected are proportional&quot; as shown in the &quot;search theory&quot; has also been introduced into the search rules. Players are also required to have the skill to guess &quot;which is the main force including the aircraft carrier&quot; by combining the fragmentary information that can be obtained gradually.<br/><br/>On the Tactical Map, aircraft squadron units move hexes to attack warship units. At this time, the possibility of success depends on the direction in which the warship unit is attacked (whether it is from the front, the rear, the diagonal front, or the diagonal rear). Therefore, the attacking team will charge the tactical map toward the warship unit aiming at the &quot;deadly shooting point (attacking direction)&quot;.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the warship unit not only shoots down attacking aircraft with anti-aircraft fire, but also incorporates &quot;turning&quot; (a movement that changes the course of the ship), which has not been taken up in previous aircraft carrier battle games, into the rules. This allows the warship unit to turn around from the &quot;deadly firing point&quot; that the attacking team is aiming for and avoid the attack. In this way, the Allied Forces shoot down the attacking team with &quot;powerful anti-aircraft fire&quot;, while the Imperial Japanese Navy dodges the enemy's attacks by turning with &quot;skillful ship maneuvering&quot;. It is now possible to reproduce different ways of fighting, similar to the actual aircraft carrier battles.<br/><br/>",

As players explore the world more tiles will be uncovered, new locations will be unlocked for interaction, and enemies will make themselves known. After a player or party has finished taking their actions, they will be required to draw and resolve an event card, which will impact the player or group and how they develop their characters.<br/><br/>Wardens<br/>The Wardens are the leader characters that players will take charge of through the course of a Chronicle or a Chronicle Campaign.

        "description": "On August 3rd, 1914, Germany declared war on France. German armies poured into France and Belgium. Britain protested, then declared war on Germany on August 4th. The famous British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France and marched into Belgium on August 21st. They halted on the Cond&eacute; Canal at Mons to defend against what they thought was a small German force to their north. Once that was brushed aside, they planned to turn east and roll up the German flank. However, they actually faced the entire German 1. Armee. The next morning, in a thick mist, German cavalry patrols stumbled into outlying British pickets. So began the long fight between the British and Germans in The Great War.<br/><br/>The Battle of Mons (August 23rd-24th, 1914) looms large in the legends of the British Army. Here the plucky BEF with their &ldquo;rifle fire like machine guns&rdquo; gave the dastardly Germans a bloody nose, or so the story goes. The Germans for their part were well satisfied. In their view, they met the &ldquo;English,&rdquo; pushed them back, then chased them all the way to the Marne. Which view is correct?<br/><br/>Mons had surprises for both armies. They expected a battle like in The Boer War or the Franco-Prussian War. Mons did have maneuver and even cavalry charges, but hard lessons were learned.<br/><br/>Mons, 1914: The Mad Minute is the second game in the Rifle and Spade Series, first used in Gallipoli, 1915: Churchill&rsquo;s Greatest Gamble. The series rules have been completely overhauled to speed play and ease learning. Key charts have been simplified and rules that were rarely used have been dropped, resulting in faster and smoother games. Gallipoli can be played with the 2.0 rules with some short upgrade instructions and a few replacement charts.<br/><br/>Mons is a big game. Two maps show the length of the Cond&eacute; Canal. The 1,500 counters have every unit from the BEF and the German 1. Armee. Units are half-battalions and batteries with some platoon pickets. Mons has many scenarios: three training scenarios, the full two-map historical scenario, several smaller one-map scenarios, and a set of very interesting hypothetical meeting engagements. In the meeting engagement scenarios, the armies enter gradually, led by their cavalry divisions. A wild period of maneuver follows as the cavalry and j&auml;gers attempt to sneak past the enemy until the infantry show up, and the battle is joined in earnest. There are rules for cavalry charges, including debacles and impetuous charges. The command problems of the BEF and German 1. Armee are shown, although scenario variants give players all the freedom they could want.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Two 22x34 maps<br/>5 1/2 standard counter sheets (280 each), total 1,540 counters.<br/>35+ Small wooden colored cubes<br/>One version 2.0 series Rule Book<br/>One Game Book<br/>One Setup Book<br/>Numerous Charts and Tables, Player Aids, Army Organization Trees, and Status Displays<br/>Planning Maps<br/>Dice<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Potions &amp; Puppies is a light weight game that has a unique twist on resource management and press your luck. It's a 1 to 5 player cooperative game where all players must work together to share resources to discover recipes to a variety of potions to help you get past tasks inside the tower. Each puppy has a unique magic ability to help their friends but must balance using their own abilities with using those same crystals for potions.<br/><br/>Puppies have a variety of actions to take on their turn ranging from gathering crystals from a shared stash to discovering or brewing potion recipes. Each puppy also has two unique abilities - a lesser ability can be used an unlimited number of times per game as well as a once per game ultimate ability that will make the puppy's player mat flip and their remaining ability will cost more gems to use for the rest of the game. Discovering potions is vital to puppies' success, and each time a player wants to discover a potion they must use three colors of crystal from in front of them that do not match any other current recipe before flipping over the top potion card. Potions can be be brewed by using the same crystals as are on the recipe card by placing them onto the puppies' current tile. When all potions have been brewed, the puppies can move forward.<br/><br/>Brewing a potion that is labelled on the modular tile they are currently standing on allows the group to move forward and one step closer to escape. They also have unique abilities such as rearranging recipes, looking at the potion deck to see what is coming up next, and digging up many crystals at once. At the end of each turn the active player can draw up to two crystals from the blind bag to replenish their resources - but each time a black crystal is drawn the guardian moves one space closer to the puppies and the crystal goes back into the bag. If the puppies brew all the potions on the final tile before the guardian lands on their current space - they win! Otherwise, it's game over.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sewers &amp; Slimebeasts is written by Abe Crow and published in NorthCoast Roleplaying (Issue 1 - 1987).  A two-page comic introduces the game, which is then presented in six pages of rules including the maze-like playing board and a tracking sheet.<br/><br/>The game is played by two opponents, one controlling the &quot;human&quot; team and one controlling the &quot;slimebeast&quot; team.  A third player acts as a &quot;referee&quot; to enforce the rules, make decisions in uncertain cases, and track locations and events that are unknown to one team.  Additionally, the &quot;referee&quot; controls a team of &quot;bums&quot; - hapless humans that should be rescued by the human team or used as egg incubators by the slimebeast team (bums are, effectively, an in-game resource).<br/><br/>Prior to play, each player receives 100 points to use to build their team.  Humans and slimebeasts have variable powers with varying costs; every human and every slimebeast can some varying powers, depending on player desires.<br/><br/>During play, each player maintains their own map that shows locations and events known to them (generally, all their own team and those of the opposing team they have discovered).  The play pieces are straight pins with colored tape to indicate status/condition/etc.  The referee simultaneously maintains a &quot;master&quot; map that is considered authoritative in the event of a discrepancy with a player map.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns following an established sequence.  In each turn, humans move first and slimebeasts move second; combat then occurs wherever humans and slimebeasts have encountered each other.  Combat uses a fairly complex series of processes that obviously are heavily derived from Dungeons & Dragons mechanics.<br/><br/>The game ends when the humans eliminate the slimebeasts or the slimebeasts eliminate the humans.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It can be played cooperatively or in &quot;hero team vs. villain&quot; mode.<br/>Players take turns singing verses which must contain a rhyme determined by the villain. They should try to include as many of the items depicted on open cards on the table, because they can take any of these item cards as coins. At the end of a round, the group can buy extra skills and lives for the coins they collected. <br/>The villain's role is to make the hero team's task more difficult, because when a player fails to create and sing a musical verse within time and conditions, the hero loses a life, and if the team loses all their lives, the villain wins. There are 3 levels of difficulty of the rhyme cards, so the Villain needs to manage the difficulty of the rhymes in their hand and analyze which ones are more difficult with the elements that are currently on the table. If after three rounds the hero team still has lives, there is one last round. In this final round each player must use all the elements on the table, and the sung stanza needs to be a provocation to the Villain. If a player succeeds, the villain is hit. If the Villain receives a number of blows equal to their life, the hero team wins.<br/><br/>",

Each team is rated for offense and defense based on points scored and yielded &ndash; including all defensive and special team scoring. Ultimately, the only statistic that matters is point differential &ndash; and that's what counts in D20 Football.<br/><br/>Game play is simple: for each quarter, the players use a virtual 20-sided die chit-pull system and consult the results chart. If no overtime, that's just four &quot;die rolls&quot; per scheduled game per player. Luck isn't everything, though. Players choose an offensive and defensive focus for each quarter. The player who does the better job of outwitting his opponent can affect the results in his favor to a considerable degree.<br/><br/>So, can 2020&rsquo;s Tampa Bay Bucs go all the way in your replay? Maybe not &ndash; there are four slightly better teams in their way.<br/><br/>Every 2020 NFL team is rated, and a specially designed scoresheet makes the game flow smoothly. The game can be played solo or two-player. It&rsquo;s highly portable, easy to play, and is sure to &ldquo;fire up&rdquo; football fans of all ages.<br/><br/>",

With corporations and security companies concerned only with the elites, the people pleads for world government action. The president of the world is then forced to finance mercenary giant robot pilots, paying for each head of the giant monsters.<br/><br/>Project HUNTER is a minimalist solo print-n-play roll-n-write game in which you drive a giant robot in order to defeat the giant monsters that have invaded the earth. You will need to print these sheets and get some dice, pencils and eraser.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>The main objective of this game is to defeat at least one monster of each of the six species. However, you must survive until then! Your giant robot is destroyed if its chassis is completely damaged or if it overheats, which will cause an explosion. You also lose if you run out of money after a hunt.<br/><br/>Hunting Kaijus<br/>To face a monster you first roll three dice. Each die will indicate a monster avaliable. Of these three you will have to choose one to face. If you don't want to face any, you will have to spend $ 50 on the maintenance of your robot to be able to wait another day. So you can roll the three dice again. You start the game with $ 300 in cash (write it down).<br/><br/>Combat<br/>As soon as you choose a monster to face the combat starts. The combat is separeted between the turn of the monster and the turn of the robot. The monster always starts first.<br/><br/>Monster Turn<br/>On the Monster turn you must roll a number of dice equal to the Monster Attack value. Each die is treated individually and allocated somewhere in the robot sheet. Each die that landed at number 6 causes 1 Overheat. Each result less than 6 can be absorbed in some armor of the robot. See in the diagram of the robot that there are squares for you to write down the result of the die you want to allocate there. You can place it wherever you want as long as there are already any other results linked to it, it must obey the rule (see below). If you cannot allocate any die in the sheet this die becomes 1 damage in the Chassis.<br/><br/>Armor&rsquo;s Rules<br/>In the diagram of the robot you will find several blank boxes to record the result of a die. Each of these boxes has an arrow. If the arrow is facing the box, it means that it has some rule. Each symbol on the black circle will indicate he rule.<br/><br/>Robot Turn<br/>On the Robot's turn you will be able to choose if you want to attack normal with your weapons or if you want to overload the shots. If you choose to attack normal, roll the dice equal to the number of weapons you have (initially you only have one weapon). Add up all the results of all the dice and write down the amount of damage the monster has taken. If the monster loses all hit points, it is defeated (see below).<br/>If you choose to do an overloaded attack, you will roll twice the attack dice but will cause 1 point of Overheating.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Undaunted, he headed for the second man to render aid... but collapsed before reaching him.<br/>Marez received the division's first Distinguished Service Cross for her bravery.<br/><br/>ASL Comp: St Lo 44 &ndash; Hill 192 is a detailed ASL Comp variant module that follows the American 2nd Infantry Division as it attacks Hill 192 on the road to St. Lo.

Every caliber from field gun to the terrible 210mm crashed down, lifted long enough for the stunned Frenchmen to rise to the surface, then began all over again. By midday, 80,000 heavy shells had fallen in an area of barely half a square mile. Trees were blasted to matchwood; platoon-sized bunkers had simply vanished; many Frenchmen were buried alive not once but repeatedly. Nevertheless, as the German assault teams advanced to infiltrate the French lines, almost half of Driant&rsquo;s men had survived. Isolated, unsupported, blown out of their own fortifications, the Chasseurs fought on.<br/><br/>This expansion contains special rules (Attack &agrave; Outrance...), geo boards and counters for the French (inc.

The variety and possibilities in this game means that no two trenches will ever be the same. Cards will provide Power Points, which is the ultimate decider of who wins in the game, and is provided by infantry cards and bolstered by support cards. Special cards can provide great advantages, if the trench can support their particular placement rules.<br/><br/>Part face-off and part-puzzle, all the cards have their own placement peculiarities, which will need to be thought about. Players will need to decide which place, out of the available places, would the card be best, to facilitate future potential card draws. This is ultimately the crux of the game, the construction of the trench through quick and simple puzzle-solving.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough, then the Buildings and Bombs expansion allows players to construct buildings in their trenches and utilise No Man's Land, adorning it with dangerous defences.<br/><br/>Good Luck, General.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The dark forests, forced-marches, and human waves of a low-morale, poorly led force ... face the crack troops of a still ascendant Germany. The horror of a two-front war is upon the Kaiser&rsquo;s best leaders and there is only one way out: total victory.<br/><br/>Historians know the battle took place near Allenstein. However, General Erich Ludendorff named it after Tannenberg, some 30 klicks to the west, to avenge the defeat of the Teutonic Knights at the earlier battle of the same name that occurred in 1410.<br/><br/>The world was a far different place during the summer of 1914. Germany was on the offensive on the Western Front. Trench warfare had yet to set in. Crowds, out in the streets welcomed war with open arms, and cheers. A massive Russian Army headed for East Prussia, and eventually, the heart of Germany ... in an unprecedented invasion&mdash;ten Russian Armies in all could be mobilized. Hindenburg was called out of retirement to manage the German side along with Ludendorff. Despite overwhelming numerical advantages by the enemy, the battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army, and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov.<br/><br/>A series of follow-up battles (1st Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well, and kept the Russians off-balance until the spring of 1915. The Battle of Tannenberg set the stage for the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes a week later, where the reinforced German Eighth Army now faced only the Russian First Army and forced it back over the prewar border. <br/>Russian forces would not again march on German soil until the end of World War II.<br/> Ownership of GWASL I is required. <br/>Includes eight scenarios, two sheets of counters, all the geo boards needed to play the scenarios, folio, and special rules.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Opening Blow &ndash; Stalluponen, East Prussia, August 17th 1914<br/>     Disaster at Gumbinnen - Gumbinnen, East Prussia 1914<br/>     Fresh Blood &ndash; Usdau, East Prussia, August 27th 1914<br/>     Samsonov&rsquo;s End &ndash; Frogenau, East Prussia, August 29th 1914<br/>     The Kerensky Offensive &ndash; Lvov, Ukraine, July 1st 1917<br/>     Sacrifice for Joffre &ndash; Vilna, Russia, March 20th 1916<br/>     Action Along the Wilja &ndash; Vileyka, Russia, September 22nd 1915<br/>     East of Sosenka &ndash; East of Sosenka, Russia, September 24th 1915<br/><br/><br/>",

With a rogue-lite campaign system, players take on the roles of survivors of humans, trying to get by after the downfall of civilization, a result of the Great Robot Uprising.<br/><br/>After a large meteor crashes into the planet, the Robot overlords start to experience communication issues and many start to malfunction. Humans dubbed this event as &quot;The Glitch&quot; and see it as their opportunity to take back their planet. This is no easy task, as the human population is just a fraction of what it once was, and communication is a challenge. Although the Robots have been greatly disrupted, they are still, in every sense of the word, a great threat.<br/><br/>Players create survivors, find a vehicle, and traverse the countryside, gathering resources, finding food and weapons, and learning skills to complete mission objectives. In doing so, players characters will level up, gain notoriety, and try to find and destroy the machines central core.<br/><br/>The game features an action-point based system - These points double as action points and your characters health. As your character takes wounds, they lose action points. Run out of action points, and you collapse.<br/><br/>Combat/skill checks are performed by rolling dice, bolstered by stats and gained skills.<br/><br/>Similar to the great tactical, turn-based video games of the 90s, such as X-Com and Jagged Alliance, players can spend extra action points to perform actions at higher levels of competency, being able to aim, change their stances, or focus on specific tasks.<br/><br/>Enemies are controlled by the game's AI  - each enemy has its own order of operations reactionary programming. Players face these enemies in campaign missions, as well as random encounters.<br/><br/>The world unfolds in front of the players - as they track their progress on the overworld map. Moving costs food and fuel, and dangers lurk around every corner. The map is be randomly generated each game, and players will find settlements, points of interest and missions in different areas every game.<br/><br/>Players never control more than 6 survivors at a time, and can be played with 1-6 players cooperatively, splitting up the survivors among players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Ruth, the protagonist of the story, is one of these people, a young and foreign widow looking for ways to support her mother-in-law, picking ears in a plantation in the region, because according to Jewish law on behalf the hungry, it was justice for the owners of land to leave the ears that fell to the ground for people in need to collect for themselves. The game is based on chapter 2 from the book of Ruth of the Bible, telling the story of this notorious young foreigner who, because of her faithfulness and dedication, marries the owner of the plantation and joins the genealogical line of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>A game that, through its mechanics, can be used to address issues such as: social equality, self-preservation, respect for women, the value of loyalty, work, and the correct authority that cares and leads people in a loving way.<br/><br/>In summary, each player plays with 3 pieces that move like queens, but instead of capturing the opponent's pieces, they capture the squares of the board, collecting them to sum points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>(Description by the designer)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Italy upended their Central Powers allies by entering the war on the side of the Allies in May of 1915, following secret negotiations. Italy fought mostly against Austria-Hungary along the northern border, including high up in the now-Italian Alps and along the Isonzo river. The war was initially a failure for Italy despite being numerically superior to Austria-Hungary. The Italian army repeatedly attacked Austria, making little progress and suffering heavy losses, and then being routed in 1917 by a German-Austrian counteroffensive after Russia left the war allowing the Central Powers to move reinforcements to the Italian Front from the Eastern Front. In October 1918, as civil unrest increased in Austria-Hungary, the Italians attacked again. The Austrian army broke, and the Italians drove deep into Austrian territory. Fighting ended on 3 November 1918.<br/><br/>Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Hill 383 - Plava, Italy, June 20th 1915<br/>     City of Violets - Gorizia, Italy, May 5h 1915<br/>     First Rush - Podgorica, Italy, July 2nd 1915<br/>     Isonzo Marsch - Tolmino, Italy, September 10th 1917<br/>     Tolmino Bridgehead - Tolmino, Italy, September 12th 1917<br/>     Cappuccio Wood - Mount San Michele, Italy, July 25th 1915<br/>     Vrtojba - Vrtojba, Italy, November 4th 1916<br/>     On To Monte Majur - Monte Majur, Italy, October 25th 1917<br/><br/><br/>",

Scenarios in this module cover the Battle of Sarikamish, as well as the campaigns in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and OF COURSE &hellip; Gallippoli, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the Conflict. <br/>The Dardanelles campaign was fought on Turkish soil, as the ANZAC tried to create a passage through to the Black Sea. Gallipoli was the brainchild of Winston Churchill, and was a bitter failure. After massive hardship, ANZAC soldiers were withdrawn, having failed in most cases to even get off the beaches. Russia also invaded Turkish territory, in the north. Following the collapse of the Tsar&rsquo;s government, the Turks swept north and entered Russian territory proper. By the Russian surrender in the Spring of 1918, the Turkish forces had taken Baku on the Caspian Sea.<br/><br/>Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     The Bergmann Offensive - Caucasus Front, November 7th 1914<br/>     Stand At Pine Ridge - Pine Ridge, Gallipoli Peninsula, April 25th 1915<br/>     Plugge's Point - Z Beach, Geba Tabe, Gallipoli Peninsula, April 25th 1915<br/>     Valley Of Death - Kereves Dere, Gallipoli Peninsula, June 21st 1915<br/>     Forgotten Arabs - Gallipoli Peninsula, August 6th 1915<br/>     Achi Baba Nulla - Cape Helles, Gallipoli Peninsula, June 4th 1915<br/>     Fir Tree Spur - Cape Helles, Gallipoli Peninsula, May 8th 1915<br/>     Australian Achilles - Gallipoli Peninsula, May 19th 1915<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Robot Tricks two-player teams each control a robot moving on a checkerboard, attempting to retrieve treasure chests.<br/><br/>The robots are controlled via card play, specifically by playing Spades. However, no bidding takes place and the number of tricks won is irrelevant. Instead, the winner of a trick chooses one of the four cards in it and moves their team's robot accordingly: the suit determines the direction and the rank determines how many spaces it moves, according to a table. Court cards allow the robot to be rotated.<br/><br/>However, if a trick contains an ace the winner chooses one of the other cards and moves the opposing team's robot instead.<br/><br/>When a robot moves to one of its treasures exactly it retrieves it. Opposing treasures and robots may be pushed.<br/><br/>The game can be set up with two treasures per team for a short game or four each for a long game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When war broke out in August of 1914, the news was met by wildly cheering crowds in Australia. <br/>Following some months of mobilization, the AIF exited the country in November 1914 and, after several delays due to the presence of German naval vessels in the Indian Ocean, arrived in Egypt. Their first task was to defend the Suez Canal. In early 1915, however, it was decided to carry out an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula with the goal of opening up a second front and securing the passage of the Dardanelles. The Australians and New Zealanders, grouped together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), went ashore on 25 April 1915 and for the next eight months the Anzacs, alongside their British, French and other allies, fought a costly and ultimately unsuccessful campaign against the Turks. The force was evacuated from the peninsula in December 1915 and returned to Egypt, where the AIF was expanded. In early 1916 it was decided that the infantry divisions would be sent to France, where they took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front. Most of the light horse units remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, carrying out further operations against the Turks in Egypt and Palestine.<br/><br/>Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Driven Out - Mont St. Quentin, France, July 23rd 1916<br/>     The O.G.

        "description": "Following Bulgaria&rsquo;s entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers on October 14th, 1915, the death knell for Serbia and Romania began to sound. <br/>The Bulgarian Summer of 1915 saw the Entente attempt to win the hearts and support of Bulgaria. It was all for naught, as the country entered the war aligned with Germany and her allies. And mobilization soon began, followed by a declaration of war against Serbia. Around this time the Germans and Austro-Hungarians had penetrated into Serbia on a front that was 140 kilometers in length and 15 kilometers in depth. In order to close the 90-kilometer gap between the flanks of the German 11th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army Mackensen ordered the latter to invade the valley of the river Morava and take Ni&scaron; and Aleksinac. In accordance with this order the Bulgarians attacked along the entire front of their 1st Army, quickly driving out the Serbian units and taking control of the border area. Following this easy success however the speed of the advance was much reduced due to the bad weather, which turned roads into mud, and a dense fog that sometimes limited visibility to 50 meters. In addition the stiffening Serbian resistance and the mountainous character of the area caused the flanks of the 1st Army to halt before the fortresses of Pirot and Zajecar. The exploits of the Bulgarian 2nd Army in Macedonia convinced the Serbians that the danger of complete encirclement is high and forced them to begin withdrawing their forces to Kosovo while offering stiff but not desperate resistance to Army Group Mackensen. In November, while the decisive Serbian defeat unfolded, the French attempted to exert pressure on the Bulgarian 2nd Army but were soon forced to halt their attempts to drive north.<br/><br/>Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Pristina Halt - Pristina, Serbia, November 24th 1915<br/>     Fall Back To Lerin - Gornichevo, Salonika Front, September 14th 1916<br/>     The Dobrich Epopee (Epic) - Southern Dobruja, Romania, September 5th 1916<br/>     A Good Field - Dobro Pole, Serbia, September 15th 1918<br/>     Chegan Operation - Banitsa, Serbia, August 17 1916<br/>     Contested Prophet - Sabac, Serbia, September 30th 1916<br/>     Rakija Courage - Gnjilane, Serbia, December 2nd 1915<br/>     Show Of Force - Serbia, August 18 1916<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Serbia was blamed for the start of World War I following the assassination of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Yet the Serbs would enjoy the first Allied victory of the war, after they drove the Austro-Hungarians out of the town of Sabac on 19 August 1914. Before they could, however, civilians were rounded up in the town and massacred. On the 5 October 1914, Austria launched their offensive against Serbia. The Serbian Army, weakened by Typhus, couldn&rsquo;t hold out and the capital, Belgrade, was evacuated on the 9th. Two days later, Bulgaria declared war on Serbia, hoping to annex the Serb possession of Macedonia. By the 24th, the Bulgarians had driven a wedge between the Serb army and the Allied armies in Greece attempting to come to their aid. The Serbs fought with courage, but found their army critically low on ammunition stocks. With defeat staring them in the face, over 200,000 soldiers and civilians fled over the rugged mountains and into Albania. Many were evacuated by sea to the island of Corfu, in what would stand as the world&rsquo;s largest evacuation by sea until the &lsquo;miracle at Dunkirk&rsquo; in 1940. Surviving Serbian soldiers made their way to Greece, and remained in uniform to serve in the Yugoslav Division of Serbs, Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins and Slovenes. When Bulgaria surrendered on 30 September 1918, Serb, Yugoslav, French and British forces united to drive the Austrians and Germans out of Serbia.<br/><br/>Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Delay Before The Drina - Podrinje, Serbia, August 12th 1914<br/>     Kosaningrad - Tekeris, Serbia, August 15th 1914<br/>     Mounted Clash - Tekeris, Serbia, August 16th 1914<br/>     In The Valley Of Jadar - Sabac, Serbia, August 16th 1914<br/>     Back Across The Drina - Cer, Serbia, August 17th 1914<br/>     The Liberation Of Sabac - Sabac, Serbia, August 24th 1914<br/>     The Youngest Corporal - Cer, Serbia, August 14th 1914<br/>     The Battle of Kolubara - Serbia, November 18th 1914<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Romania entered the war in August of 1916, on the Allied side, in an attempt to seize the prize: Transylvania. <br/>This region in Austria-Hungary had a Romanian ethnic majority but was under Hungarian control at the time. <br/>Despite initial successes, the combined forces of Russia and Romania suffered several defeats, and by the end of 1916 only Moldavia remained under Allied control. After several defensive victories in 1917, with different groups competing for authority over the Russian troops in Romania in the aftermath of the October Revolution, Romania signed an armistice at Focani. On November 10, 1918, just one day before the German armistice and when all the other Central Powers had already capitulated, Romania re-entered the war. By then, about 220,000 Romanian soldiers had been killed. Despite their small size, the Germans worried about the prospect of Romania entering the war, Hindenburg writing: &ldquo;It is certain that so relatively small a state as Romania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment.&rdquo; Romanian soldiers would fight in battles that would be compared with some of the most brutal campaigns on the Western Front at little-known places like the Bran-C&acirc;mpulung area, the Carpathains, and the Prahova Valley.<br/><br/>Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Across The Argesch - Argeș River, Romania, December 3rd 1916<br/>     Stand At Brasso - Brass&oacute;, Transylvania, October 8th 1916<br/>     Sweep Of Cinghinarele Island - Cinghinarele Island, Bulgaria, October 8th 1916<br/>      Erich and August - Silistra, Bulgaria, September 4th 1916<br/>     Turkey Shooters - Amuzaca, Romania, September 24th 1916<br/>     Der Alte Mann - Kohalom, Romania, October 2nd 1916<br/>     Saving Moldavia - Oituz, Romania, August 12th 1917<br/>     Predeal Ordeal - Predeal,Romania, October 23rd 1916<br/><br/><br/>",

The game is both a co-op and a lone fighter game. For up to 6 players. Despite the complex scope of WoU, the game is also designed to be beginner-friendly. Of course, you will also encounter zombies in the post-apocalypse.<br/><br/>What is WORLDS of UNIVERSE all about?<br/>The story begins in WORLDS of UNIVERSE Teil 1: Dawn of Terra [Part I] on our earth in the year [now]. The only difference is that the fate of the earth was already determined in the 50s. That is with a fallout, justified by a desperate attempt to stop a pandemic. A foreign virus-transformed 60 percent of the population into zombie-like mutant beings.<br/><br/>The humans, as they are, destroyed themselves afterward. The chaos in the new world brings WoU to a post-apocalyptic journey in which players can play their own hero. Due to the disintegration from 1950 onwards, the world in WoU contains both old-fashioned things that have stood still in their time, as well as technical achievements over the years of development.<br/><br/>While some live in the Outland, empires, and elites in their futuristic districts are forging new plans for power over a new unified world. On the other hand, two camps are striving for only one thing; to survive. This is exactly where the players come into play. You are allowed to join one of the camps, do jobs, and advance the main story. And as expected in a zombie survival board game, actually also zombie, mutants, something ugly ?<br/>Note: This game has no connection through the Covid19 events, the content was written by me three years ago. This is pure coincidence.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the most compelling theaters in the history of warfare was the Middle East during the Great War. From late 1914 until mid-1915, the British defend the Suez Canal, taking on various Turkish and Senussi irregulars in their attempts to capture or damage the canal, to block it. A major victory was earned in August 1916, at Rumani, near the coast. This success relieved pressure on the Suez Canal. The British then began to construct a railway and supply roads along the coast. Operations continued against the Senussi in the Western Desert. This part of the campaign saw Sollum shelled by German U-Boats, and an Emergency Squadron of the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division sent to strengthen the British post there. Both Sollum and Sidi Barrani were subjected to Arab raids. The 2nd New Zealand Rifle Brigade, one company of 15th Sikhs, a detachment of the Bikanir Camel Corps, an Egyptian Army Machine Gun Section and an armoured train garrisoned by 1/10th Ghurka Rifles, moved on 21 December 1915 to hold the Alexandria - Debaa railway, and to patrol to the Moghara oasis against more Senussi incursions. Battles would rage back and forth at places like Matruh, Sidi Barrani, made famous later, when the Desert Fox Erwin Rommel enter the annals of military history. The Senussi were finally defeated with the use of modern weaponry including armored cars, aircraft and artillery.<br/><br/>Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once the greatest kingdom in the Northern Reach of Trederra, the Kharkodan Monarchy was overthrown in a revolution by its legions of workers and peasants. The King was killed and his armies scattered. His fortress reduced to rubble under the heavy bombardment of the people's arsenal. Escaping into the mountain cities of Tredesh, the Queen and her Royal Guard now reside in exile. Biding their time and growing their numbers, the Monarchy has begun their campaign to crush the rebellious Kharkarus Konfederacy that drove them out and reclaim their rightful place on the throne. Trained in deadly close quarters fighting, the Monarchy Royal Guard go to war wielding twin ceremonial blades that can slice a man in two with one swift stroke. Decked out in the heavy furs and ornate armor of the Queen's Regiment, the Royal Guard are second to none in discipline, battle prowess, and sheer ruthlessness. They will stop at nothing to crush their enemies. For the Crown!<br/><br/>This Mission Pack introduces the Trederran Monarchy Royal Guard. Though few in numbers, they are perhaps the most highly trained and deadly warriors in all of Trederra. With 4 new Missions that form a short story campaign, a new Objective Room Map Tile, a host of new cards including Threats, Artifacts, Enemy Traits, Darkness, and more, as well as the Enemy Record Sheet, Rules, and 6 Monarchy Royal Guard models, this Mission Pack is an exciting addition to the lore of Trederra and your games of Shadows of Brimstone.<br/><br/>PAINTER'S NOTE: the Trederran Monarchy are their own faction of Trederra. For players that paint their figures, the Trederran Monarchy have their own paint scheme and are independent of existing Trederran Legionnaire color schemes from the previously released Trederra Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion.<br/><br/>- Description from the Publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "#DIDTHEMISSION: Meant to be played by a group of people, each round presents a mission and you must complete the round! ​ This social card game is simple to play. It's recommended to play with a group of people, preferably 3 or more players. Each round, one player picks a phrase card and a mission card. The player will use that phrase to earn points by way of one of the various mission cards. Some mission cards will prompt other players to win the round.<br/><br/>CONCEPT: The game revolves around one phrase created by two words picked at random. Once the phrase is chosen the player uses that phrase with a mission card for the round. Each mission has it's own point system and you play to 18 points. In a nutshell, it's a modern rendition of play on words for adults.<br/><br/>RISKY: Be prepared to earn points by way of prank calls, social media, being creative with play on words, or drinking something. Before you know it this will be the best card game for you and your friends that is played at every party or game night!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You must explore the procedurally generated game board to find The Wound, defeat the powerful Dimensional Wound Guardian, and escape with your lives.<br/><br/>PROCEDURIALL GENERATED BOARD:<br/><br/>The dungeon board is comprised of 16 room tiles which are shuffled before each game ensuring the dungeon is never the same twice. Explore the dungeon rooms by flipping room tiles as you enter them. But beware, powerful roaming monsters lurk in the depths that will take cunning and cooperation to defeat.<br/><br/>CHESS LIKE COMBAT:<br/><br/>Combat is played on separate combat board where strategic movement is as important as your party configuration and character abilities. An easy to learn but challenging to master combat system the requires you to position and respond your enemies every move.<br/><br/>BUILD YOUR PARTY:<br/><br/>Play as one of the 7 initially playable characters or one of dozens of unlockable and secret characters who will join your ranks as the emergent story mechanics unfolds an epic tale. <br/>Select your party members to take advantage of synergist team work and fill your party roles to fit your playstyle. Level up your characters to unlock new powers and gain access to elite gear and armor sets.<br/><br/>1 VS MANY OR TEAM BASED:<br/><br/>Play as The summoner, a powerful character who controls the monster and elite demons in the dungeon, as well as the Summoner Demon: A customizable character who levels up like party members and who has access to the Sigil Board. The Summoner draws from the energies party members spend in the dungeon. Each time a powerful ability is used, or a wrong choice is made, The Summoner places tiles on The Sigil Board to unlock abilities, treasure, and powerful demons.<br/><br/>THE FORBIDDEN SIGIL APP:<br/><br/>Use the optional, but highly recommended app, to play &lsquo;Dungeon Scenarios.&rsquo; Dramatic video of Octavia, an ancient and morally ambiguous demon queen who will present you with multiple choice scenarios which connect to each other and result in a cascading story tree that makes each one of your decision significant and consequential. Each Dungeon Scenario has at least three possible courses of action with many more possibly results. Literally tens of thousands of combinations can unfold which guarantees every game is different than the last.<br/><br/>PLAY A ONE OFF OR A SERIES:<br/><br/>Play a quick One Off game with friends or commit to a series, where more powerful gear can be unlocked and the sprawling story unfolds across several chapters.<br/> SEMI LEGACY GAMEPLAY:<br/><br/>Unlock town upgrades which will allow you to use new characters, over 200 pieces of unique gear or even learn how to tame the monsters of the dungeon to use in combat.<br/>Explore cascading story trees which plays out vastly differently each game based on your decisions.   <br/>All legacy mechanics are non-destructive and reset whenever you want them to.<br/><br/>Yes, the heroes are long dead, but perhaps it is monsters that are needed now.

Of these men and women, 59,544 members of the CEF died during the war, 51,748 of them as a result of enemy action. The CEF served with distinction at Neuve-Chappelle, and at 2nd Ypres in 1915 they made a legendary stand to hold the line during the first gas attack on the Western Front. Posted to the Somme in September 1916, the CEF fought the sanguinary battles for Mouquet Farm and Courcelette, taking the 2nd German line that was an objective of the failed 1 July attack. Posted back to Arras in 1917 the CEF finally cracked the defenses of Vimy Ridge in a brilliant attack, which had defied both the French and British for the past 2 years. Posted back to the Ypres area in the fall of 1917, the CEF was tasked with taking Passchendaele in October and November, in appalling weather.   This was the final push to that town that had been an objective since August. In abysmal weather the CEF finally captured it in November 1917.  In 1918 the CEF was in the forefront of the great offensive that ground down the German army in the west, in fact, the 2nd Canadian division advanced past Mons on 11 November 1918 to finish the war where it had begun for the BEF 4 long years ago.<br/><br/>All of these battles were hard fought affairs, where no quarter was asked or given.

        "description": "VIERSTRAAT RIDGE, BELGIUM, 2 SEPTEMBER 1918: The Hindenburg Line was originally organized for defense toward the end of the year 1916, and work was continuous in its preparation for a long time thereafter. <br/>The Siegfried Line makes full use, along extended stretches, of the front line of defense accorded by the Bellicourt-St. Quentin Canal. <br/>The strength of these defenses, increased as it is by inundated areas, provided extensive mutual flanking fire support. Good artillery observation rendered the line very strong. The Siegfried Line is considered to create the most favorable conditions for a stubborn defense by a minimum garrison. It is therefore adapated to the requirements of obstinate close combat.<br/><br/>Ownership of GWASL 1 and GWASL 3 are required, as is your ASL-RB. <br/>All the other combat counters needed to play are provided in the form of 648 color die-cut counters.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/>Vierstraat, Belgium<br/><br/>     Captains and Majors, August 31st 1918<br/>     The Vierstraat Switch, August 31st 1918<br/>     Blind Courage, August 31st 1918<br/>     Redoubt Farm, September 1st 1918<br/>     Riposte In Lead, September 1st 1918<br/>     Back To Chinese Trench, September 1st 1918<br/>     Handiwork Of The Devil, September 1st 1918<br/>     Vierstraat Ridge, September 1st 1918<br/><br/><br/>",

The game makes use of a custom set of 36 numbered cards, six jokers, and two dice. The cards are first dealt evenly to all of the players. On their turn, a player rolls a dice and tries to match the dice with the cards he/she has that are of the same denomination, which is then placed in the discard pile. If he is able to discard, he throws again until he can no longer discard any cards, at which point the dice (and play) passes to the next player. Numbers are divided into blocked and free numbers. Free numbers can be used by other players to discard their cards if the player whose turn it was could not discard his/her cards. Blocked numbers can only be used by the player throwing the dice. Jokers serve as wild cards.<br/><br/>",

The player takes one card from the deck at a time and places it in the discard pile; the top card of the discard stack is available to play on the mountain.<br/><br/>A card on one level is placed above two cards on the next lower level. If the cards are different ranks and suits the new card must match the rank of one and the suit of the other; otherwise it must match what they have in common. (If the cards are identical any card can be played on them.)<br/><br/>When the deck runs out and all plays have been made, cards score based on what level they are on.<br/><br/>In the two-player game one player has a deck of red cards and the other black. The base is made up of alternating red and black cards and players draw cards into their hands, from which they may play any number of cards. The winner is the player with the most cards on the top level, but if a player can complete an entire level by themselves they win immediately.<br/><br/>",

Moving to a space occupied by an enemy piece captures it.

Obelisks allow stacks they are with to teleport from one hill to the other.

        "description": "The Ring is a card game loosely based on the US election process. It is played using a standard deck of cards, a small board, and some markers.<br/><br/>The game is driven by four columns of cards on the table, which each start with a single card. On a turn a player can draw a card from the deck, add a card to a column, or discard a card allowing them to take one or more columns: columns with a total exactly matching the discarded card and/or any combination of columns matching this may be taken.<br/><br/>For each column taken the player places a marker in the top box of an area on the events board (or five markers if they manage to take all four columns at once). There is a marker moving from area to area with each placement, so a player placing multiple markers places them in different areas.<br/><br/>Once all the spaces on the board are full the game ends. Players each one point per marker, except that markers on blue spaces are worth two. A player having the majority of the spaces in an area doubles their points for it. Players lose points for cards in hand. If there is a tie for overall points the lowest player is dropped and the board is re-assessed.<br/><br/>",

In the meantime the dealer draws and passes another card, so players end up all passing cards at the same time. Discards are shuffled when the deck runs out.<br/><br/>When a player has four cards of the same rank they take a piece of candy. All other players may then also take a piece. Starting on the second round the player left without a piece is eliminated from the game. After a player is eliminated, of one player has more candy than anyone else they win. Otherwise another hand is played.<br/><br/>A player may pretend to be about to take a piece of candy to fake out other players. If another player takes a piece in this case, they must give it back along with a piece they already have.<br/><br/>Variant rules are provided for younger children.<br/><br/>(The game says up to 13 players can play, but there's no way to get the game started in that case.)<br/><br/>",

You and your opponent roll the dice at once - who gets more points wins. The defeated army that took part in the battle goes as many steps back as the points thrown by the winner during the battle. In case of a tie the combat is held again, until victory.<br/><br/>Victory:<br/>The winner is the one who first brings to the enemy's camp his entire army, of figures of infantry, cavalry and artillery.<br/><br/>",

No maximum number of players is given.<br/><br/>The game starts with an agreed-upon number of letters, each written in a circle, with the circles connected by lines. The players also agree on the number of letters that will end the game and the minimum word length.<br/><br/>On a turn a player may add as many connections as they want between existing letters that aren't already connected, as long as none of the lines cross existing lines. Also, each connection must result in at least one new word, which the player claims (they may claim more than one). Words are spelled by following the connections - a connection can be traversed more than once, and each letter has an implicit connection to itself.<br/><br/>After adding as many connections as desired a player ends a turn by adding a new letter with a single connection to an existing letter. This need not result in any new words.<br/><br/>Claimed words score their length minus the minimum word length. However, there are some additional rules on claiming longer forms of earlier words and so forth, which affect the scoring.<br/><br/>After the last letter has been added players may examine the network to find additional words to claim.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fun medium-light weight pickup-and-deliver game, where the board is always different, and your available routes change during the game.<br/><br/>In the future, after the fiasco of Monorail public transportation, logistics companies acquire the infrastructure cheaply, and use it to deliver cargo, instead of passengers.<br/>Players are route planners for one of those logistics companies, competing to gain manifests (contracts), picking up the corresponding package/s first to then deliver them to their requested destination.<br/>Each turn you use your monorail's speed for available actions to load, unload, and move, with the goal of acquiring contracts and delivering the most packages.<br/>Old passenger routes are not optimal for cargo, however, so over the course of the game you can change the tracks, improving your routes or hindering other players'. You can also improve your monorail, increasing your package capacity per trip, or making it faster, which gives you more actions per turn.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>- The board game is setup randomly out of different track tiles. Cargo packages are set on 9 stations around the board.<br/>- Each player has an action allowance, based on their monorail's speed. This can increase or decrease in later turns, as players buy more engines or more cargo space for their monorails.<br/>- Routes can be improved (or hindered) by using track improvements, which allow players replace the track tiles on the board.<br/>- New contracts are created randomly from cargo + destination decks.<br/>- The game ends when all &ldquo;golden&rdquo; packages are delivered. The player that successfully delivered the most valuable packages is the winner.<br/><br/>The game can be played from 2 to 5 players.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Green has Klingon, Hydran, and Vudar ships fighting a battle in an asteroid field. Will their fear, hate, and distrust find an end?  &ldquo;The Last Command,&rdquo; also by Green, follows a Carnivon in command of a Bear-Dog dreadnought.<br/><br/>In addition to the story, History includes information on nobility titles and an article on Tholian military ranks.<br/><br/>As is usual, Communications informs readers about the company&rsquo;s activities. Captain&rsquo;s Log #31 and SFB Module F2 have after-action reports. The company laid out its plans for new print releases and metal miniatures for the coming year, including the new Federation Commander. There are questions and answers about that new, faster-playing game. The Input Guide has guidelines for submissions to Federation Commander. Proposals for Star Fleet Battles are presented. Admiral Growler answers SFB questions. More &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions get answered. There is a page of filk songs. Finally, there are the Star Fleet Awards.<br/><br/>Federation Commander has prototype rules from Romulan Border. The first tactics papers appear. Finally, there is an example of play for the game. Later in the issue, the scenario &ldquo;Sabotage!&rdquo; provides a battle opportunity between the Klingons and the Federation.<br/><br/>This issue includes five scenarios for Star Fleet Battles. <br/><br/>     SL241, Circle of Vengeance, and SL242, Last Command, are based on the two stories in the issue.<br/>     Set during the Early Years, SL236, Web of Curiosity, involves an encounter between the Tholians and Klingons. <br/><br/><br/>SL243, Network Disruption, is tied to the Battle Group scenario that features the fleet of one of the Galactic Powers facing the Andromedans. <br/>SL244, Hearth and Home, has the Hydrans facing a Coalition fleet of Klingons and Lyrans.  <br/>Based in the Omega Octant, Dragonslayer SL245 has an Iridani clipper facing a Branthodon young dragonship.<br/><br/>Database articles include battlegroups designed with 800 points and the optional use of partial X-refits. There is an article on the cosmic cloud. Kosnett&rsquo;s war is updated from its appearance in Advanced Missions. There is a guide for converting captured Klingon ships to fit into Lyran fleets and vice versa.<br/><br/>The Tactics section has &ldquo;Victory at Origins 2005,&rdquo; by Ken Lin. The primer focuses on the Drex, located in the Omega Octant. There are three pages of term papers, including some encore term papers.<br/><br/>The Venues section covers Star Fleet Command, SFB On-Line, playing by email, Galactic Conquest, Star Fleet Warlord, Prime Directive, and Star Fleet Battle Force.<br/><br/>Federation &amp; Empire has a status update along with rules and rulings. There are four pages of tactical notes. Finally, there is the Q&amp;A section.<br/><br/>New ships are added for Star Fleet Battles. The Klingons get &ldquo;collared&rdquo; ships:  DC7 collared battlecruiser and the DC5 collared war cruiser. The Vudar gain more ships with their command cruiser, advanced technology command cruiser, fast carrier resupply frigate, X-scout, and supply cruiser. The Vudar also get a medium bomber squadron, heavy bomber squadron, and bases for both types of bombers. The Federation receives its (old) light scout cruiser and its (old) heavy fighter carrier. The Klingons get a refitted captured Lyran war cruiser and Lyran destroyer. Conversely, the Lyrans get a refitted captured Klingon D5 war cruiser and Klingon F5 frigate. Federation Commander gets new ship cards for the Romulan King Eagle cruiser and K7R battlecruiser and the Gorn battle destroyer and battlecruiser. These four ships are in fleet scale.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Armi&ntilde;o (Ermine in Spanish language), was the fur clothes sported by Catholic Monarchs in Medieval Europe.<br/><br/>The cloth board and cards of this game emulate those luxury garments. Beside the board, the game consists in 44 field cards, 10 special cards, 2 player aid cards and the instructions. All components are made in Spain from small manufacturers. No plastic components.<br/><br/>The aim of designers was to take some mechanics of different games trying to make their own version of Gwent. Tough, the idea evolved and mixed some concepts from Age of Empires, Stratego, or even Carcasonne.<br/><br/>In Armi&ntilde;o the board and scenario is always changing, allowing a great replayability.<br/><br/>Plays can last from 1 to 30 minutes, depending on strategy and luck. At the beginning of the game, the red carpet will be displayed between contestants, each of them having a King card from the maze. Then, the rest of the 42 field cards (white back) must be mixed and both players shall receive 17 face down cards. Then, the special cards (black back) will be mixed too and just one will be given to each player.<br/><br/>The player will choose how to place cards on the cloth board. Decisions on how to place them will be based just in strategy.<br/><br/>Each card has an effect written on it, so each turn a player must do an action with the cards. Move them or use them according to its effects.<br/><br/>The special cards (epic, meteorite, transmute or breeze among them) can be used all along the game as many times as needed.<br/><br/>Easy to learn but hard to master, Armi&ntilde;o is a strategic card game of medieval combat for two players, whose goal is to kill the opponent's king. Fast and destructive, in the eventuality you could not achieve the regicide, the winner will be the player obtaining most victory points.<br/><br/>",

The Captain, of course, and two or three men he trusted.<br/><br/>And one stranger.<br/><br/>It is said that, once the treasure was safely buried, the Captain would ask who wanted to stay behind and guard it. In the stories, the stranger volunteers, hoping to take the treasure and run.<br/><br/>So, the stranger is beheaded on the spot, their ghost left to haunt the place and guard the treasure for centuries. According to the stories, the stranger is bound to the place now, unable to leave, rest, or move on.<br/><br/>Unless, of course, someone were to discover the gold they have been guarding. Unless they could find some way to convince someone, anyone, to face their fears, head out into the night, and claim the blood gold for themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Headless Guide is a game for a single person. It can be a simple solitaire card game or, if you prefer, a map-making game.<br/><br/>Gather two six-sided dice, something to write on, and something to write with. If you want, get a blank piece of paper to draw the map on.<br/><br/>A player lays out 11 cards with the Ace of Diamonds (representing the Treasure) on the end.<br/><br/>After choosing one of four characters, each with a different combination of Courage and Silence and a special ability, the player flips a card and reads the description tied to that card.<br/><br/>After resolving the rules on a card - often including an attempt to roll under their current Courage or Silence - and adjusting their values accordingly, the player flips again until their Courage runs out, or they claim the Treasure.<br/><br/>",

Each chef has their own unique abilities and there are special cards in each deck, making each draw a tactical decision! And a rubber band mechanism makes players more powerful the closer they get to being knocked out.<br/><br/>Food Coma is designed to be both a fast, fun party game that can be played in easy quick sessions and also a highly strategic and thoughtful game for more competitive players.<br/><br/>All of Food Coma's images are hand drawn and each of the 35 ingredients each have a clever name and witty tagline.

        "description": "Worm &amp; Cozy is a medium-weight strategic spatial roll-and-write game offering meatier puzzles than most roll-and-writes, but sharing their simple materials, solo playability, and streamlined rules.<br/><br/>Use the roll of the dice cleverly to fit worms onto your board, give them body parts, and have those body parts act. You can use any one of thirteen different game sheets for each game; each tells a different chapter from the history of the worms, and has a few unique ways to score. There&rsquo;s one way to lose points on any sheet: leaving worms touching blank space. So fit your worms together cozily!<br/><br/>At first you need only read 3 pages of rules, and then play Chapter 1, in which the eye is the only organ that has an action: to find food.<br/><br/>Play at your own pace through the chapters. Each of the first 6 chapters introduces the power of one more of the six organ types: With a mouth, a worm can eat food to grow more organs. With a brain it can get some control of the colony&rsquo;s fate by changing die rolls. With a heart, a worm can grow longer. With a pointy tail it can team up into a &ldquo;Conga Line&rdquo;. And with &ldquo;collars&rdquo;, two worms &ndash; who love each other very much! &ndash; can make short baby worms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>The game's playtesting and development is documented in: <br/>[WIP] Worm & Cozy - 4th Roll & Write Game Design Contest - Contest Ready.<br/><br/>",

All of the important units, territory, and objectives of the operation are represented on the map. Your units  will  clash  at  important  locations  with  the  best  forces  from  both  sides,  such  as  the  Gebirgsj&auml;ger,  Fallschirmj&auml;ger,  Alpine  Troops  and  Legionaries  as  well  as  the  Norwegian  army.<br/><br/>Victory  conditions:  It  will  be  very  hard  for  the  Allies  to  achieve any kind of a real victory in Firestorm Norway and the  victory  conditions  reflect  this.  Events  in  France  will  overtake  the  Campaign  in  Norway  and  affect  the  support  of the British and French so the Allies will score points for holding out and slowing the German advance.<br/><br/>All the rules you will need are included to play.<br/>Downloadable tokens are  provided  although  you  can  easily  substitute  them  with  other models.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "F.1 Grand Prix is a game for 2-5 players. It is a true competition of Formula 1 miniatures on the Belgian automobile circuit from Spa-Francorchamps, one of the most beautiful automobile circuit in the world, by his trace and his landscape, that of the Belgian Ardennes.<br/><br/>For to start, each player selects his car and his stand A B C D or E. Each car is placed in the car park stand, and now the game starts by the qualification, in order to know what pilot will occupy the  after the trails.<br/><br/>Then the players start to race by drawing cards from a deck to determine how far the race around the track. Some cards force you to draw a card from a second deck which could be an advantage or dis-advantage for your car.<br/><br/>The first player who achieves 5 circuit turns and who goes over the check pattern flag is winner. The others continue to play to know their arrival order.<br/>One suggestion! You can thus make championships in 3, 4 or 5 sleeves attributing for each competition, 9 points for first, 7 points for second, 5 points for third, 3 points for fourth and 1 point for the fifth. You determine thus the Champion of the Champions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Also known as the Jaguar-class, Chacal (Jackal)-class destroyers were designed to fulfil a scouting role for fleet battle lines and to attack enemy shipping in the Mediterranean. As a result, they possessed poor endurance, mounted no anti-submarine weapons, and had woefully inadequate anti-aircraft fire, especially in the face of the German Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>The six ships of this class were all named after predators (Chacal, Jaguar, L&eacute;opard, Lynx, Panth&egrave;re, Tigre) and saw wildly varying actions and fates during the war.<br/><br/>This pack enables you to represent three of these vessels on the tabletop.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There were to have been four ships of the Richelieu-class, with the first two laid down in 1935 and the second pair following in 1935. <br/>Gascogne was cancelled and Clemenceau never completed. The last ship followed a modified design which placed one of the turrets aft of the superstructure &ndash; the original design had both main armament turrets forward, much like the Dunkerque-class. <br/>Designed as a counter to the powerful Italian battleships being built, the Richelieu was protected against 15-inch shells and mounted eight 15-inch guns of its own, on what started as a 35,000-ton hull. Neither ship of the class was quite finished at the time of the French surrender.<br/><br/>Richelieu, which was almost complete, escaped to Dakar in order to keep here under French control. She came under repeated British attacks that were intended to compel the battleship to join the Free French Naval forces or sink her, thus denying the Axis opportunity to deploy the Richelieu for their own means. <br/>In 1942 she eventually, joined the Allied cause and, after a refit in the USA, was deployed to the Far East to serve with the British fleet for operations against the Japanese - although present at the Battle of the Malacca Strait, she was too far away to directly engage the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>She was part of the force that liberated Singapore in the aftermath of the Japanese surrender in 1945 and later operated in French Indochina before being recalled to France in December 1945. <br/>She saw training duty on and off active-service for the remainder of her existence, eventually being sold for scrap in 1968.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When launched, the Surcouf was the largest submarine in the world, only surpassed in the Second World War by the Japanese I-400-class submarine.<br/><br/>Her intended role was that of commerce raider and her design was intended to maximise this mission. She had a range of 10,000 miles, could sail for 90 days and was equipped with a Besson MN-411 floatplane in a hanger aft of the tower to scout for victims and spot for her main battery.<br/><br/>Her torpedo outfit included four forward internal tubes, a quad trainable mount aft and a second quad trainable mount aft equipped with lightweight torpedoes. She even had a prison hold for up to 40 captives. However, the most striking aspect of her design was the inclusion of a special, watertight turret forward of the tower which carried two eight-inch naval guns.<br/><br/>Surcouf was a very complex design, plagued with mechanical troubles. She was difficult, slow to dive and rolled badly on the surface in rough seas. She was also so low to the horizon that the effective range of her 8-inch guns was greatly reduced. When war broke out, Surcouf was in the French Antilles and by the time she returned to Brest was in need of repairs. When France fell, Surcouf escaped to England, where she was seized by British sailors. She was subsequently turned over to the Free French who regarded her with pride while the British Admiralty considered her, perhaps unfairly, something of a joke.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The person to the left of the dealer leads out by playing one card of any color and play goes clockwise with each player playing one card per turn.  Players must &ldquo;follow suit&rdquo; by playing a card of the same color that was led out.  If they are out of the color that was led, they can play any color including the trump color.  The player that wins the trick takes the cards played (they are set aside to indicate a trick won) and then leads out for the next round of play.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to score the highest number of points. If a player's bid is made exactly (not under or over) add amount bid plus 5 points. If bid is not made, subtract amount bid or the number of tricks taken &ndash; whichever is the greater number. This game is easy to play, but becomes very difficult to accurately predict the number of tricks that will actually be taken.  The game ends with a special round where each player is dealt one card and each player shows every other player their card by putting it on their forehead (without looking at it).  Bids are made and the cards are laid on the table to see who takes the trick.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Battle of the Hexes, players will take part in a war of spell cards. They play as mages with a set of spells they choose from, who do battle to the death. There are different types of magic as well as different types of spells; and the player must carefully select their strategy and spells to defeat their opponent.<br/><br/>Players must each build a hand of 15 cards, by drawing by turn from a draft of cards. These cards can then be played on different lanes, damaging only what is in their path unless stated otherwise on the card. If no other card is in their respective lane, damage from the cards goes directly to the opposing player&rsquo;s health. Once a player loses all their health, they lose the game.<br/><br/>General Gameplay:<br/><br/>Gameplay occurs over several stages. Players keep track of whose turn it is through the turn indicator card. They must simply flip it when their turn ends.<br/><br/>Draw Stage:<br/><br/>During the draw stage: All cards sets should be shuffled first. Determine a starting player, that player is dealt the &ldquo;Destruction Spells&rdquo; set of cards. Then they will choose one to keep for their hand, and pass the rest of the cards to the opposing player, who will then choose one of their own, and return it to the starting player again. That process should repeat itself until each player has a maximum of 5 cards of that particular set. Any remaining cards should be placed aside for later use in the game. Afterwards, that same process is repeated with the &ldquo;Summoning Spells&rdquo; set of cards, followed by the &ldquo;Alteration Spells&rdquo; set of cards.<br/><br/>Play Stage:<br/><br/>This stage is where players play the cards they have chosen during the Draw Stage. The starting player from the previous stage starts here. During this stage, players get to use their 6 stamina points to play cards they have in their hand. Each card requires a certain amount of stamina points to be played. Any unused stamina points at the end of this stage cannot be used as extra in the next round. For the first round only: once the player has played all the cards they want, it is then the opposing player&rsquo;s turn to play their cards in the same manner. Each card type must be placed in the correct area of the battlefield sheet according to their respective type symbols. &ldquo;Destruction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alteration&rdquo; cards must remain face down until the Battle Stage starts. Players may stack up as many of these cards in one lane as they want, but only one &ldquo;Summoning&rdquo; card is allowed in one lane at a time. Players may draw cards from any of the draw decks at any time during this stage, but it will cost them 1 stamina point.<br/><br/>Battle Stage:<br/><br/>During this stage, the player who played their cards last gets to attack first. The players&rsquo; cards will deal damage to the opposing player&rsquo;s cards only on their respective lanes unless stated - otherwise on the card - and according to their damage points on the card. Damage is done to both sides simultaneously. Cards that belong to the same spell class deal only half damage to each other. Any card that loses all its HP points must be discarded. All discarded cards are returned to their respective draw deck, placed at the bottom of each. If the opposing player&rsquo;s lane is empty, then damage would go directly to that player&rsquo;s own HP. Players keep track of how much damage each card is dealt through the red health pieces. One red health piece means the card lost one HP, and so on. Players keep track of their own health through the counters.<br/><br/>Following this stage it is back to the play stage for the opposing player. Whenever players run out of cards, each draw deck is taken and reshuffled, and the players draft cards between each other in another Draw Stage.<br/><br/>",

These symbols include... Role again, next player pick up x4, Change direction, Next player miss a go. These cards can be great to trip up opponents or launch you towards victory. In the game there are also special cards. The 'CHOICE' card allows a player to put down a card, no matter the number they roll.

As a result, they were given 12-inch guns, significant armour protection, and could travel at up to 33 knots. They resembled current generation battleships in appearance, with the familiar two forward, one aft main battery turrets, massive columnar mast and a multitude of 5-inch dual purpose guns along the sides of the superstructure. However, they were built to cruiser standards, lacking the armoured belt and torpedo defence of capital ships.<br/><br/>Commissioned late into the war, USS Alaska saw limited service. <br/>Operations included those off Iwo Jima and Okinawa in early 1945, such as anti-aircraft defence in carrier task forces and shore bombardment. <br/>After the war, she participated in the Korean occupation. <br/>She was decommissioned in February 1947.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was also incredibly fast, due to increased output from the engines, and its greater size allowed it to mount more anti-aircraft guns, making it a formidable prospect for attacking planes. Invariably used as flagships for task forces, the Iowa-class was also supremely equipped to act as escorts for the fast carrier fleets of the Pacific.<br/><br/>During World War Two, USS Iowa transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic to Algeria, bound for the conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in 1943. <br/>Transferred to the Pacific fleet the following year, her operations including the preparatory shore bombardments at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and the screening of carriers around the Marshall Islands. <br/>She was present for the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay, serving as the flagship of the Third Fleet under Admiral William F. Halsey. <br/>She would go on to serve in the Korean War before being decommissioned into the &ldquo;mothball fleet&rdquo;. <br/>Reactivated in 1984 in efforts to counteract the expanding Soviet Navy she was finally decommissioned after 19 total years of active service in 1990.

Unlike with Actions or Buildings, a player must patent a Tech before it can be played by discarding cards from their point pile. This means each Tech requires careful analysis to decide if it will pay off in the lost points. Tech cards are very powerful however, with lasting effects that can be used as soon as they are played, and often shape a player's strategy.<br/><br/>In additional to 30 unique Techs, Farms &amp; Factories: Inventions adds 35 new Buildings and Actions, adding complexity and strategical depth to the original game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Prime Ordeal, two or more players take turns drafting armies from a &quot;Spawning Pool&quot; (a face-up collection of Creature and Bonus cards that all players have access to) to get ready for battle. Each creature has a Power Level, represented by a single number. These numbers are added together to form a player's Total Power Level when battling. As the game progresses, so does each player's army and Total Power Level.<br/><br/>To draft (referred to as &quot;Create&quot; in game), players discard combinations of Prime cards from their hands into the Prime card discard pile. Each Creature or Bonus card features a Creation Cost, specifying the combination of Prime cards necessary to create it. The Creation Cost may feature any combination of the following Prime card types: Bug, Sea, Bird, Reptile, Mammal, and Amphibian. Creatures themselves have types that directly correspond to their Creation Cost.  Players are encouraged to collect creatures that share types to increase synergy and for better chances at acquiring Bonus cards.<br/><br/>After each player takes a turn Creating, the round concludes with a mandatory, free-for-all style battle. Each player's Power Level is compared and those with the highest or tied for highest Power Level win the battle, while each other player loses a Life.<br/><br/>Players draft in between each battle and the game continues until only one player remains with any Life. The amount of Life chosen before the game will determine how long a game lasts. It is recommended to start players at 7 (short game), 11 (medium-length game), or 13 Life (long game).<br/><br/>This strategic, card-based brawler features a modular design.  The core set, Genesis, functions as a standalone game.  Players may purchase expansions and shuffle them directly into the core set to change the game entirely. Groups may decide on which expansions to include and which to omit for a customizable gaming experience. Prime Ordeal is traditionally played as a free-for-all; however, its design accommodates team play as well.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The King, facing unrest at home and abroad, has fired his key advisors. Now, you have an opportunity to assemble a coalition of his subjects to take their place. Maybe you'll unite the political power of an entire class, or perhaps build an alliance across the classes. As more subjects join the court, additional strategies may arise.<br/><br/>In King's Coalition, each class has its own abilities and range of influence. Build your coalition by drafting a card, then discarding one from your hand &mdash; but be careful not to give your opponents the exact card they need to make their coalition outpace yours.<br/><br/>You have seven cards in hand to form the strongest coalition to score bonuses that are revealed throughout the game, in addition to trying to create sets and sequences.<br/><br/>The player who can build the strongest coalition will win the king's support...and a place at his side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alien Mating Calls is a hilarious party game that combines performing, deduction, and trickery. Your goal in the game is to score points by correctly pairing up with other players - while having the severe and silly limitation of only making alien noises.<br/><br/>The game is played over 6 rounds. A round begins with the first player prepping one of the alien decks and dealing each player one card. The card you get is your alien card for the round, and is kept secret from other players.<br/><br/>Players go around the table once, making a noise they think their alien might make. This is their clue to other players what alien they have. Then players simultaneously begin making their alien noises, during which each player decides to either pair up with another player by fist bumping them, or not pair up. When all players are ready to proceed, players reveal their alien cards.<br/><br/>Players score points based on how they paired up, with maximum points awarded to pairs of players who were alien partners and to single players who did not pair up and didn't have their partner in play. The player with the most points at the end of 6 rounds wins.<br/><br/>Subjective interpretations and the chance of a devious Mimic being in play makes commitment risky, and surprising misunderstandings are common. Optional Mood cards modify player calls, adding more replayability.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

As you play, the totals on the dice, when you have rolled them, tell you where to move. The squares on which you land tell you what to do (for example, penalty of &quot; holding&quot; -you go to the penalty box for two turns).

        "description": "Go Adventure is a family-friendly card game that was inspired by one of the game creators going out on 'adventures' with his son. Sometimes their adventures didn't always go as planned. This hard-learned lesson to pack appropriately gave way to inspire children to also think creatively about going out on adventures. The objective of the game is to fully &ldquo;pack&rdquo; the required items needed to go on eight different adventures. The gameplay is simple and straightforward. The cards are brightly colored and cheery. Laughter will certainly ensue.<br/><br/>Players can only play one card during their turn but they have four choices of card type to play. They can play a Required Item card on an adventure thereby 'packing that item'. If the player places the last required item needed to be packed for an adventure, then they get to keep that adventure card pile. This drives the primary objective of the game. The remaining choices purely drive the fun secondary elements of the game. A player can use a Skip-a-Turn card thereby skipping the next player in order. A player can use a Funny Action card, which forces someone in the group to do something fun and silly that relates to the adventure themes. Lastly, a player can use a Random Item card, which can be placed on any of the adventures but the player must make up a story about how that item will be used on the specific adventure. This adds a fun storytelling element to the game. Gameplay continues until all eight adventures have been fully &ldquo;packed&rdquo; for and the winner is the player with the most completely packed adventure piles in their possession.<br/><br/>Go Adventure is unique in its mission to get kids thinking about what adventure means to them as well as what needs to be packed to go on adventures. The gameplay is quick, around fifteen minutes, and the storytelling element will continue to provide exciting replayability for families. Any extra inspiration kids and parents find to get out there and go on new adventures is free of charge!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;ll accomplish this by using advanced long range spacecraft to journey to the nearest habitable world that will become their new home.<br/><br/><br/>Still stubbornly divided after decades of fighting, the remaining world powers now engage in a final surge for dominance and self preservation as they race ahead to their objective. As time runs out, they now must make a hasty departure from their dying planet. In order to complete their mission, they must obtain the materials necessary to sustain themselves, maintain their spacecraft, and research the science required to navigate their way through the long and dangerous journey that awaits them. In an ironic twist, they may be forced to cooperate with one another while still protecting their own interests. Now the ultimate strategic gamble for survival will require you to be the first to arrive and claim the distant world TERRA PROXIMA...<br/><br/>Terra Proxima, by Bavarian Games, is a push-your-luck, resource management game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout gameplay!

But somehow your choice of place doesn't seem to be the best to reach the jumping fish.<br/>Fill your fishing net with the best fish before your fellow players do!<br/><br/>Each player receives a game piece and a fishing net. The lake is placed in the center. 5 phases are played. First you draw 2 tiles from the bag. Then you can put one or both tiles back into the bag and draw again. However, this costs one tile from the net. This can be repeated as often as you like.<br/><br/>After that, one tile is placed in the lake based on its coordinates. The other tile is turned over and serves as a time unit. The time unit can also be exchanged in phase 4 for giving up a tile from the fishing net. ⠀⠀<br/><br/>In phase 5, fishing takes place. For each time unit, you may take one step around the lake and cast your fishing rod. Reeling in does not cost a unit of time. You may only cast straight ahead, so you must stand at right angles to the fish. Then the start player marker is passed on and a new round begins. ⠀⠀<br/><br/>In the 3-4 player game, you can save time units and use them later. If a player's net is full, the current round is still played to the end, followed by the scoring. You add up the points of the fish on the fishing net. Who is the best angler?<br/><br/>",

The player who arrives first receives the tokens placed there at the start. Along the way, special space actions lead to special events, payments or profits.<br/><br/>When that end is achieved each player receives the tokens on the space of the monarch which was their hidden choice at the start. If players have chosen the same the rewards are split evenly.

Little lioness imagined herself as the main character with a flowing cape and super strength. She showed the book to all her creature friends, who also dreamed of what it would be like to be one of these fabled names. What if all critters could become their favorite characters? With Character Critters game, you can help them reach this dream!<br/><br/>Character Critters is an imaginative drawing game for the whole family. Every round, each player receives a random Character Card and Critter Card and draws the Critter in the style of the Character. What would a horse look like as Rapunzel? How about a kangaroo Santa Claus? Players draw their Character Critters simultaneously and earn points by guessing drawings correctly and having their drawings correctly guessed. There are also Jr. Character cards included for younger players so they can conjure up a scientist penguin or a frog who&rsquo;s a clown. With over 4,000 possible card combinations, you&rsquo;ll flex your creativity and make some delightfully unique art each time you play!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The druids are torn between taking what they need to form a harmonious land for themselves and leaving their once beloved partner druid with enough to create a harmonious land as well.<br/><br/>Each turn, one player is the Divider while the other is the Decider. The Divider literally cuts the land into two distinct fragments, and then the Decider chooses which to take first.<br/><br/>Each player forms their new domain by gluing these land fragments onto a blank map. Fragments may be divided again using a limited number of additional cuts. After you glue things onto your land, you can colour them in.<br/><br/>Every living thing within your land has a Law determining how it scores at the end of the game. As a half of a druidic dyad, you have been responsible for half of the things within your land, so you only know half of the laws of your land. Your beloved knows the other half.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will question your beloved about the other Laws, gaining knowledge about how to score.<br/><br/>&mdash;descriptions from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, they may play cards from their hand to form chemical compounds based on the real electron configuration of the elements involved. Some compounds are poisonous, explosive, or radioactive which can destroy opponents' compounds if they do not have a card to defend against it.<br/><br/>",

Players can gain further karma by landing on one of 4 different coloured life spaces (blue, green, red, and grey). You can use karma points to pay merit to other players and unlock evolution levels. But beware, losing all your karma points will send you back to purgatory.<br/><br/>At the end of each round of turns all players enter karma negotiation where players can buy, sell and/or swap life space and evolution cards. After karma negotiation is completed the karma wheel is spun. Players with life space cards that match the colour spun receive merit (karma points) from other players.<br/><br/>As you gain merit and life spaces in the game, you are ready for reincarnation to a new level of evolution. Evolution is achieved by acting, miming and pontificating the answers to questions from each of the corresponding evolution levels.<br/><br/>Win the game by being the first to achieve all four levels of evolution, (plant, animal, human, monk), become a guru and answer, act or mime the ultimate enlightenment question!<br/><br/>",

They buy, sell, haggle, and improve the offers of their competitors; they won't waste a single opportunity.<br/><br/>In Bazar, you will take the place of one of those merchants in search of the most profitable deals, but keep an eye on what your rivals are doing,they may have what you need and you can take advantage of it while you derail their plans.<br/><br/>Bazar is a fast and light game, for 2 to 5 players, that combines worker placement, set collection and hand management. And where it will be very important to choose the correct moment for each action.<br/><br/>On each turn, players will move to a new location, where they can carry out their action, or close a deal to get coins. They can also activate characters that can be of great help. At the end of a number of rounds, depending on the number of players, the player with the most coins will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kit is an easy to learn game and fun for the avid card player or if you're a beginner. Rummy style game where you make kits or runs, make the right combinations, and be the first to go out - then watch your opponents scramble to cut their losses. The goal of the game is to be the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10th round by making your entire hand into kits and/or runs.<br/><br/>The game consists of two 44-card decks. Each deck has four WILD cards and four colors: Blue, Gold, Green, and Purple. Each color has ten cards, 3 through 12. Wild cards can be considered any number or color that you wish. There are also rotating wild cards that change every round. The rotating wild cards depend on the number of cards dealt that round. When 3 cards are dealt, the 3&rsquo;s are wild, when 4 cards are dealt the 4&rsquo;s are wild and so on until the last round when the 12&rsquo;s are wild.<br/><br/>A kit is three or more cards of the same number and can be any color. You can have as many wild cards in a kit as you want. A run is three or more consecutive cards of the same color. A wild card can replace any card in a run. You can have as many wild cards in a run as you want and they can be adjacent to one another.<br/><br/>Dealing: <br/>1. Shuffle both decks of cards together. <br/>2. For the first round deal 3 cards to each player, dealing one card at a time. Note: For each round of play, the number of cards dealt increases by one card. In the second round 4 cards are dealt, in the third round 5 cards are dealt, and so on until dealing 12 cards to each player in the final round. The dealer position rotates after each round. <br/>3. Place the remaining cards in the center of the table and turn over the top card. The stack of cards is the draw pile and the card turned up is the start of the discard pile.<br/><br/>Playing: <br/>1. The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise. <br/>2. Start your turn by taking the top card on the discard pile or drawing a card. <br/>3. Complete your turn by discarding one card. <br/>4. Continue to make kits and/or runs until you are able to go out. <br/>5. Going out: Once all of the cards in your hand are part of a kit or run, lay down all of your cards face up on the table before discarding your last card. <br/>Note: you must be able to make kits and runs from the exact number of cards dealt in the round. You must have one card left to discard. You can go out on your very first turn. <br/>6. Once a player has gone out, all other players have one final turn. Start your turn as normal and after discarding, lay down your kits and runs. Any cards that do not fit in a kit or run will count toward your score. <br/>7. The cards that are in kits and runs do not count toward your score. Players add up only their unused cards. The card values are equal to the number on the card and Wild cards are worth 20 points. The player that goes out first gets a score of -5. The scorekeeper records and adds up the score for each player. <br/>8. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left shuffles all of the cards and deals the next round. <br/>Note: Increase the number of cards dealt by one card and keep track of the rotating Wild cards<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players thread a cord through holes in a board that stands between them, so that polygon shapes are formed on both sides. With only ever seeing one side, the first player to successfully declare that they have made exactly four polygons, combining the shapes made on both sides, is the winner.<br/><br/>The board is 21cms square, and shows a pentagon pattern on both sides, with a hole at each point and another hole in the centre. The players hold the board up between them, and take turns to thread the red cord back and forth between the holes. In doing so, the thread starts to outline small shapes, triangles and polygons, as it criss-crosses itself.<br/><br/>Players must use deduction and understand the patterns they can't see, so that when exactly four shapes are made, they can declare and win the game.<br/><br/>By passing the cord through the same hole twice or more, it might confuse the other player as to how the shapes are being formed.<br/><br/>If the players think that too many shapes have been made, they can declare and start over, with no winner that time.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What kind of game is it?<br/><br/>The game is played by moving the pieces on the board in the manner of Shogi or Chess. 7 different secret orders are dealt face down, and the player who moves his pieces the fastest to fulfill his secret order wins the game. The secret orders can be as simple as occupying three red squares (which can be occupied by moving pieces and entering red squares), or as complex as having the hero piece, which is one's alter ego, defeated first among all players (usually, the player loses when the hero piece is defeated).<br/><br/>Therefore, for example, if you forcibly aim at a red square that is not necessary, other players may find out about your secret order and interfere with it, and if you unnaturally leave the pieces that protect the heroic pieces empty, they will also find out and it will be difficult to achieve your secret order. The key to the game is how to approach the secret mission secretly and inconspicuously.<br/><br/>The board may be unfavorable, but...<br/><br/>There are two special squares on the board: the red square is a recruiting base and the yellow square is a treasure base. When you occupy a recruiting base, you can add your own pieces to it every turn. When you occupy a treasure base, you can draw strategy cards that allow you to perform special moves such as double moves.<br/><br/>These recruiting bases and treasure bases are the conditions for many secret orders, so you have to guess whether other players are simply occupying them to gain an advantage in the game, or whether they are actually close to achieving their secret orders. Of course, you can use your own pieces and strategy cards to interfere with other players, but it is also very effective to make use of the fact that the secret orders are undisclosed to encourage other players to interfere without getting your hands dirty.<br/><br/>In addition, since all players want to have a useful base of troops and treasure, alliances will be formed early in the game, either by using pieces and strategy cards to fight for the base, or by spontaneously forming alliances to share the base. There are no penalties for betraying alliances, so don't hesitate to betray an alliance if you think you can fulfill a secret order and get closer to victory.<br/><br/>Repeatable and fun!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, in addition to the secret mission card, seven different hero cards are dealt to the player in public, and each of the seven heroes has various characteristics: some are good at power play by sending out many pieces, some are good at trick play by making use of strategy cards, and some are good at slowly accumulating strength in a safe area. Since seven types of secret mission cards are combined with these unique heroes, the fighting style changes every time, so you can enjoy the game for a long time without getting bored.<br/><br/>Also, the initial placement of the hero pieces is determined by the hero cards. It is quite advantageous if the initial placement is close to the base which is the victory condition. However, if other players think that the victory condition is too early, you will be attacked from many directions or receive a concentrated fire of strategy cards, and it is not easy to win. Try to avoid letting your opponent know your victory condition.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you will be at a disadvantage if the base that is the victory condition is far from your initial placement. Use all possible means to achieve a victory on thin ice, such as boldly attacking and destroying the opponent's heroic pieces, making alliances with other players using the opponent with an advantage on the board as a common virtual enemy, or forcing them to fight each other.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll be distracted by delicious French pastries, however, and all day long you won&rsquo;t be able to ignore any patisserie you see.

With special dice (all six-sided displaying different numbers for slow, moderate and fast movement) you move your cars. First you choose the dice you want to roll, then you assign the results to your 3 cars. I's a good idea to reduce  speed in track curves to avoid beeing set back. A special effect occurs when rolling a 6 with the moderate die. You roll again and add the result to the previous roll.<br/><br/>Victory points are given for the cars reaching the finish line.

The game has a deck of letter cards showing both the Roman letter and Japanese characters. But the deck represents the normal Hiragana sounds, so only 15 Roman letters are used including the vowel A. This enables players to construct Japanese words in steps that are more or less obvious.<br/><br/>Players declare a theme to their word and lay out cards in a crossword style, one by one. Players score points for correctly guessing words from limited steps.<br/><br/>The game was revised as Code 6+, with more components added, including hint cards. These allow the game to be more subtle and harder to crack. The guessing players can ask for hints, using six specific hint cards. These hints apply to parts of the secret word, or the whole meaning. The word deck was revised to remove dice symbols from the letter cards. Crib sheets of suitable words were included with the game to assist players.<br/><br/>The game relies upon a good knowledge of Hiragana words and would be difficult for non-speakers of Japanese.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

This game tries to capture that trend.<br/><br/>Players draw a card that will determine the place of departure and the initial means of transportation (plane, train or car). From that point they move their pawns to other cities that are connected by the same means of transport (for example, if you travel by plane, you can only move to another city with an airport, only if you take 3 or 6 on the die).<br/><br/>Some cities allow the player to change the mode of transport, in some others players will only arrive with the exact number in the data and in others they will receive a card with penalties or rewards.<br/><br/>The first player to arrive in Brasilia is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If a high number wins, a fan card can also move. But if multiple fan cards are played, they also cancel each other.<br/><br/>After 6 rounds, the player with the most scales is the winner.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for 2 players.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>An old story. The scales of the White Dragon were very beautiful and highly prized. However, it is said that anything that touches the body of the White Dragon will be cursed and unhappy. You have found the temple where the White Dragon lives. A small white dragon lived in the temple. Then Hakuryu spoke to me. &quot;Do you want scales? If so, entertain me. By the way, scales are swelling. Who is the most daring and lucky one in the swelling? Then, the color of your eyes changed and the battle for scales began. Who can get the most scales?<br/><br/>The simple rule is that the person who collects the scales and wins the most in all 6 rounds, but the card selection for each round is very troublesome, and the tricky moving small white dragon determines the outcome of the game.

        "description": "Rules for two players:<br/><br/>Use one deck of normal face cards.  Remove the jokers.  No table talk.  Trick-taking game like rook, but number of cards won matters rather than certain cards having points.<br/><br/>One player is the dealer.  The other player is the trump caller.  The dealer shuffles the deck and the other player cuts the deck.<br/><br/>The dealer deals 5 cards in a row face down to the trump caller.<br/><br/>The trump caller looks at their cards privately and chooses a trump suit based on just those 5 cards.<br/><br/>Once trump is called, the dealer then deals 5 cards face down to himself.  (The 5 cards dealt to each player will be part of their hand.)<br/><br/>The dealer then deals 8 face down cards in front of each player that nobody can look at.<br/><br/>The dealer then deals 8 face up cards on top of the face down cards that everyone can see.  (One face up card on top of each face down card.)<br/><br/>The dealer then deals 3 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 3 cards in a row into his own hand.<br/><br/>The dealer then deals 2 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 2 cards in a row into his own hand.<br/><br/>There should now be:<br/>    10 cards in each player's hand that only the player holding them can see<br/>    8 cards in front of each player that are face down that neither player has seen<br/>    8 cards right on top of the face-down cards in front of each player that all players can see<br/>    That makes a total of 52 cards in play (the whole deck without jokers).<br/><br/>The trump caller starts the game by choosing a card from either their hand or from the face up cards in front of them.<br/><br/>The other player then plays a card and must follow suit.  Highest card number wins.  Aces are high.  If they cannot follow suit because they don't have that suit either in their hand or face up on the table, they can play anything they want.  Trump cards will take the trick in that case and other suits (non-trump and not following suit) lose - just like in Rook.<br/><br/>Whenever a face up card is played, the face down card below it must immediately be turned over and it becomes part of the cards that can be played in subsequent tricks.<br/><br/>Whoever takes that trick keeps those cards and puts them aside and then leads the next trick.<br/><br/>The round ends when all cards in hands, face up, and face down have been played and all tricks taken.<br/><br/>The winner is the player that got the most tricks (most cards).  In the case of a tie, the dealer wins since the trump caller has a slight advantage and must take more than half of the cards to win.<br/><br/>To play another round, swap who is dealer and trump caller between each round played.  Choose a number of rounds to be won to win the overall game.<br/><br/>Strategy ideas<br/><br/>The game is similar to Rook, but it splits your hand into three parts:<br/>    your hand - which only you see<br/>    face down cards - which nobody sees<br/>    face up cards - which everyone sees<br/><br/>One example of using this knowledge is that if a player doesn't follow suit and plays a face up card which then reveals a face down card that is the suit that was just led, then you know that's the only card of that suit they have and so they must play it if you lead that suit again.  There are many other strategies like this that can be used based on the global knowledge of face up cards.<br/><br/>Four players<br/><br/>The game could be modified for four players by using two decks and having the trump caller be the person to the left of the dealer and moving the dealer to the left each round.  Notice that there will be two of each card in such a game.<br/><br/>Three players<br/><br/>Just like four players but you could either use one deck and reduce the number of hand cards, face down cards, and face up cards or use two decks and increase the number of cards used for each player.<br/>    one deck<br/>        hand cards: 4 at the start, then 2 then 1 (instead of 5, 3, and 2)<br/>        face down cards: 5<br/>        face up cards: 5<br/>        You'll have 1 card leftover.<br/>    two decks (just double the numbers above - might be too much?)<br/>        hand cards: 8 at the start, then 4, then 2<br/>        face down cards: 10<br/>        face up cards: 10<br/>        You'll have 2 cards leftover.<br/><br/>Other notes<br/><br/>This is a combination of two games: one is a game from India who played it with his grandmother, the other is knaves.<br/><br/>It's apparently similar to the ancient card game &quot;Whist&quot;, which is where the card game &quot;Bridge&quot; apparently came from and Rook is also similar in some ways.<br/><br/>We've actually played a three-player variant of Rook making the fourth dummy hand split as face down and face up and the dummy's partner plays from the face up cards - kind of like bridge but with face down cards hidden.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ドルフィンスナップ (Dolphin Snap) is a game from Japan in which players try to compose photos of marine life in an aquarium. The game includes a picture frame and a tripod. Cutouts of dolphins and whales are assembled on vertical stands and process around through dice rolls. Players are trying to get attractive groupings of dolphins in frame at the right time to get their photo. The best composed shots win the most points.<br/><br/>The game has a long blue cord which is placed as a loop on the table. The frame is set up in front of this, and a blue background is put to the rear. Players then throw a number of blue dice into the loop. These determine which marine animals appear. The number and types of dolphins are limited and will not appear all the time. The cutouts are clipped at different levels to blue poles, and these are stuck to small platforms which go alongside the corresponding dice. Looking through the frame, the players can see some creatures in shot, but not all of them. In this way, players compose a shifting three dimensional diorama of sea life passing the frame of the camera.<br/><br/>Players have to chose when to take a good photo. Should they get a quick snap, or wait a bit in case a more interesting creature swims by. Will the enormous whale shark appear at the back? If the dolphins move on, will the players regret the missed chance to get a good picture?<br/><br/>When a player has taken their photo and scored points for it, the next player rolls the dice and continues.<br/><br/>Whilst being a competitive game, the designer's intention is to engage the players in a contemplative experience as they consider their place in the world. The game can be played just as well by a solo player.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The explainer takes one of the picture cards in secret and explains what the image is. The other players draw their idea of the shape based upon the description.

When everyone has been explainer at least once, the scores are totalled up. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The designer suggest ways to make it easier or harder to explain. The explainer should start with describing what the largest part of the image is. For an easier game, allow players to ask questions, let the explainer use their hands, players can use an eraser. To make the game harder, allow only one question each, words only, no eraser. The hardest method limits the players to only 5 minutes and no questions or eraser.<br/><br/>The designer suggests you can draw your own new shapes on the backs of the picture cards, or use a computer (the designer used Paint to make the game).

An electronics store was giving away a free Nintendo Switch, but didn't use a sensible method of picking the winning number. As a result, two customers had the numbers either side of the winning number. The game designer used this event as the inspiration for this deduction game.<br/><br/>The game uses a suit of 1-13 cards from a normal deck of playing cards. One player is the retailer, the other players are the customers in the lottery. The retailer shuffles the 13 cards and removes one in secret, which nobody sees.<br/><br/>Then the retailer divides the 12 remaining cards into two piles and sorts them each from low to high numbers, placing them face-down. The players take turns to draw the top card from a pile and after getting three hand cards, a player make declare the hidden card. If they are correct, they win.<br/><br/>If the cards run out and no player has guessed correctly, the retailer can declare a number card that a player has (deducing in reverse). If the player does hold that card in their hand, the retailer wins.<br/><br/>As with other games from Loserdogs, this was produced in a simple ziplock baggie with only a page of rules and 13 playing cards.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

But the course has obstacles and the players push each other around or use items to get the jump on the others. The first to the finish line is the winner.<br/><br/>The race course is made of large tiles placed in a line. The game has a starting tile, and five course tiles, of which four are used, and a finish line. The course tiles have a variety of icons; walls, pits, arrows and objects.<br/><br/>Players choose the turn order, and the last player puts their athlete where they like on the start line, then the next player and so on. In this way, the start player does not get an advantage.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and move their athlete. If they end up on an icon, or push another athlete onto one, the actions are completed.<br/><br/>Pits make a player fall back 2 places and miss a turn. Walls delay players, and arrows push them in the direction of the arrow. The ? icon lets the player draw an object card from the deck. These objects allow the player to make advances, or delay other players, or even change the position of the course tiles.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finish line wins the race.<br/><br/>The designer Misaki notes that this was one of their earliest designs. It became the third game published by the doujin circle, but had been a car race game sent to a magazine five years previously. The prototype was made 15 years before 2009, making it 1994. The designer thought it was too good a game to waste and brought it back into production in 2009.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game puts you behind the wheel of one of the most important tech companies in the last century. You will relive the stories of some of the most influential technology innovators in history that paved the way to what we are capable of today. People like Edwin H. Land, a scientist who invented a whole new paradigm in photography with Polaroid, or Nolan Bushnell who executed on the first ever video gaming ideas with Atari, that drove the world into an age of digital video games and personal computers. It will be like being inside an interactive documentary, where you play the founder first person.<br/><br/>You start as a simple tech start-up and through multiple plays you and the story evolve into giving you the responsibility of turning your first product successes into a real tech company that people worship. A company that aims to take over the world with cutting edge inventions by visionary and quirky personalities.<br/><br/>You will attract the best talent, develop prototypes and turn them into mind boggling customer experiences. You will need to compose a sweet spot of skills in product design and engineering, business, management, marketing, and people. Talent with certain know-how can help you create better quality products. But to make all that happen you need investors and business-savvy individuals who can open the doors you need to succeed in a competitive consumer space of other tech companies - your opponents who you meet over beers at conferences and in courtroom disputes over patent infringement.<br/><br/>Through a new and profound way of pairing a board game with an app on your phone, the initial barrier of getting past a complex set of rules is replaced by a progressive approach that teaches you the game through a simple first start-up story. Then it grows more and more complex over the course of multiple play sessions towards transforming you into becoming a massive tech giant in the end.<br/><br/>The app will also be used to communicate the narrative through audio storytelling, to communicate every mechanic&rsquo;s tie-in to the theme and context, to manage gaming sessions in this new narrative format, where you can save your progress between play sessions, and to be a rules learning or reminder companion, to get you quickly back into the game, if you have had a break from it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The second game Yosegaki Kyokasho means Write Jointly Textbook.<br/><br/>The game is from Japan and is home-made. Packaged in a large pencil case, the components include large plastic sleeves with paper inside, wipeable marker pens, and a variety of small cut-outs of portraits and images of various kinds. These might be from famous Western artworks, such as the Mona Lisa or Venus, or famous people such as Beethoven or Napoleon, or animals or objects. Likewise there are popular Japanese characters such as writers, samurai or politicians (including Admiral Perry!), or figures from ukiyo-e scrolls.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to mimic writing graffiti in your school textbooks. Players put the cut-outs inside the wallets, backed with the white paper. They then use the markers to write their jokes and graffiti on the outside of the wallet, as if writing on the schoolbook. Then players compare their jokes and the funniest is given points. Most points wins.<br/><br/>The designer says &quot;Let's draw a bikini on Sakamoto Ryōma!&quot; (famous samuari and democrat).<br/><br/>The alternate game has players taking turns to choose a theme, such as 'alternate hairstyles', and players draw images to that theme in the same way. This is for players who are not used to making up rude jokes.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

One side contains a dragon and treasure, the other a wizard and spell. Dragons are used to attack your opponent's treasure and defend your own. Treasure is used to pay for wizards. Wizards can also steal treasure directly, or ride similarly-colored dragons for even more points. Spells can be cast by wizards to directly manipulate the battlefield, for example rotating or flipping cards, or scoring points. Each side of a card can only be used if the text is facing you, and all cards rotate after use. For example after attacking with a dragon it rotates to reveal its treasure, which makes it vulnerable to attack.<br/><br/>It is always a thrill to chain together a sequence of spells to flip and rotate cards, culminating in a massive points-scoring attack.

Triangular qart so gives 2 pts and outer one (leaf) means 0. For example, The Good Sign (a quad with 4 purple qarts in shape of full heart) costs 8 pts in total. Players (2 by default) pick 4 quads in a turn. The summary quads' cost in each hand multiplies by 10 (multiplier from 4 to 40). Other number quads to pick is possible (with an appropriate multiplier). The number of turns is conventional (1 by default).

        "description": "Math-Batt (Mathematical Battle) is a card game that teaches times tables to children in an explosion of excitement, bold colours, and adorable cartoon characters. Get the numbers on your side and win the war of multiplication! The fun starts with two or more players. The deck contains 90 cards, divided evenly. On each card you'll find one multiplication equation. To &quot;battle&quot; each player reveals the top card of their stack. The player with the highest equation result wins. For instance, 2 x 2 = 4 defeats 2 x 1 = 2. The winner takes all the cards played in the round. Sometimes battles result in a &quot;draw&quot; where players end up with the same number. When this happens the two must duel in a &quot;war&quot;. Players take two cards from their hand, placing one face down and the next face up. Whoever has the higher face-up card wins the war, and takes the other players' pair of cards. Players who run out of cards during the war immediately lose. The game continues until only one player emerges victorious with all 90 cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Movement is determined by a die.<br/><br/>The players form two teams: the police and the robbers. Any player may move any figure of hie own team. The robber team decides in secret which robber is the main culprit and which bag contains the loot. From this information they create a secret password from the main feature of the main culprit and the letter of the bag with the loot, for example Moon Boot (Monocle + B 001). The card with the number of the loot bag is removed from the stack and the stach is placed front down on it's space on the game board. The robbers and the bags (front down) are placed on the railway bridge and the police officers at police headquarters.<br/><br/>The robbers try to reach a hideaway (circular blue spaces), which can't be entered by a policeman. If a robber reaches a hideaway the player takes a bag from the bridge and places it inside the hideaway. The police have half an hour to find the main culprit and the bag with the loot. They try to reach the railway bridge while there are still some robbers and bags.<br/><br/>If a policeman gets to the railway bridge, he may turn over all the bags still there and takes all robbers still at at bridge to the prison to interrogate them.<br/><br/>If a figure gets on an orange space, the player takes the upper card from the stack and follows the instructions printed there, depending if he is a policeman or a robber. Some cards contain information for the police about empty bags.<br/><br/>The policemen take robbers into prison to interrogate them, if they land on a space occupied by a robber. During the first interrogation the robber has to tell the password. In further interrogations the police asks about the features of the main culprit (main feature, clothes, tie, ...). The robber has to answer truthfully wit &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Additionally the policeman may turn over any bag and ask, if this bag contains the loot.<br/><br/>The police wins, if they discover who is the main culprit and which bag contains the money inside half an hour. If not, the robbers win. The robbers win also if all get into hideaways, where they are safe from the police.<br/><br/>",

An objective card is face up. The player who has the most black pieces of clothing begins.<br/><br/>Players lose if they have no cards in their hand, or if they have more than 15 cards in their hand. The player wins if he has all the scrolls of the symbols on his objective card.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to clear all their hands of all cards before the game ends. If any player is left holding a card at the end of the game, they all lose.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of 48 cards numbered 1-48. The cards are in sections each with their own theme, 1-9 (Kitakuba), 10-19 (butterflies), 20-29 (eyeglasses), 30-39 (yokai), 40-48 (fanzines).<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and seven cards are dealt out face-down to each player. Players sort their hand and then choose a hand card, placing it face-down. Once everyone has chosen, they reveal their card, and the lowest card is placed first in the centre (onto an imaginary zero), and then the next card and so on (similar to Take 5. Cards are played into a pile, and lower cards are hidden and not to be examined later.<br/><br/>Then each player draws a card so their hand is back to seven, and play continues in the same way.<br/><br/>At any point, even at the start, a player can call for a trade, and all players pass a card to the left. Successive trades can be made in the same round, but only six trades are allowed in the whole game. A marker is moved along a track on the rear of the game box to count the trades.<br/><br/>Discussion is allowed in the game, but is limited. Players cannot say or imply a specific numbered card, but can talk in general about their cards. For example, 'I have two 20s', or 'I have zero Kitakuba'. In this way, players can work out which cards would be good to trade or keep in hand.<br/><br/>If a player cannot play a card to the pile legally, the first day of sales ends and the pile is set to one side. Play continues for a second day, starting at zero again. If a player cannot play legally again, day two ends and the players all lose.<br/><br/>If the players succeed in clearing their entire hands before day two ends, they all win.<br/><br/>(Note: this game was published in Japan in 2016, before The Mind in 2018).<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

In four locations you will position witches out of your hand and attempt to take control in small and larger scale confrontations, with the mysterious Gatekeeper playing a merciless referee using some unique dynamic mechanics.<br/><br/>When positioning a witch of a specific element at a location, columns are formed. A new witch will compare her spellpower with that of the opposing witch, with the higher value &quot;dazzling&quot; the weaker party. In dazzled state, witches are vulnerable for the vicious Gatekeeper that is now activated by the Gatekeeper value on the last played witch, moving X-number of locations in a set cycle movement. In the location she lands in, she will check if a dazzled witch is present and eliminate her from the contest.<br/><br/>Next, she will activate a rondel and move a marker to the next position, activating the next Element Gate in line.<br/>By activating the gate she awakens all the witches of this element present at the location, triggering a larger scale confrontation, with the player holding majority inflicting damage equal to the number of withes they have present. The defending player can however fend off part of the attack with opposing witches.<br/><br/>Each witch also cast 1 of 10 unique special spells, each manipulating parts of the duel in devious ways. This additional layer creates tough decisions in an already challenging duel of wits.<br/><br/>Will you control the Astral plane by lowering the mana level of your opponent to &quot;0&quot;?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paradise-Opoly is a nostalgic and detailed memoir of the small mountain town of Paradise, CA that was devastated by wildfire in 2018. The games base mode uses classic monopoly mechanics and is completely redesigned and re-themed around Paradise culture, history and community. The process of whittling down what would be represented from the town involved hundreds of community members suggesting and voting online what should be included. The result is a rich and well-rounded portrayal of our little town. My main purpose in the design of the game was for it to really give someone that feeling of home when they play it, whether you are from there or not. Nearly every person who was in Paradise that day lost everything. Not only their homes, pets and even family members, but they lost their community. The town was completely changed forever in a matter of hours. My intent is to capture the spirit of Paradise that so many love, cherish and miss dearly.<br/><br/>I am not a game developer, by any means. I just had an idea, shortly after the fire, to create this game to commemorate the town. Since that idea I have learned many things and the idea has grown into a beautifully designed and well thought out game. I am currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign and fully expect to reach my funding goal so I can produce 3000 games. 100% of the net-profits from my company sales of the games and merchandise will be donated back to non-profits aimed at immediate rebuilding projects for lower income residents of Paradise. I intend to represent my town and help in any way I can.<br/><br/>The game features fun, vibrant and colorful artwork and design by Traci Van Wagoner and Kurt Keller of Imagine That! Design in New York. They have done an amazing job with conveying the detail and nuance I wanted in every illustration and design. All of the metal game miniatures are custom designed by the very talented 3D sculptor, Chad Hoverter, and represent somethng special and unique to Paradise. Even the old &quot;houses and hotels&quot; are now Miner's Tents and Log Cabins, one of the many references to the very prominent gold rush history of the area. All of the &quot;Property&quot; cards contain a short story or description about the landmark or place they contain. Included is a full color information booklet with extended versions of the stories. For some playing that weren't locals or for kids who may not know all the history of their town the game serves as a fun learning experience of the towns culture and beginnings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is the most noble and heroic way to acquire a dragon egg. Real heroes do it this way.<br/><br/>There are some players with less honor who take an easier approach. An approach that includes stealth and shady figures in cloaks. Those players may simply steal eggs from other players. (Actually this happens pretty often) You may say that this is not that heroic and noble but the result is the same and the dragon egg is as good as one that the heroes could get from a long and exhausting adventure.<br/><br/>The acquired egg still needs to hatch. If you have the right cards - two mages - you can hatch the egg. This is a very delicate process where the mages have to use their magic very carefully so that the creature inside the egg is not hurt. (but usually they just blast it with fireballs) Hatched dragons give victory points and the player who first has three wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1939 to roughly 1945, the age in which the worlds&rsquo; nation fought the greatest conflict in human history, the Second World War. The rules will work for skirmishes in this era, but also in conflicts shortly before and after as the Spanish civil war and the Korean war were largely fought with the same material and tactics.<br/><br/>In an ideal battlefield situation the enemy was pinned in place or disorganised by the concentrated fire of infantry and artillery. Once this was accomplished, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork between units, on fire and movement. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim in this game, is not to annihilate the enemy&rsquo;s units to the last man, but to inflict enough damage that morale is reduced and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and consequently removed from the tabletop. By a clever combination of movement, shooting and dashing cavalry charges, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a group, but also between groups and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>Your role will be that of a commander of a small group of soldiers. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.<br/><br/>So onwards, to glory!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They each secretly support three of the stalls.<br/><br/>There is a deck of tweets (using the actual twitter accounts from the doujin circle and their friends), and retweet cards. By playing tweets, liking and retweeting, they can promote the stalls they support.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they get to do any two actions from three (same action if they like):<br/><br/>Choose one of the three posts on the common timeline and 'Like' it to apply the card effect.<br/><br/>Refresh the timeline, which turns on new posts and removes old ones from the timeline.<br/><br/>'Retweet', which brings back to the timeline a post that was liked in the past, although its use is limited.<br/><br/>As they players perform the actions, their stock of customers goes down. The game ends when all the customers are gone.<br/><br/>The player who earns the most points wins the game by comparing the number of customers in their supporting shop, secretly decided at the beginning of the game, and finally adding up the bonuses for meeting special conditions.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

With the beleaguered Stormcast who followed Morathi into the Eightpoints making their retreat back across the Bloodwind Spoil, and the Seraphon beginning their own assault upon Archaon's realm, what could the first and greatest of the Daemon Princes have in store?<br/><br/>The third instalment in the Broken Realms series sees the hidden machinations of Be'lakor come to the fore as the Dark Master begins to take a more direct role in the Mortal Realms' events. The dire consequences will ripple across multiple factions, including an unforeseen alliance between Chaos and Death, the march of the Seraphon's Celestial Stampede, and the introduction of siege warfare to Warhammer Age of Sigmar.<br/><br/>Inside this 112-page hardback book, you'll find:<br/><br/><br/>     The chilling tale of Be'lakor's grand plan to usurp the Everchosen and take his place as the foremost champion of Chaos<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Rules for the Legion of the First Prince, including an expanded warscroll for Be'lakor himself and updated battle traits, spells and artefacts for his Slaves to Darkness warband<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Coalition of Death rules allowing you to play team-based games including 3 or more players, who may need to team up temporarily to take out a threatening foe while keeping an eye out for their so-called 'allies'<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Six battleplans to help you recreate pivotal moments from the story, as well as Realms of Battle rules to represent the unique locations they were fought in<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Rules to tie the battleplans into a narrative campaign depicting Be'lakor's assault upon the Mortal Realms<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A bounty of warscrolls, warscroll battalions and unit updates for Kharadron Overlords, Fyreslayers, Stormcast Eternals, Disciples of Tzeentch, Nighthaunt, and Seraphon<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The price of the different gemstones varies according to demand; when players put out new designs and clusters, prices go up, and fall for the gems out of popularity. Players aim to be the richest jeweller by the end of four rounds.<br/><br/>The game has 120 gem cards for different types, from 10 diamonds to 24 jet. The deck is varied for the number of players.<br/><br/>Once the deck is prepared and shuffled, players are dealt 8 hand cards. (If the deck is exhausted leter, discards are shuffled over).<br/><br/>Players then select one card to keep as stock, placing it face-down in front of them, and pass their hand to their neighbour (alternating each round). Then players can sell gems or sets of gems from their hand and make cash.<br/><br/>The value of what they sell is determined by a scoring plan, and alters each round. At the end of the game, there is a final bonus too.<br/><br/>Players can now move the prices of the gem types up or down, according to what they did and did not sell. After this, players are dealt back to 8 cards (or as best can be done), and the game continues.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the stock cards the players have been collecting are scored for a final bonus. After this, most cash wins.<br/><br/>The distribution of the gem cards matters, and players try to keep in mind which gems they have seen and which have been sold. Understanding which are going to be rarer by the end of the game is a key strategy.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

By building stations, operating typical businesses on the stations, such as convenience stores, and increasing passengers, players score points to win.<br/><br/>The game has a board on which track cards are placed. Each card has three rail lines in different patterns and hence 6 points of entry/exit. Each card also has two stations, of municipal, dept store or skyscraper types.<br/><br/>The 12 business cards score victory points when built. They come in three types, cafes, retail, and two hotels.<br/><br/>The passenger cards score points when certain conditions are met. For example, 2 points for each municipal station on the line.<br/><br/>Players have their own markers; station, train, and action markers. The train markers go onto spaces around the board, marking the start and finish of their rail lines. The action markers go on an action board, which sets player order. In the round, players move their markers to select their actions in the round.<br/><br/>Players can select a business action, draw business cards and select the one they want, passing the remaining cards to other players who selected the same action. Being able to build a mix of businesses can earn bonus points at the end.<br/><br/>Players can then build out their rail line from hand cards dealt at the start and place a station marker. Completing lines allows a player to recover their markers. After this, some additional actions can be triggered, such as building tunnels.<br/><br/>Then conditions are checked for four open passenger cards. If a card is satisfied, players can score points, and the card is discarded. A fourth card is drawn, until no more are available.<br/><br/>The players action markers are moved back to determine the turn order, and rail cards are dealt back to each player and the game continues.<br/><br/>When the map is filled out, the game ends and players calculate their final scores. The most points wins the game for the best subway network builder.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I have nightmares of the Juggernaut, and I have never seen one.<br/><br/>Released in June 2006, this Captain&rsquo;s Log issue supports Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander, and Federation &amp; Empire. &ldquo;Snap Count,&rdquo; by Stephen V. Cole, has the appearance of Juggernaut Beta in Federation territory. Can Star Fleet, combined with the Federation Police and National Guard, defend Arcturus?  &ldquo;The Silence of the Dead,&rdquo;  by Randy O. Green, follows a Romulan ship that finds a derelict alien vessel in Tholian territory.<br/><br/>In addition to the story, History includes information on Tholian patrol corvettes and destroyers, with a class history of the latter, along with details on the Klingon Empire Security Service and the G1 gunboat.<br/><br/>As is usual, Communications informs readers about the company&rsquo;s activities. Captain&rsquo;s Log #32 and Federation Commander: Klingon Attack have after-action reports. The company laid out its plans for new print releases and metal miniatures for the coming year, including new materials for Federation Commander. There are questions and answers about submissions to ADB. The Input Guide has information about the style sheet that ADB follows. Proposals for Star Fleet Battles are presented. Admiral Growler answers SFB questions. More &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions get answered. There is a page of filk songs.<br/><br/>Federation Commander has prototype rules for the Lyrans&rsquo; expanding spheres. There is a page of tactics papers. The three following scenarios appear:<br/><br/>     The First Battle of Juggernaut Beta (Juggernaut Beta against anyone who wants to fight it),<br/>     Starhunt, the Stolen Freighters (Orion pirates and police), and <br/>     the Battle of Juggernaut Alpha (Juggernaut Alpha faces the &ldquo;allies&rdquo;) provide challenges for Federation Commander players.<br/><br/><br/>This issue includes six scenarios for Star Fleet Battles. * SL246, Stand at Arcturus, is based on the story &ldquo;Snap Count.&rdquo; <br/><br/>     SL247, Tentative Response, is set in the Magellanic Galaxy and pits Maghadim against the Baduvai.  <br/>     SL248, Different Romulans, set during the Early Years, involves an encounter between the Vulcans and Gorns. <br/>     SL249, And None Shall Pass, is set in the Omega Octant and is a two-way battle between the Loriyill and Drex. A three-way version allows a third player to fly the Chlorophon ship. <br/>     SL250, A Dark and Stormy Day, has the Hydrans facing the Vudar.  <br/>     SL251, Who Ordered the PFs?, a battle station&rsquo;s PFs are absent, but a tug is on the way with replacements. Will the tug get the gunboats to the battle station in time without being destroyed itself?<br/><br/><br/>Database articles include battlegroups designed with 1,00 points and the required use of a tug or light tactical transport if the empire didn&rsquo;t have a tug. There is an article on the sun snake. SFB campaigns get a new rule for casual cargo storage. The Fast Patrol ship campaign is updated. There is a guide for Tholians to convert captured foreign ships to fit into Tholian fleets and vice versa.<br/><br/>The Tactics section has &ldquo;Fog of War 4&rdquo; by Jim Hart. The primer focuses on the Magellanic empires, exploring this new region&rsquo;s standard tactics and counter-tactics. There are two pages of term papers.<br/><br/>The Venues section covers Star Fleet Command, SFB On-Line, playing by email, Galactic Conquest, Star Fleet Warlord, Prime Directive (with a look at Tholian biology), and Star Fleet Battle Force.<br/><br/>Federation &amp; Empire has a status update along with rules and rulings, Q&amp;A, and proposals. There are two pages of tactical notes. There is a new scenario, (674) The Long Distance War.<br/><br/>New ships are added for Star Fleet Battles. Everyone gets the civilian planetary operations base. The Federation gets the following destroyer variations: emergency management ship, Middle Years destroyer, deckhouse destroyer, deckhouse light carrier, deckhouse destroyer transport, heavy destroyer, heavy destroyer carrier, heavy destroyer transport, heavy destroyer minesweeper, and heavy commando transport.  <br/>The Tholians get the scout destroyer and &ldquo;White Widow&rdquo; destroyer carrier, both destroyer variants. They also get SSDs for the following captured ships: Federation police cutter, Romulan police ship, Orion Light Raider, and Klingon G2 gunboat. Juggernaut Beta from the cover story gets its SSD. Federation Commander gets new ship cards for the Lyran Jaguar war cruiser, Hydran Mongol medium cruiser, WYN war cruiser, and ISC light cruiser. These four ships are in fleet scale.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only to do that you have to find ways of maximizing your efforts with the Construction Vehicles, which end up all over the yard and depending when you use them, they will provide different bonuses.<br/><br/>Plot out the construction of your Buildings by collecting materials, even off turn. Each Building has a special power and can only be constructed once. Often points are gained at times when Buildings are constructed, which can lead to intriguing timing to maximize the value those buildings will earn.<br/><br/>Take care to use abilities to shift dice, even to rows they wouldn&rsquo;t normally be in, finding the Bulldozer in the Dump Truck&rsquo;s row can show of some truly versatile play! Plus dice remain where they are until they are used, only then are they rerolled. Did you set yourself up for a great play later on or will your opponents pounce on it first?<br/><br/>Under Construction is a game of utilizing Construction Vehicles to gain their favor and also resources to erect buildings. Buildings create an engine to further utilize the Construction Vehicles. In the end, the player who did both the best will walk away victorious. Watch for clever combos and Vehicles moving outside of their lanes to create chaos and new opportunities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Traditional values are generally assigned to the colors (i.e. RED = $5), but some color values can change for particular players based on various bonuses awarded.<br/><br/>Players take turns with opportunities to TAKE one poker chip for themselves from the top of any one stack or GIVE one to another player from the top of any one stack.  The latter action is only constructive for winning because on the GIVER's next turn, it awards him the bonus of taking exactly 2 chips from the top of any combination of stacks (or 2 from the top of the same stack); once per round they may even take 3 chips in the same manner.<br/><br/>Play proceeds until rounds equal to the number of players are played. Each round, values are tallied; the final accumulative highest grand total tally wins.<br/><br/>This is mostly a strategy game with not much luck, except for the initial set-up that offers a bit of luck; this is balanced by letting each player start a round in a game.<br/><br/>TOMA: Take;  DACA: Give  (in Spanish)<br/><br/>",

While you enjoy visiting places with spring-like weather, islands surrounded by turquoise water, and peaceful oases with the loveliest sunsets, you relish the experiences and connections with the people you meet throughout your journey that enhance your perspective and enrich your world.<br/><br/>To win, all you have to do is to collect a minimum of 3 Passport Stamps and the most Connection cards. You start with 1 Passport Stamp collected and the game ends when someone gets 4. Each Traveler who has at least 3 Passport Stamps then adds up the Connection cards they have. You may not be the one who got the most Passport Stamps, but you could still have made more connections and win!<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die and move the number of spaces rolled. When you land on the Passport Office, you can collect that Continent's Passport Stamp, using the Capital and Connection cards collected along the way. Getting connections is as simple as landing on the space, then reading and voting on a statement. You get a connection when the majority agrees with you! You will need money for expenses and to pay for Passport Stamps. Luckily, there are cards that can help you in numerous ways - by moving you across continents in one move, winning a lottery, and even getting free Passport Stamps! But watch out because they also can land you in jail or incur unexpected expenses.<br/><br/>",

Only the might of the Royal Navy stands between him and the British Isles &ndash; that and Napoleon&rsquo;s own meddling in international politics. Austria and Russia, thrust into the welcoming embrace of Britain, mobilize their forces... Will the British forge a Grand Coalition and annihilate Napoleon&rsquo;s armies in one decisive battle? Or will the Emperor force his enemies to submit after a series of dazzling campaigns?<br/><br/>Pursuit of Victory is a 2-player game of military conquest and diplomatic realignment, of bold action and meticulous planning, playable in a couple of hours. Napoleon will have to face an ever-shifting combination of European powers, consider the fate of Spanish and Polish people, and keep an eye on small, but mobile British forces. Britain will have to contain Napoleon&rsquo;s ambitions, stoke the fire of Spanish insurrection, subsidize their allies and wait for an opportunity to strike a crucial blow against the French.<br/> In Pursuit of Victory players simultaneously play two cards. One for its initiative value and up to two actions, and the other one for its various military and diplomatic effects. Each player has a hand of 10 cards and playing any given card makes it unavailable for next 2-3 turns. And there are always the two national questions looming ahead. The French can recreate Poland and take over Spain, but will the gains outweigh the costs?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A map scale is not given.<br/><br/>The rules leave a lot of basic movement and combat procedures unspoken (it is stated that familiarity with other games is assumed). Many rules are devoted to the difficulties of moving, fighting, and supplying units in the mountainous terrain.<br/><br/>The game generally lasts for 12 turns but may be extended up to 16 by the Italian player at a cost of 15 victory points per turn. Victory points are earned by eliminating opposing units, holding certain cities, and (for the Italians) exiting certain parts of the map.<br/><br/>Fixed reinforcements enter on the second turn and the Italians may bring in optional reinforcements later at a cost. A few British units and RAF support may appear later as well.<br/><br/>The game can be combined with Egypt: David vs. Goliath – The Italian-African Campaign and Crete, Gibraltar, &amp; Malta.<br/><br/>",

The BestFriendShiitake. includes a special supplement book written by Shiitake., the Japanese popular fortune teller, and can be enjoyed as a psychological test.<br/><br/>In this game, players take turns one by one, and become a question giver. The giver draws a question card randomly from the draw pile, and announces the question written on it. There are questions like &quot;What do I think is the must have food for picnic?&quot; or &quot;What do I want?&quot; Other players write the answers that would most please the question giver according to the giver&rsquo;s character and taste, and submit it to the giver. For example, you could write sandwitches, rice balls, or summer rolls for must have food for picnic.<br/><br/>When everyone's answers are submitted, the giver shuffles the answers and then looks at them secretly. This is the best moment in this game! Looking at the answers everyone wrote to please you makes you happy and blushing.<br/><br/>The giver ranks the answers depending on their subjectivity, reveals and announces the answers from the least accurate without identifying who has written what. It would be more fun if you comment when you reveal an answer. Lastly, announce the best one. Only the person who wrote that answer claims it, and they get the question card as a point.<br/><br/>Keep doing this, and the game ends after certain rounds. The person with the most question cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A whole &quot;Team&quot; Based on its lead characters is worth Ten points, incomplete teams are only worth one point per character(For a maximum of four) if you have no complete teams, you lose automatically. The hands are broken up into their teams and incomplete ones are compiled into another deck.<br/><br/>The player with the least points starts the team battles by playing one card from one team and may only use this team until it is gone, same with the enemy player.

Circling with the pawn is accomplished by answering questions on Islamic topics. The questions are divided into five difficulty levels. The more difficult the question, the more steps you can take if you answer it correctly. If a player, for example, correctly answers a question from category two, he or she can take two steps forward with the pawn.<br/><br/>Winning:<br/>The goal of the game is to be the first to circle the Kaaba seven times with the pawn. The pawns are moved counterclockwise around the Kaaba just as is the case with the real Kaaba in Mecca.

Captured by the Germans in 1941, the Kriegsmarine renamed her the Drache (dragon) and converted her back to a Flugzeugbergungsschiff &ndash; an aircraft rescue ship. Drache underwent a refit back to being a minelayer in the spring or summer of 1942 and was moved to the Aegean. She was re-equipped with two 105 mm (4.1&quot;) guns, five 37 mm and six 20 mm cannons. A rear platform was added with space for 240 mines on four rails. The Kriegsmarine renamed her Schiff, but she is better known as Drache so the name is retained here. The large flat rear deck made her suitable to test the concept of a helicopter carrier &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first &ndash; using a Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) as a spotter aircraft.<br/><br/>The Kolibri was the world&rsquo;s first naval helicopter. It was unarmed but the Kriegsmarine intended to use it for submarine spotting. It could also be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance.<br/><br/>Pack contains 1 resin &amp; metal vessel and game cards. The full rules for fielding Drache (and helicopter) in Cruel Seas can be found in the Close Quarters supplement<br/><br/>",

        "description": "May 1942 saw the first major, considered offensive by the Red Army in the war against Germany. Expectations were high, with four Soviet armies aiming to encircle the German Sixth Army and to recapture the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union. Those expectations were dashed within a fortnight by the German Army&rsquo;s ability to absorb the offensive and launch a counteroffensive of its own which, in its turn, encircled two Soviet armies.<br/><br/>Kharkov, May 1942 &ndash; The Last Disaster is a miniature wargames campaign system, designed for two to four players, covering these events. It is designed for games in which a stand represents a platoon or in which the main unit of manoeuvre is the battalion. Suitable rules would include Spearhead, Blitzkrieg Commander, Command Decision: TOB, A Fistful of Tows, Rapid Fire Reloaded and others, including those which wargamers may have written themselves.<br/><br/>The system generates fifty or so hours of gaming spread over ten to fifteen individual battles which are fought over six to fifteen daily campaign turns. The number of turns is flexible and determined by whether either player can encircle the enemy&rsquo;s forces. Progress in the campaign is measured along campaign tracks representing the two major axes of attack with a number of battlefield &lsquo;spaces&rsquo;. Each turn players decide whether to attack or not and then which parts of their total forces they commit to any ensuing battle. Battles will generally be around a brigade or regiment of four to eight battalions on each side. The results of each on table battle determine the speed of advance on the main campaign map.<br/><br/>The book includes<br/><br/>     a brief history of the campaign<br/>     background information useful in adapting the system to different sets of rules and suggestions for additional optional rules<br/>     a comprehensive set of Appendices covering<br/>         the Tables of Organisation and Equipment to platoon level for all divisions and regiments involved (around forty regimental sized formations)<br/>         a record of the At Start forces and reinforcements<br/>         a chart to track the position and composition of forces on each attack axis<br/>         19 colour terrain squares of the battlefields (based on nearly 600 square miles of original 1930s maps) which can be used to generate 570 six feet by four feet tabletops<br/>         a Campaign Quick Reference Sheet<br/>         a colour A4 Campaign Map<br/>         a set of suggestions to convert the system to Bob Cordery&rsquo;s Portable Wargame rules<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     100 A4 pages with 20+ colour illustrations.<br/><br/><br/>&ndash; Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players are divided into three camps: mafia, citizens and outlaws. The game is played in the same way as a regular werewolf game, but with the added bonus of having a weapon of choice for each position. In addition, the game progresses faster because there are players in all camps with the ability to kill.

The second deck F1 Faith &amp; Fallen integrates with the first deck S1, however the publisher recommends using opaque sleeves for play as the card backs are different.<br/><br/>Each player has their own deck and build a particular set from it before they begin. The publisher recommends some different builds for easy through to hard play. The artwork is fairly mature and the publisher suggest age 15+ for players. The publisher has revised some card text and powers on their website since the decks were originally produced.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>Cradle is set in a distant celestial world where a race of beings with a similar culture and appearance to our own thrive.<br/><br/>A few years ago, a great and tragic war took place there.<br/><br/>The war between the powerful &quot;Academies&quot; and the &quot;Earth Incoming Faction&quot; of the Beastmaster has taken much and left new embers.<br/><br/>You take the role of a hero character and fight against your opponents' heroes.

        "description": "A fun strategy game in which players choose to play one out of 4 different consultants. Each consultant carries their own ability that players can build their strategy on. In the game, players manage their actions at the expense of working hours of which each player only has a limited amount for each round. Thus, resource management will be a key factor to win the game. Working hours can be used for lobbying politicians, getting an intern to receive additional working hours, receiving effect cards, or acquiring courses and projects which will educate your character and provide you with additional income.    While the game is round based, players can also take an active role, even if it is not their turn, by playing effect cards or participate in auctions for either projects or courses.<br/><br/>The base game can be played in three different versions. Which allow players to opt between an asymmetrical and symmetrical gameplay or change the numbers of components in the game to adjust the difficulty of play.<br/><br/>While the game mechanics require a strategic mindset, the actual theme of the game is a satire about the consulting industry. Effects like &ldquo;Auditor&rdquo; who is displayed as a blind person and approves important documents with his stamp, should remind players how shady the industry can be (Auditing firms caused the financial crisis in 2008 because they assigned ratings without evaluating them properly).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As the commander of a World War III superpower you need to use all the weapons at your disposal in this all-out-war to control rare earth minerals, oil and strategic industries.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of cards. Each round/trick is a battle over a few battleground cards placed in the middle of the table. The winner of the trick gets first pick on what battleground to conquer which is then placed face-up in front of that player. Then the 2nd best player in the trick gets to conquer a card etc.<br/><br/>Besides classical trick-taking strategies one must consider what continent the battleground card belongs to (set collection), what actions are triggered when you conquer the card (e.g. change current trump), if you can complete a nuke (which functions as &ldquo;super trump&rdquo;), if there are industries, oil, rare earth minerals or support to research space or drone warfare (worth dominance points) and if there is a strong resistance (negative points). The card you play in the current trick will be a new battleground card for the upcoming trick which must also be factored in when choosing what card to play.<br/><br/>The player with the most dominance points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

These cards show jokers or numbers corresponding to question categories. Depending on how many times a category shows up in the slot cards, a question of that category's value increases from 50 to 100 to 200 (or 100 to 200 to 500 for jokers). Correct answers award points, but wrong answers give the next player a shot at the points. During a question round when a player reaches $500 they get to play the final prize round to end the show.<br/><br/>In the prize round the three slots are filled with a prize card from three decks of prize cards of varying values, and players can push their luck to turn over the slots one by one. Prizes accumulate for the player and cards reset as they push their luck until they reveal a devil card, choose to stop, or reach $1000 which gives them the big bonus of $5000.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most money after each player has had a turn as the master of ceremonies and at least one turn as a contestant.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This represents using social media. You draw from this at the END of your turn, constantly thwarting your own attempts to use all your cards and end with an empty hand.<br/><br/>The second is the Real Life deck. You have to earn draws from this deck. It's a mixed bag, but each good card reduces the amount of cards you need to draw each turn. Some of them also have power ups that help you get rid of your cards quicker.<br/><br/>Share Content to collect Reacts and then spend that emotional currency to draw from the Real Life deck. The more Real Life cards you have on the board the less Content you'll have to draw at the end of each turn. When you end a turn with no cards in hand and no draw requirement you win the game by being a Quitter.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Turns are split into two phases, a day phase and a night phase, in which different kinds of animals can attack, depending on their natural habits. You can try to block attacks against you, and you will try to increase the number of resource cards on the table to be able to add more cards to your layout.

        "description": "Hegemon: A Wargaming Campaign in Ancient Greece is set circa 340BCE and pits Macedon against Persia with Greece as the battlefield. <br/>It is specifically designed for DBA 3.0 but is likely to be easily adapted to other sets of rules which cater for battles of around ten to 20 units.<br/><br/>The campaign features a point to point map of Greece. Each turn represents a year and consists of a winter administration phase and two campaign seasons. <br/>Campaigns are likely to last three to five years (although a spectacular failure could see a campaign concluded in a single year) and likely to feature an average of three battles per year.<br/><br/>During winter players spend their budget to bribe/persuade Greek city states in a variety of ways to make them amenable to a player's plans and to buy new elements to reinforce armies in the following year. <br/>During each of the two campaign seasons players move their army or armies on the map and invade hostile Greek states, the armies of which are played by the opposing player.<br/><br/>The winner of the campaign will be the player who allies the greatest number of Greek states, or at least renders them neutral, by the time either Macedon or Persia cannot field an army sufficiently strong to continue.<br/><br/>Although written with this specific hypothetical campaign as its basis, the campaign mechanisms are portable to other eras and armies, with the requirement only that the player create an appropriate point to point map of the area of operations. The article includes half a dozen ways in which to vary the original campaign and brief notes suggesting other historical conflicts of the classical period which might be simulated.<br/><br/>The article is fourteen pages long and incorporates a campaign map and a budget tracking graphic.<br/><br/>Finally it also presents a very simple methodology for resolving battles in a DBA style using any flat surface and 30 or so dice of different colours. This will allow the player to experiment with the campaign framework without committing himself to six to twelve DBA battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Use every trick in the book and reach the highest levels to rule the Republic of Venice!<br/>Waltz of the Masks is a card game of actions, placements and combinations.<br/><br/>Objective of the game :<br/>The main objective is to have the most influence points, and therefore usually the most &quot;revealed&quot; cards in the highest position, before the end of the game.

        "description": "Total Control Wrestling! The game where you decide how the storylines unfold on TV!<br/><br/>Total Control Wrestling provides players with an entire game system focused on a wrestling promotion with a weekly TV show. Every week, the show builds on the characters, storylines, feuds, and angles of the previous shows. It&rsquo;s like watching your favorite weekly wrestling show on TV. You never know what will happen, who will show up, or what matches you may see. But one thing is for sure&hellip; it will lead to a knock-down, drag-out, feud-settling match down the road!<br/><br/>Create your own wrestlers or use those included in the game to get right into the action! The random creation process allows you to generate a wrestler&rsquo;s physical stats, never knowing what you may get. Will it be a giant? Or a luchador? Then you decide the wrestler&rsquo;s style and attributes to fit the prototype. Alternately, players can disregard the random process and assign any stats and attributes as they see fit, making the wrestler of their dreams! Perhaps you want to make replicas of the stars you watch on TV? You can do that, too!<br/><br/>The game system allows players to customize and use whatever elements they want and disregard the rest. Players can track everything built into the game system or use the most basic aspects for matches. Only want to use the Match Charts to determine winners in one-off matches? You can. Want to leave out the XP and Character Progression? You can do that without affecting the rest of the game. If detailing all the Feuds is too much work, leave that out and let the charts tell the stories from one show to the next. For the ultimate experience, get out some paper and pencils and run an entire promotion, keeping track of every stat, win, loss, storyline, angle, and feud from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The Chart Manual guides the general action of the TV show. However, players add the details, develop the personalities, and use their own creativity to enhance the show as it tells the stories from week-to-week. Angles, interviews, and scenarios will build Feuds between rivals until they can settle it once-and-for-all in the ring. New feuds will emerge, old feuds will re-start, wrestlers will turn on each other, and more! The game system provides the methods and means, but it is up to you to decide how and why it happened.<br/><br/>You have Total Control!<br/><br/>",

Players move along a life path, starting at birth, through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, always on the way to happiness. The movement of the game pieces is controlled first by a dice and later by cards. The cards also contain texts with positive and negative experiences, which materialize green happiness stones and / or black ballast stones that you carry in a backpack. At some points in the game, only a certain amount of ballast may be carried. If you have too much, you have to go back and try to get rid of the ballast. In addition, you collect suns and stars on a characteristic board, which in turn must be filled to a certain degree to be allowed to enter the target field. The winner is the one who could collect the most stars.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fun collection of strategy games in a practical format, for many one-on-one challenges, wherever you want and with whoever you want.  Are you ready? Choose the game, take the marker and think about the right move!<br/><br/>The pack contains 7 boards on which the boards of the following classic abstract games are shown: GOMOKU - NIM - DOTS &amp; BOXES - SNAKES - MAMMA VS PAPPA - CHINESE WALL.<br/><br/>GOMOKU It is an ancient strategy game also called &quot;five in a row&quot;. The players take turns marking a square with their symbol (eg &quot;O&quot; and &quot;X&quot;). The first player to get five of their own symbols aligned, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game.<br/><br/>NIM It is an ancient game of unknown origins. The players take turns erasing one or more cans from a single row.  They must remove at least one jar and can remove any number of cans from the same row.  The last player able to move wins.<br/><br/>DOTS &amp; BOXES It is a &quot;pencil and paper&quot; game with countless variations. How to play The two players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between two adjacent points.  If a player completes the fourth side of a square, he marks that square with the initial of his name (or a letter of recognition) and must immediately draw another line (as if it were an extra turn).  When all squares have been filled, the player who has captured the most squares is the winner.<br/><br/>SNAKES It is the &quot;pen and paper&quot; version of an old video game.  How to play It is played on a 7 x 7 point matrix.  The first player starts from the green &quot;S&quot; point in the upper left, while the other starts with the red &quot;S&quot; point in the lower right, as shown in the image.  Players take turns growing their snake, extending it one segment at a time by drawing a horizontal or vertical line from the previous point to an adjacent one.  The first player unable to move loses.<br/><br/>MOM VS PAPPA It is a &quot;pen and paper&quot; strategy game: the aim is to recreate the word MOM for one player and the word PAPPA on the grid for the other. At the beginning of the game, the players decide who plays for PAPPA (inserting the letters P and A) and who for MOMMA (inserting the letters Me A).  On his turn, the player inserts one of the two letters of his word in any box, without having to use the same letter every turn.  The player who is the first to spell his word horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.<br/><br/>CHINESE WALL is a simple and fun game.  The aim is to be the last player to create a wall that spans three territories.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A game of language skill and strategy to train the minds of young and old.<br/><br/>Mix the letter tiles and arrange them in the center of the table forming a 5x5 square.  Each player takes a marker, a word-form board and a joker triangle.  Procedure The youngest player places the black placeholder on a letter-card of his choice.  Each player then chooses a letter (present in the selected tile) and writes it on their word-form board (in one of the circles).  Then the next player moves the placeholder onto another letter-card adjacent to the previous one (the movement can take place by one step).  The process is repeated up to that the players have not completed the six letters on their wordform board.  At this point the players, within 30 seconds, must write a meaningful word using their transcribed letters.  Each player will earn as many points as there are letters in the written word.  The score achieved by each player must be written in the corresponding space on the scorecard.  Jolly Triangle During a round, players can play the joker by placing the triangle of their color on the active letter-tile: in the word formation phase, they will be able to use a letter present in that tile an infinite number of times.  New round The trailing player takes the placeholder and starts a new round in the same way as the previous one.  The game continues and ends when a player reaches 20 points (or more or less at the players' choice).  He will be the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An intriguing party game, which stimulates empathy between players. Tell an episode you lived and imagine the moods you felt: will others be able to guess them?<br/><br/>The youngest player starts and briefly tells a real fact that he has experienced or an imaginary situation that could happen to him, without naming the emotions he felt. In the situation described, he must imagine the prevailing emotions he felt before, during and at the end of what happened.  He then writes on his card (with the erasable marker) the number 1 in correspondence with the emotion he felt before, the number 2 in correspondence with the emotion he felt during and the number 3 in correspondence with the emotion that he has  tried in the end.  All this, taking care not to show your card to your opponents.  In the meantime, the other competitors also proceed to mark the emotions they imagine on their cards was able to try the narrator before, during and at the end. At this point, the emotion cards are revealed and scores are calculated by comparing the narrator's emotion card with those of the competitors.  The game continues in the same way: the new narrator will be the next in a clockwise direction to the last hand, Warning: if during the story the narrator names an emotion (for example he says &quot;I was very anxious before the exam&quot;)  game and the turn passes to the next competitor.<br/><br/>Each competitor earns 1 point for each emotion right in the right time position within the story.  He receives a 3-point bonus if he guesses all three emotions in the right order.  The narrator earns 1 point for each of the emotions guessed by the contestants.  Each player keeps his score by taking the appropriate tokens.  The winner is the one who has scored the most points after 1 or 2 laps (at the competitors' choice).<br/><br/>",

An original party game that trains your creative writing skills, but beware: you don't have to use the poisonous letter!<br/><br/>The youngest player begins, placing the letter marker above the letter board in any position (but which frames one of the letters well) and then moves it on the board by one or two steps (at his discretion, but only in  horizontally or vertically).  At this point he draws a subject map and the game begins.  All competitors, within the time of an hourglass, must write (each on their own slate) a complete sentence of at least 5 words, which is inspired by an element of the map-subject caught and in which the letter indicated by the  letter-marker: this will be the &quot;poisonous letter&quot;: At the end of the round, the competitors who have managed to write a meaningful sentence earn a point for each word used in the composition (articles, prepositions and other monosyllables are not counted).  If a player realizes that he has used the poisonous letter, he does not score points and also loses all those previously earned.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, the hand passes to the next player and the procedure is repeated. The game ends when one of the competitors reaches 50 points (depending on the agreements between the players.) If the subject maps run out, they are reshuffled. Wildcard If a player draws a subject map with a joker, instead it is played at the Letter Catcher.  The player who drew the Jolly map draws another subject map to establish the theme of the test.  Therefore, within the time of the hourglass, all competitors must write a complete sentence (of at least 5 words), which is inspired by an element of the subject-map drawn and is made up of as many words starting with the indicated letter.  For each word that begins with the indicated letter, they earn one point.<br/><br/>",

He writes two definitions on his own slate, one right and one wrong, trying to trick the opponent.  The opponent chooses the definition. If he gets it right, he wins 3 points, otherwise 3 points go to the player.<br/><br/>",

A challenge that tests expressive skills, intuition and creativity.<br/><br/>The youngest player begins and draws an inspiration card and tums the spinner. The spinner indicates, in the outer circle, a theme (for example cinema), while in the inner circle, an action to be performed (for example, mimic). The player then has 20 seconds to find a subject that is consistent with the theme and inspiration card. He/she then writes the identified subject on the small board, without showing it to others. Subsequently, he/she has a minute to have the other players guess the written subject using the action indicated by the spinner. At the end of the round the scores are calculated and the game continues. The next player will be the one on the right of the last one to spin the spinner.<br/><br/>In addition to defining the theme (cinema, sports, art, music, occupations and literature), the spinner indicates one of the following tests: drawing (with the large board and erasable marker and without using letters), verbal explanation,(without pronouncing the words in the solution) and miming 9 (without uttering any words). When the spinner indicates the chain segment, the player must invite another player to play his/her turn, and to freely choose one of the three skills above indicated.<br/><br/>The winner is the one who first reaches 10 points (or more, or less, as decided by the players at the beginning of the game).

Any head, torso and leg cards are placed face up on the table and the action cards (and brain card) are hidden in the players hand. When it's a players turn they can either play a body card or an action card.

The other players can deny the brain when revealed which makes that zombie loose their brain and has to keep going. Unless they have a matching zombie (the three parts 'belong' together).

To do this players must use die rolls, abilities, and spells to capture the center gate. Once a player is gatekeeper they will then become very powerful, and the rest of the players must team up to destroy the GK. One unique aspect of the game is that the board turns, giving players a plethora of strategies to get an edge on their opponents. Each board position gives way to new paths and opportunities. Use your hero's strengths to your advantage to devise a plan to capture and hold the center gate so that you will be deemed victorious... but do not get to eager, as any game of Gatekeeper can turn in an instant. With a bit of luck, wit, determination, and the roll of a die, you could kill the gatekeeper and conquer the gates yourself.<br/><br/>The game is a fantasy game where you pick a hero and attack gates to get bonuses and ultimately capture the center gate. Once you capture the center you must survive against the rest of the players as they team up to take the center gate from you. If you survive you win!<br/><br/>Each turn you will take your hero's trait card and roll a die to see what trait/ability you get to use this turn. Then you will have the opportunity to roll your dice to attack a gate. Your hero will have bonuses on some gates and will destroy them easier than others, if you capture a gate you will unlock abilities that can be used to further attack more gates on other turns. Your turn ends when you attack the gate.<br/><br/>When a player captures the center they become Gatekeeper, then for the next three turns all of the other players team up and try to kill them. To do this they can use special gate abilities called keeper attacks. To increase your chances at winning, you need to be prepared for the Keeper attacks that will be used against you. If you survive the three rotations you win the game, if not, you are out of the game and players reset the board and attempt to capture center again.<br/><br/>To win, you need to survive or be the last man standing!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A trivia game about horses. The game board has two sides, a cross-country course and a steeple chase course. The game can be played on either side of the board, but the goal is always to finish ahead of the other players.<br/><br/>Movement is decided by a combination of dice and answering trivia questions. The player is asked a question, and they add the dice value to the value of the correctly-answered question to get their movement for the turn. A player can usually opt out of the trivia, but that will slow down their movement to just the die roll. An incorrect answer ends the player's turn without advancing.<br/><br/>When an obstacle is in the way, the player must answer a trivia question to advance past the obstacle.<br/><br/>The first player to cross the finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>",

All players (regardless of whether they played any effect cards or not) can draw 1 card or more if they played the &quot;EXTRA&quot; effect card  at the end of their turn.<br/><br/>The deck contains the exact amount of gold so it is impossible for the deck to run out of cards without anyone winning.<br/><br/>There are also varying amounts of effect cards allowing players to steal cards, draw more, skip turns, force players to return gold back to the deck, re-order the top 3 cards, trade cards, look in other players hands, and a card that allows you to block any of these effects (including blocks themselves).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches the required amount of gold which is different depending on the number of players playing:<br/>2 Players: 30 Gold<br/>3 Players: 20 Gold<br/>4 Players: 15 Gold<br/>5 Players: 12 Gold<br/>6 Players: 10 Gold<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players begin in the middle of one side of the board, called the &quot;paddock.&quot; Letter tiles are placed on alternating tiles on the grid, with empty spaces between each tile.<br/><br/>The players then use chess-style movement to collect the letter tiles before ending the round in a designated corner of the board. Once a player lands in a corner square, the &quot;stables,&quot; their play is ended and they must wait for other players to finish.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players spell a word with the tiles they have collected. The highest scoring tile wins. Players who did not end in a &quot;stable&quot; get no points.<br/><br/>",

They can also be used by any faction in the game.<br/><br/>Omen Cards<br/>Ancient Greek culture was steeped in tradition, belief and superstition, considered both bad or good with many of these varying from region to region. A vulture flying the wrong way across a battlefield has caused engagements to end abruptly with all participants packing up and returning to their cities. This element has been added to Mortal Gods with the inclusion of the Omens Deck, with the Omens being read as the game progresses.<br/><br/>During play whenever a red Omen marker is taken from the Draw, the player who drew it takes the topmost Omen card from the Omen deck. He then reads the card description aloud before following the rules on the Omen card immediately.<br/><br/>Gifts Cards<br/>In ancient times extraordinarily rare or lucky objects&mdash; or people with extraordinary strength or speed&mdash;were thought to be gifts from the Gods.<br/>Gifts can be given to a warrior in one of two ways: they either have Gifts already included in their Roster card which is reflected in their initial points value, or you can purchase Gifts for the Warriors of your Lochos by spending roster points to obtain them.<br/><br/>Both Heroes and Companions can be given Gifts. To do this simply include the points value as indicated on the individual Gift cards while rostering your Lochos. You can give a warrior as many Gifts as they have actions and, unless stated on the card, you may only use one Gift per activation.<br/><br/>Injury Cards<br/>Only Heroes gain Injury cards.<br/><br/>If a Warrior sustains more damage than their Resistance score they would usually be removed from the game. Instead Heroes take a Courage check. If it is successful he finds the courage to carry on and takes the top Injury card. The Injury card imposes a penalty for the rest of the game as detailed on the card. If the Hero fails this Courage roll, or already has an Injury card, he is removed as normal from the game. If the damage sustained by the Hero in this instance is caused via critical damage they are automatically dispatched.!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Choose one player to be the round's chief. That player gives all players a random card numbered 1-10, then they read one of the five hundred theme cards included in the game, e.g., &quot;Batman wants to replace Robin to fight the bad guys. Create a new duo 'Batman and ...' from the worst to the best.&quot; The chief looks at their number, then gives an answer based on their number. If they have a 1, they want to give the worst possible suggestion; if a 10, the best; if a 5-7, somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Each other player then gives an answer to this theme based on the number they were dealt, then the chief needs to decide who has the lowest number, then the next lowest, and so on. For each mistake, the chief flips a unicorn token over to its poop side.<br/><br/>If all the unicorns have left by the end of the fifth round, leaving you with nothing but poop, then you lose. Otherwise you win!<br/><br/>",

Isle whales would crush entire towns in their passing, and river wyrms swallow whole camps. Yet every so often, a tiny hamlet or a cosy little village would spring up atop a hill. In our story, the village chief has just passed on, leaving a chaotic mess of younger heads to run the place. The Tool Master needs stone to craft useful items for everyone, while the Culinary Chief feeds the group, the Scouting Lead goes out with his party to patrol and scour for materials, and the Commander protects the walls and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>They are but a tiny settlement with limited people. How will the different leaders work together to utilize their resources? Too much of one resource will cause some leaders to not be able to do what they have to do, and too little of anything could spell doom for everyone. A single deck represents the village, and players take on the roles of the various leaders. They must balance their own needs with those of other leaders in order to survive and thrive amidst a harsh land. Every leader is important!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Compete against your opponents to earn points, money and fame all in the hope of having the greatest career and becoming Rising Star champion!<br/><br/>This sports based role-playing game allows individuals to play out a footballer's career. They compete in matches, have contracts and sponsorships, work with an agent and take part in different events.<br/><br/>Matches use the match dice to decide the scores and players roll against each other. Match Event cards can be used to impact the final score. Contracts allow the players to earn money and they can change contracts by being transferred or entering negotiations where their agent's ability (if they have one) comes into play.<br/><br/>With varied tiles that require different actions and lots of cards to read aloud this game brings all the components of a footballer's life into a board game and gives a fun competitive environment for friends and families to play.<br/><br/>Players roll the game dice to move around the board. Depending on where they land, different events occur. They could land on a variety of match event tiles where they have to play out a match against an opponent in the hope of defeating them and gaining points. They could appear in the press and draw a press card to read what the papers are saying about them, impacting their fame. They might enter contract negotiations and use their Agent's ability to enhance the amount of contracts they are offered. There are many different events that occur as the player goes through each season and this can change the storyline of that player as well as impact their career in positive and negative ways.<br/><br/>The length of game varies depending on how many seasons players wish to play. This is decided at the start of the game and one trip around the board is equal to one season. The game ends when all players have completed the agreed upon number of seasons.<br/><br/>Throughout each player's career their goal is to collect Points (won by participating in Matchdays, Reserves, Derby Day and Cup Final events), earn money by improving their contract, gaining sponsorships and getting transferred and gain fame by appearing in the press. The referee keeps track of the scores and the winner is the player with the highest career score. The scoresheet has a simple formula for calculating the winner at the end of the game and the results are announced in reverse order crowning the winner Rising Star Champion.<br/><br/>",

One set gives orders to patrolling units unaware of the player. The other two sets of orders are for aware units attacking the player's units, separated by the size of the Walks (Light/Reg Vs Large/Behemoth).<br/><br/>Patrol instructions include: Sweeping the area for the player, Patrolling objectives, Checking suspicious behavior, etc...<br/><br/>Attack instructions include: Rushing the player, Flanking, Various types of attacks, etc...<br/><br/>Each card includes: Compass directions, Dice rolls, Player to attack, and Hit Locations. There are also playing card symbols on each card to be used for variable actions or objective orders in the case of multiple objectives.<br/><br/>For each enemy activation, the player draws a card for that enemy unit. The card gives the enemy order or orders, sometimes requiring multiple cards to be drawn to show what direction the enemy moves, and also which player to attack.<br/><br/>H.E.: Walk Solobot AI is quick to learn and gives you a good fight.
