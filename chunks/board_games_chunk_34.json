But even as their civilizations grow vast, their economies grow prosperous, and their armies grow strong, their greatest battle yet will be against the power of the island which they&rsquo;ve just unleashed. Enraged by the conquests of the explorers and the misdeeds of the Thieves, the Guardian of El Dorado has risen from the depths of the island to reclaim what is eternally hers. With the power of a god she summons beasts, giants, and ruthless natural disasters to reclaim the shrines and cleanse the island of its trespassers.<br/><br/>In The Revenge of El Dorado, explorers and thieves widen and deepen their strategy as they face off against the mythical Guardian of El Dorado and the fury of the island she defends. Expanded explorer boards allow players to upgrade their buildings and units, unlocking new abilities, new military and economic tactics, and new paths to victory.<br/><br/>Fully cooperative gameplay allows explorers to band together against the island, employing complex strategy to control the shrines while defending against the islands varied and savage attacks. Or, take control of the Guardian herself (as a completely asymmetric faction), championing her army of beasts, giants, and the power of the island against the Thieves and explorers as she races to secure her shrines.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For those of you who can&rsquo;t stand someone who wins all the time, here is an opportunity to game one of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s rare losses. The Battle of Gergovia was Caesar's failed attempt to wipe out the threat of a large Gallic uprising by isolating and defeating a gathering of the Arverni, plus several other Gallic contingents, under their new chieftain, Vercingetorix.<br/><br/>The Arverni had taken a defensive position in the hill fortress oppidum of Gergovia, a position somewhat similar to (but much smaller than) that that they would take at Alesia but, given the surrounding terrain, a bit more difficult to take.<br/><br/>In a series of short battles that took place mostly below the walls of the oppidum, and probably helped by a topless show from the Gergovian women (really!!), the Gauls managed to drive off the Romans, inflicting on Caesar his only serious loss in his 8 year campaign.<br/><br/>The Gergovia module comes with its own map but uses, mostly, counters from Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, along with a few extra tribesmen counters. It also uses the rules for C/CoG (preferably the 2nd edition (2006), but the original version will work just fine).<br/><br/>And while the hilltop oppidum of Gergovia is fortified, Gergovia is not a siege assault (for the most part), but a rather disconnected series of attacks, feints and mistakes. The terrain is not overly conducive to linear combat, the approach to Gergovia being fairly steep and somewhat rocky, but Caesar, Roman that he is, has already built two camps and a sunken trench for easy movement. Gergovia is a tough game for either side, as the options and possible strategies are multiple.<br/><br/>Designed by GBoH&rsquo;s own Caesar (Julius, not Sid), Richard Berg and Developed by his House Labienus, Al Ray, Gergovia contains one full map, one small sheet of counters, and all rules needed for the battle (as a scenario for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul).<br/><br/>(from the GMT Website)<br/><br/>",

Each chapter is printed with the unlock condition that must be met before players can open it.<br/><br/>Inside each chapter, you'll always find the same two types of cards: The story card reveals the world of Fantasy Defense, with notes and snippets that drive the narrative forward; the rules card introduces new mechanisms and concepts, so you can play with all the components you've just unlocked. However, Fantasy Defense isn't a legacy game! When it's all finished, you can return to the original version and play that. You could also put back all cards in their original envelope and start from the beginning &mdash; or you can spice things up, mixing and matching different elements as you wish.<br/><br/>The Stone King provides a more varied and challenging experience for those players who have figured out the basic gameplay of Fantasy Defense.<br/><br/>",

There are Cubans with SU-100s, South Africans with Oliphants, French AMX B-2s, T-80s with different armor factors, and a designer who seemingly ignores logic, but there is one thing that World at War is missing. That one thing is LOTS of American tanks. Into the Breach cures that. This expansion to The Untold Stories explores the Yank&rsquo;s battle on the front line in the first days of the war. Now you get to fight with lots of Abrams, Bradleys, infantry, and even Sheridans. On the flip side of the tank, you&rsquo;ll fight a mass of Soviets and Polish armor.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s great big fun, with some great big scenarios. There are 12 of them to be exact (unless you order the upgraded version with an additional eight scenario campaign), including an East German counterattack, West Germans on defense, and Amercans defending in depth, screening main forces, attacking, and counterattacking.&quot;<br/><br/>In other words, this expansion for World at War: The Untold Stories adds a lot of new scenarios while adding a lot of American and Soviet units.<br/><br/>",

As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times.

The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful &lsquo;infantry&lsquo; division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s). These forces defended from probably the most dense network of mines, trenches, and bunkers in Army Group Center, including special rotating bunkers housing machine-guns.<br/> Years of extensive on-sight research along with vigorous play testing by the veteran game designers at Heat of Battle brings you ONSLAUGHT TO ORSHA.<br/> ONSLAUGHT TO ORSHA contains:<br/><br/>* Color 29x56&quot; historical map featuring 1&quot; hexes of the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad area<br/>    * Chapter OtO, that includes rules for new units, terrain types and vehicle notes<br/>    * Campaign Game, 22 scenarios and 2 Solitaire Missions<br/>    * 17 Page Map Study and Order of Battle<br/>    * And, over 180 new, full color counters covering vehicles and weapons not seen in an tactical wargame system are included for free!<br/><br/>",

When a few volunteers were equipped with them, the Grim Reapers were born.<br/><br/>Named for the death their touch promises, these Allied soldiers attack from above. With the Jump ability and a movement of two, the Grim Reapers can deploy and sweep across the battlefield to reach and destroy any Axis infantry and walkers. Players can also use their lightning speed together with Jump to fly over buildings, an advantage their Axis enemies have yet to access. The Grim Reapers are also equipped with dangerous weaponry: Victory MG duals and Rocket Punches.

        "description": "2GM Tactics Wargame is a tabletop game that lets you recreate battles between the US &ndash; Allied nation &ndash; and Germany &ndash; Axis nation &ndash; during the late years of the WW2.<br/><br/>Players will create and customize their own decks in advance in order to complete the military feats assigned. Army decks are comprised of Unit cards (Infantry, Artillery, Armor, Transports and Aircraft) and Support cards.<br/><br/>Support cards complement each army deck and provide special, one-time abilities and perks to our units during a battle. Use Support cards to hamper the enemy and their strategy.<br/><br/>Terrain cards are double-sided cards that are placed in the battlefield and provide extra cover to our units.<br/><br/>Additionally, you&rsquo;ll also find General cards, Scenario cards and Player Aid and Game Summary cards.<br/><br/>There are two different game modes:<br/><br/>1. Battle Royal, in which the goal is to destroy the opponent&rsquo;s HQ.<br/><br/>2. Scenario, a pre-set scenario with its own set of deployment rules and predetermined configuration. The final goal is established by the specific rules of the scenario itself.<br/><br/>A key factor to take into account in the game is the ability a player has to build up their own army deck before entering the battle. Depending on the objectives and the restrictions inherent to the scenario, the player will be able to choose what units and Support cards to include.<br/><br/>The goals to achieve the victory in a given game are totally diverse depending on the battle or scenario being played. Goals Range from destroying enemy&rsquo;s HQ to seize the battlefield or inflicting a specific amount of casualties; to bomb a building or seizing it; raze a specific objective or steal supplies from the enemy; rescue a key position or standing on it for a given number of turns, among others.<br/><br/>German Reinforcements is an expansion to the base game in which we add new Unit and Support cards to Germany. Also new Terrain cards, such as Factories or Debris.<br/><br/>This expansion consists of 76 new cards, 42 units of 18 different types and 28 additional Support cards. In addition, we include 4 new Terrain cards, 1 summary card and two new General cards: Von Bock and Von Leeb.<br/><br/>1x Headquarters<br/>1x General Von Bock<br/>1x General Von Leeb<br/>3x Motorized Infantry (Infantry)<br/>4x FK 16 NA (Artillery)<br/>3x Puma (Tank)<br/>3x Panzer I (Tank)<br/>4x Panzer III (Tank)<br/>4x Stug III (Tank)<br/>4x Panther (Tank)<br/>3x Elephant (Tank)<br/>2x Ostwind (Tank)<br/>3x Brummbar (Tank)<br/>3x SD KFZ 11 (Truck)<br/>2x JU87 Stuka (Airplane)<br/>2x BF 109 (Airplane)<br/>2x HE 177 Greif (Airplane)<br/><br/>",

In addition to that, a new ice type was added to the Corps arsenal. &quot;Deflectors&quot; now allowed the Corp to send the Runner down the wrong rabbit hole by sending them to another data fort.<br/><br/>Hinting at other innovations to the game that will never be developed, this expansion sadly marks the end of WotC's Netrunner game.

There are 40 new scenarios depicting both sides on the attack, battles of cavalry against cavalry, and even a tank battle or two. Plus of course background articles on the armies and weapons involved. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin to enjoy all of the scenarios. White Eagles includes 165 die-cut and mounted playing pieces. Almost all of them represent Polish forces: tanks, cavalry, armored cars, infantry, machine gun, mortar, anti-tank, artillery and of course leaders.

The sea board contains additional water spaces and introduces the fish market field.<br/><br/>In addition there is a fish market board, fishing boats, fish fairs, store tiles, sea creatures and treasures.<br/><br/>In the Deep Water game, players complete the seasons on different turns. The first player to complete a season gains a store tile and then plays through that season for a second time. This is an unusual concept which can provide new and interesting game challenges. Keyper at Sea presents players with more scoring opportunities than in the base game of Keyper and players are likely to be able to score achieve higher scores.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Combine its ability with one of the expert sides of the player boards and you have a potentially lethal combo.<br/>     the Fort provides a mix of Favor Points, Gold and the infamous Morale - probably the most expensive and hard to obtain &quot;resource&quot; in the game.<br/><br/><br/>Last but not least, the promo player board offers two brand new expert sides, giving players opportunities to discover new strategies in the Praetor universe.<br/><br/>Any promo component can be added to the base game separately or together with the rest.<br/><br/>The Praetor Promo Pack will be available in the Geek Store.<br/><br/>",

Communication and teamwork are critical to survival because there's no time to form a carefully considered plan &mdash; and no predicting what dangers lie ahead.<br/><br/>In more detail, players assume the role of one of ten heroes, each with special cards and abilities. Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &mdash; and after the first boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon, gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.<br/><br/>Also included, Curses! Foiled Again! is an expansion for 5-Minute Dungeon that brings new challenges and abilities to the party in their quest to defeat the Dungeon Master. The expansion adds Boss Cards to the Dungeon, two new heroes (Druid and Shaman), and powerful Artifacts that can be activated once per dungeon to help the party. This expansion also adds support for up to 6 players.<br/><br/>Also included in the Big Box are several Kickstarter only exclusives all bundled together in a limited-edition Curses-themed 10.5&quot; x 10.5&quot; box!<br/><br/>",

They found that the rare crystals they were studying have enormous amount of energy, unlike anything they've seen before. The discovery of these crystals led the galaxy to a new era of technological breakthroughs, as it was already going through exciting and turbulent times since the start of the first major intergalactic conflicts.<br/><br/>When using Small Star Empires: Dawn of Discoveries, at the start of the game you randomly draw crystals of three colors from the bag and place one at each 1 planet system on the board. Additionally, you shuffle the technology deck and reveal several technology cards that will be available for the players to research (purchase).<br/><br/>Once you colonize a system containing a crystal, you collect that crystal. During the game you may spend collected crystals in order to research the available technologies. Additionally, you may also build research stations on the board. When an opponent colonizes a system adjacent to your research station, you both get &quot;research bonus&quot; and gain one extra crystal for use.<br/><br/>The technologies that you will research range from new engine drives that enable special movement across the board, utility modules that can be used to colonize asteroids and weapons, and shields that can be used to defend or damage ships. Eventually the technologies could score points at the end of the game, so you need to think about which technologies fit your strategy best!<br/><br/>How will you use the possibilities that the powerful crystals have to offer? Will you use the them to engage in researching peaceful technologies to further prosper your civilization or engage in military research in order to subdue the other civilizations?<br/><br/>",

When the avatar departs, the victim&rsquo;s body is left transformed, forever a hideous monster. In the box, we provide Dark Demons in every faction color: nine total figures! When you recruit the Dark Demon, all the enemy factions also get one, but theirs is a burden and weakness to them, while yours is more of an asset.<br/><br/>The Shadow Pharaoh <br/>This manifestation is Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s Egyptian connection, well-known from many stories. The figure itself is a sort of combination of sphinx, scorpion, mummy, pharaoh, and tentacled horror. I really like it, and I think you will too. It has an especially nasty ability which drives cultists off gates, making the gates vulnerable to be captured once the Pharaoh leaves.<br/><br/>The Bloated Woman<br/>First popularized in the well-known adventure Masks of Nyarlathotep for the Call of Cthulhu system, the Bloated Woman is Nyarlathotep in a rather repulsive female form. She steals killed enemies, and later transforms your gates so they produce Elder Signs rather than Power.<br/><br/>The Haunter of the Dark<br/>The Haunter of the Dark is a full-on Great Old One. It is awakened as with most independent Great Old Ones &ndash; you need a Gate with your own Great Old One. In the Haunter&rsquo;s case, you spend 6 Power to get the loyalty card, putting it in the same high-end category as game-changers such as Atlach-Nacha, Cthugha, or Daoloth. (Most Independent Great Old Ones only cost 4, or even 2.)<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re Crawling Chaos, you can awaken the Haunter for just 5 Power, and you don&rsquo;t need a Great Old One, so obtaining it is a lot easier, BUT every other faction does get an Elder Sign when you do this.<br/><br/>The Haunter is explicitly a combat critter. It has a combat of 1 per enemy spellbook (so in theory 0-6, but in practice usually at the high end). I wanted to reflect the fact that one of the Haunter&rsquo;s best-known characteristics is that it can&rsquo;t survive well in the light. Therefore, it actually starts with a weakness, representing this disability &ndash; Fly The Light. This &ldquo;ability&rdquo; states that post-Battle, if the enemy scored only 1 Kill, it MUST be applied to the Haunter. If the enemy scored 2 or more kills though, you can target them normally.<br/><br/>The Haunter&rsquo;s spellbook is really easy to get &ndash; just spend 1 Power as an action. Trivial. In fact, normally this is the first thing you&rsquo;ll do after awakening the Haunter, which gives your enemies a one-turn window to try to take it out, before you get this frightful pre-Battle ability. It&rsquo;s The Shining Trapezohedron. Before rolling combat dice, your enemy has to roll 1 die per unit he has in the battle. For each Kill he rolls, he must eliminate a unit (his choice).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The Bloated Woman, Shadow Pharaoh, Dark Demon, and Haunter of the Dark sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mega Empires is a board game for 3 to 18 players and covers the development of ancient civilizations over 8000 years of history. This bundle including the stand alone games Western Empires (2019) and Eastern Empires (2021) can take up to 13 hours to complete, and still yet, it has a simple mechanism and is easy to learn. It was designed to be the largest game possible that fits within a single day within a single room. The players lead their civilizations, as they expand and collapse, from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. This game is especially meant for larger groups of strategic board game fanatics.<br/><br/>Culture<br/>Though it may seem at first glance, Mega Empires is a not a wargame. Yes, conflict may be involved, but rather it is a game about history, culture, trade, development, and... calamities. The 2 meter (80 inch) wide map board stretches from Britannia in The West to current Bangladesh in The East. From Scandinavia in the North to Sudan in the South. Some of the involved civilization are The Romans, The Egyptians, The Babylonians, The Indus Valley civilization and The Nubains. Players develop their own unique civilization in arts, crafts, science, civics and religion. Each player starts his civilization with a single population token, 8000 BC, but grows and grows over time, and eventually cities can be built. Cities of course bring wealth and fortune, but also&hellip; natural calamities such as epidemics, famine or earthquakes, or civil calamities such as pirate attacks, slave revolts and civil disorder.<br/><br/>Trading<br/>This wealth is expressed in trade cards. The more cities, the more cards a player gets. These cards provide both trading commodities, and calamities. Trading is the heart of the game. A real social experience, where all players simultaneously trade with each other during a limited time. As soon as trading has ended, the players that end up with calamities will suffer them.<br/><br/>Develop advances<br/>And then, of course, it's time to do something about it. Build walls, give your citizens music and architecture. Develop religion, democracy, improve science&hellip; 51 different advances can be developed in five different categories.<br/><br/>Maybe a player can even construct a wonder of the world, or scatter their people all over the map, and gain cultural ascendancy. The player that knows best how to work together, trade or battle for territory, defend his people against nature or enemies like barbarian hordes, and stand the test of time, eventually will win the game. After up to 13 hours of playing that is.<br/><br/>Mega Empires<br/>Either game can be played by 3-9 players, and the combination can be played by 10-18 players. Either stand alone game can be expanded with the two Special Buildings Expansions (2019). Where Western Empires has a focus on sea travel and trade on the Mediterrainean Sea, Eastern Empires follows the Silk Road to India and trading is done through the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. Both games are developed as equally balanced counterparts that either have their own unique characteristics in gameplay, while competing together in an East/West 18 player experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

While the lure of such knowledge is great, few wizards have ventured into this region as it is overrun by barbaric northern tribesmen, who have descended from the hills in their own search for treasure. Marking themselves with demonic sigils, many of these barbarians have aligned with ancient powers discovered among the temples. Along with a host of new scenarios focusing on the exploration of the temples, the book also contains new treasures, spells, soldiers, and creatures that can be found in and around the ruins.<br/><br/>",

Villages of Valeria: Architects is sold separately at retail, but was combined together during the Kickstarter campaign (Villages of Valeria: Landmarks & Architects)<br/><br/>Unable to decide on the location of the new capital, the King of Valeria sends out his messengers with another decree: the village to be named New Shilina must also have wondrous landmarks to distinguish it from the rest. As a Duke or Duchess vying for the prestigious prize, new adventurers await your call, new plans for buildings have been drawn up, and landmarks are ready to be constructed within the village surrounding your castle.<br/><br/>In Villages of Valeria: Landmarks, players will be able to discard cards with specific resources in order to take and build Landmark tokens on their Castle card. At the end of the game, the player with the most of each token will gain bonus points. You can also earn bonus points by collecting sets of all 5 Landmark token types. Will you leverage the new Landmarks to be declared the next capital of Valeria?<br/><br/>",

Containing three copies each of twenty new cards, this pack immerses you in the world of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. As the story progresses into the pages of A Dance with Dragons, those who would play the game of thrones find themselves helplessly surrounded by enemies. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister struggles to hold onto power as the Tyrells and the Faith of the Seven split the loyalties of the capital's citizens. At the Wall, Jon Snow takes the role of Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but has trouble balancing the demands of duty with those of morality. Finally, In Essos, Daenerys Targaryen has become the queen of Meereen, only to discover that the realities of rule differ greatly from expectations.<br/><br/>The Dance of Shadows cycle reintroduces the player-favorite Shadow mechanism from A Game of Thrones: The Card Game First Edition. This mechanism increases the tension of your encounters, keeping games steeped in mystery and a constant fear of the unknown. As the sun sets on Westeros, you must decide how much of yourself you are willing to sacrifice in order for your plots to come to fruition.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Germans can set up an extensive fortified zone in a primarily wooded region near Leningrad with pillboxes, trenches, a few Guns, and a bunch of good infantry led by a 10-2. The Russians attack in three waves, intent on Controlling a bridge and grabbing at least one building in a small village on board 67.<br/><br/>WO13 All The Stops: Another Russian attack vs SS Germans, this time in Poland in 1944. The Russians must move down the length of board 67 and win through a combination of terrain Control and Exit. The Russians get three M4/76(a)s, loaded to the gills with Smoke and the awesome Smoke Mortar, while the thin German force, centered around four 6-5-8 squads and three lesser 4-4-7 SS squads and supported by a halftrack and a mortar, try to delay the Russians long enough to reduce the VP value of the buildings, thus forcing the Russians to Exit more VP in order to win. There is a very interesting &quot;semi-random&quot; Russian rolling barrage of 70mm Harassing Fire that can impede both sides. Two StuGs show up later in the game to bolster the defense. This is a rense scenario between two powerful but potentially brittle forces that requires sharp play by both sides to avert disaster.<br/><br/>WO14 For Pride's Sake: This scenario features a Japanese Night attack vs Americans on Luzon in 1945. Good Japanese infantry and 6 tanks try to Exit, while a nasty batch of American firepower &mdash; a thin line of infantry backed by a Sherman, three M8 Armored Cars, and a 37LL AT Gun (with CANISTER) &mdash; try to plug any gaps and deny the Japanese the escape.<br/><br/>Board 67 is dense mix of woods, brush, orchard, hedge and grain with 2 small hills, a town and two gullies.<br/><br/>",

You'll score points for this goon based on certain conditions, but if someone ever controls more territory of this color than you, that player takes control of the boss and you have to say goodbye to those goons.<br/><br/>Goons of New York was made in conjunction with the Brooklyn Game Lab, an afterschool program in which children learn to play today's best board games, then discuss the strategies and tactics used to play them. For this project, hundreds of children worked together &mdash; in a month-long game-jam &mdash; to design and playtest this promotional content for New York 1901, which is currently planned to be made available solely at trade shows and game conventions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Automated Player (or AP) uses an unused player&rsquo;s components and focus bar, with the focus row essentially functioning as a highly simplified version of the code that operates the AI opponents in the Civilization video games, providing a series of instructions for how the AP functions. On the AP&rsquo;s turn, it will resolve the focus card in the &ldquo;5&rdquo; slot of its focus row and reset that card to the &ldquo;1&rdquo; slot. To assist with that, the AP has its own set of unique focus cards, designed specifically to remove decisions from the AP&rsquo;s turn so that you won&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re playing for the AP yourself.<br/><br/>And what&rsquo;s more, the AP isn&rsquo;t just for solo play. It can also be used in games with up to three human players to provide an additional opponent against which you must compete. Will you coexist peacefully with the AP, manipulating it to your advantage and turning it against your human opponents, or will you team up with the other humans to carve up the AP&rsquo;s territory for yourselves? The decision is yours.<br/><br/>-description by the publisher<br/><br/>",

He's at least much happier as a zombie butcher than a book publisher (although it can be argued that the publishing business is as cut-throat as any gang war). Eventually he went too far in the pursuit of high profit margins and found himself in jail. When the apocalypse began and the prison was overrun, he personally battered half a dozen berserkers to death with a crowbar. The world needs men like him again, although the overwhelming nature of his rage threatens to turn him into a greater monster than those he destroys.<br/><br/>Benny is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Season 3 Kickstarter campaign. A Zombivor version is also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shazia Barnes had come to the far end of a ruined mall&rsquo;s parking lot, searching for her husband when she heard the cry. She spun around, watchful for alien locusts, and the dreaded flying &lsquo;squids&rsquo;. Shazia heard the woman&rsquo;s cry again as she swept the mall, carbine at the ready. The weapon was the only companion who&rsquo;d made it this far, and she&rsquo;d scored &lsquo;him&rsquo; once with her knife for each deathworm she&rsquo;d put an explosive-tipped caseless round into. A megalithic starship was visible on the horizon, hanging like cast-iron doom over the distant mountains. Towering columns of black smoke roiled upward from the city in front of her. Shazia studied the landscape, stone-faced. It was clear to her now that her husband must be dead.'<br/><br/>CAN MANKIND OVERCOME THE ALIEN THREAT?<br/><br/>Invaders: Armageddon is an expansion for Invaders, comprising four expansions in one package.<br/><br/>Armageddon expands the number of possible stratagems available to each player, from the board-set ones available in the base game of Invaders. Due to the hidden nature of these powerful additions, both players are kept guessing as to their opponent&rsquo;s overall plan of attack &ndash; until it might be too late!<br/><br/>Mankind has also gained a new phase, allowing him to attack the vast alien mothership, and possibly increase his shot at victory against the alien overlords. This addition alters the way both players fight the invasion of Earth:<br/>Will the Invader move scarce resources to protect the mothership - which has an energy source available to help play Invader cards, or can fire a mega-death super-weapon.<br/>How many cards will Mankind play to directly attack the mothership, because every robot or tank moved to strike the starship is one less card available to defend Earth from other attacks...<br/><br/>This expansion also adds three new theatres of conflict (coastal cities) for both sides to combat over. Along with his hand of cards, the Invader player deploys alien squids to form an ever-increasing swarm, while Mankind struggles to defend Earth with a limited number of jet squadrons.<br/><br/>",

Call on the corporation with money to spend! Enter BUDDYFINDER&trade; - the premier subscription-based friend rental service. Rental friends starting as low as 12.99 a month!<br/><br/>In sport, there are usually a couple of big sponsors that pay for exclusive primary advertising and presence. In GKR: Heavy Hitters, Big Little Buddy is that guy. He&rsquo;s made available for the match (as well as serviced and repaired after the match) by his premier sponsor &ndash; BUDDYFINDER &trade;. They&rsquo;ve got money to burn and they want their name everywhere. IN YOUR FACE.<br/><br/>Subtle, Little Buddy is not.<br/><br/>When Big Little Buddy is deployed to the gameboard, he advertises for whichever Faction has unlocked him for that round. Players can try to claim Little Buddy by playing a special Sponsor Card &ndash; a move that can only be deflected by playing a counter-hack.<br/><br/>Once a player controls Lil Buddy, the fun begins. Move him during the Movement Phase, and use him to attack opponents in the Combat Phase with his own unique cards: 3 Weapon Cards and 1 Unit Card. Each round, he can only fire 1 of these weapons in his arsenal BUT he does not require Energy to fire. Making him really rather handy in a pinch. Once the Combat Phase is over, players lose control of him once more.<br/><br/>Like all Units, Little Buddy can be destroyed. Once he&rsquo;s destroyed, he&rsquo;s removed from the game completely. Buh bye, Little Buddy.<br/><br/>One important note: Lil Buddy is not considered a &ldquo;Support Unit&rdquo; so he&rsquo;s not bound by Support Unit rules. That also means he can&rsquo;t tag buildings. Standing at 70mm he&rsquo;s a mid-size Unit that, we think you&rsquo;ll find, more than pulls his own weight.<br/><br/>With Little Buddy, you&rsquo;re not just getting an awesome new mini, 1 unique Unit Card, 5 new Sponsor Cards, and 3 new Weapon Cards. You&rsquo;re getting a little friend to keep you warm through those long lonely nights.<br/><br/>",

The French?  They rolled sixes on life&rsquo;s CRT all day.

At least, that&rsquo;s one side of it. The set also offers a group of new units, hex tiles, and interior overlays that you can use in your own scenarios or battle mode games.<br/><br/>You get 18 monk miniatures in 6 different poses together with 4 multi-figure bases, and 6 stat cards. All of these monkish types are playable in the battle mode, as well as the Ars Nova scenario.<br/>You also get 7 unique, double-sided hex tiles, and 7 building interior overlays. The hex tiles can be mixed in with any others you may have to expand your options and size of playing area. The building interiors offer you some choices for existing buildings, changing the way some familiar types work. This means that you won&rsquo;t always know what a building is until you enter it, adding a sense of exploration and mystery to even a simple battle.<br/><br/>Finally, for the Ars Nova scenario itself, you get 1 Suspect sleeve, 8 Suspect cards, 20 Event cards, 80 Trial cards, 1 sand timer, and 30 tokens. <br/>Playing the scenario is straightforward. It uses the normal rules with some additional mini-games to represent the trials you have to go through to gather your evidence. <br/> Also worth noting is that this scenario includes no combat at all.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pacific Theatre Via Midway is a variant/expansion to the Midway wargame (1975 Avalon Hill) that appeared in The GENERAL Vol.15,No.5, Jan-Feb 1979.<br/><br/>The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the South Pacific) behind a screen. Each player &quot;searches&quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the hex and calling the hex number. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on hexes and the attacking planes are placed in hexes to indicate which ship it is attacking.<br/><br/>The basic game is very simple. But there are many additional rules, which add realism (and complexity): CAP fighters, surface actions, bases, inaccurate search reports, etc.<br/><br/>The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.<br/><br/>Note: the rules and maps for the Coral Sea Variant were published in General Magazine Vol. 15, #5, counters were available separately via ordering through Avalon Hill.<br/><br/>",

While the sea routes for tourism and goods play a role of great importance to the livelihood of these islands, they also offer luxury products and superb quality to the continent.<br/><br/>The rules are the same as the original game, with the exceptions presented below.<br/>The map was designed for 3 and 4 players.<br/><br/>The real hook of this map is the importance of Lisbon on the map center.<br/><br/>The game usually grows from Lisbon since the companies can link to almost all cities on the map from there.<br/><br/>The twist is that each player can only make one connection to Lisbon per turn, be it by land or by sea. In fact, Lisbon and Oporto are the most important links in his map.<br/><br/>This expansion works very well with steam rules too.<br/><br/>",

Through the ritual invocations based on their champion&rsquo;s affiliation, a cult will eventually be able to summon their avatar to join their deck. These avatars are not only powerful characters, but the direct path to the Sigils of Ruin.<br/><br/>Once the avatar has served their purpose on the mortal plane, they can be sacrificed to channel the cult&rsquo;s corresponding sigil. When conjured, these sigils are immovable auras that bestow their cult with unique abilities and victory conditions.

Nott. All four of them were hanged in an abandoned barn behind the jail.<br/><br/>Elias survived, against the odds, when he was cut down minutes after his short-drop attempted execution, by Deputy 'Clay' Beckwith - he and ten lawmen broke up the vigilante gathering. The records state that thirty men were arrested that moon-lit April night, but the records do not tell if the other prisoners survived.<br/><br/>After being taken to Surgeon's Hall, the authorities decided to reprieve Elias and his sentence was commuted to transportation for four years. While serving his sentence, Elias turned to the teachings of the Good Book for guidance - returning to Repentance Springs a changed man. Soon, he found that his gunfighting and horse-handling skills had attracted the recognition of Ned McReady, who gave the man a badge.<br/><br/>When Jack Colty rained bullets about town, Elias was one of the first to ride with Ned. The rest is history...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kickstarter editions comes packaged with 3 expansions not contained in the retail edition - The Fire Temple Monsters, The Kaharian Monsters, and The Shade Events.<br/><br/>The goal of Valeria: Card Kingdoms &ndash; Darksworn is to introduce co-operative play into the Valeria world through groups of related books called Sagas. These books will lead the players through a story that unfolds during the game and offers greater immersion into the Valeria setting. New rules and cards will be introduced in each book, some lasting only through the current book and some persisting through the unfolding Saga, somewhat like a &quot;legacy game&quot;.<br/><br/>Darksworn uses six book-decks to tell a story of wonder, sacrifice, and adventure as you explore the territory west of Valeria and encounter a darkness that cannot go unchecked. Each book presents you with a set of new rules and several tasks that must be completed by your gaming group in order to advance to the next book in the saga. Within each book you'll find special boons to assist you and powerful monsters to challenge you. Your team will have to strike a balance between building effective tableaus of citizens that will allow you to complete the tasks and defending the decreasing center stacks of citizens that are the health of your kingdom.<br/><br/>The play area for Darksworn is much the same as an ordinary game of Valeria: Card Kingdoms, but there are some notable changes. The story board sits above the monster row. This is where each book's story and challenges are presented, where new rules are displayed, and where citizens captured by monster attacks languish in a dark oubliette. Walls provide additional protection from the attacking monsters, but if they make it past the walls, your citizen stacks are going to suffer. At the bottom of the play area is the Blessings Board where your devotion to the radiance of Aquila can grant you special powers, free captured citizens, and even rebuild fallen walls. If any of the monsters make it through to the Blessings Board, however, all is lost.<br/><br/>",

These tiles are essentially a new common objective system that replace the ordinary Objective cards in the game. When playing with the Hegemony tiles, players do not draw a personal Objective card at the start of the game as they normally would. Instead, they will all be trying to satisfy the demands of the Hegemon. These demands are determined by drawing three Hegemony tiles, which will each have a criteria based on Cities, Knowledge cards and colours of Nodus. Players will then battle it out for dominance over each objective dictated by the tiles: at the end of the Age, the player with the highest number of each of the 5 criteria is awarded additional victory points! In the case of a draw, no player gets the points - the Hegemon is only interested in the best&hellip;<br/><br/>However, as time passes, old leaders shall fall and new ones will arise&hellip; The start of each new Age will bring a new Hegemon to power, and their demands could be very different this time around! Two of the objectives are constant: the number of Monument levels in your possession, and your Influence score. However, the old tiles will be shuffled back into their piles, and three new tiles will be drawn. As a result, your objectives could remain the same (at least in part), or change completely for the next Age!<br/><br/>",

The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Defenders The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>These new features include a Campaign Mode, with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.<br/><br/>Caravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.<br/><br/>Skills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.<br/><br/>The Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.<br/><br/>The Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part of the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As player progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans are critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.<br/><br/>",

It includes alternate rules for the six base game heroes, six more heroes, five more monsters, four more Catacomb Lords, more room cards, three more antients, more items, and more spells.<br/><br/>There are also entirely new concepts added to the game, like stone traps that the overseer can set up on top of the obstacles and flick at the heroes. There is also a new reckless modifier: when a hero is hit with an attack that induces recklessness, that hero is now capable of friendly-fire.<br/><br/>More randomness can be added to the game. This can take the form of a token bag heroes draw from, and are able to perform the drawn move on a subsequent turn. Randomness is also added with the new Death antient/Catacomb Lord. Death brings a new deck of death cards. When a hero is hit with an attack with the death card icon, they draw one and apply its effect. These effects range from &ldquo;gain two health&rdquo; to &ldquo;instant death&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Finally, this expansion adds the mounts concept. Mounts act similarly to the wyverns of the Wyverns Wylemiur expansion- with some key differences. Mounts can teleport to runes, and then allow the hero riding to perform a melee or projectile act while on top of the mount. Heroes cannot be knocked of mounts, however, damage to mounts always passes to the hero. Mounts can also be controlled without a rider, and cannot he ridden by monsters.<br/><br/>",

In the base game, players move their magnetized figures across a game board in order to claim symbols, but a metal ball is attached to their figure underneath the board; if they try to pass through a hidden wall in the labyrinth under the board, they lose their marble and return to their starting corner. Remember where the hidden walls lie underneath the game board, and you'll graduate from being an apprentice magician in no time.<br/><br/>Das magische Labyrinth: Erweiterung adds only a handful of elements to the base game: eight magic walls (that can replace up to eight walls from the basic game) along with four magic wands, magic potions and nightcaps, with each player receiving one of each of these objects.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can use the power of one of these objects, then remove it from the game: The nightcap covers another player, costing her a turn; the potion lets you move as far as you would like, until you hit the target symbol or a wall; and the wand lets you replace the symbol you are currently searching for with a new one from the bag before moving.<br/><br/>As for the magic walls, they allow movement through a section of the labyrinth in only one direction. Approach from one direction, and the wall will fold over and let you pass. Approach the other way, however, and *snap* there goes your marble. It's back to start for you, Merlin...<br/><br/>",

With several field-tested refinements integrated into its design, the new generation of A-wing fighters boasts incredible maneuverability to go along with blazingly fast speed, which makes mastering this craft a challenge worthy of the greatest aces.<br/><br/>The RZ-2 A-wing&rsquo;s three defense dice and ability to evade incoming attacks make it a hard target to hit, and its redesigned swivel mounts deter pursuers by allowing pilots to target enemies behind them. One of the ship's many improvements over earlier models, these built-in Refined Gyrostabilizers provide the RZ-2 with a turret arc that can rotate exclusively between the front and back of the ship. This gives it some much needed flexibility in where it fires, but intrepid pilots must carefully choose where to direct their fire or miss out on opportunities elsewhere.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "B-Sieged: Heroes Set 1 introduces three brand-new Heroes to defend the Citadel of Modhelm: Seren, the Trickster; Axel, the Engineer; and Eyra, the Thief!<br/><br/>Seren, the Trickster<br/>As a seasoned artist, Seren, the Trickster boasts a very unique and powerful starting Special Ability: Chicanery! Through Chicanery, Seren is allowed to draw 1 Resource card from the Seasons Resources at the beginning of each of her turns, and she can choose from any of the four types (Armory, Tavern, Market or Sorcery). This ability frees her up from visiting the Citadel's buildings as frequently as other Heroes, and gives the Heroes a way to get at least one Resource card per turn. Note that unlike Kador's Archmastery or Orobox's Intimidation skills, Seren may only draw from the Season Resources, which drains from the Heroes' common resources and makes her options limited if the Season resource decks are depleted.<br/><br/>Axel, the Engineer<br/>As an Engineer, Axel comes with the Royal Artilleryman starting Special Ability. With it, Axel gets a free action per turn to either Rotate or Shoot the Catapult, and it can help the Heroes in crucial moments! Each Catapult shot may kill up to three enemies and it has a Strength of 4, so it can kill M&ouml;lens or severely damage the Avatar! The option to rotate the catapult is also important because Axel may use it to aim the catapult for another Hero, allowing him or her to shoot twice with the catapult in their turn if they wish to do so!<br/><br/>Eyra, the Thief<br/>Last, but not least, Eyra the Thief brings two starting Special Abilities that emphasize her roguish nature: Filch and Archer's Discipline. With Filch, Eyra &quot;accidentally comes by&quot; one Market resource card at the beginning of each of her turns. These Tavern Resource cards come directly from the Tavern Resource pool, so she may get a card even if the Tavern is damaged or destroyed. With her trusty one-handed crossbow and Archer's Discipline, Eyra is able to shoot with better precision at enemies in Zone 2, making her a valuable asset to help control Krohns and Gargohs and filching Tavern cards every turn!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Siedler von Hessen (The Settlers of Hesse) is the first in a new series of historical regional map expansions for the venerable Settlers of Catan line. The new line profiles famous regions of Germany during the Middle Ages, when Celts, Romans, and Germans intermingled.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Hessen celebrates the state of Hesse, home to Wiesbaden and Frankfurt am Main. Like Die Siedler von N&uuml;rnberg and the other historical expansions, it features a fixed map board. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.<br/><br/>The rules of Hessen cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Hessen is followed in six month intervals with new additions to the map line, each adding a new German region. Next in the lineup are Die Siedler von Rhein, Die Siedler von Pfalz (Palatinate), and Die Siedler von Saar.<br/><br/>Part of the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

Ultimately, the decisions you make will have consequences for the entire city through the implementation of a new and improved event system.<br/><br/>This large expansion features over 150 cards that are compatible with both the cooperative and competitive base game modes. Included in these new cards is a large selection of items that focus on the item modification mechanic, a host of extraordinary new civilians, and many new secret locations with powerful, game-changing effects.<br/>Also included in the expansion is a set of rebalanced cards, updated rules for the base game, and extra tokens to help to spread the wealth around at high player counts. Additionally, Steamfall introduces new crises and modifications to the cooperative experience that will streamline the game to its full potential.<br/><br/>The rich wonders of Steamfall await.

Introduce your children to your own childhood favorites, like Ludo, Checkers and Tic-Tac-Toe.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Boardgame Book is a beautiful compendium of the world's most entertaining and universally popular games. Every board in this fascinating and unique collection of over eighty games can be played on the page, because the book has been specially designed to open flat. For easy reference, instructions with diagrams explaining how to play are on the pages adjoining each board. All the pieces and other equipment needed for play are supplied on a separate cut-out sheet.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Here is a unique collection of over eighty games from every part of the world and dating as far back as five thousand years. Some, though very popular in their countries of origin, are almost totally unknown abroad, and others are rarities only to be found in museums and private collections.<br/><br/>Many of the games reproduced in The Boardgame Book are from an especially fine collection built up by R.C. Bell over many years. All the games have been chosen as much for their interest and visual appeal as for their value as a pleasant and universal pastime. About one third of the boards reproduced in this book are completely new designs which have been specially commissioned, with all the details taking account of traditional models.&quot;<br/><br/>",

As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population &mdash; and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost &mdash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>The add-on expands the game with new tiles of the boundaries of the playing field, which bring bonuses to the owner. The expansion includes over a dozen new building tiles, as well as new income-boosting bonuses and reputation-raising tasks when completing intermediate in-game objectives.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 1-4 players over the age of 8. The duration is about 1.5 hours.<br/><br/>",

Plenty of new cards with the Deep Strike keyword give you ways to surprise your opponent with unexpected tactics or reinforcements. Elite units continue to become more dangerous and viable for every faction, and finally, a new Chaos warlord invites you to call upon the Daemonic power of the Warp!<br/><br/>",

Bizarrely, this doesn&rsquo;t always end as badly for them as it probably should, and somehow the Scarcrag Snivellers seem to make it from season to season without being utterly wiped out&hellip;<br/><br/>Pick up a Goblin team for your games of Blood Bowl with this set of plastic miniatures. In it, you&rsquo;ll find 12 multi-part Goblins, featuring 6 pairs of unique bodies and 7 pairs of unique heads, meaning no two Goblin teams need look alike! There are also 6 Goblin team balls, featuring the kind of dirty tricks the Scarcrag Snivellers frown upon &ndash; 2 deflated, 2 with Goblins stuck in them and 2 stuffed with dynamite &ndash; 2 turn counters and 2 double-sided team tokens. The 54-component kit is supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases and a 1,000,000 gold piece roster, including 8 (eight!) team re-rolls and Fan Factor 4!<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Magic Computer Dungeon Builder set focuses on computer themed cards that manipulate cards and their effects.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Civilization: The Expansion Project <br/>is designed for five to eighteen players covering the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture to the emergence of Rome as the dominant Mediterranean power - a span of almost 8,000 years.<br/><br/>Civilization: The Expansion Project is one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements. One of the greatest advantages with Civilization: The Expansion Project is that it has a large map so that each game can be played at different location on the map. This fact alone gives the game more flexibility and depth than it's base game.<br/><br/>Included are even more civilization advancements than in advanced civilization which give the players new options for advancement. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a mapboard much larger than in advanced civilization that stretches from the Mediterranean to India as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture. Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Civilization: The Expansion Project is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, political and religious factors. Conflicts that do arise result from rivalries and shortages of land rather than from attempts to eliminate other players. Nomads, farmers, warriors, merchants, artisans, priests and citizens all have an essential part to play in the development of each nation's civilization. The player who most effectively balances these various outlooks will achieve the best balance and win the game.<br/><br/>New stuff &amp; impact on the base-game:<br/> * Redesigned extended map<br/> * More civilization advancements<br/> * 18 player at most<br/> * New victory point system<br/> * Improved timeline<br/><br/>",

Knowing their well-deserved fate if captured, they often fought with suicidal fanaticism.<br/><br/>Sinister Forces brings background articles and scenarios covering these troops and their battles to the Panzer Grenadier game system. It is not playable by itself, but requires Eastern Front to play most of the scenarios, and Afrika Korps or Desert Rats to play all of them.<br/><br/>Scenarios take place on the Eastern Front. The SS troops are of generally lower quality than the corresponding German Army pieces of Eastern Front, reflecting the lower standards of training and recruitment for these political formations. Background articles place the scenarios in the full context of the war in Russia.<br/><br/>New weapons also appear. The SS wield huge 220mm mortars seized from the French army in 1940, French-made B1 heavy tanks, B1 tanks converted to carry flamethrowers, Soviet-made T-34 tanks, and new forms of transport: light SPW 250 half-tracks and fast Volkswagen personnel carriers, the famous Kubelwagen.<br/><br/>There are SS units included of high combat value: special pieces and scenarios for the Norwegian ski battalion and for the Finnish SS battalion.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/>    Afrika Korps: The Desert War – Platoon Level Combat in World War II: A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Desert Rats<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lurking in the dark and humid corridors inside the Belly of the Beast, these scavengers feed on the bones and remnants too hard to be dissolved by the massive creature&rsquo;s normal digestive systems. Living in darkness, Bone Eaters have no eyes. Instead they use their keen sense of vibrations and smell, absorbing scents through their outstretched fingers, as they search feverishly for anything worth devouring. Even the slightest noise or movement can alert them to your presence, drawing them away from whatever old refuse they were feeding on, with the prospect of a fresher meal!<br/><br/>Bone Eaters are creatures native to the Belly of the Beast, though they are also known to wander the Forest of the Dead, as it is a world rich with things for them to feed upon! Attracted to movement and sound, Bone Eaters pounce on Heroes that move too quickly or make a lot of noise by attacking. If you stay still and silent, you just may be able to avoid the worst of their attacks, as they simply run their groping fingers across your face, sniffing for tasty morsels to devour. With their oversized mouths and gnashing jaws, Bone Eaters can steal away your items or Tokens, crushing and swallowing them if you don&rsquo;t retrieve them in time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Genetically altered for an increased mental capacity, these specimens also possess both Herculean strength and bestial savagery that they are forced to direct against Allied targets in battle.<br/><br/>These inhuman fighters cast dread into the hearts of Allied soldiers when they charge into the fray. Allied units are advised to kill Axis Gorillas on sight or keep a distance as their monstrous attacks are brutal enough to destroy both squads and walkers of any strength in close combat. Don't be surprised to see a pack of enraged gorillas tearing apart an Allied walker with a sickening ease.<br/><br/>",

While colourful biplanes gallantly duel each other as true &quot;knights of the air,&quot; colossal &ldquo;giants of the sky&rdquo; also take flight, bringing destruction to distant cities and over the battlefield.<br/><br/>Wings of Glory is probably the most popular World War One aerial combat tabletop game in the world, with a great collection of pre-painted, ready-to-play model airplanes. Thanks to its elegant and innovative game system, it is possible to start playing minutes after opening the rules. Each airplane has a unique, historically accurate, maneuver deck, yet it is easy to play.<br/><br/>The German Zeppelin Staaken R.VI was the largest airplane ever to fight during World War 1, with a wingspan more than 30 feet larger than a WW2 B-17 Flying Fortress.<br/><br/>This leviathan of the air was used in the last months of the war in pivotal historical events, such as the raids over London in 1918.<br/><br/>The wingspan of the R.VI model is about 30 cm (1 foot!). The model will be a complete, ready to play miniature in 1/144 scale, painted and assembled.<br/><br/>The model also includes everything you need to include it in your Wings of Glory aerial battles - maneuver deck, airplane card, crew management card and damage counters, new rules, and the special gaming base.<br/><br/>",

The Jedi battle the Sith lords, playing out the age-old struggle between the light and dark sides of the Force. The armies and navies of the Rebels and the Empire clash on planets and in the skies above them. The galaxy&rsquo;s smugglers and spies struggle for supremacy against the scum that lurk in the shadows. These dynamic rivalries have shaped the Galactic Civil War, and now, with the the Opposition cycle, they will take their rightful place in Star Wars: The Card Game as well.<br/><br/>Ancient Rivals kicks off the Opposition cycle and simultaneously serves as an introduction to the new themes and mechanics that will be found therein. Here, you will find a host of cards that focus on the struggles between pairs of affiliations: Jedi and Sith, Rebel Alliance and Imperial Navy, Smugglers and Spies and Scum and Villainy. The Opposition cycle also introduces a host of new fate cards, including a new type&mdash;fate cards with an affiliation. Ancient Rivals also offers up a host of iconic characters: the heroes and villains of Star Wars: Rebels begin to appear in the LCG, joined by new versions of classic characters like Dengar, Han Solo, and Darth Vader. Immerse yourself in the epic conflicts and battles of the Galactic Civil War in the Opposition cycle, beginning with Ancient Rivals!<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 231-235.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Morgana introduces two new resources: &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Mistletoe&quot; that are present in all three new modules. Gold is used to procure other resources like shields, flags, and building materials. It is also worth points at the end of the game.  Mistletoe may be spent to ignore one requirement on a mission card, making them easier to fulfill.<br/><br/>Module 1: Morgana<br/><br/>The enchantress Morgana is interfering with the search for the heir to the throne! Players may use Morgana once per round to help their cause and make it harder for other players to accomplish their goals. This module significantly increases the amount of direct player interaction in the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game round one Morgana die per player is rolled. Once per round for their turn, a player may choose to use a Morgana die and place it according to the depicted pips onto a cauldron, activating various special abilities. Additionally, they may move the Morgana figure on the board between principalities,  which blocks the principality as long as she is present. Nobody can place any figure (knight or Merlin) on the principality making any resources there unobtainable until Morgana is moved again (knights no longer count this space while moving)!<br/><br/>Additionally Morgana brings her poisoned apples, which can be used by players to manipulate any knight die and even move other players knights to do your action, really interfering with other player's plans!<br/><br/>And one more thing&mdash;using a Morgana die and spending construction materials or gold to increase the number to 7 will award the player the drinking horn that is kept in front of the player (till another player takes it from them, like Excalibur or the Holy Grail). The drinking horn not only awards one victory point as well as a poisoned apple immediately, but also gives victory points at the end of each round to the player who currently holds it.<br/><br/>Module 2: Caerleon<br/><br/>Caerleon offers hopefuls to the crown a host of new options in approaching their quest. Caerleon is comprised of 6 districts that replace the principalities on the game board. Each district works differently and alter the game play of the base game in various ways:<br/><br/>Textile district - Here players gain a flag of any color, but it is also the only place in the city where players now can gain flags. When placing the flag-bearer, players may choose two flags instead of one.<br/><br/>Stone cutter district - Here players gain a construction material of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get construction materials. When placing the builder, players may choose two materials instead of one.<br/><br/>Armor district - Here players gain a shield of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get shields. When placing the shield-bearer, players may choose two shields instead of one.<br/><br/>Gold district - Here players earn two gold each time they place a henchmen.<br/><br/>Merchant district - Here players can gain up to 4 resources, flags, shields, and construction material of their choosing. But for each resource they have to pay either one gold or another of their resources.<br/><br/>Garden district - Here players gain apples and/or mistletoe to help them on their quest.<br/><br/>Caerleon is very challenging and gives players a way to experience Merlin in a totally new light. New strategies and tactics wait to be discovered.<br/><br/>Module 3: Market<br/><br/>The market gives players the opportunity to acquire different goods by spending gold. To qualify for using the market, they must not have completed a mission on their turn. Each of the available goods costs one gold, and once taken by a player is not replaced until the good is used or a scoring has taken place. Players may use these goods when they see fit, but they have to return any market good at the end of a scoring (After the 2nd, 4th and 6th round).<br/><br/>The market goods:<br/><br/>Shields and Construction materials &mdash; work the same as other shields and construction materials.<br/><br/>Apple / Mistletoe &mdash; There tokens may be used either as an apple or as a mistletoe.<br/><br/>+ 1 Influence - When the player uses the Lady-in-waiting to place an influence, they make place the token under the influence, making it count as two influence.<br/><br/>Extra die - The token functions as an extra die of a specific value, granting the player an extra turn when they want. The number cannot be altered in any way though.<br/><br/>- description from publisher's Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

Additional Deep Strike cards enter the card pool, giving your units, attachments, and events new ways to arrive at the battlefield unseen by your foes.

It became renowned as the aircraft in which Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron&quot; gained his last 19 victories. The Dr.I offered exceptional maneuverability, due to the rudder and elevator controls that were light and powerful. Thanks to the exceptional skill of the Red Baron and his &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, the Dr.I triplane has entered the popular imagination as the most famous and iconic airplane of WW1. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following on the success of the two previous ASL Oktoberfest packs, ASLOK XXXIV takes a deep dive into the battles in France throughout Normandy and Brittany in the late spring and summer of 1944. From D-Day to the Falaise Pocket to the drive on Brest, these 12 scenarios explore the fierce fighting engaged in by the infantry, armor, and mechanized cavalry of the American, British, and Canadian forces attacking (and being counterattacked by) a wide range of German defenders, primarily fallschirmj&auml;ger and elite SS forces. The scenarios are created by veteran designers Pete Shelling, Bill Sisler, and Ted Wilcox and developed under the guidance of veteran playtesters and tournament directors Bret Hildebran and Bill Hayward. These scenarios will stretch your tactical knowledge and skills, with many different situations. Bocage features heavily (but far from exclusively). There is one night paradrop scenario, and one is an assault on a fortified gun battery, but none of the scenarios uses offboard artillery. Several scenarios feature combined arms on both sides, several more combined arms on only one side, and several are infantry only.<br/><br/>Two new boards were designed specifically for this pack and feature significantly in its scenarios. Board 84 features a large hill mass next to a small village with many hedges, numerous orchards, and scattered woods conveying a very claustrophobic rural terrain. Board 12a/b features a larger village with stone buildings partially surrounded by a board-length gully, with orchards, grainfields, and hedges throughout. Both boards show off the skill of artist Charlie Kibler. With great boards and great scenarios, Action Pack #14 is sure to be a winner.<br/><br/>",

The Majority Complete Edition combines two games previously available only in Japan, The Majority and The Majority 2.<br/><br/>The Majority:<br/>The Majority is playable with 3 or 4 players. In a 4 player game, the game is played in teams of 2, forming a 2 versus 2 game. In this game, each player will be playing a card from his or her hand to form political parties. Cards have different special abilities as well as strengths in the political party. Players will be using these cards to form a strong and powerful party. However, in this game, having the strongest party won't make you the most money. Instead, being the second most powerful party will grant you more money! Remember though, that getting some money is always better than getting nothing. You must carefully coordinate your plays with your partner so that you and your partner will end up with the most and second most powerful party!<br/><br/>In a 3 player game, the game is played almost identically. However, you will not have a partner, so it will be a 3 person free for all. You will need to play cleverly to ensure that you will end up with more money than your opponents!<br/><br/>The Majority 2:<br/>The Majority 2 is playable only with 2 players. In this game, a player's goal is to create more political factions with higher authorities than his or her opponent. Board members are the various residents of the pandemonium, including Witches, Demons, Dragons, Angels, and Reapers. These inhumane creatures are equipped with exciting and powerful special abilities that can aid their factions or hinder their opponents. The game has a very unique card drafting mechanics where the hand of cards are shared between the player and their opponent. Therefore, player must carefully decide when and which politicians to hire for their factions, as those left behind may comeback as a member of the opposition!<br/><br/>",

Winning the game requires delicate strategies...and some luck as well!!<br/><br/>A turn consists of two phases: card playing and building.<br/><br/>&bull; Players play cards directly from the top of their deck and may choose to continue unless they have three cry-face icons in play, which ends their turn immediately. When they choose to stop, they move to the building phase.<br/><br/>&bull; During the building phase, a player can use the coins gained from their previously played cards to buy a new card or to upgrade a card in their personal discard pile. To upgrade a card, pay the cost and flip it over; upgraded cards remain in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Since all cards in this game are double-sided, be careful not to flip them over accidentally when placing cards into your discard pile or when shuffling your deck. Whenever a player gains eight or more VP during a single card playing phase, that player wins immediately!<br/><br/>This edition of Design Town consists of the original Design Town from Homosapiens Lab as well as the Design Town: Reuse expansion that adds two more double-sided cards to the game.<br/><br/>",

The Imperial Navy hunts the beleaguered forces of the Rebel Alliance. Smugglers and spies fight in the shadows with the galaxy&rsquo;s scum and villainy. The Jedi and the Sith play out the endless struggle between the dark and light sides of the Force.<br/><br/>Yet there are more rivalries to be found than the obvious lines drawn between factions. There is opposition between order and chaos, between the physical and the intellectual, between those who stand alone and those who work together with their friends. You&rsquo;ll get a closer look at these and plenty of other interactions in the second Force Pack of the Opposition cycle.<br/><br/>A Wretched Hive continues to expand on the primary themes of the Opposition cycle, highlighting the differences between groups of opposing factions and bringing new ways to fight your battles to the forefront. You&rsquo;ll also see more of the characters of Star Wars: Rebels entering the game for the first time, such as Agent Kallus and Zeb Orrelios, alongside recognizable scum like Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba. Pursue your favorite vendettas with the second Force Pack of the Opposition cycle!<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 236-240.<br/><br/>",

It contains the majority of the most-used equipment and rules expansions from Total Warfare, Tactical Operations, Strategic Operations, and Interstellar Operations that are relevant to typical mech-only games.  However, the most niche equipment and optional rules are not included, making those books still necessary if you're a completist.  Construction rules are not included.<br/><br/>New material is limited to nine new Quirks, a complete lists of quirks for all mechs that had not yet had any assigned, a variety of simplified advanced terrain and fire rules, and a new quick-play system called Battlefield Support, which allows you to add artillery, air strikes, and minefields in an abstracted quick-play fashion.<br/><br/>While the rules in the Manual follow the standard BattleTech ruleset as presented in Total Warfare, in response to complaints from players they were rewritten and re-laid out from scratch in order to focus on clarity and ease of use at the tabletop.  As such, the Manual is much easier to reference than Total Warfare.<br/><br/>With reference to the 2019 box sets, the BattleMech Manual is suggested as a follow-on to the &quot;A Game of Armored Combat&quot; box set.<br/><br/>Publisher ad-copy:<br/>&quot;Using the most up-to-date rules text, the BattleMech Manual has been designed from the ground up to cater to the BattleTech player wanting to engage in an all-&rsquo;Mech battle. Includes a variety of optional rules, terrain and more. Welcome to the most table-usage-friendly BattleTech rulebook ever published!&quot;<br/><br/>The 2019 second printing incorporated errata and changed the cover art to a blue background with a red Marauder mech in the centre. The 2020 third printing incorporated errata and added an index. The fourth printing and later (in addition to further errata corrections in each) change the cover art yet again, featuring a Crusader against a jungle backdrop.<br/><br/>",

A monstrous oni stomps toward the Emerald Empire, leading waves upon waves of deadly foes to breach the Great Carpenter Wall. It is the greatest threat that Rokugan has faced in centuries&mdash;and even if the clans can unite, there is no guarantee that they will survive.<br/><br/>The Under Fu Leng's Shadow Premium Expansion is stuffed with 271 new cards for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game, and at the same time, it introduces two brand-new ways to play the game! Almost half of the new cards contained in this expansion are fully dedicated to the brand-new Shadowlands faction, and you can battle against the awe-inspiring might of the Shadowlands using two new game variants. You might choose to play the cooperative variant, either playing solo or teaming up with your friends to take on a mighty Shadowlands warlord. Or, you could embrace the darkness in a challenge variant, allowing one player to lead the forces of the Shadowlands into battle against two to four other players.<br/><br/>Whether you battle the rising darkness together with your friends, challenge them to fight the Shadowlands hordes under your command, or use this expansion&rsquo;s clan cards in your stronghold or skirmish games, Under Fu Leng&rsquo;s Shadow is packed to bursting with exciting new content for every Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game player.<br/><br/>",

Some rust early, some late, and there are some slightly weird historical twists in there too, The later trains (D - H) operate in a slightly different way from the originals. The number of trains actually used in the game will broadly be the same as in the standard game, with one or two possible exceptions.<br/><br/>Depending on how players want to handle things, players can choose which train in the current band they buy from the bank, or the game can be played so the trains are available in a strict order, causing possible angst or joy.<br/><br/>",

The card is placed on the legend track by rolling a six-sided die. When the narrator reaches this space (and after any other tokens or cards on that space are activated) Koram is placed by rolling two six-sided dice for the 10s and 1s digit.

Koram moves as usual for a gor, and should he reach space 0, this effect lasts until the end of the legend.<br/><br/>Note: If another Legend card or a creature token is activated at the same time, the &quot;Koram, the Gor Chieftain&quot; card is read last.<br/><br/>",

Now, the Dark Angels legion meets the forces of Chaos in the breach, led by Epistolary Vezuel. The Space Marines are not alone in their desperate attack, of course. They are supported by a massive force of the Vostroyan Firstborn, who now face the greatest test of the quality of their tactics and the strength of their armored forces&mdash;the Warp-infused jungles of Nectavus VI!<br/><br/>Slash and Burn invites you to continue the battle for Nectavus VI in all your games of Warhammer 40,000: Conquest. A new keyword&mdash;Deep Strike&mdash;has given your units, attachments, and events the ability to secretly enter the battlefield, only revealing their presence seconds before battle is joined. You&rsquo;ll also find a wealth of new support for Elite units, including cheaper units that offer powerful benefits to their faction&rsquo;s Elites. Finally, Slash and Burn introduces a new warlord for the Astra Militarum faction, inviting you to lead a squadron of tanks in a blaze of carnage and glory through the densely-packed jungles.<br/><br/>",

The Southern Expansion map is used for the Crossing of the Sambre. The Grand Campaign uses the Scenario Information for starting on June 15th (34.0), adding the Northern map Extension (35.0).<br/><br/>New Scenarios added:<br/><br/>&bull; # 34.0 = CROSSING THE SAMBRE 15 June, 1815 <br/>Around 9 AM Prussian outposts fell back before elements of Reille&rsquo;s II Corps and Domon&rsquo;s horsemen. As Steinmetz retired on Gosseilles, Pirch was ordered to abandon the river line and concentrate on Gilly.  Pajol&rsquo;s Cavalry Corps followed-up, moving through Charleroi. Duhesme&rsquo;s Young Guard took the place of the delayed III Corps. With the defection of General Bourmont, commander of IV Corps&rsquo;s lead division, the ensuing chaos delayed Gerard&rsquo;s marching columns.   The limited number of bridges on the Sambre, with their steep and narrow approaches, caused great delays, even with the Prussians scrambling to get away. This scenario is a race against time, to see if the French player can get into a better position for the battles of the 16th.<br/><br/>&bull; # 35.0 = THE GRAND CAMPAIGN GAME - Beyond Waterloo, 15-19 June, 1815 <br/>The Grand Campaign uses the Scenario Information for 15 June (34.0), except for the end dates and the additional special rules below.  The Grand Campaign uses the Northern map Extension to extend the game through the 19th.<br/><br/>&bull; # 36.0 = THE BATTLE OF IXELLES 19 June, 1815 <br/>Napoleon expected to fight the united Prussian and Anglo-Allied Armies in front of Brussels. This scenario assumes that none of the Prussians marched from Wavre to support Wellington. Hence the Duke would have fought only a medium-sized rearguard action at Waterloo, buying time his army to arrive near Brussels. &ldquo;If the allied army had been obliged to fall back from Waterloo, the roads from Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud, from Waterloo, and from Wavre, meet upon very strong ground about a mile and a half in front of Brussels&mdash;the right ... at Uccle upon the Senne, its centre at Vleurgat, and its left thrown back at Ixelles.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In addition, several Turn Record Charts and Anglo-Allied Setup Cards will be provided to account for the added map and associated arrival times on the WX map.

        "description": "Add-on module for War Galley.<br/><br/>Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.<br/><br/>With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.<br/><br/>At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.<br/><br/>To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.<br/><br/>There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.<br/><br/>At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.<br/><br/>The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.<br/><br/>Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

Now our adventurers will travel the lands and interact with villages, towns and cities, and explore vast wildernesses in search of amazing quests.<br/><br/>Through the use of a special calendar, the adventurers will set off from their homeland (a home hex), spending days (crossing them off on the calendar) to take actions, and all the while trying to complete quests. They will need to scout the surrounding areas and navigate towards quests they will be finding out about on their travels; however, along the way they will need to find food, rest and may encounter events that could aid, or hinder their efforts.<br/><br/>The different terrain that they will encounter (such as hills, mountains, forests, deserts, swamps, seas, marshes, tundras, jungles and grasslands) may contain rivers and roads, and these will greatly impact their movement, and make journeys slow until they can afford a mount; perhaps until then, they will try to find a passing wagon, or cart and pay for a lift.<br/><br/>As time trickles away, the seasons pass by and the adventurer will find certain times of the year more food is found during the warmer months and less during the colder months. Also various terrain events may be harder, or easier to overcome depending on the time of year.<br/><br/>If the current lands are proving difficult, or when 25 quests have been completed, it may well be time to take a voyage across the seas to a faraway land in search dungeons waiting to plundered. The adventurer pays a ship to take them, and plots a route to another land (hex) sheet. There is no limits to the number of lands that can be explored. In addition, if the adventurer wants to take part in the campaign and adventurer books released for D100 Dungeon, they may also take a voyage to those lands and play those quests too.<br/><br/>You will need the D100 Dungeon rule book to play the world builder game, and it is fully compatible with everything that has been released for D100 Dungeon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The team consists of 6 Linemen (4 of which are actually Linewomen), 2 Blitzers, 2 Throwers and 2 Catchers, each of whom are as impressively-cheekboned and beautiful as you might expect from an Elven team. The heads and shoulder pads are interchangeable between the miniatures, meaning your team can look unique.<br/><br/>There are a host of extras in the kit &ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins and 6 balls, 4 of which are encrusted with opulent gemstones. Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases and an Elven Union transfer sheet.<br/><br/>",

Backed by an international eco-terrorist organization, Ra&rsquo;s has returned to carry out his Machiavellian plans. His daughter Talia, her twisted son Heretic, and the fearsome lady Shiva make their BATMAN&trade;: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES debut in this exciting, action-packed expansion. <br/>The League of Assassins expansion includes 12 new minis, their tiles and 3 New Adventure mode missions, that can be played sequentially as a campaign.<br/>The Assassins and Assassins with rifle can be used as substitutes in corebox Adventure Mode missions and are fully recruitable in Versus Mode missions.<br/><br/>Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul goal: to Cleanse Gotham City, creeps ever closer in this 3-mission mini campaign &ndash; He&rsquo;s going to need all his cunning to outwit the Bat-team. <br/>To even up the odds &ndash; Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul plans to augment his faithful assassins, increasing their destructive capacity and giving them an edge to stand firm against Gotham City&rsquo;s guardians. <br/>Creating these boosted troops is going to be a challenge- he&rsquo;s going to have to obtain a DNA sample from his Grandson Damien, Prof Langstrom&rsquo;s formula and hardest of all-- some DNA from the Batman himself. Once these elements are gathered together, the Demons Head will create his Man-Bat commandos, poor copies of The Man-Bat augmented by Bruce&rsquo;s DNA.<br/><br/>What this villain succeeds in amassing during mission 1&amp;2 determines the Man-Bat commandos stats in mission 3.<br/><br/>Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul (The Demon&rsquo;s Head) <br/>Just how old is he? This scheming terrorist that cannot die - at least not permanently? Six centuries? Longer? His real name remains unknown, but the Egyptian name &ldquo;Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul&rdquo; (the Ghouls head&rdquo;) has long been whispered in fear. <br/> His secular experience makes him a formidable opponent: he is one of Batman&rsquo;s few enemies that knows his secret identity.<br/>Additionally when his luck runs out, Ra's can count on the strange Lazarus Pits, filled with a mysterious rejuvenating liquid, located in places loaded with mystical energy, to come back to life.<br/>Life, moreover, is his obsession, and he is ready to erase all traces of humanity to enable nature to regain its rights and create a world in perfect environmental balance.<br/> Over time, Ra's has had several wives, and several children, the most formidable of which is his daughter Talia, who aspires to take over his terrorist organization, the League of Assassins. She also gave him a grandson, Damian, Bruce Waynes&rsquo; son.<br/>Gameplay<br/>In contrast to his corebox profile, where he supported his men, this time The Demon&rsquo;s head is leading from the front, showcasing his superb munitions skills and taking full advantage of his Lazarus Pit dips induced regeneration skill.<br/>Versus power<br/>Indoctrination<br/>As Head of the League, his Assassins accompany him at all times &ndash;the event tile with an Assassins tile. At the beginning of the mission replace the event card with the Assassins tile. This tile provides 2 Assassins minis instead of the normal 4.<br/><br/>Talia Al Ghul<br/>Talia is the daughter of Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul and the on-and-off romantic interest of Batman. Her relationship with Bruce has always been complicated; the two belong to two very different worlds and often take conflicting moral stances. On one occasion, when Bruce lay drugged and injured, Talia conceived his child&mdash;a fact that would remain unknown to him for many years. Talia raised Damian according to her own standards and beliefs and this tale of secrecy did little to settle Talia and Batman&rsquo;s tumultuous love-hate relationship. Regardless of her connection to Bruce or her father, Talia remains a powerful individual in her own right.<br/> Gameplay <br/>Trained since childhood, Talia has grown into an accomplished warrior. She is equally proficient in melee and ranged combat, which are boosted by her martial arts and marksman skills. <br/>As with all league members- handling explosives is an innate ability.<br/>Versus power<br/>Bodyguard: <br/>Talia Al Ghul, worthy daughter of Ra&rsquo;s ramps up the firepower.<br/>recruits 3 assassins with rifle and replaces the event tile by their tile.<br/>At the beginning of the mission replace the event tile with an Assassins with rifle tile. This tile provides 3 Assassins with rifle minis instead of the normal 4.<br/><br/>Lady Shiva<br/>There are many hired assassins in the world, but few as formidable as Sandra Wu-San. She is arguably the most accomplished martial artist in the world, even challenging the likes of Richard Dragon and Batman. She tends to work for the highest bidder as long as the contract doesn&rsquo;t break her curious code of honor. She has even worked for Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Assassins. Her only weakness is that she seeks an opponent who can actually defeat her. At this point she has yet to find one, but perhaps someday her daughter, Cassandra Cain, will provide the challenge she so desperately craves. <br/>Gameplay<br/>A Master assassin, this lady annihilates her opponents. And if a hero is foolish enough to throw down, odds are they won&rsquo;t live to regret the decision.<br/>Versus power<br/>Fatality<br/>Expert in assassination, she targets an opponent&rsquo;s Leader or Lieutenant, hunts them down and strikes (Melee attack) with 2 orange dice and level 2 poison.<br/><br/>Heretic<br/>When the League of Assassins created Damian Wayne, it was a complex and delicate process. In the end, Talia Al Ghul was not completely satisfied with her son&rsquo;s loyalty or his capabilities. To improve on this design, she employed blasphemous arts and cloned him in the hope of creating a perfect warrior&mdash;one who would be fully grown, merciless, and, most importantly, obedient. What she ultimately got was a monstrous killing machine&mdash;another creation she deemed a failure. <br/> Gameplay <br/>This fearless product of the Al Ghul&rsquo;s experimentation with Damian&rsquo;s DNA delivers devastating blows, this combined with his ability to take on multiple opponents make him the League member of choice to break through the other sides lines and take out its leader.<br/>Versus power<br/>Fury of the clone<br/>Damian&rsquo;s clone performs a melee attack using berserk skill level 2.<br/><br/>Assassins with rifle<br/> Gameplay <br/>Adept at ranged combat, these new troops are also explosives experts.<br/>They can be substituted in the following corebox Adventure Mode Missions &ndash; <br/>&ldquo;To Sink a City&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chain Mutation&rdquo;, &ldquo;An Icy Welcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;Suicide Escape&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sleep Well Children&rdquo;.<br/>Heads up &ndash; when a villain chooses to replace a tile in their river, he does so BEFORE the heroes form their team from the available choices.<br/><br/>Assassins<br/> Gameplay <br/>The triple skilled troop type, they are good in a fight, move quickly and avoid ranged attacks, but remain fragile in melee in comparison to other Elite troops.<br/>They can be substituted in the following corebox Adventure Mode Missions &ndash; <br/>&ldquo;To Sink a City&rdquo;, &ldquo;An Icy Welcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good Cops / Bad Cops&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sleep Well Children&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High Tide - An Harpoon 4 expansion boxed set. Based on what we have learned since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it compares, for the first time, the strengths and weaknesses of the Cold-War adversaries at the height of their power. The 128- page scenario book provides thirty naval battles, covering all types of naval operations: antisubmarine warfare, convoy operations, mining missions, amphibious landings, air-strikes on land and naval target, special missions, and sub-on-sub engagements from between 1980 and 1989.<br/><br/>Sidebars describe the naval technology of the time, as well as important events and key leaders. Over half the scenarios are part of a linked campaign based on a story line written by Larry Bond and Chris Carlson. Jay Wissmann has contributed the scenarios.  The foreword was written by Dr. John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy from 1981 to 1987. Dr. Lehman was directly responsible for the condition and performance of the U.S. Fleet, and its amazing buildup during that decade.<br/><br/>High Tide's Data Annex is a comprehensive listing of platforms, weapons and sensors for naval, air, and some land units.  All the data is based on real-world information, and is the most accurate unclassified source in existence. The rules, which are also the basis for the Harpoon computer game, describe how weapons and sensors behave, individually and in combination, how to improve their performance or reduce their effectiveness. Sidebars provide deeper background and guidance on basic tactics.Completing the boxed set are 210 ship (1/2&quot;x 1&quot;) and 140 aircraft and weapons counters (1/2&quot;x 1/2&quot;).<br/><br/><br/>    The Harpoon Series<br/><br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    Harpoon 4<br/><br/><br/>",

They were able to harness Wakfu (live force) and forged alliances with many other powerful races at that time. However, as the result of a treacherous event caused the destruction of the majority of the race, leaving only a small handful left in the present day. Yugo is the reincarnation of one of the kings of the Eliatrope and is the protagonist of the anime Wakfu. He is able to use Wakfu to create phantasmal weapons and open portals to transport himself and his allies to faraway places.<br/><br/>Faithful to his anime character, Yugo, in Krosmaster: Arena, can use Wakfu to attack his enemies. Though it is a short range attack, it has the distinction of being one of the few attacks in the game that deals neutral damage, allowing it to ignore elemental resistances. He is also able to create portals to move himself or his allies to other locations nearby, giving him great utility to any team's mobility. If paired up with his teammates from the anime, who are also promotional figures, his spells will become more efficient, allowing him to use more of them during his turn.<br/><br/>",

We think Katrina really captured our good looks.<br/>     Hellcow Boss Card - In our final stages of playtesting, we have been honored to have game designer and novelist Keith Baker playing the game and offering crucial advice. We are big fans of Keith's work on Gloom, the Eberron D&amp;D campaign setting, and many other games, so it's been reassuring to see such a seasoned designer having a blast with our game. To celebrate, we figured we had to immortalize his bovine alter ego as a Boss!<br/>     Pixel Lincoln Hero Card - In launching a pixel-themed card game on Kickstarter, we knew that some people would compare us to Pixel Lincoln. But though we may have begun as rivals, that all changed when Pixel Lincoln designer Jason Tagmire ended up with a review copy of Boss Monster. He saw right away that the games are very different, but both awesome. So at Jason's suggestion, we've joined forces to bring time-traveling Pixel Lincoln to the world of Boss Monster as a truly Epic Hero ...and King Croak will be popping up as a promo card for Pixel Lincoln!<br/>     T.P.K. Spell Card -  If you've Mastered a few Dungeons, you might be familiar with the concept of a Total Party Kill. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Atlantis &amp; Trisland is a full size, full color mounted expansion that folds to a size that will fit in both the Steam and Age of Steam boxes. While both maps are island based, they couldn&rsquo;t be more different: Atlantis is an epic map focusing on the struggles of the island nation to somehow create a self-sustaining rail network that reaches the shore from a central hub of production, while Trisland is a 3-player-only map with elegant simplicity and symmetry.<br/><br/>Atlantis takes place on the mythical island of lore, where you&rsquo;ll need to figure out how the giant city of Atlantia in the center of the island can reach the towns and cities along the coast. It&rsquo;s expensive, production is very limited, and the competition is brutal. Atlantis was originally designed 5 years ago, but was deemed too harsh and unforgiving for even the bravest players...it was shelved and only recently picked up again and tweaked to make it slightly more friendly, with an emphasis on slightly. Bankruptcy or utter hopelessness is almost always just around the corner when playing this map. Atlantis is for 3-6 players who are comfortable seeing their opponents weep uncontrollably.<br/><br/>Trisland is the perfect 3 player map. By perfect, not only is gameplay streamlined and optimized for 3 players, but it is also perfectly symmetrical. Very few rule tweaks are included with the map, making this a perfect &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Steam/Age of Steam playing experience for three players. The rule changes that are present are specifically designed to address the shortcomings of Steam/Age of Steam when played with three players. Trisland is for 3 players, and 3 players only.<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double size expansions. These maps can be preordered from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.beziergames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.beziergames.com</a> and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; 7th map is only available through preorders. Expansion #1: California Gold Rush &amp; Underground Railroad as well as Expansion #2: Amazon Rainforest and Sahara Desert have been previously announced. Details about the remaining bonus pre-order only map will be coming in the next few weeks from Bezier Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Their footsteps have shaken the earth for millions of years. Large, heavy and armored, but also small, agile and deadly, dinosaurs shaped their time from the top of the food chain. Today, another species dominates, it moves on two legs, builds huge colonies and shapes the landscape like no other species before. Evolutionary, however, every challenge is also an opportunity. Find your niches, face the new situation and become Darwin's Choice.<br/><br/>Darwin&rsquo;s Choice - Before and After is the expansion to Darwin&rsquo;s Choice and requires the base game. The expansion brings over 240 new Animal Cards into play, with a focus on dinosaurs and prehistoric species. In addition, human-made events and territories set the focus of this expansion on the consequences towards nature and evolution created by humanity. The expansion fits seamlessly into the theme of the base game and creates a reference to today&lsquo;s environmental challenges. All artworks are again beautifully hand-drawn by the French artist Rozenn Grosjean, giving the game its very own style.<br/><br/>Since the team behind Darwin's Choice cares for the environment, the expansion will once again be solely made out of sustainable wood and contain as little plastic as possible. In addition, both the base game and the expansion will be 100% carbon neutral.<br/><br/>Darwin's Choice is a competitive card game in which players create their own animal species from more than 230 animal cards. These animal species will be placed in biomes that differ strongly in their requirements and food availability. The highest possible adaptation of animal species to their biomes not only ensures their survival but is also rewarded with the coveted Darwin points. In addition to a high adaptation the species with the highest competitive strength are also awarded across all zones.<br/><br/>Between the 3-4 eras played, conditions can change completely due to biome changes and event card effects. The task is now to adapt the successful animal species of the past eras to the conditions of the present, either through sophisticated mutations or smart migration to other biomes. However, you must always keep an eye on the animal species of the other players in order to anticipate their actions, because anyone who acts too quickly or imprudently might be unable to react at the decisive moment.<br/><br/>Darwin's Choice is a strategic allocation game in which you must think carefully about how to use your cards. The large number of own possibilities and the ones of your opponent lead to a high variability, which makes thinking through each action and thinking ahead indispensable. The randomness caused by drawing cards (animal cards, biomes, event cards) requires flexibility and fast rescheduling. This results in each played game being completely different and thus guarantees a high replayability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The improved D.Va version was widely used by the Luftstreitkr&auml;fte, and piloted by German aces as Udet and Jacobs, until it was replaced by the Fokker D.VII in the last months of the war. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.

There is also a solo mode new to Shaolia which introduces a Boss for the player to battle.<br/><br/>A game of Great Houses proceeds much the same as one of Warring States, but with the addition of the Noble House tiles and Quest cards. These two new components work in tandem.<br/><br/>Noble House Tiles<br/>These tiles can be purchased during the purchase phase of the game. The currency to purchase them are Quest cards that players have earned in the game. After a Noble House tile has been purchased, it is immediately replaced by another from the deck.<br/><br/>Noble House tiles are placed near the player&rsquo;s territory board, and function the same as Level 1 &amp; 2 cards, with one important exception: They cannot be attacked, blocked, or destroyed, so a player will benefit from their abilities until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Quest Cards<br/>If a player completes the requirement listed on a Quest card during their turn, they get to take the quest card into their hands. Another Quest card from the deck is immediately drawn to replace the one taken.<br/><br/>As mentioned previously, Quest cards can be used to purchase Noble House tiles. Alternately, you may sell one a Quest card for 2 gold.<br/><br/>There are two types of Quest cards: ones that are immediately achieved by meeting their requirements, and ones with 2&ndash;3 open slots that require players to repeat the action listed on the card that many times before they complete the quest. Cards with these repeating quests can only be completed by whoever does the action first, claiming it with one of their quest trackers.<br/><br/>A game of Shaolia: Great Houses ends the same turn that someone either gains 18 culture, or does 12 damage to their opponent&rsquo;s palace. Additionally, there will be that previously-mentioned third victory path achieved through completing quests.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion includes four survivors (there are no zombivors) from the Dork Tower webcomic designed by John Kovalic.<br/><br/>John Kovalic has been writing and drawing in the gaming industry professionally for 20 years, now. John is best known for the comic strip DORK TOWER, and games like APPLES TO APPLES and MUNCHKIN. His latest project include games such as ROFL! and DOUBLE FEATURE (Cryptozoic). When not writing or drawing, John's spending every minute possible with his wife and daughter. You can find out more about John by visiting <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dorktower.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.dorktower.com</a>, or plying him with craft beer.<br/><br/>The four survivors include:<br/><br/>MATT<br/>&quot;You rolled CRITICAL FAIL, Meat-Pillow! I know 'cuz I'm the DM!&quot;<br/><br/>Matt McLimore was a web cartoonist and Game Master for his local group in quiet little Mud Bay, Wisconsin. DM'ing made him a natural leader, gaming taught him strategy, while trying to make a living cartooning trained him to survive on little. General frustration, and plenty of free time spent playing &quot;Warhamster: ZombieSide,&quot; meant that when the zombies did come, Matt was ready and waiting. The hordes have disrupted his weekly gaming sessions, and they're gonna pay - and he doesn't mean in Gold Pieces or Experience Points. And unlike his game-table experience, he's not giving any of them a saving roll!<br/><br/>GILLY<br/>&quot;Head-shot between the eyes! SQUEEEE!&quot;<br/><br/>Gilly Woods was Mud Bay's Perky Goth fangirl and cosplayer, so she's always been an outsider, making her strong, fiercely independent and self-reliant. She's had to put up with idiot fanboys labeling her a &quot;fake geek girl&quot; long enough. A veteran of many long Comic-Cons, she's used to dealing with the mindless, shambling, unwashed masses. Since most of the haters were zombie-like to begin with, she doesn't see a whole heck of a lot of difference between putting down a basement-dwelling fanboy with a well-timed quip, or plugging a zombie right between the eyes with a trusty Glock.<br/><br/>IGOR<br/>&quot;There's another one coming out of the sewer! HUZZAH! It must be mine!&quot;<br/><br/>Igor Olman believes anything worth doing is worth doing to excess: comics, gaming, movies, and fandom in general. So it's no surprise that when the horrors of the hordes appeared on his doorstep, he launched into them with all the gusto of a Warhamster Fantasy Roleplay 25th-level Dwarven Hellwarrior armed with Zordaz's +25 Axe of Lordly Slicing and Dicing, with the &quot;Mighty Big Cleave&quot; bonus. Nobody's quite sure where Igor got his full arsenal of bazookas and rocket launchers from. Nobody's quite sure where he was storing then. Frankly, his friends are afraid to ask.<br/><br/>Igor calls his bazooka &quot;THAC0.&quot;<br/><br/>CARSON<br/>&quot;I live my life by the Muskrat Way. And right now, those zombies are in the way.&quot;<br/><br/>Carson the Muskrat is a mild-mannered soul. But he's small, fast, and clever, making him hard to get a hold of. And somehow he got a hold of a vintage, fully-operational British Bren Carrier. Igor may have been involved, frankly.<br/><br/>Don't let Carson's quiet demeanor and trepidatious outlook on life fool you: when his friends are threatened, he fights like a cornered animal: literally.<br/><br/>",

With nothing else to compete for, the bored populace has turned to the Super Brawl for entertainment. These same powerful magics are now used to reach back into the timelines to pluck out the finest warriors from every civilization in order to compete against each other in the greatest entertainment spectacle ever staged.<br/><br/>Super Fantasy Brawl is a fun, fast-paced competitive miniatures board game. Players select a team of three champions and combine their unique action cards to create a synergistic action deck. The game is faction-free, so players have their choice of any combination of champions they wish. Each turn, the players use their hand of action cards to maneuver, attack, displace enemies, and claim objectives to score victory points.<br/><br/>The objectives in Super Fantasy Brawl are only scored at the beginning of a players' turn, ensuring that you always get a chance to disrupt your enemy's plans and position your champions to score the objective for yourself. This tactical to-and-fro continues until one player reaches the victory point threshold, declaring themselves the winner and advancing towards victory in the Super Brawl tournament!<br/><br/>Super Fantasy Brawl will also offer a 2v2 mode for 4 players to clash in an all-out melee mashup!<br/><br/>",

To use this expansion, select your favorite heroes from one of the existing games, then dive into this new campaign!<br/><br/>The King of Keoland, after unsuccessful expansion to the north, has turned his eyes southward, to Saltmarsh, with the intention of turning this village into an important port to increase the stature of his kingdom &mdash; but not everyone in the village is happy about the new developments, and old enemies fight for control, unaware of a new enemy about to rear its ugly head.<br/><br/>You come through the town gates and cross Sharkfin Bridge...to the screams of townsfolk and the unmistakable sounds of fighting. You do not know the situation but you are sure you are needed.<br/><br/>Return to the classic gameplay of the D&amp;D Adventure System, with some exciting new changes! You'll still take on the role of a D&amp;D hero, with thematic skills and abilities, either on your own or as a group of up to five adventurers. You'll face multiple scenarios in an overarching campaign, evolving and leveling up your character on the way. You'll explore treacherous dungeons, avoid deadly traps, and defeat terrifying monsters. You can also play your favorite scenarios on their own as a standalone experience!<br/><br/>Ghosts of Saltmarsh includes eight new highly-detailed Sahuagin miniatures, including two powerful new villains to encounter in your adventures! You'll add these to the miniatures from your Adventure System Games to populate the board, using included tokens to represent any monsters you may not already have. (If you do own the related games, feel free to replace the token with the appropriate miniature!)<br/><br/>In addition to the &quot;exploring&quot; adventures familiar to fans of Adventure System games, where tiles come out one by one, there are adventures that take place in the town of Saltmarsh itself, a set map made up of six double-sized tiles, where you'll fight to keep villagers safe from monsters after their own ends. It's an exciting and different game mode, where without exploration, the new Adventure deck provides the challenges and surprises that stand between the Heroes and success.<br/><br/>",

And in a world of eternal war, these races each harbor ancient enmities. As the races of the Old World continue to seek new means of routing their old foes, Warhammer: Invasion - Glory of Days Past &ndash; the fourth Battle Pack in the &quot;Eternal War&quot; cycle &ndash; presents them with sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards) that explore their traditional strengths while developing strategies based around dynamic battlefield phases and the Ambush and Raider keywords.<br/><br/>As ceaseless battles deplete each army's resources, the Dwarfs rely upon the riches of their mines and the talents of a legendary runesmith to forge new defenses. Elite Greenskin Warriors and Cavalry surge forward in an endless tide of violence. Men of the Empire ready to meet them with both Spells and steel, though the forces of Chaos seek to corrupt every army&rsquo;s mightiest heroes. High Elf Mages seek to protect themselves and their armies by harnessing the Eight Winds, but their dark kin, the Dark Elves, draw strength from their hatred and malice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manila, on the Philippine island of Luzon, was known throughout the world as &quot;The Pearl of the Orient&quot; for its lush gardens, modern buildings, and vibrant nightlife. It was also a strategically critical naval base, featuring the largest deep-water port in the Pacific. With the fall of the Philippines in 1942, the Japanese turned Manila into an enormous supply depot serving as a hub from which supplies could be shipped to bases across the Pacific, all the while ruling the Philippines with an iron fist. After more than two years of brutal Japanese occupation, General Douglas MacArthur &quot;returned&quot; to the Philippines in October 1944 at Leyte Gulf. In January 1945, the Americans invaded Luzon. They reached the outskirts of Manila in the first week of February and prepared to assault the city. The Japanese commander of Manila, Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi, had no grand plan for victory; just a fight to the death, taking as many American lives as possible.<br/><br/>Sword and Fire: Manila is a Historical Advanced Squad Leader (HASL) module covering the month-long American effort to wrest control of &quot;The Pearl&quot; from the Japanese. Arrayed against the attackers was a mixture of veteran Japanese Marine and Army units and inexperienced Naval units composed of sailors, aircraft crewmen, and conscripted laborers with little or no formal ground combat training or experience. They were well-equipped with numerous machine guns as well as anti-aircraft guns ranging from 12.7mm to 120mm. They would fight for every building, every courtyard, and every garden as the defenses fell back upon the ancient walls of Intramuros. Built by the Spaniards in 1571 as a fortress town, this walled city would be Iwabuchi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alamo&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Sword and Fire: Manila features rules for the city's unique terrain types such as Multi-Material, Adobe, and Steel-Walled Buildings; Stone Monuments; Bomb Craters; the many detailed elements of Intramuros; and a host of others. Twenty-five scenarios and five Campaign Games (CG) &ndash; ranging in size from 6-15 CG Dates &ndash; are played out on the six map sheets depicting the city.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publihser<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A weapon promo card for Adrenaline that was exclusively designed for Dice Tower and was included in one of the reward promo packs for their Season 13 fundraising campaign.<br/><br/>Basic effect: Deal 1 damage and 1 mark to one target you can see. Deal 1 mark to a different target you can see; then you may teleport it to a randomly selected spawnpoint.<br/><br/>Notes: You randomly select the destination by revealing and discarding the top card of the powerup deck. The teleport works like the effect of the Teleporter powerup. If you choose only one target, you either give it 1 damage and 1 mark, or you give it 1 mark and you may choose to teleport it.<br/><br/>",

It was one of the most capable fighters of the war, and one of the most widely employed. The single-engine Spad XIII was faster than its main contemporaries, and it was renowned for its speed and strength in a dive. This aircraft was flown by famous French and Italian pilots and also by American pilots including the ace Eddie Rickenbacker. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Chroma Dragon Dungeon builder set is another good all-around set!<br/><br/>",

And she was right: the little boy was gifted with incredible luck. Yet Marvin didn&rsquo;t ask for anything. Being left in peace was all he wanted. Marvin&rsquo;s life was turned upside down the day his family was caught in a grisly accident. The boy was extracted from the rubbles without a scratch but was now an orphan.<br/><br/>Years flew by and Marvin became a bodyguard. As if to ward off the past, he used his luck to better protect his fellow Survivors. When the zombie apocalypse came, Marvin was not afraid for himself but for his friends.<br/><br/>Nowadays, Marvin scouts the city trying to save as many people as possible. His legendary luck hasn&rsquo;t left him and gives him the aura of a &ldquo;redemption angel&rdquo;: some people pray to him and beg him to find their lost ones amidst the death vortex. Marvin&rsquo;s still cool: no way he&rsquo;s going to become some kind of messiah. His dearest wish hasn&rsquo;t changed since his childhood: all he wants is to be left in peace.<br/><br/>Marvin is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  He may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.<br/><br/>",

It's a total blast to play, but it's not for the thin-skinned.<br/><br/>The 11 new abilities can be individually added to the WILD Coaster from the base game to spice things up. Or players may use the included Anger Management Disc and Anger Coaster combination to create a quick mix of new abilities to explore.<br/><br/>(A set of 4 Angry Dice, originally included with this package, is needed for one of the abilities.)<br/><br/>The Dice Hate Me Signature Series:<br/>The Dice Hate Me Signature Series is an elegant set of miniature games that can be added to the base game of VivaJava Dice and is fully compatible with the Anger Expansion. Five excellent Dice Hate Me Games titles are represented in the mix (Brew Crafters, Compounded, Belle of the Ball, Carnival, and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and each comes with an ability disc and Coaster combination that are added to the WILD Coaster from the base game.<br/><br/>While the Anger Expansion is focused on adding more player interaction and wilder ability combinations, The Dice Hate Me Signatures Series focuses again on expanding the game with meaningful and alternate ways to score points and move forward toward victory. Each of the Coasters takes thematic and mechanical cues from the represented games, and will be nostalgic to those familiar with the other Dice Hate Me titles.<br/><br/>",

Featuring new tactical options for your Allied and Axis armies, these primed, unpainted miniatures will expand and enhance your existing forces.<br/><br/>For the Allies, the Medium Assault Walker expansion contains one Allied walker that can be customized to multiple types including the Allies&rsquo; newest walker: the Steel Rain! Altogether, the Medium Assault Walker expansion delivers all the parts you need to field a Pounder, a Hot Dog, a Mickey, or a Steel Rain.<br/><br/>The Medium Combat Walker M2-F, or Steel Rain, is a mobile dispenser of mass destruction. Although its mighty rockets don&rsquo;t leave any space to carry the .50 cal, and the weight of the frame and the artillery shells prevent Steel Rain from jumping over obstacles, these minor drawbacks are overshadowed by an impressive armament. Its 4.2&rsquo;&rsquo; rockets can set sizable areas of the battlefield aflame and annihilate the enemy, and its massive mortar fires explosive shells weighing 20 kilos each!<br/><br/>",

They mean to turn the mountain to the service of Chaos by desecrating its every chamber through dark sorcery and brutal sacrifice. It was Khagra&rsquo;s sister Zarshia who led the warband into Beastgrave, but they soon became trapped in a gnashing chamber. Khagra wedged her shield between the cavern floor and the encroaching ceiling before carving a way out of the rocky gullet, and since then, the brutal warriors Cragan and Razek have turned to Khagra for direction. Zarshia has not abandoned her own ambitions, however, and is poised to overturn her upstart sibling when the opportunity arises.<br/><br/>Claim the living mountain in the name of the Dark Gods with Khagra's Ravagers. They're tough, strong, and wield sorcerous power, giving you multiple ways to desecrate Direchasm.

        "description": "Starcadia Quest: Showdown is a brand-new expansion that complements not only Starcadia Quest but also plugs into the Arcadia Quest series as well! Showdown is not about going on an arduous quest to defeat evil monsters, no siree! Showdown introduces a new mode: full Player-versus-Player deathmatches that will see players draft &amp; pick all-new Upgrade tokens and enter a vicious arena to battle enemy Crews!<br/><br/>The action in Showdown takes place in a Double-sided Game Board, with one side designed for 3-4 players, and a 2 players version on the back. With its tight corridors and sharp turns, the Crews (and Guilds) will see themselves immersed into non-stop action! Only 1 Stimpack, 1 Recharge Token and 2 Computer Terminals are still functioning in the arena and sometimes become contested hotspots. In Showdown, the Crews don&rsquo;t claim Victory by accumulating Victory Points: the first Crew that manages to score 3 Kills is deemed Victorious!<br/><br/>Thanks to the Hollow Deck technology, Starcadians can conjure up the legendary Heroes from ancient Arcadia to test their mettle! With 60 Hero cards and 4 Crew Dashboards (sporting an appropriately battle-damaged look and slots for Pets and Mounts!) players with any Arcadia Quest core box (Classic or Inferno) or with the Starcadia Quest core box can join the Showdown!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;At the start of 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt had divergent views on the conduct of the war. The British Prime Minister favoured a strategy which focussed on the peripheries of Europe: Italy was a ripe fruit ready to be plucked, via Sicily. For the American President on the contrary, Germany was the sole objective. The enemy was to be struck right in the heart of his war economy, the Ruhr, and by the most direct route: France ! Two operations are studied in the game : &quot;Round up&quot; and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; which for the Anglo-American general staffs quickly became one operation, &quot;Roundhammer&quot;.<br/><br/>The Trident conference in Washington in May 1943 gave Churchill his way, clearing the road for the invasion of Italy. The Quebec conference in August 1943 (Quadrant) cancelled Roundhammer definitively in favour of the future Operation Overlord in 1944, developed in the game Liberty Roads.<br/><br/>But what would have happened if the allies had dared to launch Operation Roundhammer in mid-September 1943, as the generals had planned?<br/><br/>At this date, the Atlantic Wall defences were still barely started on many beaches. A large number of the German divisions in France at that time were undergoing training and were not yet operational. As for the Panzer Divisions, they were not yet equipped with the formidable Panther tank.<br/><br/>But on the allied side there was a lack of US units. The majority had been sent to the Mediterranean, or were training in the USA. The amphibious capacity of the invasion force was far from sufficient and British reserves were very weak. Worse yet, aerial supremacy was not complete with an omnipresent Luftwaffe. Mission impossible?<br/><br/>The Roundhammer 1943 module allows you to supply an answer through this what-if game ! The extension of Liberty Roads includes those extra units present in Western Europe at the time, along with new supports and Atlantikwall/D-Day markers, with a &lsquo;1943&rsquo; ambiance.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Especially when referencing different games or universes.<br/><br/>Well I made an exception to the rule as the art for Naturopolis: Points of Interest started to come in we noticed that the point of interest (a rainbow over some more prominent flowers) really looked like a Sprawlopolis curved road shape. We laughed and made sure it wasn't in the same position as the roads to avoid any confusion and kept moving forward. As time went on we realized that not only is it still kind of confusing as it looks like a road just in a different position, but IT SHOULD JUST BE A ROAD.<br/><br/>So here it is, the first Point of Interest that introduces new rules. This rainbow is also a road, and it's a road that does not count towards your road tax. If you ever needed a little buff to help your score, Points of Interest is there for you, and this one can help prevent you from losing yet another point (actually 2 points in Naturopolis!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On every inhabited world in the known galaxy, the Tolmek appeared, a race of pan-dimensional beings of immense power. Everywhere their message was the same: &quot;We are dying and must choose a successor.&quot; The Tolmek are the keepers of the Key to the Universe, a powerful artifact that holds the secrets of their power. They will give this Key to the race that proves themselves most capable and worthy. The Tolmek are watching. Will you inherit the Key to the Universe?<br/><br/>The small expansion Empires of the Void: Key to the Universe is designed to make the game more fun and balanced. Players now have a fourth action each round that can be used to perform new actions. One of the new actions is called Enslave, which increases the income of conquered planets. Also included are technology boards, which replace tech tokens and have a number of new technologies that open up new paths to victory. Four additional alien races provide more choices for players. Key to the Universe also has a new, revised rulebook for Empires of the Void that makes the game easier to learn and more clearly explains how to play.<br/>  <br/>Key to the Universe, currently in beta-testing, is available as a free downloadable, print-and-play expansion here:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.redravengames.com/empires-of-the-void-key-to-the-universe/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.redravengames.com/empires-of-the-void-key-to-the-...</a><br/><br/>",

Shadows haunt the streets, closing in from the North, the East, and the South, and dark prophecies speak of terrors just on the horizon. Perhaps the time of great Houses and powers has passed.<br/><br/>Those who do not fight for a king or queen find a new agenda that can allow them to join the brotherhood without banners in the hollow hill. This Chapter Pack also continues to develop the shadow keyword, allowing your battles for the Iron Throne to take on an added level of intrigue with shadowy new events to give you the edge by embracing the true nature of your faction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

From there, the 5 dragonslayers began their journey into the core of the moon.<br/><br/>Buried in the bodies of their fallen foes in their pierced battlesuits, the knights of the KG 01 were imbued with Tsukuyumi's power and became Oni. But due to their training and their faith they were able to resist the transformation and keep their own will. With their new powers they patched their battlesuits with organic mass and ascended from the inner core of the moon. Half Oni and half knight. Ready to rain havoc on whoever steps in the way of their crusade. Their DARK CRUSADE.<br/><br/>Playstyle<br/><br/>The Dark Crusade are immensely powerful. But like the KG 03 they only have few units. In fact they have even less units then their righteous brothers, namely three.<br/><br/>As the Dark Crusade are kind of Oni themselves they can to certain amount interact and even control the Oni.<br/>All Oni adjacent to Grendel count as units of the Dark Crusade and can be moved by the player and can even perform attacks.<br/><br/>As long as Lilith is in play, areas with Oni in them can not be conquered and finally every area Samael enters gains the Tsukuyumi area property.<br/><br/>Oh, and I almost forgot Baal. But he just sits in his drop pod (The KG 01 homezone) and shoots everybody who comes near him.<br/>Like the KG 03 the Dark Crusade wants to dictate the pace of the game right from the start and center the attention on the moon and areas that a worth more VP.<br/><br/>The Dark Crusade really are the new powerhouse in town.<br/><br/>Did I mention that Grendel has an atomic bomb for a heart?<br/><br/>No? And guess what, he can blow it up, inflicting tons of damage! Literally TOOOONS of damage.<br/><br/>So are you ready to expose yourselves to Tsukuyumi's pheromones and step inside a tainted battlesuit to bring wrath upon your opponents?<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Darkness Dungeon Builder Set focuses heavily on vaporizing and hiding cards.<br/><br/>",

The Survivors may now visit the Woodbury Location and take their chances with the Resource Deck there, but must also avoid The Governor or he'll gun down anything in his path! The Woodbury Expansion now allows up to five players to play at once and offers an alternate win condition.<br/><br/>The Woodbury Location is added to the standard game set-up by placing it adjacent to two of the four starting Location tiles. Survivors sneaking into Woodbury can take their chances with the Woodbury Resource deck there. These cards have big highs and devastating lows. Examples include: Seduced, Assault Rifle, Enter the Arena, and Bargaining Chip. However, as a well-maintained and protected enclave, the good stuff outweighs the bad &mdash; and there aren't very many Walkers to deal with there!<br/><br/>Alternate Victory Condition: If your team of Survivors can draw up all of the Woodbury cards or find other ways to deplete the entire Woodbury deck, the Survivors win the game! The Woodbury deck begins the game with five cards per Survivor (plus a base five cards), so it's a well-balanced objective no matter how many Survivors there are.<br/><br/>Watching over everything is The Governor. Armed with his heavy Assault Rifle, he moves around the board causing all sorts of problems for the Survivors. However, with careful planning and some risk management, crafty players can get The Governor to help clean up pockets of Walkers. Just don't get too close to him when the bullets start flying, or you might get caught in the crossfire!<br/><br/>The Governor is an automated game piece on the board that moves to a new Location each round and creates plenty of panic. Alternately, the expansion provides a new &quot;Versus Mode&quot; where one player takes on the role of The Governor and works against all of the Survivors! The Survivor players must now win the game as a team or else The Governor player wins it all for himself. Instead of using automated or randomized movement, a player in control of The Governor can move at his own discretion, turning The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense into a five-player game!<br/><br/>",
