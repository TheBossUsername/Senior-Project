        "description": "A set of four dice that will fairly determine who goes first in a game... or just a very simple game to itself. The four specially numbered twelve-sided dice have the following properties when rolled one against one another:<br/><br/>1. There will never be ties.<br/>2. Each die always has an equal chance of rolling high. This is regardless of whether all four are rolled against one another, or ANY subset of 2 or 3 dice are rolled against one another.<br/>3. The fairness extends to all permutations of lower positions too; meaning that the 2nd highest roll can fairly determine who should go second in a game, the 3rd highest roll determines third player, and so on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alien City is a game that is set in the far future and concerns the building of a city on a newly colonized world. Society in this distant time is divided into four powerful guilds. These are the Energy Guild (symbolized by a red sun), the Synthesis Guild (symbolized by a blue fountain), the Control Guild (the most powerful guild of all, symbolized by a green crown), and the Builder's Guild (symbolized by a black tool---yes, that's how tools look in the far future).<br/><br/>Cities in this future contain two types of structures, towers and domes. Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.<br/><br/>Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.<br/><br/>The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.<br/><br/>The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three.<br/><br/>Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all<br/>available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city. Then scores are determined based upon the relative positions of the towers and domes.<br/><br/>Winner of the piecepack Ludic Synergy design contest.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Abstract Play<br/><br/><br/>",

They'll have a bit of time to create a simple plot, mixing the panels they have and creating a full comic page, following the theme of the story. The fun part comes when those crazy stories get actually told...and reviewed!<br/><br/>Co-Mix tests players' imagination and creativity, putting them in the shoes of comic writers with a strict schedule. They need to think quickly, get inspiration by the panels in their hand (with hundreds of panels included in the game), craft their story, and expose their creations to each other.<br/><br/>Co-Mix is a game for everyone. The inspirational illustrations, with their varied set of characters, actions and settings, guides the players through the creation of short, fun and (more often than not) crazy stories that are sure to cause more than one laugh.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Duel Masters, players build a deck of creatures and spells using cards from starter decks and booster packs. Your creatures are brought into play by paying the mana cost associated with it and are used to attack your opponents creatures or shields. Each player starts the game with 5 shields in play. These shields are merely 5 cards from your deck that are dealt face-down in front of you before the game starts. The shields, along with any &quot;tapped&quot; creatures you have in play, form your defenses. When a creature attacks a player and isn't blocked, that creature breaks one of that player's shields. Each time a player's shield is broken, the player puts the shield into his hand. You win the game if on of your creatures attacks your opponent when he has no shields left (as long as your creature isn't blocked).<br/><br/>Duel Masters is played in a very similar fashion to Magic: The Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. Much of the terminology used in Duel Masters is the same as in Magic as well, such as &quot;tapped&quot;, &quot;summoning sickness&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>Re-released as: Kaijudo<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to manipulate the deck, so the princess ultimately eats the desired dish &ndash; but before you discard too many or too important cards.<br/><br/>Aside from the initial setup, there are no random or hidden elements to the game. Each turn, you play one of your &quot;equipped cards&quot;. The played card's number says which card from the deck you &quot;equip&quot; next; you then perform the played card's action and recycle the card back into the deck. When the cards are played, they progress from the passive state to ignited state and are ultimately discarded, so the whole deck is constantly on the brink of exploding.<br/><br/>You win by fulfilling 3 win conditions: you must play Prophet cards to find out what is the &quot;desired dish&quot; - you must prepare this dish by igniting it - and ultimately, you must play the Princess to &quot;equip&quot; the &quot;desired dish&quot;!<br/><br/>The game also comes with 6 modular expansions, a variant and a campaign.&emsp;<br/><br/>",

The shapes that survive grow into different, larger shapes until one player runs out of space to grow (and thus wins).<br/><br/>The game is played with white and black stones on any hexagonal tiling. The author strongly recommends playing at first on a &quot;hexhex3&quot; board, and playing on larger boards only after accruing some skill.<br/><br/>The game originated in the author's thinking about a cognitive phenomenon called &quot;perceptual binding&quot;, and how it may be used to make combinatorial games more easily understandable to the human mind, given its peculiarities.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>A bug is an entire group of connected, same-color stones on the board. A single stone is also a bug.<br/><br/>The size of a bug is the number of stones it contains.<br/><br/>The board starts empty. Black begins the game by placing one black stone on any empty space. Then, starting with White, the players take turns. Each turn has 3 steps, taken in order: 1) Grow, 2) Eat, 3) Bonus Grow<br/><br/>1) Grow: Place a stone on an empty space to either start a new bug or grow one of your preexisting bugs by one stone. You may not merge bugs, and you may not grow a bug to be larger than the largest bug on the board (regardless of color) prior to placement.<br/><br/>2) Eat: All your bugs which are adjacent to one or more enemy bugs of the same shape (possibly rotated and reflected) must eat (capture) those enemy bugs.<br/><br/>3) Bonus Grow: Increase the size of each of your bugs that ate, by exactly 1, by placing a stone of your color on any empty space adjacent to each such bug.<br/><br/>If eating would unavoidably force a bug to grow by more than 1 through a merger with another bug of the same color, no eating occurs.<br/><br/>If, after growing, a bug is adjacent to an identically-shaped enemy bug, it must eat the enemy bug (and grow again) if possible, and so on.<br/><br/>The first player who CANNOT place a stone in the placement step WINS.<br/><br/>",

Your objective is to guide your flock from North to South, along a series of randomly constructed journeys. At each location, you will need to make the best use of your limited actions to keep your flock healthy, well-fed, and always on the move. Success depends on balancing the resources available against the risks of the journey.<br/><br/>Action cards may be played for one of several purposes, but as single-use resources, must be balanced against competing needs. Will you forage for food, or fly on an empty belly? Each flight brings a roll of the dice, and a risk of exhaustion, which you can offset by sacrificing future flights. Exhaustion and hunger always loom. Your goal is to reach the South before running out of actions, before your flock is too worn out to continue.<br/><br/>Can you fly them all home?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War has ensued following an attack on the Mothership, and problems have escalated for the occupation of space elements among several alien races of nearby constellations. You are the leader of one of the six great races fighting for the central sector of the Cosmos.<br/><br/>You need to transfer all your interstellar fleet to this disputed area before the rest &mdash; but you need to be careful as even a single unsuccessful placement on the subspace can break the entire fragile gravitational balance and lead to a devastating anomaly! The tumbling of ships from subspace happens in a random way, so one must be very dexterous and attentive. Enemies are also playing a role and are capable of twisting time and space to ruin your plans, strategically placing their interstellar fleet in key locations.<br/><br/>In Gravity Warfare, you play one of six commanders of alien races, each with a special ability, and your goal is to either run out of pieces (troops) to play or make other players lose on their turn. To do this, you must strategically choose your challenge cards and use your ability against other players on their turn, while having the dexterity to make it through yours.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt one guardian card to protect themselves and five cards from the deck. The cards contain challenges or events such as &quot;Spin it!&quot; or &quot;Stack it!&quot; which you may issue to other players, one per turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls the dice to determine which piece of their army to play, and where to place it. Other players now have the opportunity to force that player to play their turn in a certain way by playing their challenge cards. For example, if I have the &quot;Spin it!&quot; challenge, I may use it on your turn if I want you to spin the board and play your turn while the board is moving.<br/><br/>Are you ready to master gravity?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Compass Games website)<br/><br/>Nations in Arms brings one of the most famous periods in history to your gaming table: the French Revolution and the legend of Napoleon in Europe, from 1792 to 1815. This epic treatment of the Napoleonic period covers 24 years of warfare at the strategic level.<br/><br/>Nations in Arms uses a extensively updated, modified and streamlined version of the Le Grand Empire game system from Pratzen Editions (that game covered the 1800-1815 time period). The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer François-Stanislas Thomas.<br/><br/>Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.<br/><br/>The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.<br/><br/>Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the &lsquo;chaos of war&rsquo;, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios. Nations in Arms features a one-turn tutorial scenario , four epic campaign scenarios, and five smaller scenarios.<br/><br/>Now it&rsquo;s your turn to either fan the flames of The French Revolution throughout Europe, or to preserve the Old Order&hellip;<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    2 map sections making a 56&rdquo; wide by 39&rdquo; high playing area<br/>    4 countersheets<br/>    6 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various tables, charts  and player aids<br/>    1 card deck (110 cards) of historical and tactical events<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    1 scenario booklet<br/>    2 dice<br/>    1 box and lid set - the big 3&rdquo; deep box<br/><br/><br/>",

Your score is based on the number of cards in all players' hands, with 0 being the best score possible. If you find the game difficult, you can include the tavern card that a few times each game allows a player to give limited information about their hand; if the game is too easy, you can remove some or all of the shrines to eliminate those &quot;extra&quot; bonuses.<br/><br/>",

Every day, friends come to visit them; there are always many visitors and a lot going on and the castle is running out of space. Using many clouds and a little bit of magic, the unicorns gradually add more turrets to their castle.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect the 10 pink crystals, stack the clouds and the unicorns on the castle in order to house all the unicorns in their new home!<br/><br/>Players roll the die and move Rosalie forward the corresponding number of tiles, or if they land on a star - they fly to any tile of their choice. The tile on which you land determines your move. Land on a cloud, stack the corresponding white or blue cloud on the castle. Land on a unicorn, stack any of Rosalie's unicorn friends on the castle. Land on a gem, place a crystal in the recessed board. What happens when the the parts fall down? Not to worry, the parts go back in the stock pile, the crystals stay put and the player must turn over a cloud card....what will it reveal? Sun = that&rsquo;s lucky, thunderstorm = look out!<br/><br/>Players work as a team and win together when all unicorns &amp; Rosalie are stacked and all 10 crystals have been collected. They lose together if 3 thunderstorms are turned over before they reach their goal.<br/><br/>Contents: 4 unicorns: Glitterluck (hot pink), Stardust (yellow), Marvel Flower (purple), and Magic Swirl (turquoise), 1 baby unicorn Rosalie (pink), 1 cloud castle, 5 large white clouds and 5 smaller blue clouds, 1 die, 1 cloud game board, 16 double sided cloud tiles, 10 cloud crystals and instructions booklet<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During the course of the game, players assume the roles of mob bosses vying for control of a small city. Moving the members of their families between various locations on the game board, players attempt to collect cash and intimidate or work with other players&rsquo; family members to gain respect and protect their assets.<br/><br/>Players are dealt favor cards at the beginning of the game that include attack cards, defense cards, weapon cards and specialty cards. Each turn during the action round, players may play any or all of the cards in their hand, attacking other players&rsquo; family members in locations where they also have family members, or defending their own game pieces from attacks.<br/><br/>Each round, cards are drawn from the Fed Deck which determine how many and on what location Feds will be placed. If a location is surrounded by four or more Feds, the players must either defend themselves using weapons to remove one or more Feds, or vote for one among them to be pinched. If a player&rsquo;s game piece is pinched by the Feds, the game piece is placed in the Prison location on the game board.<br/><br/>To win the game, players must successfully avoid the growing threat of the Feds and defend themselves from the encroachments of other mob families on their territories. As more family members are killed or pinched, the Heat Meter rises, eventually reaching its highest level and signaling the end of the game. Players then count their remaining game pieces and the cash they have accumulated during the course of the game and the player with the most money and respect wins.<br/><br/>from the back of the box<br/><br/>The pigs sound hungry.

The sudden gunshot, a solitary flash under the door, startles you.  They drag your Associate's body off towards the expectant herd of swine at the end of the hall.  Steady footsteps approach the room where you sit tied to a chair.  The Don's men have some questions for you, too.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The spiritual successor to tennis game Sweet Spot, Volleyball High is the second entry in a trilogy of sports titles by Medieval Lords. The mechanisms and gameplay are completely different though. Heavily inspired by the Japanese anime Haikyu, one can expect unique school teams known for various specialties and powerful individuals with their own signature moves. The package is completed with each school having their own coach as well, who can execute abilities to assist their teams.<br/><br/>Players choose to play as one of several school teams. Volleyball High is a game of spatial control and hand management. There are 5 types of cards - Set, Bump, Dig, Serve and Spike. Each type has a distance range as well as Hit value. Players will play these cards to pass the ball between their own members as well as smash it over the net to the opponent. When the ball crosses the net, a player must always first defend by discarding cards showing DEF value equal to or greater than the Hit value of the attack. Then he chooses which member to receive the ball, again discarding cards for every extra space that member has to move in order to reach the ball. If the chosen member is already at the spot the ball is going, there is no need to discard any cards for movement. Finally, he plays a card to hit the ball and flip that member over (this member is now exhausted and cannot hit the ball again) There is a benefit in passing the ball around before sending it back to the opponent though - each time a member of the team touches the ball, the team synergy meter goes up by one. It is this value that determines how much Energy the team gains, as well as how many cards to replenish from the deck when the ball is sent over. Players can discard 2 cards to flip back an exhausted member. Here is the interesting part - if all 6 of your members are exhausted at the same time, they automatically refresh together and flip back as a team for free! Also when you set up the ball by passing it from a front member to another front member, when that member hits it over the net it is considered a Heavy attack. Unlike the typical defense where the opponent simply chooses which cards to discard to match the Hit value, in a Heavy attack it is a blind defense. He decides how many cards to discard, after which you can then randomly draw from his hand without looking. In this manner it is a press-your-luck style where your opponent must decide how much to commit to defend this Heavy attack. Too many and he will waste cards unnecessarily, too little and he risks not having enough DEF to overcome the attack.<br/><br/>The first team to score 2 points wins the game.<br/><br/>In the 2v2 mode, it gets more intensive as each player controls 3 specific members of the same team and must coordinate between each other to take down their opponent. Even the slightest crack in teamwork will spell defeat!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

All the Royalist infantry, except the Swiss, was put in disorder. The attacks and counter-attacks would continue until Guise and Saint-Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s troops, passive until that point, overwhelmed the Huguenots. At the end of the day, almost all the commanders of the two camps were killed or taken prisoner. Despite the Protestant rout, the war would continue for a long time !<br/><br/>- La Roche l&rsquo;Abeille 1569<br/>After the assassination of the Prince of Cond&eacute; at Jarnac during the third French War of Religion, Coligny regrouped the Protestant forces near the Vienne. He managed to surprise the Duke of Anjou, who had set off in pursuit of him, despite his strong defensive position. At dawn, Coligny&rsquo;s avant-garde progressed through hedges and thickets. The Royalist infantry, knocked about by the Protestant cavaliers, was beaten and their commander, Filippo Strozzi, taken prisoner. This victory would be a limited and fleeting one.<br/><br/>- Coutras 1587<br/>The eighth and final French War of Religion began with Henri of Navarre's first battle as commander in chief. Faced with the Royalist troops commanded by the Duke of Joyeuse, &ldquo;Premier mignon du Roy&rdquo;, Navarre took advantage of the night to position his troops near Coutras. At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully. But the counter-charge of Navarre, Cond&eacute; and Soissons shifted the course of the battle and destroyed the morale of Joyeuse&rsquo;s troops. The ensuing massacre caused the deaths of Joyeuse, his brother, and numerous other noblemen.<br/><br/>See Avec Infini Regret wiki<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.<br/><br/>Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.<br/><br/>That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.<br/><br/>Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).<br/><br/>The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.

To set up a round of Duffers, players choose up to nine holes from the 18 included with the game. Gameplay is all about building the perfect &quot;bag&quot; or deck. Each player opens with the same starter deck. Every turn is a new hand and a chance to purchase clubs, crew, and equipment from the Pro Shop or attempt to complete a hole. Fun fact: You can finish the holes in any order, which is important because any holes not completed by the end of the game are marked as triple par on your score card.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player finishes the course or the Pro Shop runs out of cards. The only thing left to do is add up the scores, crown the Duffers Master for this round, and plan your next tee time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Rock of the Marne: The Second Battle of the Marne, 15 July to 25 July, 1918 covers both the final attack of the German army in July 1918, and the Allied counteroffensive that produced the battle known to Americans as the Second Battle of the Marne. The Germans believed they could launch an offensive on both sides of Reims, which would pinch out an Allied salient and draw in Allied reserves, and thus possibly produce a breakout across the Marne leading to the final drive to Paris. Despite gaining their bridgehead across the Marne, the Germans did not expect the fierce resistance offered by the Allies including the American 3rd infantry division-which earned its honorific name &ldquo;Rock of the Marne&rdquo; for its steadfast defense.<br/><br/>An even bigger surprise awaited the Germans, however, when the Allies attacked them with crushing power from a wholly unforeseen direction three days later. Refusing at first to relinquish the initiative, the Germans showed why they were masters of defensive warfare in World War 1 as they exacted a fearsome toll in casualties from the attackers including the American 1st and 2nd infantry divisions.<br/><br/>Rock of the Marne shares many of its design features with MMP&rsquo;s earlier game on the 1918 battles - Operation Michael. The Germans&rsquo; striking power consists of the battle-depleted, but still dangerous, stosstruppen. Trained specifically in infiltration tactics, these hard-core infantry units can find a way to pick apart the toughest Allied defensive position. The Germans also have mobile, and deadly, machine-gun units that will wreak havoc on unwary attacking Allied units. The Allies used tanks in record numbers in their initial assault, and these are shown in the game, as well as the six big American divisions that participated including the famous 1st Infantry Div, The Big Red One, the 42nd Infantry Div, the Rainbow Division, as well at the 3rd.<br/><br/>The air game has been significantly expanded in Rock of Marne as both sides deploy their air assets to bomb bridges, and strafe infantry. Finally, both the Allied and the German player must learn to operate within their constraints and opportunities of the WWI command and control environment, which means you may not automatically get to attack with all the units you had planned!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    One 22&quot;x34&quot; map<br/>    280 counters (1 countersheet)<br/>    Series Rules<br/>    Rock of the Marne Specific Rules<br/>    Two Dice<br/><br/><br/><br/>Part of the Standard Combat Series.<br/><br/>",

It is a two-player (or multi-player) strategic / operational wargame of low-to-medium complexity.<br/><br/>Units in Proud Monster Deluxe are typically divisions with some corps, brigades and regiments also included. Hexes are 20 miles (about 33 kilometers) across, and each turn represents about a 2 week period.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame systemIn addition to updated graphics, the major changes are Reserves and Reserve Movement phases to simulate the potential for encirclement or defensive reaction. Soviet first winter offensive rules allow the Soviets to retake parts of Russia in early 1942 as happened in history. Both sides now have offensive supply markers to show historical offensive potential and limitations. Innovative weather chits allow for weather variation without extreme weather swings biasing the game. AFV units become even more important due to AFV combat shift. Close Combat option allows for use of an alternate loss procedure and attacker advance to form a jointly-occupied hex, for example, to simulate Stalingrad's gradual fall to the Axis. The ability to fully exploit holes created by mobile assaults is limited to reserves.<br/><br/>The Axis forces degrade in capability over time while the Soviet forces upgrade in capability. The Axis super heavy artillery Thor and Odin, Heavy Gustav and Dora can fire before combat resolution. Besides the 1941 Free setups, 1941 historical setups are provided for both sides as well as a 1942 scenario. Seasonal offensive rules allow for special turns when special things can happen. The 2 sides show a greater disparity in capability, the Axis can do things the Soviets cannot do and vice versa. Things that work when playing the Axis may not work when playing the Soviets and vice versa.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame componentsGame components have all been improved over the originals. All graphics have been completely updated and upgraded. Counters are 9/16&quot; and map hexes have ample space to avoid players from knocking over those stacks of counters when the fighting starts to tighten up. The four (4) maps impress upon the players the enormous expanse of the Soviet Union and the challenge for both sides to defend and overcome it. Rules are consolidated from the two original sources into one comprehensive set, with all known errata folded in, and a number of important rule changes to improve game balance and playability. In addition, the development of a definitive set of player aids will keep players playing the game instead of hunting down items in the rules.<br/><br/>4 maps - each map is 22&quot;x34&quot; with overlap<br/>    10 full sheets of 9/16&quot; counters (2052 counters), printed both sides<br/>    1 rules book<br/>    Full color player aid charts and tables cards printed both sides on cardstock<br/>    2 6 sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>",

To do this, they have at their disposal only a few military biplanes from the First World War, such as the Breguet XIV, recycled into dusty transport planes. These machines were often outdated and underpowered, forcing pilots to fly only on the shortest routes.  Then, thanks to the technological and commercial development, they will have at their disposal more and more efficient aircrafts, and will be able to venture on more and more important distances. Then will come the time to try to accomplish great firsts, such as crossing the Atlantic or crossing the Andes, with the ultimate goal of an aerial tour of the globe!<br/><br/>The Air Postal game is built around a solid historical context highlighting the pilots of the time, men and women with incredible destinies, as well as the most famous civilian airplanes of the 20s and 30s... some of which are still flying today, nearly a century after having written the most beautiful pages of aviation history in the sky! Finally a game that deals with the peaceful, technological and heroic aspects of the world of aeronautics, and allows you to relive an epic that has become mythical: the fabulous flight of air transport.<br/><br/>Goal of the game:<br/>To become a legendary pilot by accumulating the most GLORY POINTS. GLORY POINTS are earned during the game by flying to a STAGE CITY, completing an OBJECTIVE and achieving a world-first flight. In addition, at the end of the game players also earn GLORY POINTS based on the TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL of their aircraft and the amount of money they have.<br/>On his turn a player must perform one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>     take an OBJECTIVE card and collect your INCOME.<br/>     improve its aircraft or change it.<br/>     Load your aircraft, refuel, fly and deliver passengers or goods.<br/><br/><br/>During a flight you roll the dice corresponding to the colors of the course. The length of the route, the fuel used, the endurance of the pilot and the reliability of the engine will allow you to cover the distances or not.<br/><br/>",

Players hold a hand of ingredients of different types and colors and attempt to match all ingredient types or colors in the cauldron.<br/><br/>Each turn, players ask a question about other players&rsquo; hands, referring to the ingredient type or color (but not both). (For example, &ldquo;Who has blue ingredients?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who has newt saliva?&rdquo;) They then play a card from their hand into the cauldron and draw back up to three cards, ending their turn.<br/><br/>Some ingredient cards have Binx the cat or a spell book on them. When an ingredient with Binx is played into the cauldron, the active player puts the Binx mover in front of any player. That player then lays their cards down so everyone can see them and keeps them there until Binx is moved. If a spell book is played, the active player draws a card from the Spell deck and resolves the card. Spells generally do something to ruin players&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>If you have cards showing all of one color or all of one object in the cauldron, then you've stunned one of the witches &mdash; and you need to stun the witches three times before time runs out! When stunned, a witch cannot cast spells from the deck.<br/><br/>Players also have four &ldquo;Tricks&rdquo; to use based on scenes from the movie; each Trick can be used once per game. For example, &quot;Burning Rain of Death&quot; allows you to discard three potion ingredients and draw three new potion ingredients.<br/><br/>",

But will you be able to help him carry his ever-growing pile of honey jars without knocking them over?<br/><br/>Strong Stuff! &ndash; previously published by Goldsieber with slightly different rules as B&auml;renstark &ndash; is a dexterity game in which players move Bruno, represented by a wooden bear, across a series of meadow tokens. Each turn, the active player rolls the die then either moves Bruno a number of spaces equal to the number of dots on the die or leaves him in place; when moving Bruno, a player cannot touch the tray he holds or any honey jars already balanced on his head. In either case, the player ends his turn by stacking a new honey jar on the highest jar on Bruno's tray.<br/><br/>The honey jars come in six sizes, making stacking tricky; should any jar fall while a player moves Bruno, that player loses one of two honey drops he was given at the start of the game. Once a player loses both honey drops, the game ends and whoever has the most honey drops in hand wins.<br/><br/>The HABA edition of Strong Stuff! includes a special die for experienced players in which you're challenged to spin Bruno in place or move him only with your right or left hand. (Note: The HABA edition is for 2-6 players, while Goldsieber's B&auml;renstark was labeled for 2-4 players.)<br/><br/>",

In that design, players would create crazy inventions from the adjective and noun cards in their hands, simultaneously choose one invention (other than their own) to invest in, pay to invest in other inventions (whether newly created that round or an earlier creation), then roll a die for each investment to see whether it pays off and if so by how much. The player who collected the most money won.<br/><br/>For the 2011 edition of The Big Idea from French publisher Funforge, Ernest and Funforge's Philippe Nouhra have transformed the design into a true party game by stripping out the elements related to earning money. Players still have a hand of adjective and noun cards, and combine any number of them to create a fancy invention. They then take turns pitching their ideas to everyone in the game, lobbying players as if they were in front of a crowd of venture capitalists. Players then secretly vote on which idea they feel should be rewarded, placing a reward card face down in front of the chosen invention and blank cards in front of all other inventions. The player who collects the most rewards wins the round.<br/><br/>Unlike the Cheapass titles of yore, Funforge's The Big Idea will include high-quality, full-color illustrated cards packaged in a nice box.<br/><br/>",

Outshine and outpace other Allied generals &ndash; and change history by winning the war in 1944, before Christmas!<br/><br/>Keep&rsquo;em Rolling: Race to the Rhine features Race to the Rhine, a unique, logistics-focused euro-style wargame for 1-4 players (including a solitaire mode as well as optional cards and rules), and a standalone solitaire game &ndash; These Are My Credentials &ndash; covering the Allied liberation of Brittany.<br/><br/>As one of the historic Allied Commanders, you control several Corps that you must move along predefined, point-to-point routes, liberating cities from Axis control as you do.<br/><br/>Unlike many other wargames covering the liberation of Western Europe, in Race to the Rhine the focus is on planning and logistics. Moving your Corps requires fuel. Defeating Axis units and garrisons en route requires ammo. Feeding your armies as they move forward requires food.<br/><br/>The slower you are in moving to the Rhine, the longer you give the Axis to form a strong defense. But move too quickly and you risk overwhelming your logistical capacity to supply your advance. Whichever Commander can best manage these dual challenges will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

ACME is not a sequel nor an expansion but a stand alone game using the same multiplayer and solitaire systems as its predecessor with many new and exciting features to intrigue its players.<br/><br/>ACME is a game of the chaos-inducing wrath of gods &amp; men&mdash;a chaos each player does their utmost to manage, survive, and guide their civilization through to triumphant victory. Spanning the ancient world from the Hellespont to the Indus, from the Caspian to the Red Sea, and from the early Bronze Age to the Hellenic Age, Ancient Civilizations of the Middle East allows you to command not just 10 but 17, SEVENTEEN CIVILIZATIONS!<br/><br/>If you want a War Game, you got it. If you want a friendly game, this is it too! As in Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea, Ancient Civilizations of the Middle East can be all about war, but it doesn't have to be. It can be a friendly game of exploration, city building, trade, and faith. Players (solitaire, a group of up to six, or even a mix of live players with a system-driven civilization of two or more) can make of ACME what they wish or imagine. Competition can be martial or cultural, warlike or friendly, or a combination of both&mdash;how the game unfolds depends entirely on how the players want it to play. The duration of the game is also up to the players: from a multi-hour odyssey of all four Epochs to a pre-arranged shorter contest of an hour or two or to an agreed Sudden Death Victory Point threshold.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Connecting these castles combines their powers resulting in that Family claiming the throne. Who will sit on the throne of the Cloudy Kingdom?<br/><br/>In this game Players play one Route (or Magic) card per turn until the game finishes due to two Castles of one Family being connected. These Castles must be on opposing sides (north-south or east-west). On your turn, you play the Route card from your hand, or you discard it and play a Magic card instead. At the end of your turn, you draw a new Route card and play continues clockwise to the next player.<br/><br/>Sounds easy enough. But. Route card can be placed perpendicular on top of each other (so at a 90-degree angle). Meaning that when you want to play a Route card, you can either use an empty space or play your card on top of an existing card. Add to that a dash of magic with the Magic cards, and you have got yourself a challenging game with lots of options and strategies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card game that forces a Hex token around the table between players. In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.<br/><br/>There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.<br/><br/>Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.<br/><br/>One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air. The slowpoke loses points. Not exactly strategy, but still entertaining.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Hex Hex Next<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    Hex Hex XL<br/><br/><br/>",

Achieving an ambition allows the player to convert that adventurer's &quot;will&quot; into points and to possibly level him up. All ambitions require the player to venture forth, which means moving his party from one site to another along a path. One of the main actions in the game is playing an enemy or adventurer card to these path spaces. Once a path is completely filled in, any player can choose to venture forth down it and encounter each card one by one, recruiting adventurers, defeating enemies, and possibly gaining treasure along the way.

He left his brother, Joseph, in nominal command of his armies in Spain, as puppet king in Madrid. Fighting flared on several fronts simultaneously, and the French occupation had some successes, notably at the siege of Saragossa, concluded by Marshal Lannes just before his departure to join the Emperor.<br/><br/>In 1809 the French under Joseph nearly mastered the plains of Old and New Castile. However, the Napoleonic magic could not work at such distances (a dispatch sent from Vienna to Madrid, would travel 2,400 km in 12 to 14 days); when dispatches arrived they were often days or weeks out of date. A series of battles were fought during the course of the year along the approaches to Madrid from Portugal, where the future Duke of Wellington had just arrived with a small British Army to second the Spanish Army of Extremadura.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>     Two full-size color maps (22&quot;x34&quot; each)and two half-size maps (17&quot;x22&quot;)<br/>     Rulebook (28 pages)<br/>     Scenario Folder (24 pages)<br/>     Two counter sheets (560 units)<br/>     Two decks of cards (50 cards each, 100 total)<br/>     15 player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Series scale<br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: <br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series hits harsh and unforgiving desert terrain in Heroes of North Africa. As World War II unfolded, Mussolini and Italy&rsquo;s colonial expansion in Libya and East Africa were at stake, as well as the Axis&rsquo;s desire to control the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal. In the beginning, only Britain and her Commonwealth Allies could stop them. From 1940 to 1943 a relentless, bloody push and pull of forces across the desert, from Egypt to Morocco, ensued.<br/><br/>We have had a few name changes along the way, Mare Nostrum and then Heroes of the Mediterranean. God willing we hope to be sticking with Heroes of North Africa. We have done away with all the overlays so we have expanded the game to 14 Maps. all pre-orders will include 14 X-Maps as well.<br/><br/>Play 18 dynamic scenarios that feature everything that makes the award-winning Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series stand out&mdash;fluid, impulse-based turns; squad-level and individual heroics&mdash;plus lots of armor and unique rules to bring desert combat to life. Italians, including paratroopers from the rugged Folgore Division, and Rommel&rsquo;s vaunted Afrika Korps take on the resolute British Eighth Army. The Free French and Americans also get into the action. The battles start in 1940, with a few in East Africa, and Sidi Barrani, Egypt, and continue up to El Alamein and the Americans&rsquo; first taste of combat during Operation Torch, in November of 1942. Heroes of North Africa has the most components of any game in the series to date, so find a pair of goggles; the dust and sand of the desert is going to fly!<br/><br/>- - - - - -<br/><br/>Previously and variously advertised as Mare Nostrum and later Heroes of the Mediterranean on its way from concept to to publication.<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.  We add some every few weeks.

You wish to return to your earthly existence, but Lord Maldorf, ruler of Norkobia, will not let you go unless you meet his demands and build him an enormous empire.<br/><br/>In Warlock, you must use the skills and powers of mythical creatures such as giants, wizards and gnomes to build your empire and thwart your opponents. Each card offers four possibilities, and by using your cards strategically, you can build the biggest empire, be released to return home, and win the game.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to build an empire next to your castle, with cards that are laid out in a 4x4 grid. Every turn, players will receive 5 cards. One will be placed in their dungeon (where a card will receive a special ability), another one in Hubba's bar, where all the local creatures gather to be hired by the players. The other three cards are kept in the players' hands. The round continues with an auction where players can use their cards to purchase others. Once the auction is done, players can use their cards' special abilities to expand their empire and thus score points. Beware however of other players, as they can steal some of your cards, or destroy parts of your empire. The game calls for cunning placement of your cards in your empire and shrewd bidding in the auction phase. The game ands after three full rounds, or after a player manages to build his/her 16th city (card) in his/her empire. Points are awarded based on the value of your cities, majority bonuses and the variation of the cities built in your empire.<br/><br/>",

The guides know the card that the explorers must guess, and to help the explorers, they give clues in the form of adjective cards that best define the platypus for them. Each guide has a hand of four clue cards, and after each new clue, the explorers must eliminate one or two cards that they think don't match what's being defined by the clues.

With a unique deck of captain cards, individual strengths, and special abilities, each captain offers players a very different game experience.<br/><br/>Players seek to explore and control locations in the galaxy to gain the resources, artifacts, and technology to help them face more difficult encounters later in the game. As players explore the galaxy, and time passes, encounters become more rewarding, but the penalty for failure rises. Players determine the length of the game by how quickly they move through the galaxy, and how well they manage the damage inflicted on them by their travels, or by their fellow captains.<br/><br/>The galaxy offers a variety of encounters where players can control individual locations through the use of six different skills, such as science, diplomacy, or tactics, depending on an individual&rsquo;s play style and captain&rsquo;s strengths. Players can also brave open space, random encounters which increase in difficulty as the game progresses, or explore discoveries and uncover many different stories in the game. How well a player does at exploring and controlling the galaxy is reflected in their victory points.<br/><br/>Made up of modular tiles, the galaxy itself, and many of the elements within, is very different each and every time you play Emergence Event, allowing for great replayability and unique challenges with every game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Kinoko, each player secretly draws a color card corresponding to a family of mushrooms &mdash; musicians, scientists, etc. &mdash; and gets a hand of three mushroom cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll the three dice, then choose one of them. The result of that die, whether a number or an icon, determines your action: exchange two cards, swap two sets of cards, pick at any card secretly, etc. To win the round, you must gather the three members of your family in one location during your turn. This reunion can happen in any player's hand or on the table.<br/><br/>Seems easy? The trick is you can see only the cards in other players' hands, and your decisions are limited to what you roll on the dice. What's more, each round one family of mushrooms turns poisonous, and having a card of that color in your hand when the round stops earns you a negative point...<br/><br/>The round's winner scores positive points, and the first player to 4 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The inhabitants of the Pacific island are represented by giant birds, such as the moa and kakapo, while the settlers from the west are played by dogs, rats, possums and weasels.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of the defenders of the land, competing with their fellow players for control of the regions while staving off the advances of the mammals. However, the cunning bird may consider selling their land to the mammals rather than fighting to defend it.<br/><br/>Moa is an original design inspired by Martin Wallace's stay in the Land of the Long White Cloud.<br/><br/>A 2-player variant is included in the rule book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Sunday, 7 December 1941, the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was attacked by Japanese aircraft. For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war with the US, from the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts.<br/><br/>The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;<br/><br/>The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.<br/><br/>The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.<br/><br/>The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.<br/><br/>Booklets:<br/><br/>    Rulebook I (rule 1.0 to 25.0)<br/>    Rulebook II (rule 26.0 to 62.0)<br/>    Scenarios &amp; Campaign reinforcements<br/>    Examples of Play, Optional Rules &amp; Designer's Notes<br/>    Chartbook I<br/>    Chartbook II<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The June 6, 1944 Allied landings in France were an overwhelming success. With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.<br/><br/>British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.<br/><br/>Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.<br/><br/>Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.<br/><br/>Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.<br/><br/>The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.<br/><br/>The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

One person plays the side of the Romans, while the other plays the side of the Gauls, with both players vying for control of the various Gallic tribes.<br/><br/>The game uses blocks and area movement. Players use cards to collect allies, move units and attack or play events. Certain leaders are represented in the game, including Julius Caesar, Vercingetorix and Ariovistus.<br/><br/>As the Gauls you will start with fewer and weaker units, but you you'll have an easier time recruiting other tribes to your side. Eventually Vercingetorix will appear to help you. Will you confront the Romans directly? Or will you play defensively, and rely on raiding tactics and political maneuvering?<br/><br/>As the Romans you start with six legions, with four more on the way. Your units are stronger and faster. But you'll have a more difficult time recruiting tribes onto your side, and you'll not only have to worry about rebellions, but watch your supplies as well.<br/><br/>",

During each turn, both players choose a &quot;move&quot; card from their hands. Moves might attack, block or evade at a particular location (high or low) and speed. The chosen moves are then simultaneously revealed and compared, usually dealing damage or shifting the initiative.<br/><br/>The guessing game is never exactly the same; chosen cards may not be used again for a time, taking damage gives players the opportunity to secretly upgrade their moves, and each player also has a unique character card with special moves.<br/><br/>Dragon Punch was designed to be very portable: It consists of only a few cards, and it also doesn't require a table or other surface to play. This means you can have a quick brawl against a friend almost anywhere!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Corinth simulates the battle that occurred on 3-4 October 1862 near Corinth, a Mississippi town just south of the Tennessee border. The town was a vital cross-link for the two main Southern railroads: the Mobile and Ohio (the north-south line) and the Memphis and Charleston (the east-west line) railroads. The Union had captured Corinth shortly after the Battle of Shiloh, and Confederate General Earl Van Dorn was ordered to keep the Union troops tied down while General Braxton Bragg struck into Kentucky.<br/><br/>Van Dorn, his reputation damaged at Pea Ridge the previous spring, planned to hurl his 20,000 man army at an equal number of Federals who who held Corinth. Using a circuitous route to successfully confuse Union General William S. Rosecrans, Van Dorn marched on the town under the blazing hot sun of an Indian Summer. After two days of vicious fighting, in which they managed to take part of the town, the Confederate forces were forced to withdraw under the onslaught of the emplaced Union guns and Rosecrans&rsquo; fresh troops. Corinth marked the effective end of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi and brought about the unsuccessful court-martial of Van Dorn.<br/><br/>Each Game-Turn represents 30 minutes of real time, and each hex covers about 135 yards from hexside to hexside. Each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun.<br/><br/>The Battle of Corinth is Volume 6 from the Great Battles of the American Civil War series. Each game in the series uses a set of standard rules, which cover melee attack, small-arms and artillery fire, cavalry charges, and the effects of leadership.  Each game has a 16-page booklet of exclusive rules to cover the unique features of each battle and an historical article about each event. The game includes 400 counters and one 22&quot; x 34&quot; map.<br/><br/>Published with Jackson at the Crossroads: Cross Keys & Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862.<br/><br/>",

You've lived here your whole life, but it was only a little while ago that you started to notice the strange sounds at night, and now the new kid at school has vanished. You're sure that a hideous creature has been unleashed on your town &mdash; and it's up to you to defeat it!<br/><br/>In the co-operative game The Snallygaster Situation, which is based on the Kids on Bikes RPG, you and your best friends must face off against one of four diabolical monsters set on destroying Lakeview &mdash; and possibly the entire world! Get on your bikes to search for clues about the monster's weakness, find the missing kid it has abducted, and end the threat to your hometown. Oh, and watch out for the Federal agents because they can put a real damper on your epic adventure.<br/><br/>In more detail, one player takes the role of the Lost Kid, selecting a card to play each turn that provides clues about their location such as street names, buildings, or landmarks &mdash; but the card also dictates how the monsters and the Feds move and attack on the board. You might have the perfect clue to give, but then the monster will attack one of your friends, sending them back to the treehouse and advancing the &quot;doom marker&quot;, i.e., the game's timer.<br/><br/>The other players are trying to defeat the monster and save their friend. On their turns, they use their rides &mdash; skateboard, dirt bike, inline skates, etc. &mdash; to search the town, look for clues, use special item cards, and avoid the monster, which might be the Jersey Devil, a Dover Demon, Bloody Mary, or (of course) the Snallygaster. Each monster has a different level of difficulty with unique gameplay elements.<br/><br/>Once the Lost Kid is found, they join their friends to try to defeat the monster.<br/><br/>",

Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.<br/><br/>It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published in The Wargamer Magazine Vol.I, #23, this game covers the German operations called Fruelingswind &amp; Morgenluft which led to the famous battle at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia in 1943. This game feature a rich variety of nationalities (US, British, French, German, and Italian) as well as unit types (motorcyle troops even!) played on a single map. Units are generally companies and battalions, with individual batteries of artillery. Game turns are half a day each and each hex = 2 miles. The game stresses the importance of headquarters units for coordination (particularly of air support) and has some of the best artillery rules ever. The game has since been updated by GMT's Kasserine in 2001. This game would become part of what would be known as the &quot;Battles for North Africa&quot; Series.<br/><br/>It was also released in a boxed format by 3W. A very thin box containing exact reprints of the rules, maps and counters.<br/><br/>The other games in the &quot;Battles for North Africa&quot; Series are: Rommel at Bay,   O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass,  Patton Goes to War,  Objective: Tunis, and Race For Tunis.<br/><br/>",

He was determined to make one last stand on the road to Paris. Facing a coalition between Prussia under Blucher and Russia under Sacken, Napoleon caught them and was about to crush them in decisive battles before Paris in 6 days of February, 1814.<br/><br/>Designed by Hall of Fame Napoleonic game designer Kevin Zucker, developed by Paul Dangel, the game comes with a standard 22&quot; x 34&quot; map by Rick Barber showing mud and snowy ground at 1,700 yards per hex, 280 counters, mostly division size units. One 24-pages rulebook with 6-pages of historical commentary by the designer and 1-page of Terrain Effects Chart included (hence the rules actually occupy only 17 pages).<br/><br/>The Six Days of Glory is an operational Napoleonic game. 3 short scenarios are included, covering the campaigns in three separate battles at three cities along the road to Paris: Champaubert (9~10 Feb); Montmirail (11~12 Feb) and Vauchamps (13~14 Feb), each playable in less than 1 &frac12; hours. A campaign scenario linking all three (9~14 Feb) battles from the beginning to the end can be completed in less than 3 hours.<br/><br/>The French moves first in all scenarios. The game has a standard command check &ndash; move &ndash; combat sequence with an additional night turn on each turn during which armies can force march to out maneuver the enemy. Features include Chain-of-Command and Leadership Initiative, Artillery Bombardment, Supply and demoralization, Repulse at odds greater than 5-to-1, Movement across Pontoon Trains and Bridges (Allied only), and an interesting weather effect of forced mud on wheeled unit during the afternoon (PM) turn. Team play is also possible where Allied command is divided between Prussian and Russian and thus communication between the two is not allowed unless written messages are exchanged.<br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System = 1,600m/hex, 800-1,000 men/SP, 6 hours/turn.<br/><br/>",

Live fast and die hard on Route 666. Can you survive the Devil's Run?<br/><br/>There are four types of vehicles: Bikes, Trikes, Buggies and Cars. Each of these vehicle types play differently due to how they drive, their weapons and their arcs of fire. The game has story driven missions which are a mix of full throttle racing and maximum carnage vehicular battle, with an immersive ruleset to make you feel like you're a part of the post-apoc action. We use six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game, from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to take control of the main legal and illegal sources of profit, meaning bars, game rooms, jazz clubs and revue theaters. To do this, each player sends his men to intimidate the owners of these businesses and gain them to their cause. Most of the businesses even change ownership at the game table! The winner is the first player who, by playing poker combinations with his cards, takes control over 3 businesses of the same kind, 4 different ones, or any 5.<br/><br/>",

(Humans use the softer term &quot;bluffing&quot;.) You can lie about which abilities you have access to, and you can lie about whether your cards are strong enough to win the pot! And if you win a pot by lying, you gain the favor of a Panda Lord. Be careful, though, because other players can call you out on your lies for fun and profit.<br/><br/>Each round (called a &quot;gambit&quot;), players try to build the best hand they can from their two private cards and five community cards, similar to gameplay in Texas Hold'em Poker. Over the course of a gambit, players bet several times while making claims about how good their hands are and using abilities to influence the game. Each suit gives access to a different ability and if you don't have the one you need, just lie about it and hope you get away with it.<br/><br/>You can play Pand&aacute;nte as a social game with a definite win condition and no player elimination, or you can play it as an ongoing gambling game in which players are eliminated when they lose their money, like in Poker. You could even play with real money if you're Panda enough.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Geometric Art is a party game which is a drawing game in which everyone take turns to drawing and guessing, The simple goal is to let the guesser understand the name of your artwork. Remember, you may only be able to finish your &quot;Art work&quot; with a few geometric symbols.<br/><br/>In Geometric Art , every round will exchange a guesser who guess questions. Each round there will be a theme. Within this theme, the artist can complete the artwork with the symbols specified above the dice. The guesser can guess the name of the artwork of every artist, If it's right, both get more rewards, but if guess wrong, both will be punished. Those who first get 10 points to win, but If you have too many penalty points, you will be eliminated.<br/><br/>Compared to traditional painting games, there is no need for painting talent, but need more wonderful inspiration.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The date: March 1938. The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?<br/><br/>Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.<br/><br/>A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.<br/><br/>Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.<br/><br/>Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.<br/><br/>",

The Captain allows the crew to search through the place and bring back to him what they have found, but by bluffing the Captain, they will try to keep the best part of the loot for themselves...<br/><br/>In Oh Captain!, an asymmetric game of changing roles, an adventurer must offer the loot cards they draw to the Captain, telling the Captain something about what the cards contain but not necessarily speaking truthfully. Indeed, some cursed objects can't be spoken of at all by the adventurers.<br/><br/>The Captain, who is safe from being attacked by objects, decides whether the crew member can keep the loot or not, and if the Captain turns down the offer, the crew member can decide to use an object against another adventurer. The latter player can overcome this by calling out a lie, winning or losing a coin based on who is right. The role of the Captain can be claimed by any adventurer who is richer than the Captain, and in the end the richest adventurer wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There is no 'Zombie Master' here: all the players are on the same side, all working together to survive, although the option to use other players as zombie bait while you grab all the guns and lock yourself in the cellar is there if you prefer.<br/>Either way, you will need to use strategy and your (fresh and spicy) brains as well as chainsaws and shotguns to make it through the night.<br/><br/>Each scenario has a location to be explored, and an objective to be fulfilled, but if things don't go well just survival may be enough. Cards drawn throughout the game may help or hinder your progress, but as the night draws on you can be sure things are going to get much worse before you see the sun again.<br/><br/>The game ends when somebody fulfils the main objective (eg, escaping in a fuelled up vehicle), or at daybreak, which brings respite in the form of an advancing army patrol. If you can survive until the end of the game, you are a winner. The survivor who best fulfils their objectives will come out on top.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Mall of the Dead<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kiitos is a fast-tempo, card-based word game with novel, simple rules and deep, emergent game play. Can you make a word with the letters in your hand, and what letters that may or may not be in your opponents&rsquo;?<br/><br/>Players start by playing one letter of a word and saying a target word. Then subsequent players build up the target word, either playing the next letter if they can, or by changing the target word dynamically if it can&rsquo;t be continued. Can your word be finished for positive points, or can you trap your opponent into not being able to play and force them to pick up the unfinished word for negative points? Can you outwit your player with cleverness? If your opponent finishes your word for you say &ldquo;Kiitos&rdquo;, the Finnish word for thank-you.<br/><br/>The rules change dynamically as the game is played and the game play switches between two modes: Kiitos which builds up words from left to right, and Super-Kiitos which builds up words at either end. Dubious words can be challenged. Fake words are OK if you can get them past your opponent unchallenged. Kiitos edge-case tests the dictionary like no other game.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a word game that feels somewhat like a trick-taking game, with a bit of deduction and bluffing. Lateral thinking and clever strategising are rewarded, sometimes. Luck can make or break your strategies. The target word can change 5 or more times just in the one hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Timeline: Qu&eacute;bec is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: Qu&eacute;bec can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>Card represent event related to the culture of the province of Qu&eacute;bec in Canada.<br/><br/>",

Even though the battle was insignificant in numbers of forces engaged compared to other battles fought during WW I, it represent a master- piece of exercising modern military strategy.

Two ill prepared, yet superior in numbers, Imperial Russian armies attack East Prussia in August 1914 in order to honor the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894.<br/>Even though the Russian attack turned out to a disaster, it played an important role on the Western Front. German reserves were pulled from the West to East Prussia, that otherwise would have been used in the crucial battle of the Marne north of Paris.<br/><br/>The Game Design<br/>The game mechanics includes a chit-pull procedure.

The boats are numbered 1 to 4, so the better your prediction, the more points you score. A very funny but simple dice roller, which works better with more players. The game is re-issued in 1998 by Simba as Tr&ouml;deln, where the children want to be last into class so they sit at the back.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>     Trödeln<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buy the Vote is a 15 minute blind bidding game where candidates win states by spending the most campaign dollars. Players are presidential candidates running for president with the goal of collecting as many electoral votes as possible. At the end of the game, the player with the most electoral votes becomes the presidential nominee and the player with the second most electoral votes become the running mate; together the presidential nominee and the running mate need 270 electoral votes to win the Presidency!<br/><br/>To campaign for states, players will select states to spend their campaign dollars on behind voting booths, and when ready, all bets are revealed. The player that spends the most campaign dollars on the state wins the state's electoral votes. Once that money is spent, win, tie, or lose; that money is gone. Big advertising networks thank you for your campaign dollars.<br/><br/>The game starts when the 15 minute timer begins, and with every new round, time pressure escalates as more states will be up for grabs. Ties on state cards leaves the state card and creates stacks of state cards for rebid in the next round. Swing states let you steal the last won state from other candidates. And every player gets more money as rounds pass plus bonus money as you win more states.<br/>Think you have what it takes to win the presidency in 15 minutes?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from Coozies Games<br/><br/>",

The race takes place on a circular track, with the start/end space being chosen by a player for the first round.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player selects one Power card in secret, then lays it down with the value being played pointing toward the game board. Players reveal their cards one at a time, moving forward on the track; if a player would finish his movement on an occupied space, he moves his vehicle the same number of spaces once again, repeating this process, if needed. Once everyone has finished, each player pays the leader the amount showing on the space where his car stands.<br/><br/>If a player chose 1-3 for his movement, he draws a replacement Power card; otherwise, he must use one of the cards remaining in hand. The round ends once a player reaches the end marker or once all players cannot or choose not to play a Power card. The first two (or three) players on the track advance on a central scoring path, with players being able to pay money to advance additional spaces.<br/><br/>Players then reset for the next race with a new hand of Power cards and continue playing. The game ends when one or more players reach the dream island at the end of the central scoring track, with the player who advances the farthest winning. In the case of a tie, the tied player who did better in the final race wins.<br/><br/>",

Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?<br/><br/>",

You draw cards that indicate the color or shape of a box, and that's the type of box you have to stack next. The game proceeds until there are no more boxes to stack or until the players decide it is best to stop to avoid penalties. Scoring takes into account three factors: the number of full rows on the pallet, the number of boxes that aren't stacked on the pallet at the end, and the number of penalty points (from cards you draw but cannot play). The best score is 25. The perfect solution exists, but will your team find it?<br/><br/>",

For one, ships come in 3 sizes (victory points of 4, 3, and 1), and there is a requirement that the bigger ships are sown first. Second, each player has 3 chips that allow an extra move, but are worth 2 victory points if unused.

Not all of them can be described, but you can sense them as you play, and these sensations lead you to something bigger, something deeply connected to other worlds and civilizations.<br/><br/>The game is based on the modularity of the never ending connection between all cards. You can literally pick them up and randomly place them on the chessboard: coherent designs with infinite combinations will always come to life. However that&rsquo;s not the game.<br/><br/>Being completely deprived of any setting, the game can be defined as &lsquo;universal&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s based on visual perception of symbolic geometries. OTTO is the most abstract game ever, with a unique and original design, perhaps even extraterrestrial.<br/><br/>The game hangs in the balance between strategy, the vision of future opportunities, chance, and the player&rsquo;s style. In playing OTTO you will always discover new strategies, unforeseeable scenarios and complete situation reversals up to the last move.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When your fighter moves off the front edge of the board, it &quot;loops&quot; to the back of the board and continues. If you successfully position your jet behind an enemy, open fire with you cannon or a missile.  Damage is assessed by a die roll, and multiple hits are needed to bring down a plane unless a(n un)lucky shot strikes the cockpit or fuel tank. This is simple game that plays at jet speed!<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s also treason cards that can be used to mess other player&rsquo;s plans but these can be countered with protection cards.<br/><br/>The main mechanism is that most actions require a number. Dice imprinted in the cards are used to assign this number to be assign. The die used can be chosen from a card from the hand, therefor be a known number, or use the first card from the deck and be a random one. Cards used as a die are discarded and don&rsquo;t have additional effects.<br/><br/>",

They bring fine carpets to the market and share delicious mango juice while praying men honor the holy cows, and the children tease mischievous monkeys and gasp at the snake charmers. But the main event of the festival is the elephant race. Young men and women of the region spend days painting joyous and reverent decorations on their elephant partners for this one moment when they can surge through the crowds of festive villagers, push and shove their way past other racing pachyderms, and brave the tiger-filled forests to win honor for themselves and their proud elephant friends. The bell rings, the elephants trumpet their excitement, and the race begins!<br/><br/>Elephant Rally, which was first released as Formula E, is a game in which 3 to 6 players race their elephant pawns through an Indian village, over treacherous mountains, and across parched deserts seeking to be the first one to complete the course.<br/><br/>The primary game mechanism in Elephant Rally is hand management as players use their hand of cards to advance their elephants through the course. Elephants move in a unique manner &ndash; they push elephants in front of them until those elephants hit an obstacle, then the active elephant pushes sideways until a path is clear for it to move forward again. Certain move-adjusting cards and tactical-screwage cards can be played to trigger events like diagonal movement, obstacle movement, and nasty little screw-your-opponents effects. Elephant racing is not necessarily a sport of honor!<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a symmetrical deck of cards with values from 1 to 4 which symbolize the troops of magic minions he has created. Players take turns laying down their chosen cards to form a line of 3 or 4 (depending on the mode of play). They must follow several rules when doing so:<br/><br/>     stronger cards can cover weaker cards<br/>     The playing field is created as more cards are dealt<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, players can use:<br/><br/>     power cards - at the beginning of each turn two powers are laid out on the table and available for each player to play instead of making their move<br/>     Illusion spell - once per battle a player can draw a face down card, the opponent doesn't know if he can draw it or not, if he tries to draw a card of lesser or equal value he will only lose his card<br/>     Explosion - if any player fills the playing field by laying down 2 full lines of cards, an explosion occurs which discards certain cards laid out on the table<br/><br/><br/>When one of the players wins the clash by laying down a line, the effect of this victory is marked on the board (in the place where the last card was laid down). The board is a reflection of the playing field, if one player wins by making a line on the board he wins the whole game , or if he has the lead after 5 rounds of play.<br/>In addition before the game each player chooses his mage, each player has a unique and very powerful ability which can be used only once per game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Luckily these dastardly robbers have an array of items to help them get the better of the guards and their fellow thieves, such as sultry Llamas, mighty Underwear and the high-tech Cardboard Box.<br/><br/>Each player controls a thief, moving up to three tiles a turn. Then if they are on a tile with loot they can take a stealing action to grab some loot from the tile. Certain tiles have special &quot;Rare Treasures&quot; that are worth a lot more than standard loot, but you have to crack the lock code by rolling the correct numbers before you can steal these!<br/><br/>Each stealing action brings the nearest guard two spaces towards the thief's tile. Trying to crack a lock does the same. After stealing, the next card in the room is turned up, which might reveal more treasure. But turn up a security camera and the guard moves another 2 spaces closer! If the guard ends up on the same tile as your thief, you can slip away with a dice roll or play cards like &quot;Take Down&quot; or &quot;Lure&quot; to get rid of the guard. Otherwise the thief is thrown out of the Museum and loses all card but one. The player can break in again so there is no player elimination in the game.<br/><br/>Each thief draws new cards at the beginning of their turns, these cards can be used to take out guards, disable security cameras and mess with the other thieves.<br/><br/>When you draw a Clock card, time will advance and once you draw a certain number of clocks, depending on the number of players, the game ends.  At this point there is a rush to the nearest exit, rolling a dice to avoid dropping a card for every space you have to cover. The winner is determined by who has the highest value of loot at the game's end, once you are outside the Museum.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players may even go most of the game without a weapon at all, hoping to dodge their way through.<br/><br/>All players begin the game bitten, already infected by the zombie virus. No one can be trusted, not even that girl from band camp. Your objective: Be the first player to run down the hall, find an antidote in the science lab, and get back through the zombie-filled corridor to the exit. Only the first through will live, locking the door behind him to prevent the spread of the outbreak, which means everything and everyone on the board is an enemy. You may have to choose between killing a zombie or tripping a friend into your undead classmates to slow them down or eliminate them.<br/><br/>But take heed because players who die before taking an antidote join the game to feast on the living. Unlike the mindless horde, they rise as extremely deadly &quot;smart zombies&quot;, still playing with their full hand and hunting the living players. It's even possible for zombie players to win cooperatively by killing everyone else.<br/><br/>Student Bodies creates an intense feeling of desperation and maintains it throughout, while the humor comes from the horrible lengths players will go to survive at the expense of the others. Randomized board elements and a customizable zombie AI deck keep the game fresh and allow its difficulty to be raised or lowered to a significant degree.<br/><br/>",

Dice are rolled to capture bars with numbers on them, with the idea that bigger-numbered bars that are far from your starting location on that turn are the most difficult gold bars to acquire.  You can continue collecting gold on your turn until you either miss a dice attempt or decide you've collected enough for one turn.<br/><br/>",

Who will succeed him...<br/><br/>The two-player trick-taking game Awimbaw&eacute; presents a duel for the throne of the animal kingdom, with each player trying to use the animals of the savannah to win more crowns than their rival while avoiding the pack of hyenas. Win two rounds to become the new king or queen of the savannah.<br/><br/>The card deck consists of 28 cards: 24 animal cards numbered 1-6 in four suits, and four eagle cards in a fifth suit. Shuffle the deck, then deal four cards separately face down to each player, then deal four cards face up on top of these cards (to create four piles of two cards), then split the remaining cards so that each player has a hand of six cards.<br/><br/>On a turn as the lead player, you can play any of your available cards, whether one in your hand or one face up on the table. The opponent must then play a card of the same suit, if possible. If they can't, they must play an eagle &mdash; and if they can't play an eagle, they can play anything. If the two cards played are of the same suit, the higher card wins. If the opponent played an eagle, they can make it flee (placing it in their own scoring pile and ceding the trick) or they can make it fight, winning the trick. If the opponent played off suit, the lead player wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads again. At the end of a trick, if you have a face-down card on top of a pile, reveal this card, making it available for play.<br/><br/>The round ends when either a player collects their fourth hyena (losing the round immediately) or all cards have been played. In the latter case, count the crowns on collected cards to see who has the higher score. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

(Hii Fuu!!) is a trick-taking game from Japan in which the aim is to win exactly two of the nine tricks as late as possible.<br/><br/>There are two main features: the scoring system and the choice of the initial hand. This makes for an exciting trick-taking game that can be enjoyed from the beginning to the end of the game.<br/><br/>The scoring system: if you do not score exactly two tricks, you score zero points. If you score three tricks, you are eliminated from the round and score zero points. If you score only zero or one trick at the end of the round, you score zero points. This can be a nerve-wracking dilemma.<br/><br/>How to choose your initial hand: Unlike most trick-taking games, the initial hand is decided by discarding a relatively large number of cards from the hand dealt. Each player's intentions are intertwined and each session can be different.<br/><br/>ヒーフー!! は9トリックのうちぴったり2トリックをなるべく遅く獲得することを目指すトリックテイキングゲームです。<br/>大きな特徴は２つ、得点方式と初期手札の選び方です。これによりトリックテイキングゲームの楽しさをゲーム序盤から終盤まで楽しめるエキサイティングなゲームになっています。<br/><br/>得点方式：ぴったり2トリック以外は0点になってしまいます。3トリック獲得した時点でそのラウンドは脱落して0点、ラウンド終了時に0 or 1トリックのみの場合も0点です。2トリック時の点数もより後のトリックほど点数が高くなっており、ひりついたジレンマを味わうことが出来ます。<br/>初期手札の選び方：通常のトリックテイキングゲームと違い、配られた手札から比較的多くのカードを捨てて初期手札を決めるゲームです。プレイヤーごとの意図が交錯しセッションごとに違った展開が楽しめます。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

The game comes with a Tee Box and several different &quot;holes&quot;. You complete the course by adding tiles that include roughs, sand hazards, trees, water hazards, and a cliff, as well as the fairway tiles. The game includes four balls that are basically mini-shuffleboard pieces that you must flick from tee box to hole, while trying to avoid the hazards just like in real golf.<br/><br/>If you do hit into the hazards, each one carries its own unique mechanism to replicate the challenges of real golf. For example, hitting into the sand means you must hit your next shot using the thumb of your non-dominant hand. Each hazard also limits the distance you can hit your next shot.<br/><br/>The game also includes a weather die and spinner that must be rolled before each shot to determine the wind speed and direction. Golf pro player cards, which players can choose or deal out randomly, each have a different ability players can use once per hole.<br/><br/>Whoever has the lowest score after the final hole wins.<br/><br/>TGA can be played solo, one-on-one, in teams, or as a league.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rebel Nox is a highly tactical team-based card game with shifting alliances and a hint of social deduction. It is a stand-alone game set in the world of Capital Lux.<br/><br/><br/>The world of Lux is in uproar and rebels and loyalist fight for control of the capital. Who is on your side? Will your team gather enough followers to seize power? And who is true to your cause when it looks lost?<br/><br/>With the cards dealt at the beginning of the game, players are assigned to either the Rebel team or the Loyalist team. The two teams fight for control over locations that alter the rules in that particular fight, and provide influence to the winner. Play your cards tactically to establish who is on your team, take control of locations and make sure your team has the most influence at the end of the round. But as cards change hands, allegiances can change, so who can you really trust? Perhaps you secretly switched team yourself?<br/><br/>The near endless combinations of locations and card distribution make for a vast number of unique situations and tactical challenges, ensuring no two games will ever feel the same.<br/><br/><br/>Game flow: <br/>At the beginning of each round, six locations are placed in the middle of the table and each player is dealt nine cards. If you were dealt a rebel card, you announce that you are on the rebel team; if you do not have a rebel card, you are on the loyalist team.<br/><br/>The player who was dealt the &quot;rebel commander&quot; chooses a location for the first fight, and leads by playing the first card.<br/><br/>The game then plays like a trick taking game, but with some important differences: certain cards will alter who wins the location (assassins take out the highest card, making the second highest card win instead), flags increases the value of the current location (play them when you think a team mate will win), and infiltrators make cards switch hands (for every infiltrator symbol played, the player who played the lowest card must draw one card from the hand of the winning player). With tactical card play you can both influence who wins the location and how much it is worth. But as cards switches hands, you may not be sure who is on which team.<br/><br/>After all six locations have been won, players reveal which side they are on (if you have a rebel card, you are on the rebel team; if not, you are on the loyalist team).  Players now collect followers for their controlled influence, and all players on the team that controls the most influence are awarded bonus followers. If one team has managed to gather a required number of followers, they win the game. If not, another round must be played.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an update of the World War II: European Theater of Operations game published by TSR/SPI. It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.<br/><br/>Advanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.<br/><br/>Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &quot;Black Widow,&quot; the Fw 200 &quot;Condor,&quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &quot;Defiant&quot; and many, many more.<br/><br/>And that's not all!<br/><br/>Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "White Eagle Defiant, the follow-up game to the bestselling Brave Little Belgium, recreates the German, Slovak and Soviet invasion of Poland in September and October 1939 that marked the beginning of the Second World War.  Germany and its Slovakian ally began the invasion on September 1, 1939; the Soviet Union followed suit on the 17th.  Known in Poland as the September Campaign and in Germany by the codename Fall Weiss (Case White), the campaign ended on October 6, 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union splitting the country in two.<br/>  <br/>In White Eagle Defiant, one player controls the Germans, Slovaks and Soviets (simplified as the Germans in the game) while the other player commands the Poles.  The German objective is to gain control of Warsaw and other designated Victory cities while preventing Polish forces from destroying their forts in East Prussia and recapturing Victory cities.  If the German player does so in less time than the historical campaign, they win the game.  Anything less is a draw or a win for the Polish player.<br/><br/>This quick-playing wargame employs very similar mechanics as Brave Little Belgium, but with a modest increase in complexity. The game uses a point-to-point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the campaign, with each turn representing four days. Random event chits are included to add variety and excitement to the game, reflecting the weapons (such as armored trains and aerial bombardment) used at the beginning of World War II.  The combat system, while still simple, is enhanced to better simulate mechanized warfare, as well as the use of combined forces (players can bring forces from adjacent spaces into an attack, creating primary and secondary combat groups).<br/><br/>Other new features in White Eagle Defiant include Panzers for the Germans (which can roll two dice instead of one) and cavalry for the Poles (which can roll a &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; at the beginning of a combat round). A Victory Point track allows for variable entry of Soviet forces (depending on the success of the German player in capturing Victory cities), as well as the possibility of the Allies launching an attack in the West (if the German player fails to do well in capturing Victory cities). Finally, a &ldquo;blitzkrieg breakdown&rdquo; track is used by the German player; if the turn ends before both German army group chits are pulled, the German player may elect to activate a group, but possibly suffer a &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; while doing so &ndash; and if five such breakdowns occur, the German player automatically loses the game.<br/><br/>Players who enjoyed Brave Little Belgium will find that White Eagle Defiant offers the same tense play for both sides, while presenting new challenges that reflect the dawn of the blitzkrieg era.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: Wissenschaft &amp; Forschung, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.<br/><br/>",

Any number of players can join the struggle, although it's designed as a multiplayer game. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game, or you may try to obliterate your opponent's dice. Spells and layered strategies benefit certain races as you try to control the odds in this dynamic game full of surprises!<br/><br/>History: 2-Player Starter Sets, including completely rewritten rules, were released in 2006. These rules are available online at [<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.sfr-inc.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.sfr-inc.com</a>]. The new Starters have perfectly paired racial armies, not random assortments like the old retail packaging, plus four terrain dice, two dragons, the complete rulebook, and new army placement cards. The races are paired up as Coral Elf/Lava Elf, Dwarf/Goblin, Feral/Undead, and Amazon/Swamp Stalker. Hybrid Dragons were offered in 2008. Acolytes of the Eldarim (a large expansion of the Eldarim race) was released in August 2009, along with a re-release of the Dragonkin. The Battlefields expansion (new major and minor terrains) was released in August 2010, adding exciting new options and strategies. The Dragoncrusader and Dragonzealots (new Eldarim Champions) were released in 2011. Dwarves and Goblins were re-released as kickers in 2012 and now include a 5th monster for each race. Magic Items were also re-released in the Battle Chest expansion in 2012. Coral Elves and Lava Elves were re-released as kickers in 2013 and now include a 5th monster. Amazons were re-released as kickers in 2014 and now include a 5th monster.<br/><br/>The Starters listed above are now out of print. New Starters have been released that have 30 health of Firewalkers and 30 health of Treefolk.

We've all heard about the cats in boxes experiment, and maybe we're even curious about the results &mdash; but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!<br/><br/>In Schr&ouml;dinger's Cats, players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each other's research. Players take on the role of a cat physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby. Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis &mdash; or at least debunk someone else's &mdash; each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schr&ouml;dinger's lab.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player starts with six cards in hand, along with a physicist card. The first player asserts how many identical cards &mdash; whether live cat, dead cat, or empty box &mdash; are present among all the cards in play. The next player can increase the number of this claim or call. Each player can use their ability once during the round.<br/><br/>When a player does call, whoever was right &mdash; whether about the claim or about doubting that claim &mdash; stays in the game, while the other player is eliminated. Each remaining player gets a new hand with one fewer card, and you keep playing rounds until only one player remains.<br/><br/>",

Your rightmost column is also considered to belong to your right-hand neighbor, and likewise your area includes the rightmost column of your left-hand neighbor. Each player reveals any two cards in their area, then the round begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, you either draw the top card of the deck and reveal it, or draw the top card of the discard pile. If you draw from the discard pile, swap that card with any card in your area, then discard the replaced card. If you draw from the deck, you can discard that card (turning any card in your area face up) or you can swap that card with any card in your area.<br/><br/>If you draw from the deck, any other player can knock on the table to indicate that they want this card. You can ignore the knock, or you can give them the card; in the latter case, they then replace one card in their area with this new card, taking the old card in their hand. You then take any one card in their area and swap it for a card in your area, discarding the replaced card. The other player then places the card in their hand into the hole you created when you took one of their cards.<br/><br/>Any time you have three identical cards in a row or column &mdash; even a row that includes a card in your left neighbor's rightmost column! &mdash; you discard those cards from play.<br/><br/>Whenever one player has all their cards face up, each other player takes one more turn, then players sum the value of the cards in their area (which includes any cards remaining their neighbor's rightmost column). If the player who triggered the end of the round doesn't have the lowest sum, their sum is doubled. The player with the lowest total score after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the Blitzkrieg on the East Front at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.<br/><br/>PTH while utilizing &quot;La Bataille de France, 1940&quot; base rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Human wave attacks<br/>    Battalion officers<br/>    Communist Commissars<br/>    Recon rules<br/>    Flamethrower tanks<br/>    Motorcycle recon<br/>    Waffen SS<br/>    Rumnanian<br/>    Gully<br/>    Rail Roads<br/>    One 8'5 x 11&quot; chart with many overlays<br/><br/><br/>PTH has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.<br/><br/>Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units <br/>representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFVs/Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.<br/><br/>Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase<br/><br/>The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which can align to any edge of equal length on any other mapboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios.

        "description": "&ldquo;Not everyone can command an army of 140,000. It is difficult to manage when one is not used to it&rdquo;<br/>Mar&eacute;chal Canrobert during the trial of Mar&eacute;chal Bazaine<br/><br/>Death Ride covers the battle of 16 August 1870 between French units of the Imperial Arm&eacute;e du Rhin seeking to retreat west from Metz, and German Confederation forces seeking to deny the French escape by turning their southern flank. Neither side was fully aware of the other&rsquo;s position. Faced with the unknown both armies conformed to type with the French defending strongly and the Germans attacking. For once, though, the French far outnumbered the Germans. As a result a heavily outnumbered German army was forced to make a series of attacks to prevent the French discovering its weakness and to deny the French their retreat to the west.<br/><br/>Had the French pushed the Germans aside they would have been able to combine their armies and possibly protect Paris. They might also have avoided the collapse of the Bonapartist cause.<br/><br/>This version appeared in Against The Odds magazine #24<br/><br/>Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map<br/>140 full color die-cut 1/2&quot; and 88 5/8&quot; counters<br/>Rulebook length - 16 pages<br/>Complexity - Low<br/>Solitaire Suitability - Medium<br/>Playing Time - 4 hours<br/><br/>Design - Charles Vasey<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",

Each card has a power and an ability that is affected by the value of die that matches the color of the card i.e. the dice affect the cards and the cards may change the dice.<br/><br/>The game is typically played with 4 to 6 players (there are several game variants including a 3 player version on our &ldquo;Game Variants&rdquo; page). Game time is approximately 1 hour.<br/><br/>Noble Treachery is a &quot;casual&quot; game designed for players that enjoy changing strategy on the fly. Your best laid plans will be foiled by your opponents (you can always count on your friends to mess up your master plan), so always have a back-up plan and a back-up plan for that plan!<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/>The time of peace and prosperity for the Kingdom of Black Rose has ended with the untimely and mysterious death of the king. With no heir, it is now up to the five great noble houses to choose a successor to the throne. Only the most cunning and treacherous player will be able to unify the five noble houses and ascend to the throne.<br/><br/>Noble Treachery is a card and dice game for 4 to 6 players where players risk their tenuous political alliances during the chaos of war or the treachery of diplomacy to form new alliances with the noble houses of Black Rose. The first player to form an alliance with each of the noble houses becomes the King or Queen of Black Rose and wins the game. Players utilize armies, knights, nobles, clerics, spies, castles, witches, thieves, mages and poison in an ever-changing quest to win the support of the noble houses.<br/><br/>Noble Treachery is about thrills, love of the chase, close finishes, moments of shock and comeback victories.<br/><br/>",

Can you save your city from badly-named mob bosses, fear-inducing serial killers, a rising crime rate, and a police Chief that isn&rsquo;t always your friend? These officers may have 99 problems, but crime ain&rsquo;t one.<br/><br/>Code 3&rsquo;s cooperative scenarios challenge players to complete goals and make choices before revealing the next part of a branching story arc. Of course, mob bosses aren&rsquo;t the only thing hindering our officers, as 911 calls spread like wildfire about your city. If too many 911 calls go unanswered&hellip; the game is lost.<br/> Customize your crime fighting duo by selecting two officers (out of hundreds of officer combinations), each with their own unique deck, which are then shuffled together to create your &ldquo;Beat Partners&rdquo; deck.<br/><br/>You can tailor your Beat Partners deck to answer 911 calls quickly, to investigate for witnesses and evidence, to complete scenario objectives, or even move your beat cops into position to help your allies. There are hundreds of character combinations that you can experiment with, and finding the best two cops (or canines!) is key to your team&rsquo;s victory! Choices are everywhere!<br/><br/>Most importantly, Code 3 gives players the opportunity to handle things by the book... or play just outside the rules. However, if players choose to step outside the Police Department&rsquo;s Code of Conduct then the Internal Affairs Division starts investigating them. Players then shuffle &quot;IA Heat&quot; cards into their deck, and if two are ever drawn on the same turn, those players must immediately proceed to a contentious &quot;Internal Affairs Interview.&quot; Unfortunately, this prevents players from hitting the street and handling those 911 calls. Your teammates can help you during the IA Interview by vouching for you... but at what cost? Are they willing to put their reputation on the line for you? Are they willing to risk their own IA Interview?<br/><br/>Code-3 is a sand box of 80's cop action. Do you love rolling dice? Do you love pushing your luck? Do you love unraveling the story? The meta-game? Helping the team? Being in charge?  And... do you do it by the book? Find out now!<br/><br/>&mdash;descripton from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The World is changing and new powers are rising; soon they will begin to harass and attack the Roman lands. Deep within the impenetrable and dark forests, which stretch beyond the rivers of Rhine and Danube, live brave Germans, who turn their greedy eyes on rich towns and villages spread across the Roman provinces. It would be, however, a lot easier to pillage and conquer if not for rivalry and constant wars between tribes and warbands.<br/><br/>&quot;Germania Magna: Border in Flames&quot; is a card-wargame of shifting alliances. Each player assume the role of a Germanic warlord leading his warriors into Roman provinces, which lie across the Rhine and Danube rivers. The Roman Empire is still too strong to be conquered, but its fields and cities provide loot for your warriors, and its armies give you an excellent opportunity to prove yourself as a worthy leader and, by doing so, to achieve eternal glory for yourself. The enemy is very powerful, so to win you need to forge alliances (however fragile) with other warlords, who will switch sides each time the tide of war changes.<br/><br/>",

Scenarios range from the Japanese invasions of Burma and the Andaman Islands through the massive carrier raids to the planned but never executed invasion of Ceylon. The Japanese often have overwhelming superiority in the air, which the British must counter with guile while trying to lure the enemy into range of his slow but powerful battleships.<br/><br/>Pieces represent the ships and aircraft that took part in the campaign. The Japanese fleet is built around its five powerful fleet carriers with their deckloads of Zero fighters, Val dive bombers and Kate torpedo bombers, all wielded by expert pilots and crews. They are supported by four fast battle cruisers, fast but lightly protected heavy cruisers and big destroyers armed with the awesome Long Lance torpedo.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy is outnumbered and outgunned in the air, with three fleet carriers &mdash; all of them smaller than their Japanese counterparts &mdash; and one nearly useless light carrier. The British do have four old and painfully slow R-class battleships and the much more useful Warspite, newly rebuilt in an American shipyard. British cruisers are vastly inferior to those of the Japanese in both numbers and capability, as is the case with the British, Australian and Dutch destroyers.<br/><br/>But this is the Royal Navy, with a tradition of victory and a secret base on which it can fall back in the middle of the supposedly empty Indian Ocean.

Each player is secretly assigned one predator and one kind of herbivore. <br/>During a turn, a player can move an open herbivore below a predator card. When two of the same herbivores are adjacent, they will either fight (if they are of the same gender) or mate (if they are of different genders). Fighting removes a card, mating adds a cub token on one of the parents. <br/>The predators eat the top four size points of herbivores in their column. Each eaten herbivore counts a point for the owner of the predator. Each surviving herbivore card or cub of the kind you control also scores a point. When a player has reached nine points, they win the game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike most games, in Trench the 8x8 grid board is diamond-shaped; each player sets up his army on opposing sides of the &quot;trench&quot;, which divides the board into two. As hostilities between the armies commanded by the players grow, each attempts to seize control over the trench in order to take full advantage of its strategic potential, hoping thus to breach the opponent's defenses and capture the most valuable and important pieces.<br/><br/>From the Soldiers to the General, each piece being subject to specific maneuvers, all will have to cooperate in order to be able to occupy the trench, invade the enemy's territory, and vanquish the foe. The army that manages to survive after two battles wins the game!<br/><br/>",

A player rolls the dice and then may move pawns that correspond to the total of the dice, e.g. rolling a 5 allows a player to move the 5 pawn, or the 2 and the 3. The pawns are always moved to the next free space that is available on the board.<br/><br/>If the player succeeds in making a chain of 3 or more pawns, he or she may roll the dice again.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last three, specially-marked squares are occupied. Each player receives the number of points achieved by multiplying the number of the square by the number of the occupying pawn.<br/><br/>Rules Summary:<br/><br/><br/>    Roll d6; may move your matching-numbered token (* is wild but moves only one token)<br/>    Move it to the next free space on the track<br/>    After any player's token has crossed a line (varies with number of players playing), rolls of 3 4 or 5 may be split between 2 of your tokens (3-&gt;1-2, 4-&gt;1-3, 5-&gt;1-4 or 2-3), but only if you can move both the other tokens<br/>    If, with your move, you create 3 adjacent tokens of your color, go again (may do it repeatedly)<br/>    The game ends when last 3 spaces of the track are occupied<br/>    Final scores (for each token):<br/>        (token number) x (number on that token's space)<br/>        the multiplier for tokens never played to the board is -5<br/>        highest sum wins<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The original version of the game provided players with six tokens and had different rules for gaining points from the board spaces.<br/><br/>",

When this card is revealed all players must shout 'GUACAMOLE!'. The last player to react must pick up the centre cards. However, if a player smashes on a Guacamole card then they must pick up all the cards.<br/><br/>The last card is a change direction card and when this card is revealed you must immediately change direction. This change stays until the end of the round or until another change of direction card is revealed.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner of Avocado Smash, providing they survive the next smash!

Tanks, armored vehicles, anti-tank guns, mortars, infantry, air support and artillery are at the tip of your fingers. In 16 scenarios, the Italians, Germans and Vichy French fight against the British, their Commonwealth allies from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the Americans and the Free French. New to the system are obstacles such as Wire and Anti-Tank Ditches. What would desert combat be without that ever-unpredictable variable: Dust. It&rsquo;s Panzer IIs, IIIs, and IVs against M3 Lees and M5 Stuarts, and M13/40s and L3s against Crusaders, Valentines and M3 Grants. It&rsquo;s Armored Infantry in desperate close assaults, and ATGs, air support and mines.<br/><br/>&quot;It&rsquo;s a fluid struggle pitting tank on tank, and now you can re-fight these battles using the popular Nations at War system. Based on the popular World at War tactical system, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. In NAW you'll find everything you're looking for in a platoon level game: armor, artillery, infantry serving as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat.&quot;<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>308 Color Counters<br/>Four 11&quot; x 17&quot; Mounted Maps<br/>Rules &amp; Scenario Booklet<br/>Player's Aid Cards<br/>Dice<br/><br/>Other Games in Series:<br/><br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising<br/>    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Airborne<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Operation Cobra<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have you ever wanted to play a pop-up book? Have you been searching for a game that is filled with magic and mystery? Is your gaming group looking for something quick and fun without pages and pages of rules? Look no further!<br/><br/>The Shivers is a truly one-of-a-kind tabletop experience that features the magic of hand-crafted pop-ups, combined with just the right amount of spooky puzzle-solving mystery and role playing.<br/><br/>Using our patent-pending modular pop-up system, the mystery will unfold as you and your friends explore a magical mansion, as one of the members of the Shivers family. Each episode takes about an hour to play cooperatively, with one person taking the lead as the Storyteller. Once players finish one episode, a quick change of the system reveals the next story which will be completely new and unique: filled with new clues, puzzles, room layouts, and foes to vanquish.<br/><br/>The Shivers is fun and challenging for young kids, teens, and even older experienced game players. While most games have dozens of pages of rules and take many hours to learn and play, Shivers players have just a couple simple rules, and can get up and playing in less than 5 minutes. Similar to an escape room in structure and feel (but on a much smaller scale), players can get immediately immersed in the mystery, discovering the right path forward as they progress.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>For each scenario, one player takes on the role of the &quot;storyteller&quot;, which is akin to an RPG GameMaster (GM). They know the whole story, and facilitate the rest of the players as they play the game. They are not an adversary, as they can't win or lose. Their goal is to make the game as fun as possible for the group.<br/><br/>",

Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.<br/><br/>The game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.<br/><br/>",

Myraclia is a strategy game to be enjoyed on many occasions with many different people...<br/><br/>Rudy Priecinsky, Designer of Myraclia<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Planet Myraclia. Deserted and inhospitable. Wildly controlled by the elements. Life has no place here...<br/><br/>But you came! With your divine powers. You know, or more precisely, you want to turn Myraclia...to a dreamed planet full of life. The task is not easy. You have to subdue chaotic elements of nature, organize them, establish order, to give life a chance...<br/><br/>But you are not alone. Others want to turn Myraclia into their picture. Resources and time are limited. If you want to think of Myraclia as your creation, you have to fight with others ruthlessly for resources, but the form of Myraclia as well.<br/><br/>Your goals are noble. But are your motives?<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>In the game, you compete with other players for the title of The Creator of Myraclia. You are trying to get limited and chaotically emerging elements and sources of life. These are represented by glittering cubes in 7 colors in uneven numbers. You have to get them, organize them correctly, possibly replace them with the other player's elements, and ..... a miracle! The desolate and inhospitable part of Myraclia changes into a beautiful cradle of life.<br/><br/>The Myraclia surface is divided into hexagonal tiles. One side of the tile represents the original look of Myraclia, before the transformation, without life, the other side of the terraformed appearance, the new beautiful face of Myraclia full of greenery. There are 4 types of surfaces, namely plains, forests, water areas, and mountains.<br/><br/>The game takes place in rounds, divided into two basic phases.<br/><br/>In the first &ndash; drafting phase &ndash; players alternate in the specified order and select one element (cube) from the drafting board to help them transform (re-shape) a part of the planet in the next phase. But remember. Not the same resources are available in each round. Those elements, which were abundant in the last round and nobody wanted them, can now be scarce and desirable. And vice versa. The price for gaining a rare element is great. Speed - and sometimes greed &ndash; during elements selection determine the player order for an important second phase.<br/><br/>In the second phase - the terraformation - the players, according to the order set in the first phase, turn the individual deserted parts of the planet into Myraclia full of life. They discard the elements displayed on the Myraclia tile and turn it to a terraformed side. In most parts, they instantly earn points and/or a bonus in the form of the free released element. A released element can be used immediately. Order is key, but the first position does not necessarily mean an absolute advantage. If you were greedy in the first phase or you have chosen the wrong combination of elements, other players in turn could exchange their elements for your unused elements. The reward for the conversion of Myraclia is, in addition to the points, also the right to reveal new parts of the planet (by choosing new Myraclia tiles from the offer).<br/><br/>The game ends in a round in which any player has terraformed 7 parts of Myraclia planet or if a certain part of the planet has been terraformed (i.e. it is not possible to replenish the offer of Myraclia tiles).<br/><br/>Until the last moment, you cannot be sure who gets the title of The Creator of Myraclia.<br/><br/>At final scoring, players are rewarded by the final look of the planet Myraclia and receive a bonus for the most consecutive terraformed area of the planet, for the variety of the terraformed surface, but also for the size of individual types of surfaces terraformed by the player.<br/><br/>Your reward is a brand new Myraclia, beautiful, full of life. And also the feeling that you have contributed to it ..... the most.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Developer's Website:<br/><br/>Bushido is an oriental fantasy tabletop miniature battle game for two players. Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs. If you have played tabletop miniature games before, Bushido falls into the &lsquo;skirmish game&rsquo; category: all miniatures represent individuals and your force consists of a small group of unique characters rather than a big faceless army. A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet. A typical game of Bushido takes between one and two hours to play - more if you are new to the game, less if you are a seasoned veteran.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes you play the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; which can go more places but disappears as soon as the capture is made.  You also have the option of positioning to be the main deal-maker on a capture, which leaves you paying off all the surrounding boats but getting more money yourself on the deal at the end of the game.  Timing, of course, turns out to be a nice matter for judgment.<br/><br/>",

Set in a post-alien-invasion-of-Earth universe, the squads, heroes, and tanks of Earth's Militia battle against powerful aliens with enhanced power armor, hover tanks, Mechs (Ya, I need a better name.), and spider-like robots.<br/><br/>In each turn gamers draw up to a four card hand and may play a card, sometimes more, in each impulse. The cards activate units to move, fire, assault, and use special powers, such as explosive rounds, telekinesis, and more. Special cards, such as critical hit or bullet storm, can also enhance a unit's attacks.<br/><br/>Each turn continues until three end turn cards have been drawn. Players then choose one card from their hand to keep, the administrative markers are removed from the board, and a new hand is dealt to each player. The players use that new hand, or the card kept from the previous turn, to bid for initiative in the new turn.<br/><br/>Night of Man ships with numerous scenarios, as well as a point system that allows gamers to put together their own battles in no time flat.<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Sport&quot; contains historical events related to the world of sports, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Further south, Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Group captured Orel on 3 October without fighting and pushed on to the Zusha River. While Mtzensk fell on 10 October, further advances would have to wait until the pocketed Russians could be eliminated. The Russian 4th Tank and 201st Parachute Brigades had been fighting rear guard actions as the Germans advanced beyond Orel. Mtzensk&rsquo;s defense fell under the newly formed 26th Army composed of the 6th Guard Rifle  Division, 4th and 11th Tank Brigades, 41st Cavalry Division, and the 5th Parachute Corps (three Parachute Brigades). The German drive on Tula resumed on 22 October in spite of the terrible German<br/>supply situation.

        "description": "Bemused is a card game for 4-6 players in which the players take on the role of a muse seeking to elevate their chosen human virtuoso to the greatest height of celebrity and influence. To do so, the muse must eliminate their virtuoso's rivals by levying doubts and dreads upon them until they are driven insane...or worse.<br/><br/>Bemused is not a social deduction game.  Although there are elements of deductive reasoning, Bemused is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their scores in a &quot;take that&quot; environment.  Bemused is best described as a strategic &quot;ruin your rivals&quot; game with hidden goals and asymmetric player powers.  It is also a much deeper strategy game than it first appears.<br/><br/>Each player has a virtuoso card that designates their human prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a hand of doubt and dread cards.  Each turn, the player draws two doubt cards for their hand, places a doubt or dread card from their hand onto a virtuoso card, then discards a card from their hand. In some cases, a player may play two doubt cards from their hand, but this action permanently reduces their hand size. Each virtuoso has an ability that their muse may use, such as change a dread to a doubt or move a doubt from one virtuoso to another.  Scheming, negotiating, and table talk are encouraged!<br/><br/>When a virtuoso is saddled with a combined total of five doubt and/or dread cards, the virtuoso is driven insane. An insane virtuoso still gets their turn and may still win the game, but their options for which cards they may play on their turn is limited by their insanity. If an insane virtuoso has more dread than doubts, that virtuoso dies and becomes a fantasma that haunts the remaining living virtuosos. A fantasma may still win the game!<br/><br/>Each muse's prot&eacute;g&eacute; also has a gemina, a secret virtuoso in the game that holds a psychic link with their prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and a secret that describes how their prot&eacute;g&eacute; feels about their gemina, and how the player's score will be affected by the state of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s gemina when the game ends (e.g., the player may gain points if their virtuoso's gemina is not insane at the end of the game).  Once a virtuoso's gemina is revealed, a player may use the gemina's ability as well as their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ability!  A player may also reveal and use their virtuoso's gemina for a price... but whenever a virtuoso goes insane, their gemina automatically flips over and can have severe consequences for play...<br/><br/>",

However, when a gruff attacks it does not deal damage until the beginning of your next turn allowing your opponent a turn to dodge, deflect, or counterattack!<br/><br/>A Player wins when they can break through the enemy line of defenses and kill the enemy shepherd, or if you successfully kill all 3 enemy gruffs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Excerpts from the Clash of Arms website:<br/><br/>Brandywine &amp; Germantown expands the Battles from the Age of Reason Series into the American War of Independence. The games adhere closely to the highly successful BAR rules system. The major change lies in the halving of the strength point ratio so that 1 point equals 50 men, 25 horsemen, or 1 cannon, accommodating the smaller battles and units of North America. There is a noted lack of cavalry in both battles. The counters are in the same style as the other BAR games, but with some interesting variations (e.g., rifle frocks). Brandywine (three maps) has 4 scenarios: Knyphausen's attack at Chads Ford, Cornwallis' attack at Birmingham Meeting House (both one mappers), Howe's historical plan (comprising both Knyphausen's and Cornwallis' attacks), and an optional Howe plan. The latter scenario will allow the British player to select alternative schemes of maneuver to attack the Americans.  Washington, in turn, has the ability to gain intelligence on the British movements      (both true and false information) and possibly readjust his force. Germantown (two maps) has 2 scenarios. They vary based on whether or not the Americans are required to seize the Chew House.<br/><br/>",

Before you have time to think, multi-ball starts placing you and the other players in competition to score the various pop bumpers, drop targets and other playfield devices. You and the other pinballs have only a short time to score the most points and complete the various combos for bonuses before it's all over and you inevitably drain.<br/><br/>Players are dealt ten cards each of which represents a pinball playfield device. Each turn the players all select one card from their hand and one is added from the draw deck. These cards are placed face up in the center of the table and are the playfield devices that pinballs can steer towards and try to score this round. Starting with the first player, each player has three options. They may place a bid on a playfield device (Steer towards it), spend one or more control tokens to increase the speed of their pinball and they may purchase a playfield card from the discard pile. They many do any or all of these options or pass and do none. The highest bidders on each device takes their card and, assuming they meet the speed requirements to complete the device, they score it. Anyone who did not bid on a device starting with the first player selects one of the remaining devices. Pinballs must be going the speed listed on the device they get or greater to score it. If they are not, it is not scored and they still lose speed according to the device. Devices that are scored affect speed and can cause your pinball to speed up or slow down depending on the device. Besides scoring devices and trying not to drain by hitting a speed of zero, players are all competing to finish various combinations which score additional bonuses. At the end of ten rounds, the player that scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ignacio Zambrano, a successful merchant, was found dead in the back room of his shop. How did he die? Who is responsible for that? And why? Follow the instructions with your investigation team and try to answer these and many other questions. Can you clear up the mysterious death of the merchant?<br/><br/>In each Q case, you try to solve a mystery case with 32 clues, with players revealing one clue at a time until all cards have been revealed or discarded. During your turn, each player must perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>Choose a card from your hand and place it on the table, so all players can read or see the entire information.<br/>We recomend you read out loud all shared info when you place it on the table. If you play a clue that happens to be irrelevant<br/>to the case, you lose points at the end of the game, but be careful! Some clues are vital to resolve the case.<br/><br/>You can share and expose your theories at any moment and talk about the cards you have in your hand but you cannot show them to the other players and you may only read out loud the words written in bold or the text framed inside an image:<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all clue cards have been revealed or discarded, you must check carefully all the available information and prepare a theory of what happened, working all together. Then, open the questionnaire and answer all questions. During this phase of the game, you can speak freely about your discarded cards, or the information you remember of them. Each right answer will add two points.<br/><br/>",

Then you'd better speed up!<br/><br/>In Speed Colors, each player has a double-sided card with a colorful picture on one side and the same picture but in black and white on the other side. All players memorize the colorful side of their pictures, flip it, then color it in as quickly as possible the same way as on the back of the card! The faster and the more accurate you are, the more points you get. Try to keep up as the caps on the markers are switched at the end of each round (adding more challenge)!<br/><br/>Speed Colors is a reMARKERble fast-paced game that proves that coloring is fun for everyone!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new miniature tabletop game.<br/><br/>The website explains &quot;Wrath of Kings is a miniatures war game, where players take command of the armies of on of the five kingdoms of Arikania!  Scalable from 10 to 50 models per side, now you can vie for the throne of the Ancient King!<br/><br/>&quot;With a unique one roll resolution system and an active chain of command, you'll feel like you're actually in charge of an army without being bogged down in tedious tracking.  Combat is fast, fluid, furious and tactical - your decisions will matter on the battlefield!&quot;<br/><br/>There are five initial factions:<br/><br/>House Teknes<br/><br/>The armies of Teknes are some of the most well rounded troops. They are able to move from a defensive posture to attack in the blink of an eye. Both the Union Workers and Defender Linemen punish their enemies for attacking them. Their specialists and characters often employ lightning and magical wards to bolster their own defensive lines. No army attacks Teknes battle lines without expecting heavy casualties.<br/><br/>House Shael Han<br/><br/>The Shael Han fighting style is a mystery to all of their enemies and for good reason. The Legionaries are some of the weakest troops on the field by themselves, however whenever they are close by a specialist they become a force to reckon with. The Wrath led by their Big Sister are experts in engaging more than one enemy at a time. The true strength of any Shael Han army are their specialists, vulnerable by themselves but extremely powerful when working together they can cause a symphony of destruction on any battlefield.<br/><br/>House Nasier<br/><br/>Nasier love nothing more than to see their enemies wither in their path. The Nasier Ashmen charge is legendary and few enemies have ever lived to tell the tale. They&rsquo;re often supported by the Pelagarth who revel in combat and despite their lack of armor, cause more casualties then they take. The specialists of Nasier prefer to use flames to punish their enemies. One of the most aggressive armies, their zeal for reinstating the Efrenti presence leads them to wrought destruction throughout the continent.<br/><br/>House Hadross<br/><br/>As the most defensive army in the game, Hadross units become stronger both offensively and defensively as the game progresses. With each Deepmen lost, enemy models receive Resonate markers, which makes them easier to kill. Meanwhile the slower yet deadlier Sevridan keep enemy units from fleeing the battlefield. The Hadross specialists enhance the battlefield adding water elements to increase movement.<br/><br/>House Goritsi<br/><br/>Combining the fastest movement in the game with some of the strongest attacks Goritsi prefer hit and run tactics to conventional warfare. Players can employ the blazing speed of the Skorza to flank their enemies while their lethal Zeti hold the line. The terrible Blood Engine consumes the flesh of his enemies to heal his wounds. If you prefer high mobility armies and attacking first, Goritsi is the army for you.<br/><br/>The models are in plastic, with weapons in polystyrene so that they keep nice straight edges on spear shafts, handles, and large sword blades etc.<br/><br/>",

Everyone reveals their answer, and anyone who wrote the same thing becomes a blob and works together for the rest of the game!<br/><br/>A new category and word are revealed each round, with players and blobs again coming up with answers that ideally match with others.

        "description": "Wok Star is a cooperative real-time game in which players take on different roles to help grow a Chinese restaurant in a tycoon style game. The clientele of customers is represented by a deck of cards with various Chinese dishes on them. Customers are served one at a time while a 30-second sand timer is running.<br/><br/>Each order requires a combination of ingredients to make. The board is used for tracking the levels of ten prepared ingredients in the kitchen. To prepare more ingredients, players spend dice in different combinations. All players are in charge of different tasks and all must work simultaneously because the timer is running!<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players pool their money and invest in different options to grow their business: acquire new recipes, upgrade preparation cards, or send out coupons to get more customers. The players must have a certain level of profit by the last round to keep the restaurant open and win!<br/><br/>The third edition of Wok Star contains new gameplay wrinkles: You can re-roll dice by &quot;washing dishes&quot; and modify dice by using &quot;hustle&quot;. Fortune cubes limit how often you can share dice, and you now have daily goals that you must reach each round or else you lose immediately.<br/><br/>",

On your turn you are moving two of the characters on the board (could be yours and/or the others). Movement is decided by dice (you chose which dice you use for each character you chooses to move).<br/><br/>The game is won when either everyone is out of the mansion or when the last card (Clock Strikes Midnight) is drawn from the deck. You win by having the most moneybags (of the 20 available) of any of the players.<br/><br/>You are always trying to &quot;knock off&quot; the other heirs because as they are gone, their moneybags move down the will to the next heir in line. The board is a 3D house with several traps, which you use to get rid of the other heirs.<br/><br/>You can bluff by moving your opponents' characters towards the entrance or moving your own character onto the trap spaces, but without releasing it.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    13 Dead End Drive<br/><br/><br/>",

Launching with Star Wars: Episode III toys, ATTACKTIX is a battle figure game that combines great action figures with kinetic battling features.<br/><br/>Each figure comes on a base that contains all of the information that a trading card might include, such as speed, defense, point value and special powers unique to that character.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is simple: be the last one standing; but beyond that there are nearly unlimited strategies.  To begin, kids select how many points each squad should start out with, pick their squads and put them into formation.  On each turn, kids will move their figures across the table (counting distance using a patented clicking wheel in the base), and then attack with features like slashing light sabers, firing projectiles and others.  When the figures are knocked over, their special powers come into play and influence the game.  For example, granting another one of your figures an attack or bringing back a figure who may have been previously defeated.<br/><br/>This version is based on characters in the Star Wars Universe.<br/><br/>There are multiple themes in the Attacktix series of games.<br/><br/>",

But, because of turtles,  rerolling the dice is risky!<br/><br/><br/>     Movement: move meeples up and down the island and collect gems<br/>     Lava flow: kill opponent meeples, close territories, destroy gems<br/>     Statues: Protect meeples from lava flows<br/>     Volcanic eruption: Pick a gem, place it on top of the volcano and catapult it onto the board to kill opponent meeples or close to yours in order to collect them later.<br/>     Turtle: Any dice with a turtle can not be re-rolled. The Ancestral Turtle moves 1 space along it's path for each symbol at the end of the player's turn. If the turtle swims twice around the island, the island is the winner and all players lose.<br/><br/><br/>When the last member of a tribe is killed, the game is over. <br/>Each meeple is worth the value of the square they end on. Level 1 = 1 point, level 2 = 2 points etc.<br/>Score the gems you collected from the board. Emerald = 1, Ruby = 2, Saphir = 3, Diamond = 5<br/>Score the gems remaining on the ground if you have meeples in that same enclosed area. An enclosed area is an area between 2 lava flows starting from the volcano and reaching the sea.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

LNA uses cards to represent the military units, supply convoys and objectives of the historic campaign. To win, you must consider your units' combat power and maneuver options as well as their supply situation. The game features: the Afrika Korps, Tobruk, the Desert Rats, Malta, anti-tank guns, resupply from Europe, minefields and more. LNA is based around a new combat system that makes maneuver and planning as important as brute force. That approach is faithful to the historic events, in which smaller forces were often able to defeat and rout larger ones by using better tactics and planning. In LNA, battles can be won not only by overwhelming the enemy with firepower, but also by out-thinking and bluffing him. The dynamic game system puts you in charge of one of the most famous theaters of WWII.<br/><br/>Lightning Game Series<br/><br/>",

Approximately 400,000 men from the Allied forces of Belgium, France, and England were surrounded in the area of Dunkirk by German forces. England launched Operation Dynamo with the hopes of rescuing 30,000. Instead they rescued 330,000. In this game, the player controls the Allied forces and must try to recreate the historical result.<br/><br/>The game uses Event cards to define the conditions for each turn. These cards dictate where the Luftwaffe will strike, how many units can evacuate, the German army movement, and the number of player actions.<br/><br/>The game uses a point-to-point map. The Allies can move between any two connected points but the Germans can only move on set tracks. As the player moves the Allied forces to the beach, they are converted to evacuee units, which can then sail to England. But even then they can be subject to artillery or Luftwaffe strikes until they arrive safely in England.<br/><br/>The game is scored by calculating the total number of evacuees rescued and earning victory points as a result. The historical result or better wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Will you answer the call and perform your service dutifully?<br/><br/>C.O.G. is a steampunk themed game that fuses a crossword game with a eurogame. Each player has their own tableau (similar to a Scrabble board) on which they spell various resource words (such as cog, pulley, rod, aether, bulb, lens). When a player spells a word, they have collected that resource, which will score points at game end.<br/><br/>The central turn mechanic is worker placement. In each round, players take turns placing workers to gather letter tiles, action cards, and a die. The letter tiles are used to construct words on the players' tableaus. The action cards provide a variety of actions. For example, some cards are &quot;resource cards&quot; that provide an alternative way to collect resources. Other cards provide the ability to manipulate letters. Other cards provide victory points and other special powers. The die chosen has two functions: (1) to move player's pawns along a track whose spaces provide more abilities and (2) to activate some of the action cards.<br/><br/>",

There are always more fledgling civilizations ready to rise to the heights of power and culture, invent new technologies, and usher in a new millennium.<br/><br/>Deep Future is a card-driven board game for 1-3 players of empire and innovation spanning the rise and fall of the countless worlds of the galaxy. You will settle on planets, expand your influence across sectors, invent new technologies and rediscover old ones, and face challenges that threaten to tear your civilization apart as you try to achieve one of several paths to victory.<br/><br/>Deep Future is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few materials (a map, paper, index cards, and colored cubes) and the remaining components will be generated as needed during play. Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy, the techs invented, and the lasting impact of previous civilizations.<br/><br/>The rules include tables and guidelines for creating new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Deep Future an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. The galaxy&rsquo;s content &mdash; its worlds, techs, and history &mdash; can grow endlessly over a connected campaign as players return to see what each new era holds for the future of humanity.<br/><br/>",

While challenging enough for serious puzzlers, it also features a rich, emotional narrative composed by New York Times bestselling YA novelist Tommy Wallach, which will have you and your loved ones feeling all the feelings.<br/><br/>The game is divided up into three acts, each of which contains a trove of documents and puzzles, all of them beautifully crafted and cunningly designed--ostensibly by Mary Shelley herself--in order to reveal a great secret she left to her only surviving child. A bonus edition also includes a full copy of the 1818 edition of Frankenstein with additional puzzles from Emerald Flame creator Rita Orlov (PostCurious).<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you'll also build a 500 piece 2D puzzle and a 350 piece 3D puzzle, ending up with a gorgeous recreation of Frankenstein's castle you can keep forever!<br/><br/>Simply put, there's never before been a game like Mother of Frankenstein.

        "description": "Take It or Leave It is a game title asking to be mocked by those who don't like the design, so here's hoping it goes over well with audiences.<br/><br/>What is the game, you ask? Each player has a hand of four task cards showing dice combinations and other tasks that the player is trying to achieve during a game round, such as a sum of pips less than 13, or two white dice and one black die; each card has a point value on it, with the tougher cards obviously being worth more points. Someone rolls a bunch of white, black and red dice, then players take turns choosing a die from the pool. Each player also holds one action card that lets them manipulate the dice to better achieve their tasks.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either takes a die or passes from the round. Once everyone has passed, players assign dice to their task cards, with red dice counting as either black or white. Complete your tasks, and you'll cheer (and score points); have dice unused, and you'll wish that you'd never been born &ndash; or you'll just lose a couple of points. Depends on how much of a drama queen you are.<br/><br/>After each round, a player refills his hand of cards in the appropriate proportions, and after each player has started a round 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and players tally their points.<br/><br/>",

The time is the 17th century when shipping routes on the Indian Ocean are bustling with trade ships. Who will emerge as the final victor to seize all the lucrative trades in the Age of Discovery?<br/><br/>In East Indiaman, players operate their own East India Companies by building their trade posts in the Far East and dealing with exotic spices, silk, tea and china as they manipulate their fleets to create their trading empires!<br/><br/>Starting from the first player, players take turns in clockwise order. Each player performs two actions during their turn until all players have chosen to pass the round. Players can choose from the following seven actions and perform them in any order. Additionally, you can choose to perform the same action twice:<br/><br/><br/>    Send ship to buy cargo: Choose this action to send ship(s) to purchase spice, silk, tea or china<br/>    Exchange cargo: Choose this action to exchange cargo A with cargo B<br/>    Complete an order: Use cargoes in your possession to complete orders<br/>    Increase investment level: Use cargo in your possession to increase your investment level and receive a new ship<br/>    Build a trade post: Use ships to build a trade post and adjust the prices of cargo<br/><br/><br/>A round ends when all players have finished their actions for the round.

        "description": "Quantum physics tells us &lsquo;the ability of quantum particles to occupy two states seemingly at once could be explained by both states co-existing in different universes&rsquo;. So when you wave goodbye to your ship in your universe, someone else waves goodbye to their ship in a different parallel universe. But what would happen if these neighboring universes, separated by the thinnest, gossamer barrier should somehow be breached and my ship sails into your world and searches for gold in competition to your ship? Play the game and find out...<br/><br/>Ni&ntilde;a &amp; Pinta is a game of exploration of the New World where the great nations of Spain, England, France and Portugal send ships out to map the unknown and to bring home wealth to the Old World. This is a game where those ships will cross the divide and where no love is lost between Captains no matter which world it is! Explore, settle, fight if need be, and help your nation develop its Culture, Science, Religion and War-craft, to be the best in all worlds!<br/><br/>No dice rolling in this Ragnar game, but plenty of tension as players can launch offensives with their Captains after first using them to flip land tiles thereby exploring each New World. Settlers are placed in explored lands to generate gold revenue. When combinations of terrain are occupied, towns and cities can be built. Meanwhile gold is used in the Old World to buy items to benefit further New World development or to accumulate the victory points generated by Culture, Science, Religion and War which themselves are meshed with what is taking place in the three New Worlds.<br/><br/>This is a tightly knit puzzle that will have players pondering a multiplicity of decisions from start to finish. As much of the play is simultaneous and &quot;single-action&quot;, there is little downtime. The game has a good sense of growth worthy of its fascinating theme.<br/><br/>",

They will increase in power and prestige by expanding their trading routes and by contributing to the political and religious life of the city. In the game, a merchant&rsquo;s success is measured in Prestige Points. The winning merchant is the one who scores the most Prestige at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each player has a number of Camels and Ships that can be sent to different locations on the board to collect wood, stones, marble or gold and use these resources, in turn, to acquire rare goods, fulfil specific missions presented by the King or build the city temple or the tower.<br/><br/>Each development line has its own advantages and drawbacks: the Tower provides prestige points during the game and can boost your scoring significantly but it is highly competitive. Also, the more Tower levels you build the higher the building costs. Acquiring Rare goods is key to get more ships which are the main way to collect resources but you must time your purchases very well to get the different sets of goods that can boost your final scoring. King&rsquo;s Missions are very versatile: they are worth a good number of prestige points at game end but also carry a one-off benefit that can result crucial at a certain points in the game. Finally, building the Temple is a slow way of adding prestige points but can give you a dramatic boost when you manage to complete its construction in full.<br/><br/>Different strategies can be built by acquiring improvements that let you excel on specific areas of the game. The wide range of improvements available and the fact that the mix changes at every game ensures that no play session is the same.<br/><br/>Growing your trading enterprise and your prestige does not make you immune from danger. Marauders sweep the Syrian Desert plains or sail along the coast to intercept and rob your peaceful merchants. You will have to use all your intuition to spot which region they will attack and avoid placing your Camels and Ships there or these will be lost!<br/><br/>",

I&rsquo;ll say it again. Meeple Microbes (squeeee!)<br/><br/>In this nasty little 2-5 player game, your boss, Dr. Lillian Johannae has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of microbiology. She has discovered a new breed of extremely unstable, highly volatile microorganisms, BIOTIX&trade; (patent pending and pronounced &lsquo;biotics&rsquo;) that can uneasily coexist within a small system. Now she needs supporting data. But science can be a brutally competitive field.  What began as an innocent pursuit of discovery has quickly devolved into self-centered posturing and ruthless backstabbing among her lab personnel, all vying to have their name attached to the research paper, thereby rocketing them you into scientific superstardom.<br/><br/>Your mission, carefully grow the largest culture of BIOTIX you can in your petri dish &ndash; and sabotage the work of others by pushing their microbe populations above their limit, causing them to explode and bio-react in all sorts of fun ways.  Game play is simple: on your turn, draw two BIOTIX from the specimen bag and place them, one at a time, either into your own dish for points or into an opponent&rsquo;s dish to try and force a bio-reaction to destroy their work.<br/><br/>Each of the five BIOTIX species has a different trigger number and a unique bio-reaction when they &lsquo;go off&rsquo;. It may force you to trash the microbes, force microbes from your dish into the petri dishes of others, steal microbes or wipe out a species across the whole table. The BIOTIX are in a constant state of flux throughout the game, as is your score, because at the end of the day you gain points for the BIOTIX remaining in your dish, with the most volatile BIOTIX being worth the most points.<br/><br/>The best score over 3 days of research determines the winner! Then try the advanced game, with Aggressive BIOTIX, a cancer-like organism that mimics the properties of the BIOTIX they replace in your dish &ndash; except they are worth negative points instead of their usual values.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ChronoCops is a time-travel adventure packed with wacky humor and lots of tongue in cheek. The game idea is based on point-and-click adventures in video game history. As ChronoCops, agents of the most prestigious research department for time travel, the players travel through time to famous people and places where they have to solve puzzles. To do this, you need to bring the right things together to think outside the box, clear obstacles out of the way, and work together to stop the insane Professor Knix, the former mentor of the ChronoCops.<br/><br/>The players explore different timelines, which can be opened up only gradually by successfully solving puzzles. Each timeline has different jump markers that players can travel to, some in the past or future, others in alternate realities. There are clues and objects hidden everywhere that the ChronoCops can collect and combine with the Chrono Decoder to use at a specific location. The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.<br/><br/>In ChronoCops: Einsteins Relativit&auml;tskrise (&quot;Einstein's Relativity Crisis&quot;), Professor Knix wants to build a time paradoxomat to unify all timelines into a single mess, but the ChronoCops can't allow that to happen! To stop the mad professor, they need the help of Albert Einstein. But on their journey, the Cronks, Professor Knix's strange helpers, get in the way repeatedly.<br/><br/>",

These elections will name the nine representatives who will sit at the high council. Each party must carefully divide its soldiers, merchants and priests, to obtain the majority of votes during the elections. These elections follow each another in each of the areas of the city. The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes. Tyrus is thus a game of careful application of power, force and influence in order to affect the best outcome possible for your political party.

As one of the members of that search party, you will need to trespass into the sacred forest and cross the boundary that separates the realm of humans from the realm of the Slavic deity Radgost.<br/><br/>Inhabiting the forest are strange beings such as the Psoglav, Lesnik, or Todorci, none of which take kindly to human intruders.<br/><br/>You'll need to use all your skills, wisdom, and instincts to survive the numerous encounters with these strange creatures.<br/><br/>Along the way you will develop your character, collect items, gain skills, separate and rejoin with other members of the search party, and, possibly, discover the secret reason why the druid chose you to join the search party.<br/><br/>Forest of Radgost is a role-playing game where each player controls a character with a fleshed-out backstory, motivation, and skill-set. Players navigate the web of interconnected forest footpaths with a pair of dice that determine the distance and direction of their movement, evoking the feeling of being lost in the woods, with creatures lurking at each crossroad.<br/><br/>At each encounter, players must decide whether to run, hide, flee, or communicate, without knowing which creature they are about to face. Depending on their choices, the encounters are resolved according to the numerous scenarios provided in the accompanying book of encounters.<br/><br/>Nine decks of cards add an open-world dimension, allowing players to explore the rich game world based on four years of research into Slavic mythology. Numerous scenarios, map details, and cards interact to weave a unique storyline ensuring that players will never have the same adventure twice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Strange signs have started to appear all over the world: seas flecked with blood, flocks of shadowy figures wheeling in the sky, prophetic visions that leave people mumbling in addled madness. The time has finally come. The Old Ones are stirring, and it&rsquo;s your job to wake them up!<br/><br/>In Rise of Cthulhu you play as the leader of a cultist faction wishing to awaken Cthulhu and the other Old Ones awaken to rule this world. But a competing faction races against you to be the first to awaken these chaotic masters. By playing various numbered and colored Cultist Cards, you must control the prime Lovecraftian locations &ndash; Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport &ndash; in an effort to awaken an Old One. The faction that maintains the most influence on a location will gain favor when the Old One arises, while the losing faction risks the destruction of their sanity and souls. Through clever pairing of colored and numbered cards, players can summon dangerous Monster Cards to their aid, unlock the eldritch secrets of lost Artifact Cards, and even manipulate an Unspeakable Guardian to terrorize your opponent. All of this and more await the cunning and adventurous in this tactical card game of influence and horror for 2 players.<br/><br/>On your turn you will have 2 actions: you can either draw 2 cards, play 2 cards from your hand, or draw a card and play a card. Cards can be drawn from a face down deck of Cultist cards or a face up pile of discarded Cultists cards, known as the Valley. Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport. The player with the most total points on a given location turns the location to face them, marking that location as being influenced by their cultists. As the values change during gameplay, locations will shift their influence from player to player. Playing three of the same color, three of the same number, or a run of three cards of the same color (ex. 2-3-4 of green) will earn players the right to draw from special Monster and Artifact cards to help their hold on locations or hinder their opponent. At key points in the game, Old Ones will be drawn from the Cultist Deck and attach themselves to a location: the player currently influencing that location will reap the benefits of the Old One. When all three Old Ones awaken, the game ends and the person with the most locations facing them (or points in play if there's a tie) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In Movie Empire, you are a junior producer working for that guy and are competing with other players to be the heir to his throne. You do this by producing movies (a few big blockbusters or several small trash movies) and publish them at the right time in the right market and hit trends to get awards. But also keep an eye on pleasing your boss as this will have an influence on your assets.<br/><br/>Movie Empire is a mix of worker placement and set collection for 1-4 players. And as Hollywood is a shark tank, you have the (completely optional!) black dossier variant, that adds a take that mechanism to the gameplay. Let the clubbing and stabbing commence!<br/><br/>The game consists of four phases: Grumpy phase, working phase, premiere phase and upkeep phase.<br/><br/>The most important phase is the working phase. This is where you send out your production assistants (a.k.a. workers) in order to get production assets, cast stars, buy scripts or do some other tasks. But since many tasks can only be occupied by one player, you have to choose your strategy carefully. The gathered resources have to be attached to a movie. Pay attention to special laying rules and requirements - for example, post-production has to happen after shooting the movie and not before.<br/><br/>Then if you feel like it, prepare for releasing your movie. Choose a market (each one with its own advantage) and reap your rewards. If you release the right movie at the right time, get ready for an award. But don't forget your boss, Mr. Grumpy. The more he likes you, the more possibilities you have.

On a turn, you flick one of your pieces at one or more of the opponent's pieces, and if you manage to knock at least one opposing piece from the board while not flying off yourself, you take another turn; otherwise, the opponent takes their turn.<br/><br/>If you manage to remove all of the opposing pieces, you start the game again, but with you now having eight pieces instead of nine and with those pieces being one level closer to the center of the game board. Each round that you win, you start with one fewer piece and one level closer to the center. If you win a round after starting on the fifth row with only five pieces, then you win the game.<br/><br/>",

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation. If correct, the player wins, but if incorrect, the player must return the cards to the file without revealing them and may no longer make suggestions or accusations. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players. Recent and current issues of the game state 3-6 players.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.<br/><br/>If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).<br/><br/>The timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.<br/><br/>Many years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the designer:)<br/><br/>The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War, 1861-65 is Renaud Verlaque's second published design after Age of Napoleon, winner of 2003 Best Pre-WW2 Historical Boardgame CSR award.<br/><br/>The Price of Freedom is a true grand-strategic-level look at the American Civil War. Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.<br/><br/>The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.<br/><br/>The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.<br/><br/>So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website:)Components:<br/>    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map<br/>    132 counters<br/>    1 deck of 55 playing cards<br/>    2 player-aid cards<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    2 6-sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>",

Each card features 1-3 birds in one of four colors &mdash; red, green, yellow, purple &mdash; with the reverse of the card having either the same number of birds in a different color or the same color of birds in a different number. Thus, each number+color combination appears five times in the deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a card in the grid, then flip it over. If you can add it to your collection, do so; if not, return the bird to the grid with the newly revealed side face up. Your goal is to collect sets of birds in a single color, with you needing to take the single bird first, then the pair, then the triplet. The first player to collect 2-4 sets wins, with the number being dependent on the number of players. Watch what others do, remember what was flipped where, and play the odds when deciding to flip the birds!<br/><br/>",

In Embark, you will load various boats heading to these new, uninhabited islands in order to explore, colonize, and mine their riches. Only fully-loaded boats will launch, so assign your voyagers carefully. Explorers will scout out the islands, unlocking their mysteries. Miners will collect ore, and colonists will cultivate farms and reap the benefits that the islands have to offer. Watch out for your opponents&rsquo; warriors, who can replace your voyagers and take over their jobs!<br/><br/>Embark is a game for 2-5 players, designed by Philip duBarry, and developed by Seth Jaffee. It lasts about 15 minutes per player, and could be described as a light-to-medium weight game.<br/><br/>In Embark, you and your friends simultaneously assign your voyagers to boats, then take turns assigning them jobs by placing them into specific berths in the boats. When a boat is full, it launches, carrying your voyagers to one of the islands in play, where your voyagers will start to perform the jobs to which they were assigned:<br/><br/><br/>    Explorers explore the island, scoring 1 point per round, and increasing an exploration bonus for the island.<br/>    Miners collect ore, which will score an end game bonus.<br/>    Colonists build farms worth a chunk of points. Having a majority of colonists also wins a player the exploration bonus for the island.<br/>    Captains can do any of the three jobs above.<br/>    Warriors must displace another voyager and take over their job, sending the displaced voyager back to the owner's pub to be reassigned next round.<br/><br/><br/>After six rounds of assigning voyagers and launching boats, the game ends, bonuses are tallied, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on hexes and the attacking planes are placed in hexes to indicate which ship it is attacking.<br/><br/>The basic game is very simple.

        "description": "Dark Nebula has 8 small map-boards representing sectors of about six or so Star systems. The boards are placed randomly at the start of the game by both players one at a time, to their own advantage. The game is played in turns with each player's turn having a number of phases. Get the money you earn from your star systems, move your ships and combat, a reaction from your opponent (which has some restrictions), a final move and combat by you, then it is the other players turn.<br/><br/>The object of the game varies with the board placement, but basically you need to control your opponents Home-World for a number of turns..<br/><br/>One of GDW's Series 120 games, a line of introductory wargames spanning various historical eras.  The games in the series had 120 counters and were supposed to be playable in 120 minutes or less, hence the name.<br/><br/>The game plays quite fast because the rules, while badly referenced (typical of GDW), are quite straight forward (medium simple). You need to get some card and mount the boards, but the boards themselves are nice enough. The counters are standard fare, but have no printing on the back to show disrupted units.<br/><br/>The system is based on that used in Imperium: Empires in Conflict – Worlds in the Balance.<br/><br/>",

In game one player becomes a member of the Polish resistance and try to execute tasks against occupants.<br/><br/>The second player becomes a member of German forces and tries to stop Polish actions.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four agents. Each turn player choose a card which decides whose agent first makes his move and what is the amount of action points. This points can be used to moving agents on map and taking special actions like searching for items or evidence of illegal activity. They can try to talk with enemy agents to force them to reveal secret information. German agents may try arrest Poles but polish agents may try to make assassination of gestapo officers. After successful actions, players receive Victory Points.<br/><br/>Both players can play cards to use special effects or to disturb enemy actions.<br/><br/>Every scenario has special win conditions (like finding some items or execute some activities). If this conditions are not achieved, players must compare Victory Points they gathered.<br/><br/>",

For the next four years there would be no quiet: on the western front in France, on the eastern front in Russia, in the Italian Alps and the Balkan foothills, the only peace would be among the dead.<br/><br/>Recreating the Great War of 1914-1918, GUNS OF AUGUST is a unique, exciting game. As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.<br/> Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.<br/><br/>For those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.<br/><br/>COMPLEXITY: Rated &quot;5&quot; on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) <br/>1040 Counters<br/><br/>(BGG description :)<br/><br/>Avalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  <br/>Comes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars.

Hired to retrieve a copy of The King in Yellow stolen from an Arkham collector, you are drawn into a web of murder, suicide, and madness. Banned in most countries and denounced from the pulpit, the terrible, irresistible ideas presented in the play are unquestionably unsettling. Are the better qualities of humanity no more than false masks worn to conceal the base passions that rules all men, women, and children? It might be best not to dwell on it, and to<br/>focus on the task at hand.<br/><br/>As private investigator Howard Lovecraft, you will investigate events based on Robert W. Chambers&rsquo; collection of stories, The King in Yellow, and on Raymond Chandler&rsquo;s short story of the same title.<br/><br/>Arkham Noir is a solitaire card game inspired by the interconnected stories of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors, re-imagined as noir detective stories. Each case stands alone.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of adding cards to open cases, creating lines of investigation in an effort to solve them. The ultimate goal is to score five &quot;puzzle&quot; clue cards in order to piece together the big picture before running out of time or mental stability. Each newly shuffled deck is the start of a unique challenge, with adjustable difficulty levels to accommodate all level of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As part of the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944, the British 6th Airborne Division took part in Operation Tonga, to capture and destroy several bridges on the Orne River and Caen Canal and to secure important villages in the area. Bad weather and difficult landing conditions meant that units were scattered and often had to fight in smaller, weakened forces. Fortunately, the German resistance was, on this occasion, inefficient.<br/>In Battles of Normandy, you will be commanding whatever British units happen to be available in order to take strategic positions on the map. German forces may not act with the full efficiency that the German army was known for, but they will nonetheless put up a fight.<br/>This book builds on my previous book-based game, The Fields of Normandy. It is not a sequel, and the rules are different, but it is aimed at the same audience &ndash; those who are relatively new to wargaming and would like to &ldquo;dip the toe&rdquo; and those who, like me, would rather play something than have time for nothing.<br/>The aim here was to produce a fairly traditional hex and counter wargame experience with simple rules and a manageable &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; which will not take up too much time or effort to operate, especially once you have grasped the basic system.<br/><br/>",

Each player then chooses a role. When competing for the crystals later, each player may only play cards for his or her role (suit) or wild cards.

Set-up is to put two matching cards at the center of the table.

However this historical detail should not obscure all other facts which mark out this battle, where successive attacks and counter-attacks succeeded each other: massive commitment of German tanks A7V, employment in the two camps of elite troops, attack at night,...<br/><br/>April 1918 - The German Michael offensive, launched in Picardy, is peaking. Reaching the gates of Amiens, the Kaiser's troops threaten to definitively breakthrough the Allied Lines.<br/>On 24 April, the Germans captured the last defensive bastion in front of Amiens, the village of Villers-Bretonneux, during a battle that featured the first engagement between tanks. But that same night, Australian soldiers entered the line and prepared to repulse the enemy in an intense night attack. Their objective was as simple and terrible as their war cry: &quot;Into the Bastards!&quot;<br/><br/>Into the Bastards! is a low complexity game recreating this battle, from the initial German offensive to the Australian counter-attack.<br/>Each player has elite troops at his command, represented at battalion scale: the German Guard Division, the french Moroccan Division, an Australian Brigade, and, of course, British and German tanks.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 - 3 hours<br/>Hex: 219 yards / 200 meters<br/>Units: Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (160 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 6-page Into the Bastards! rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time:<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deck of Wonders is a solo-first expandable card game with legacy elements. It captures the feel of games like Hearthstone and MTG, but in a solo/co-op format.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to defeat the various Villains that challenge you for the Deck of Wonders by turning their own spells and minions against them, while enlisting the support of magical creatures and powers of your own.<br/><br/>The story is that you&rsquo;ve stolen the Deck of Wonders from Fate herself and, as you make your escape, all manner of magical creatures start coming out of the woodwork to both help and hinder you. Chief among these are Fate&rsquo;s Villains, who are hunting for the Deck of Wonders at her command (or perhaps for their own selfish reasons).<br/><br/>When the game starts, you select the Villain you want to face off against. Each Villain has a set of special rules you MUST follow and a set of cards that you MUST use in your deck as long as you're facing them. To their cards you add additional cards from your Collection, which forms the deckbuilding challenge of the game: what cards should you add to the deck that can take advantage of the special rules, and combo with or counter the Villain's cards?<br/><br/>All these cards go into the same deck, which you and the Villain take turns drawing from. This works because each card has two halves: one to use if drawn on the Player turn, and one to use if drawn on the Villain turn. The Villain halves are stronger, faster, and more powerful than yours (Fate is on their side after all), but they will attack mindlessly following a simple set of rules called the Priority System. It's up to you to outplay the stronger Villain by manipulating the Priority System and leveraging the synergies of the deck you've built!<br/><br/>As you defeat Villains and progress in the game, you will unlock special legacy packs. Each legacy pack will have special cards that alter the play experience in surprising ways, forcing you to change your strategic approach. Once a Villain is fully defeated, you can add their cards to your Collection for use against other, more powerful Villains. You may even unlock special, permanent upgrades for your cards! You&rsquo;ll need every bit of help you can get to stay in front of the difficulty curve, and the choices you make around what to upgrade turn your collection into a unique representation of your decisions and play style.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time to catch some crabs! Not for dinner, mind you, but to sell to markets for a grand haul. In order to make the most for your efforts, you want to concentrate on those crabs grouped together in large sets. Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.<br/><br/>Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.<br/><br/>A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)<br/><br/>The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

You run its daily business: you hire workers, hold winetastings, make wine and trade it at the local Wine Stock Market. Indeed you will need a keen nose for business to cash big and become the favorite of the high-class wine circles. Toscana is a light, well-aged strategy game and tastes best when enjoyed among friends.&quot;<br/><br/>Toscana is a game with short and clear rules, but with considerable depth of play and minimal random elements - so it suits gamers and non-gamers alike. It is a unique combination of stock market and area control, and the game introduces some good and trusted mechanics in a new blend.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Every round each player has 3 available actions: Hiring, Winemaking, and Trading. Players perform actions in turn, and the order in which they perform them has consequences.<br/>In the Hiring-action, the player hires a winemaker or a winemaster who can make wine, and he can hire the Lobbyist or Mr. Ros&eacute; who can influence the market place. In the winemaking-action the player makes wine and in the Trading-action he buys or sells it at the Wine Stock Market. The player with the most money in the end wins.<br/>Simple rules, simple structure, but loaded with tricky choices and difficult decisions.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>- 1 gameboard<br/>- (8 map pieces to optionally create a random map)<br/>- 4 lobbying tiles<br/>- 5 price markers<br/><br/>Boxes (cubes) of:<br/>- 15 red wine, white wine, champagne, ros&eacute;<br/>- 20 water<br/><br/>In each 5 player colors:<br/>- 1 winery board<br/>- 4 action coins<br/>- 5 workers<br/>- 3 winemasters<br/>- 7 winetasting tiles<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a lightweight strategy game for 2 to 4 people which also includes a number of challenging puzzles for 1 player. The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.<br/><br/>The game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.<br/><br/>The game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.<br/><br/>The publisher's website <a target='_blank' href=\"http://sagacity.aires.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://sagacity.aires.com.au</a> formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three years after the collapse of South Vietnam, General William Westmoreland announced that &ldquo;militarily we were successful . . . we didn&rsquo;t lose a single battle above company level.&rdquo; It was in these intense company- and platoon-level firefights, which characterized most combat in the Vietnam War, that military engagements could be won and lost. At close quarters in the jungle, at night, and in hamlets surrounded by rice paddies, American soldiers faced their North Vietnamese and Vietcong enemies on even terms. FRONT TOWARD ENEMY allows players to explore intense company- and platoon-level battles from the perspective of a company commander, using a fast-playing system that provides the feel and unpredictability of small unit combat.<br/><br/>FRONT TOWARD ENEMY is a simulation that recreates tactical engagements during the Vietnam War at the scale of 50 meters per hex and five minutes per turn. Units represent fire teams, heavy weapon sections, leaders, vehicles, and helicopters. Eight scenarios with set-up options recreate twelve missions that typified company-level engagements during the Vietnam War, including airmobile insertions, assaults on fortified positions, and classic search-and-destroy operations, among others.<br/><br/>Rules cover all of the elements associated with combat in Vietnam: helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, artillery support, snipers, sappers, civilians, booby-traps, medics, evacuation of the wounded, prisoner interrogation, tunnels, hidden caches, and more. Winning doesn't always mean holding the objective if the cost in casualties is too great. Sudden combat in difficult terrain causes command and control to quickly break down. A chit-pull system means command and control is erratic, and volume of fire is rewarded, but results are fickle. The unforeseen occurs, ranging from non-combat injuries to interference from higher headquarters to so-called &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo;. Immediate action drills, staying close, and the ability to move and act as a coordinated unit ensure survivability in this environment.<br/><br/>FRONT TOWARD ENEMY puts you in the middle of the toughest fighting of the longest war of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>FRONT TOWARD ENEMY contains:<br/><br/>        three countersheets (5/8&quot;)<br/>        two unmounted mapsheets (22&quot; x 34&quot;)<br/>        one rulebook (20 pages, color)<br/>        two Combat Results Tables/Terrain Effects Charts (color)<br/>        one Helicopter Table (color)<br/>        four scenario cards (color)<br/>        two d10 &amp; one d6<br/>        one box &amp; lid<br/><br/><br/>FRONT TOWARD ENEMY scales:<br/><br/>        each turn is approximately 5 minutes<br/>        each hex is approximately 50 meters across<br/>        counters represent Infantry Units of one to four men (Fire Teams, Weapons Teams, Leaders, and Individuals) Helicopters, and Vehicles<br/>        Additional markers represent Civilians, Caches (rice, medical, and ammo), Bunkers, Foxholes, and Tunnel entrances<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Joe Chacon<br/>Developer: Nick Richardson<br/>Map Art: Jordan Worley<br/>Counter Art: Nicol&aacute;s Eskubi<br/><br/>(from MMP website)<br/><br/>",

The game also ends as soon as the person in front (the king frog) hops over the person in last place, in which case the king frog wins.<br/><br/>",

Can you defend yourself from their attacks and perhaps perpetrate a few of your own? And can you end the hunt at the most opportune time, perhaps by actually wakening the fearsome beast?<br/><br/>Hoard is a dynamic game of hand management, set collection, and press-your-luck. Each turn players take one of four possible actions:  1) roll a custom die and move to take a new card, 2) secure a set of treasures or add to an existing set to score points, 3) affect the dragon, who wakes in stages from his tail to his head, by playing cards that soothe or rouse him, or 4) use a sword on an opponent or capture a used sword with a shield. The board is composed of 12 facedown cards surrounding the dragon.  It changes as players remove and replace the cards. Dice rolls between 1-5 enable clockwise or counterclockwise movement and the special symbol allows access to all but one of the cards, so it is a game that rewards memory.<br/><br/>Hoard is meant to be played in rounds, with scoring tokens obviating the need for pencil and paper scorekeeping.<br/><br/>",

On that night and that night alone, in certain rooms vast treasures appear, granting unspeakable wealth to those brave enough to find and claim them. But those who enter this mansion do so at their peril as some rooms awaken ghosts and curses that claim any who are foolish enough to enter. Rumors speak of glyphs and sigils found within the manor only on Crimson Moon night; these markings offer hints and clues &mdash; indicating both where treasures can be found and where paranormal traps lie in wait.<br/><br/>In Spectral, players control competing bands of treasure hunters. These bands enter the Spectral Manor on the night of the Crimson Moon and race to uncover and stake out the locations of the treasures before midnight. As they discover and decipher the glyphs, they can avoid rooms where demons secretly slumber and selfishly keep such information from their rivals. Meanwhile, locations of the manor that promise to conjure the most treasure will see multiple clans clashing over the territory. Through deduction, bidding, betting, and bluffing, players will uncover and harness the secrets within. The game ends after a player has placed all of their treasure hunters or if all players consecutively pass. The band that claims the most treasure while avoiding cursed rooms will come away victorious.<br/><br/>Spectral features multiple challenge levels &mdash; beginner mode, standard mode, and advanced modules &mdash; so that you can tailor the game to your experience.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each tile shows an icon on both the front and back: Lupin, Lady X, the Blue Lion diamond, or a police inspector. Each combination of two icons occurs once. One player plays as Lupin, the other as Lady X. During set-up, these tiles are arranged in a row. In turn, the players take one tile and add it to the front or the back of the line, without looking at the back of the tile. After this set-up, the players try to score points by creating special combinations of tiles. Each turn, a player can perform one of three actions to change the line:<br/><br/><br/>    Switch two adjacent tiles.<br/>    Move a tile that is on one end of the line to the other end of the line.<br/>    Flip a tile.<br/><br/><br/>If this action results in a scoring combination of three tiles, the player scores points. The combinations are:<br/><br/><br/>    Sandwiching a tile showing the opponent by two tiles showing police inspectors: 1 point.<br/>    Sandwiching a tile showing the Blue Lion by two tiles showing the player's character: 2 points.<br/>    Creating a row of three tiles showing the Blue Lion: 3 points.<br/><br/><br/>After a combination has been formed, the middle tile of the combination is removed. The opposing player then adds it to one end of the line, although he cannot score points by doing so.<br/><br/>The first player to score seven points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The original edition came out in 1963 in a double-size box. The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one hex) or retreat (two hexes) after combat.  Units have one-hex thick zones of control; movement directly from one hex in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining hex of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one hex per turn movement), mountains (one hex per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten hex movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.<br/><br/>Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whoever wants to overcome the footholds and foothills must be the first to get two of their pawns to the summit. This requires two things: a little luck with the dice, and the opportunism to be at the right place at the right time. In your struggle to reach the top, your opponents will jostle you toward the foot of the mountain. You can do the same right back, but you can also use a chain reaction to shimmy your way to the top.<br/><br/>In Gipfelst&uuml;rmer, which translates as Summiteer but should perhaps be titled Footholds and Foothills due to the author, each player tries to reach the peak with their five mountain goats. On your turn, you can roll dice up to three times. At the end of the turn, you look to see if you fulfill the requirements to move one of your mountain goats toward the summit.<br/><br/>Each path up the mountain has its own dice combination. The closer to the peak, the larger the required dice results (from three-of-a-kind and small straight to full house or five-of-a-kind), and the narrower the paths. In spaces of the upper half of the game board, there is room for only one mountain goat to stand. If you reach an occupied space, you may push one of your goats there one space toward the peak; on the other hand, you push one of your opponents' goats back toward the valley. Whoever can get two of their mountain goats to the summit first wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dinosaur Table Battles is a game about dinosaurs fighting each other for some reason. As in the original Table Battles game &mdash; which apparently is going to be called &quot;Human Table Battles&quot; from now on &mdash; players roll dice, then assign them to cards representing their fighting forces. Removing the dice triggers an attack, but that attack might be reacted to &mdash; whether absorbed, blocked, or countered &mdash; if the opposing player removes dice from a card with a reaction. The trick is that if you can react, you must react, and if you do react, you don't get to attack on your next turn. Mastering tempo is key to your success.<br/><br/>The thing about this game, though, is that it has dinosaurs, and dinosaurs are pretty big guys and gals &mdash; so big, in fact, that each dino spans two or three cards, giving them an assortment of attacks, reactions, and rule-breaking special abilities. During set-up, players draft a team of dinosaurs, creating unique synergies to be exploited and disadvantages to be mitigated. There are over 900,000 different matches possible, and while that might not be enough to keep you occupied for 200 million years, it's probably close enough.<br/><br/>",

After being featured at IndieCade 2014, Circular Reasoning was then picked up by Ad Magic and is now being published under Breaking Games.<br/><br/>The board consists of a goal in the center and three concentric tracks of 16 spaces each. Each track has a gate to the next level, but the gates rotate around the board according to the number of tokens found in each level.<br/><br/>Each player gets a square, a triangle, and a circle, which move four, three, or two spaces respectively. In addition to racing toward the center, tokens can be used to block other tokens from using the gates to advance. Because of this, players must predict and work around their opponents moves to secure victory.<br/><br/>",

A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).<br/><br/>Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then it&rsquo;s free.<br/><br/>EDITIONS<br/><br/>Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:<br/><br/>- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.<br/><br/>- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.<br/><br/>- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resin balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.<br/><br/>The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:<br/><br/>- Light: around 15 grams each.<br/>- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.<br/>- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball &quot;clack&quot; they make when struck together.<br/>- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.<br/><br/>They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.<br/><br/>HISTORY<br/><br/>Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.<br/><br/>Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.<br/><br/>GAMES<br/><br/>This is the official geeklist of Shibumi games:<br/><br/>Official Shibumi games list<br/><br/>Please feel free to create your own game for this system!<br/><br/>The names of these games all start with &lsquo;SP&rsquo; because they're Square Pyramidal games:<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Glory II: Across the Rappahannock (AtR) is the second game in GMT's acclaimed American Civil War series, Glory. Glory presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play with solid historical insight. Across the Rappahannock revises the original design to make all of those features even better. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.<br/><br/>Across the Rappahannock still features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Best of all, these new mechanics are not only retro-fitted to the original Glory, but Glory II: AtR provides all the counters necessary to play the battles in the original Glory game (Manassas and Chickamauga) with the new rules!<br/><br/>Across the Rappahannock brings you two of the biggest battles in the Civil War; battles that have received scant attention from the hobby: Fredericksburg, with Burnside's frontal assault across the river against a heavily defended Confederate position, and Chancellorsville, the biggest battle in the entire war. And, while the full game of the latter battle uses 3 maps and a lot of your time, there are two standard one-map battles and three smaller scenarios highlighting engagements within the bigger battles that use few counters and take only a couple of hours to play!<br/><br/>",

Its distinctive feature among those games is the use of various pair-runs like 2-2-3-3-4-4 to trump single and pairs of 2s.<br/><br/>The game is for four players. A standard 52 card deck is used. There are no Jokers and no wild cards.<br/><br/>The ranking of the cards is: Two (highest), Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three (lowest).<br/>Within each rank there is also an order of suits: Hearts (highest), Diamonds, Clubs, Spades (lowest).<br/><br/>Among climbing games, Tien Len's most distinctive feature is its unique mechanic for &quot;bombing&quot; the high deuces: a 3-finger run (e.g. 445566) trumps a single 2; a 4-finger run (e.g. 44556677) trumps a pair of 2's; a 5-finger run trumps a trio of 2's; and a 6-finger run beats a quad of 2s.<br/><br/>",

You do this by playing cards face-down from your hand and declaring what they are, then giving one other player the choice to decide if you are bluffing or telling the truth. If they choose correctly, THEY get the Farm Animal card(s) you played, but if they guess wrong, YOU get the card instead. Whoever wins Farm Animal cards adds them to their collection. But you may also get Crows, pests that irritate Farmer Brown and count against you in the scoring.<br/><br/>Collect the most animals by bluffing, baffling and out-guessing your friends! Score the most points and win the game!<br/><br/>Barnyard Roundup is a family-friendly, appropriate game for ages 7 and up. We have played the game with players as young as 4 and had a lot of fun!

        "description": "In Terra Pyramides, players compete to acquire building sites to build pyramids of different sizes. They need money, resources and workers to build the most magnificent pyramids, for which they get points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Each player must place exactly one tile on the game board in a round. Then all tiles on the game board that are in a straight or diagonal line from the tile just placed are activated.<br/><br/>The tiles have workers, resources and money that can be activated/received by the player. Workers and raw materials are needed to build pyramids. The workers must &quot;walk&quot; in an unbroken straight or diagonal line to the pyramid building sites. If a player has enough resources and three of their workers on a building site, they may build another level for this pyramid, which earns them points. Money can be used for bonus promotions, e.g. B. to obtain wild resources or to search a stack and select a tile.<br/><br/>The game ends when all tile stacks have been used up. Each pyramid is worth points depending on how far a player has occupied the pyramid. Leftover resources and money are also worth points.<br/><br/>Terra Pyramides comes with two expansions in the box. While the basic game is aimed more at family players, the expansions add additional strategic elements that make the board game more complex.<br/><br/>",

But, the best artists are the most sought after, and, beyond that, you must also wittingly use your money to improve your circus. And of course, don't let the marketing down or you won't gather the crowd to improve your income!<br/>[Taken from the publisher's website.]<br/><br/>--x--x--<br/>The game takes only 4 rounds, during which the players will get income, pick two business partners to work with (which will help them with additional powers), get new artists or possibly send them to the cooperative in a new, ingenious distribution mechanic and then invest on their business. During the investment phase, a player will have the opportunity to hire artists from the cooperative, get improvements for his circus, advertise the new show in town and set up tents for the selling of merchandise.<br/>After every two rounds there'll be a show, in which players will score their circus and then move on to another town (thus, discarding everything but artists and improvements).<br/><br/>After the two shows (that is, 4 rounds), the player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>Um divertido e emocionante jogo de estrat&eacute;gia para toda a fam&iacute;lia!<br/>Imagine que voc&ecirc; &eacute; dono de um grande circo, e dever&aacute; contratar o mais talentoso elenco de artistas para apresentar seu espet&aacute;culo! Por&eacute;m, os melhores artistas s&atilde;o muito disputados, e al&eacute;m disso, voc&ecirc; tamb&eacute;m dever&aacute; usar seu dinheiro com sabedoria para melhorar as suas instala&ccedil;&otilde;es. E claro! N&atilde;o deixe de fazer as propagandas certas para atrair mais p&uacute;blico e aumentar sua renda!<br/>[Retirado do site da fabricante.]<br/><br/>--x--x--<br/>O jogo leva apenas 4 rodadas, durante as quais, os jogadores ir&atilde;o ganhar dinheiro, selecionar 2 parceiros (que lhes ajudar&atilde;o com poderes adicionais), conseguir novos artistas ou poss&iacute;velmente envi&aacute;-los para a cooperativa em um engenhosa mec&acirc;nica e ent&atilde;o, investir em seus neg&oacute;cios.<br/>Durante a fase de investimento,  um jogador ter&aacute; a oportunidade de contratar artistas da cooperativa, comprar melhorias, fazer propaganda do novo espet&aacute;culo na cidade ou armar barracas para vender mercadorias durante os shows.<br/>A cada duas rodadas ter&aacute; um espet&aacute;culo, durante o qual os jogadores pontuar&atilde;o e ent&atilde;o ir&atilde;o para outra cidade (descartando, assim, tudo exceto artistas e melhorias).<br/>Ap&oacute;s dois espet&aacute;culos (ou seja, 4 rodadas), quem tiver a maior pontua&ccedil;&atilde;o ser&aacute; o vencedor!<br/><br/>",

Event cards seem to cover just about every dimension of the period. The underlying game system also offers opportunity for strategy and negotiation as well as chaos. The seagoing players, Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Dutch, each have national differences and advantages/disadvantages.  This is also true for Russia and Turkey which can colonize overland. There is also provision for general European war.  Multiple scenarios are provided. Also included are rules for 1 or 2 players which permit Spain and Portugal to participate as non-players.<br/><br/>One interesting dimension of the game is the idea that each player also has a &quot;job&quot; within the game, from which he occasionally earns a little income.  One of them was even The Rules Lawyer, in charge of resolving any disputes!<br/><br/>In 1992, expanded to support 8 players, including China, with the Columbus expansion kit commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' initial voyage.<br/><br/>",

And as luck turns out, the winds have blown you directly where you are needed the most!

        "description": "Ulti is the national card game of Hungary.<br/><br/>Background to the Game<br/><br/>It was developed in the 20th century from the rules of the 18th century card game Marias and the 19th century card game Talonmarias. It is traditionally played with a special deck of cards called the William Tell deck. The deck has 32 cards - like a modern Skat deck - but uses German suits (Bells, Hearts, Leaves, Acorns).<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Ulti is a trick-taking game for three players. In each hand the player who wins the bidding chooses trumps (or no trumps) and plays alone against the other two players in partnership.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 10 cards. The start player is allowed to look at and swap with the two cards left over (called a Talon). Once they have done this they must make a bid. Each player in turn can choose to look at the Talon and swap cards with it but if they do they must make a bid which is of higher value than the previous one.<br/><br/>Numerous different value bids can be made. These range from winning the hand, taking the last trick with the seven of the trump suit (Ulti), loosing every trick (Betli) or winning every trick (Durchmars). The value of most of these bids can be doubled by playing the Heart suit as the trump card. If a player thinks the winning bid will not be successful he can make a bid saying this when he plays the first trick (called a Kontra). At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points (or money if playing for money.)<br/><br/>Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid. If a player has called a Kontra he gets double points.<br/><br/>Ulti has no fixed end point and players can play as many hands as they have time for.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new pathology has just appeared! Patient Zero has been identified, and it's up to you to find the antidote as soon as possible to save the patient and humanity!<br/><br/>Save Patient Zero pits two labs against each other. Each lab employs one or two scientists (i.e., players), while another player plays a lab computer named Savvy. The labs compete to identify an antidote of three molecules, with the labs typically sharing no information with one another; whichever lab finds the antidote first wins.<br/><br/>The general idea of the game is to use lab tools in the best sequence possible to identify the three molecules out of 25 that make up the antidote. (These 25 molecules are arranged in a 5x5 grid on each lab's worksheet.) At the start of the game, Savvy looks at the top three molecule cards in that deck, then sets them aside. These are the molecules the labs must identify. On a turn, each lab submits a tool card to Savvy to show what they want to do in the round, and whichever lab submits first takes its action first in that round. Actions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Samply: Draw three sample cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy. Each sample card depicts five molecules, and Savvy will identify which of them show at least one molecule used in the antidote.<br/>    Mikroskopo: Choose two cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy, who will treat them like the cards in &quot;Samply&quot;.<br/>    Dedukto: Receive five molecule cards from Savvy. You (but not the other lab) now know these molecules are not in the antidote.<br/>    Centrofugo: Place your centrifuge on your lab worksheet so that it points to four molecules. Savvy then indicates whether any of these molecules are in the antidote.<br/>    Scanpad: Place a cardboard device on your worksheet to highlight six molecules in a 2x3 grid. Savvy then indicates how many molecules highlighted (0-3) are part of the antidote.<br/>    Spionado: Savvy takes two lab cards from the opposing lab that do not have any molecules in the antidote on them, then shows them to you.<br/>    Antidote: Circle three molecules on your worksheet. If all three are in the antidote, you win! If not, Savvy will indicate how many of the circled molecules are in the antidote.<br/><br/><br/>Each lab has a limited number of actions in its deck &mdash; eighteen total, with three Samply, two Dedukto, one Scanpad, two Antidote, etc. &mdash; so use them wisely, especially the Antidote because if you fail to identify the correct three molecules a second time, then your lab loses the game automatically.<br/><br/>To play Save Patient Zero as a two-player game, each lab draws three molecule cards from the deck, and the opposing lab must identify these three molecules before you can identify the three molecules they drew. Each lab takes the role of Savvy for the opposing lab.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Count of Nine is a solo, 9 card, economic, city building Euro-style game.<br/><br/>You are the Count(ess) of the small territory of Nine. Search your land for resources to build basic structures that will provide more resources. Use these structures and resources to build up your small village into a powerful economic force.<br/><br/>Count of Nine is played with 9 double-sided cards containing up to 2 resources and up to 2 structures on each side of the card.  There is no board, no dice, no cubes, no meeples, just the 9 cards, so it makes a great travel game.<br/><br/>The goal is to score the most victory points in a match, which is made up of 2 separate games.<br/><br/>In each game, first select one of the 5 &quot;high structures&quot; that will be your goal of the game.  The 5 high structures are: Castle, Cathedral, Monument, Harbour, and Town Square.<br/><br/>Then, play through the deck of the remaining cards (called a round) and use resources on adjacent cards, and resources provided by already built structures to build additional structures.  Play multiple rounds to get everything you need to build your selected high structure.  Continue playing to accumulate additional victory points.<br/><br/>Victory points are awarded several ways:<br/>- Victory points marked on some of the structure cards<br/>- 1 victory point for each different structure built<br/>- 2 victory points for each pair of identical structures built<br/>- 5 victory points is a second &quot;high structure&quot; is built<br/><br/>Final score for each game is total victory points minus the number of rounds played.  Final score for the match is the total of both games.<br/><br/><br/>Count of Nine was created for the 2018-19 Card Nanogame Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>Released in the August 2019 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.<br/><br/><br/>Structure art from the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;En Garde is a semi-historical game/simulation representing many of the situations of an Errol Flynn movie set in the Seventeenth or Eighteenth Centuries. The game was originally devised as a fencing system, with background added to provide scenarios for the duels. After a time, it became apparent that the background was more fun than the duels, and En Garde, in its present form, was born.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In En Garde, a player finds himself born into and educated in a world where social climbing is a way of life, and status is a goal to be pursued even over money. It is a world inhabited by Cyrano, Roxanne, Scaranouche, Errol Flynn, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rhonda Fleming, Francois Villon, Constance, and, of course, D'Artagnan. There are people to be used, friends in high places to be cultivated, enemies to be humiliated, the Cardinal's Guard to be trounced, lackies to be abused, the hand of a fair damsel to be won, and the ear of the King to be gained. Come with us now, to those vibrant, bawdy days of Yore.&quot;<br/><br/>A pencil and paper game in the style of an RPG, and with much of the detail expected in an RPG of the time, but with the &quot;adventure&quot; structure built into charts and tables so that no referee was required. Playable by any number of players.<br/><br/>GDW published a second edition in 1977, which incorporated the errata sheet into the rules along with some non-substantive changes. In 1988, SFC Press (UK) printed a third edition which was reformatted and illustrated, but is essentially the same as the second edition.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.engarde.co.uk/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.engarde.co.uk/index.html</a><br/><br/>",

Strange and deadly monsters know the adventurers are weak and in possession of a powerful item, and they will pursue them until all have been defeated.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty simple:<br/><br/>1. Choose a quest to have completed; pick up the quest item.<br/>2. Choose your adventurers.<br/>3. If you have a spellcaster (and you should have at least one), choose their spells.<br/>4. Split the Journey deck in two, shuffle both halves and stick the Home card in the bottom half.<br/><br/>Playing is even simpler:<br/><br/>1. Flip Journey cards and resolve the actions.<br/>2. The game ends when either the Home card is drawn or all adventurers have been killed.<br/><br/>The gameplay requires you to manage your resources (adventurers, items, spells, and money) with an eye towards a long-term goal (home) in the face of short-term obstacles (monsters and other unfriendly cards). Every choice you make at every stage of the game will help decide if you make it home.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;ROME, INC. - From Augustus to Diocletian&quot; by designer Philip Jelley is a solitaire wargame of the Roman Empire from Augustus in 27 BCE to Diocletian in 286 CE. The player (as CEO of this vast corporate empire), appoints consuls and governors, raises taxes, deploys legions, fleets and auxiliaries to garrison provinces, and fights wars to expand the prestige and power of Rome.<br/><br/>Historical statesmen are rated for their military and administrative talents, popularity, and skill at intrigue (or lack thereof), and each has a special ability. For example Augustus is rated as 5 for administration, 5 for popularity, 3 for intrigue and while only rated a 2 for military, he also has the Conquest special ability. This makes him excellent at collecting taxes, increasing prestige and keeping the mob happy, but a poor general overall, even though Conquest allows him to annex extra provinces. Nero is rated 2 for administration, 4 for popularity, 5 for intrigue, but only 1 for military, and has the Persecution special (dis)ability, reducing prestige as long as he is Caesar. A player may use him to reduce unrest with his showmanship, or plot to remove him for the greater good of Rome (&quot;the Biz&quot;).<br/><br/>Governors are used to fight wars, expand the empire, and develop provinces, but may make themselves Caesar through assassination or rebellion. New imperial dynasties change the rules of the game, provide new units, and determines who will succeed when Caesar dies.<br/><br/>Each turn produces a new crisis and the player, much like a modern CEO, earns victory points by expanding the empire and triumphing over wars and rebels, deciding where allocate his resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertaking prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the mob (&quot;the shareholders&quot;), or even setting aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. Annexing the rich provinces of the east will increase taxes, but securing the northern frontier may be more important. Placing a popular, competent general in command may result in a triumph, but encourage rebellion. A more loyal, but less able man may be better, or for Caesar to risk himself on the field of battle himself.<br/><br/>The map consists of provinces grouped into military commands such as Britannia and Syria, each commanded by a governor. Provinces may be controlled by barbarians, allies or insurgents, which can be conquered and developed into peaceful tax-payers. Beyond these are the homelands from where barbarian wars and enemy leaders pillage their way from province to province until defeated.<br/><br/>There are four scenarios starting in 27 BCE, 70 CE, 138 CE and 222 CE, which may be combined into campaign games. Each turn represented 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each of the four scenarios.<br/><br/>ROME, INC. and issue #53 of ATO<br/><br/>Map - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>Counters - 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>Rules length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Playing time - From 3 to 4 hours<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Excellent<br/><br/>Design - Philip Jelley<br/><br/>Development - S.

Wrestlers of varying size, skill, and disposition wreak havoc upon one another by playing various Hold cards to batter their opponents senseless en route to a quick fall or submission.<br/><br/>Each of the 24 wrestlers has his own unique set of abilities (Strength, Agility, Skill, Weight, Recovery, etc.) that determine what he can do in that spotlit ring on your table at home. Using Action Cards depicting a variety of holds - both legal and illegal - you must use your wrestler's strengths to their best advantage and minimize his liabilities in order to overcome your opponent. Victory depends solely on your skill in using your wrestler's abilities and the Action Cards that come your way.<br/><br/>Play is fast and furious; most matches last but a few minutes. This is a simple, light-hearted, yet challenging game - ideal for family or social events, and for those rainy days when the lastest ringside seat at the arena isn't available. Whether you are a fan of the glittering world of pro wrestling, or a skeptic, you've just got to crawl into that ring at least once. And you can do so Wrasslin'.<br/><br/>Handicap, Tag Team and Battle Royale rules allow any number to play. Hold your own tournament to crown the champion of your own Weird Wrassling Federation.<br/><br/>",

You can use your actions to activate a location, move around, eliminate agents, search a location, get ammo and hack an area. However, the Source will generate energy depending on your actions. The more powerful the effects you activate, the more energy the system will receive. You can also upgrade your character depending on the dice and location you choose, making you more and more effective in 5 different segments of the game. You win the game by finding out which location has the Source and eliminating all agents from that location. But you will fail if you run out of health or if the Source's energy bar is fully charged.<br/><br/>But you can't just play alone! If you print out several identical boards and each get their own dice set and pencils, up to three of you can embark on a COOPERATIVE adventure.

It is incredibly quick and easy to pick up, but has a deep breadth of strategy driven by player interaction and perceptive card value.<br/><br/>There are 18 goods cards in the game, each with 3 of one good, 2 of another, and 1 of another. The goal of the game is to have the most Scudo (aka money) when the game ends. Each round all players will put one card from their hand in the center, and reveal them simultaneously. Then all players will participate in a Silent Auction, with the highest bidder receiving the most cards and so on down the chain. All players who received any cards pay their bid to the bank, and anyone who did not receive a card (lowest bidders) will pay half their bid rounded down. Everyone will then have the option to put a card they have won up for sale using their own Scudo as collateral for the sale price.<br/><br/>There are slight variations based on the number of players, such as keeping a secret card in your hand until game end to add to your goods. In the 2-4 player games there are 5 auction rounds, after which a payout phase begins. Players with the most of each good are paid an amount from bank, as well as 1 Scudo from each other player with any of the good. Once payout is complete, everyone pays back their loans (taken out for 10 and paid back for 15) and the game is over. The player with the most Scudo is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the dawn of a new year. The old king has just died childless, and the new succession must be decided before the end of this year. You are a local baron or countess with as good a claim as anyone else, so now is the time to grab the throne. Your peers understand only force, and your subjects understand only gold. Gather your men, pay your knights, and assert your claim. Everyone will recognize the strongest and richest as the rightful monarch.<br/><br/>In Melee you want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year. Money is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.<br/><br/>The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.<br/><br/>To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.<br/><br/>The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's 2020, and a disaster has occurred, damaging nuclear reactors around the country. There's no time to lose; your help is required, and you must lead an evacuation operation to get your people to safety. Rescue them in time!<br/><br/>The game board in Meltdown 2020 is composed of twelve tiles, each consisting of seven hexes. Seven nuclear reactors and two airfields are scattered amongst the landscape hexes that make up the remainder of the country. At the start of the game, your color-coded twenty people and three vehicles (car, bus, helicopter) are placed on their designated hexes. You need to get them to the airfields to save them, preferably before they absorb too much radiation. You can airlift a vehicle out of an airfield, too, to save the driver, but then you have fewer opportunities to save more people.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Radiation outburst &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die and place a radiation counter on the numbered reactor (or nowhere if an 8 is rolled).<br/>    Move buses &ndash; In player order, move a bus up to two spaces, with a maximum of four passengers at any one time. You can pick up and drop your color-coded passengers as you wish. Vehicles can't enter a reactor hex and can't end the turn in the same space as another player's vehicle (except the airfield, which holds any number of vehicles).<br/>    Radiation outburst &ndash; Same as above.<br/>    Move cars &ndash; Same movement rules, but cars can move up to three spaces while holding at most three passengers.<br/>    Radiation reparation &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die, then remove a radiation counter (if present) from the numbered reactor.<br/>    Move helicopters &ndash; Same movement rules, but helicopters can move up to four spaces while holding at most two passengers.<br/>    Radiation sickness &ndash; People next to a reactor absorb 1 Sievert radiation (1 Sv) for each counter on a reactor. People one space away absorb that many Sv minus one; people two spaces away absorb that many minus two; and so on. A person can absorb radiation from more than one reactor.<br/><br/><br/>When a person's token absorbs 1 Sv, lay it on its side to show that it's ill; when it absorbs 2 Sv, lay it on its back (very ill); a person absorbing 3 Sv or more dies and is removed. Radiation sickness is cumulative. People stay in their positions even after being evacuated. Vehicle drivers die only if they absorb 3 Sv or more from a single reactor in a single turn.<br/><br/>The start player position rotates each round. The game ends immediately when one reactor receives a fifth counter or a 16th counter is to be placed on the game board. The player who has rescued the most people wins. In case of a tie, the player with more healthy people wins, with subsequent ties being broken by the number of ill vs. very ill people.<br/><br/>",

Good fun for adults too.<br/><br/>Each trader has four camels, that they attempt to get through the desert to the market at Marrakesh. The market in Marrakesh has a lot of valuable items waiting and these provide the victory points for finding out the winner. Movement is controlled by drawing tiles from a bag. Tiles usually allow you to move your camel, but may have other effects such as Sandstorms, which change the board layout. Camels that arrive earlier at the market will be able to pick up the most valuable items. However, if you concentrate all your efforts to get one camel to market, you are likely to lose your back-markers to the sandstorms.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Up the River<br/><br/><br/>Ages 6 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rollway Station is a roll and write game inspired by the 18xx series of games. In these games players take on the role of an investor, trading stocks and shares in train companies in order to beat the competition and earn the most money. Rollway Station distils the experience into a short solo experience, using dice to add a layer of unpredictability.<br/><br/>The game is played over fifteen turns, in which the player will roll five dice and assign them to three different actions: buying shares, auctioning trains, and laying track. The values of the dice determine the options a player has. Every few turns there is an operating round where the companies run the best routes they can and earn money for the player based on the number of stops they make and the number of shares the player owns. The player also has access to Engineers who will help to lay additional track at the cost of money. The aim of the game is to earn the most money possible.<br/><br/>There are three different maps available with different starting layouts and special advanced rules. There is also a multiplayer variant in which all players play the standard solo game but using the same dice rolls, comparing their score at the end.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Powerful guilds within the empire are squabbling, positioning themselves for their own gain. If the Empire is to survive, it needs a strong leader - that means you! You must build a power base throughout the Empire by connecting with important guilds: the military, traders, priests, engineers, expansionists, and politicians and then claim the throne. Time is running out, though; others also struggle for the throne. You must form a network of support with powerful guilds and slander your opponents. Each connection gains the support of some guilds, and at the end of the game the player with the most support grasps the Galactic Throne. Take advantage of events that occur for further gain. Be careful, though, because each slander you receive reduces your support.<br/><br/>The name &quot;Carpe Astra&quot; was chosen after Jackson Pope asked the users of BGG to brainstorm a name for the game.<br/><br/>",

Now players can take command of armored formations of German, Italian, or British forces and re-fight key engagements in the North African desert from mid-1940 to late 1942. For Panzer veterans and newcomers alike, this stand-alone game requires no previous ownership of other games or modules in the Panzer series.<br/><br/>Contains rules for solo play, Italian, British and German units, and 32 scenarios (a list can be found below in the Community Wiki section).<br/><br/>The game system is designed for small unit actions from platoon to battalion-sized formations. Vehicles, towed guns, and aircraft are scaled at 1:1 with each 7/8&rdquo; double-sided counter representing a single unit. The 5/8&rdquo; double-sided leg unit counters are scaled at squads, half-squads, and sections, including their attached weapons. The game includes six double-sided geomorphic mapboards, 12 mapboards in total, plus diecut map terrain overlays to further customize your engagement maps. The game features a streamlined chit-based command system that moves the action along at a brisk pace. The game includes solitaire scenarios.<br/><br/>Panzer North Africa includes a Modular rules system with Basic, Advanced, and Optional rules section. Players may keep their battles as simple or as complex as desired. The game includes rules for:<br/><br/>    Vehicles - 11 unique hit locations, armor angles, and penetration charts for level, rising, and falling fire<br/>    Various ammunition types, e.g., AP, APCR, HEAT, HE<br/>    Sighting Effects, e.g., dust, sun blinding, and heat haze<br/>    Overwatch fire<br/>    Rate-of-fire<br/>    Indirect fire, both on and off map<br/>    Hand-to-hand combat<br/>    Close assault<br/>    Troop quality<br/>    Command control<br/>    Leaders<br/>    Unit cohesion<br/>    Morale<br/>    Smoke Effects<br/>    Mines<br/>    Obstruction<br/>    Bogging<br/>    Air-to-ground and anti-aircraft combat<br/><br/><br/>Included Panzer North Africa units:<br/>German: , 15cm sIG, 2.8cm sPzB 41 ATG, 2cm FlaK 38 AAG, 2cm FlaK Zgwk 1t, 3.7cm FlaK Zgwk 5t, 3.7cm PaK 36 ATG, 5cm PaK 38 ATG, 7.5cm leIG, 7.5cm PaK 40 ATG, 8.8cm FlaK 36 ATG/AAG, Marder II, Marder III PaK36(r), Panzerj&auml;ger I, PSW 221, PSW 221 sPzB 41, PSW 222, PSW 231, Pz IB, Pz IIC, Pz IIF, Pz IIIF, Pz IIIG, Pz IIIH, Pz IIIJ, Pz IIIJ Lang, Pz IVD, Pz IVE, Pz IVF1, Pz IVF2, Pz VIH Tiger I, SPW 250/1, SPW 250/10, SPW 250/11, SPW 251/1, SPW 251/10, SPW 251/2, SPW 251/9; Artillery, Crew Served Weapons, Leg Units, Prime Movers, Trucks<br/>German fliers: Bf 110C-4/B, Ju 81B-1<br/><br/>British: 2-Pdr Port&eacute;e, 6-Pdr Port&eacute;e, A9 Cruiser Mk I, A9 Cruiser Mk I CS, A10 Cruiser Mk II, A10 Cruiser Mk II CS, A13 Mk II Cruiser Mk IV, AEC Mk I, Crusader I, Crusader I CS, Crusader II, Crusader II CS, Crusader III &amp; OP, Daimler Mk I, Daimler Dingo Mk 1A, Deacon, Humber Mk II/III, Humber Mk II AA, Loyd Carrier, M3 Grant, Marmon-Herrington Mk II, Matilda II, Matilda II CS, Mk VIB, Mk VIB AA, Morris CS9, OQF 2-Pdr ATG, OQF 6-Pdr ATG, OQF 25-Pdr Gun/Howitzer, OQF 40mm Mk III AAG, Rolls-Royce, Sherman III, Suart I 'Honey', Universal Carrier, Valentine II, White Scout Car; Artillery, Crew Served Weapons, Leg Units, Trucks<br/>British fliers: Bristol Blenheim Mk IV, Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC<br/><br/>Italian: <br/>20/65 Truck, 47/32 Port&eacute;e, AB 41, Autocannone 20/65 AAG, Autocannone 90/53, Cannone 47/32 ATG, Cannone 65/17 IG, L3/35, L3/35 cc, L3/35 Lf, L6/40, M11/39, M13/40, M14/41, Semovente L40, Semovente M40/41; Artillery, Crew Served Weapons, Leg Units, Trucks<br/>Italian fliers: Breda BA.65, Fiat CR.42AS<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCOMPONENTS<br/>    8 double-sided 7/8&rdquo; x 5/8&rdquo; full-color counter sheets<br/>    6 double-sided 10&quot; x 27&quot; geomorphic mapboards with 1&quot; hexes (12 maps in total)<br/>    49 double-sided 5&rdquo; x 4&rdquo; Unit Data Cards<br/>    45 diecut Map Terrain Overlays<br/>    Modular full-color Rulebook with Basic &amp; Advanced Rules<br/>    Modular full-color Rulebook with Optional Rules and Solitaire Rules sections<br/>    2 Scenario Playbooks and Solitaire Scenario Playbook - 32 scenarios included<br/>    Table of Organization &amp; Equipment booklet<br/>    4 double-sided Player Aid Cards<br/>    4 ten-sided dice<br/>    3&quot; Box<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         GMT Complexity scale<br/><br/>         6 of 9<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         GMT Solitaire suitability<br/><br/>         6 of 9<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Time Scale<br/><br/>         15 second to 15 minutes per turn<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Map Scale<br/><br/>         100 meters per hex<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Unit Scale<br/><br/>         Individual tanks, vehicles, towed guns and aircraft; infantry squads, half-squads, and sections<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

The race is to a chest full of treasure, the very same chest that was offered at the truce to buy the dragon's favour. In the true spirit of the days gone by, the dragons now pit their wits against each other instead of the Draghanian folk...and today it seems you are a dragon...so you better be prepared!<br/><br/>Sneaky Ol' Dragons is a racing game full of surprises. A round starts with drafting the cards you are going to play that round. From the cards drafted you always play 2 cards on yourself and one card on each other player. So make sure when you draft you don't keep only good cards or you'll also help your opponents.<br/><br/>When all cards are assigned the cards will be executed one by one and the dragons will move on the racing track. Most cards just make your dragon go forward, but there are also many action cards available that influence the race.<br/><br/>Will you find a knight on your way? Only if you have enough courage left you will be able to beat him and continue your way. If you don't have the courage you'll have to run backward.<br/>Just maybe your dragon will stop to smell a flower and blow himself backward when he sneezes (dragon have hay fever!) while the other dragons in front of you jump forward to avoid burnt bottoms.<br/>Or will you encounter a novice wizard. You really can't predict what will happen when he fires off a spell with his wand and you are accidently in his way.<br/>And the race will have quite a lot of additional surprises waiting for you to discover.<br/><br/>The game also includes some variations.<br/>For example you can choose to hold the race in the enchanted forest on a &quot;safe&quot; forest path. Or you can hold the race in the mountains where you have to make sure you avoid the rockslides and jump over the dangerous holes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Roll the dice three times to acquire loads of rental property, open bold new businesses, try your luck with some risky investments, and perhaps even win the lottery! Can you turn five dice into cool cash?<br/><br/>Players roll dice three times, keeping whatever they want between rolls, then use the result to claim an Asset. Each Asset in the game requires different combinations of dice to claim.<br/><br/>There are eight neighborhoods, each with 2-3 Rental Properties to be claimed. Players claim Rental Properties by entering sums of qualifying dice. The values entered must increase from left to right, and the first player to claim all Rental Properties in a row gets to open a Business for a big bonus (which all other players immediately cross out). Most rows have room for two Businesses of decreasing value, while others only contain one, leading players to compete for them before they are gone. Once a player opens a third business, this signals the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players can also roll sequences of four to claim shares of the Mass Transit system, each of which can only be claimed by one player...larger sets pay out more money. And players can put the sum of one roll into Liquid Assets, which can then be multiplied by Stock Indexes (claimed with a sequence of five).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the great trading center of Damascus, via the Silk Road, ancient weaving techniques and motifs made their way to the famous textile houses of Venice. Master weavers used draw looms to create richly woven fabrics that became known as damasks. For centuries, these luxurious silks lavished the wardrobes and halls of mansions and palaces across Europe.<br/><br/>In Damask, players play the roles of these master weavers, trying to make the most money, while also gaining the favor of the Weavers' Guild. In more detail, the game includes 72 damask cards, with the damasks being two of six colors and one of four patterns; place 26 cubes (which come in six colors) at random on the spinning wheel, lay out a pattern and color card at random for each &quot;season&quot; that the game will be played (two in a short game, three in a normal one), then lay out six damask cards at random. Each player drafts a damask card, then you refill the display.<br/><br/>On a turn, either you take a damask card and place it in front of you, or you draft cubes from the spinning wheel by choosing a cube, then going clockwise or counter-clockwise until you hit the second cube of any color. Collect all of those cubes, placing them on damask cards as you wish and keeping the remainder in your overstock. Each damask card requires three cubes of one color and two of another to complete. After the required action, you can take one of two optional actions: Take all cubes of one color from an opponent's overstock (with them receiving a guild favor in compensation), or mount a damask by returning the five cubes on it and standing it in your personal holder. You earn 1 coin when mounting a damask and 1 additional coin for each color or pattern it has that matches the previous damask you mounted, i.e., at most 4 coins.<br/><br/>If a mounted damask also matches the season's color or pattern, you gain guild favors. Each guild favor has a color or pattern on it, and you can use them to mount damasks in place of missing cubes, replace damask cards available in the display, mount an additional damask, or avoid paying taxes for extraneous cubes left in your supply at the end of a season. Three guild favors are worth 1 coin at game's end, and in addition to coins earned during the game, you receive bonus coins at game's end for having all six colors or all four patterns among your mounted damasks. Whoever earns the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In May 1942, the Japanese sought to capture Port Moresby on the south coast of New Guinea and interrupt communications between the United States and Australia. Such a move, they hoped, would bring the Americans to battle.<br/><br/>The United States Navy needed no special inducement to fight its nation's enemies. Two American aircraft carriers met one small and two large Japanese carriers in the world's first battle between these powerful new warships. For the first time in naval history, a major battle was decided with no warship of either fleet even sighting an enemy ship directly. Aircraft were the new measure of naval power.<br/><br/>Coral Sea is the new introductory boxed game for the Second World War at Sea series. It covers this key battle and is intended as a gateway for players new to the world's most popular series of naval boardgames. The Japanese player must establish new bases in New Guinea and at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands; the American player must stop them. Forces are very closely balanced, and victory will rest with the player who can best make use of his or her resources.<br/><br/>The 22x17-inch operational map covers the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia as well as surrounding waters. Players maneuver their task forces on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.<br/><br/>The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crime Zoom is a series of investigation game for 1 and more players and for plays of about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Each investigation propels you into a different universe, but almost always on a crime scene.<br/><br/>This crime scene is spread over several cards to form a great illustration. To investigate, nothing more simple. Take a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you ? Flip the card over and find out what is this little paper on the bedside table.<br/><br/>An address ? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more ?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty ? What is his mobile ? What is the murder weapon ? And some subsidiary questions, of course.<br/><br/>Do not miss the culprit otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you will not reveal will decide you.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will come to tell all this in a story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.<br/><br/>Crime Zoom: Un &eacute;crivain mortel is the third case of the Crime Zoom family. It brings you in a British manor in 1929.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Will you finish all nine holes before the judges carry out their inspection?  If not will stunning scenery and design excellence be enough to beat off the opposition?<br/><br/>The Front Nine is a card game where players compete to build the best nine hole golf course with a balance of challenging par, scenery and facilities. The course cards depict each hole (pars 3, 4 and 5)and after paying the land and resource cost for trees, water and sand, they are laid on the table to depict the actual layout of the course. Each player develops a course from club house to 1st tee and from green to following tee etc. Each hole has a differing topography which constrains tee access and green exits which results in each player's course snaking across the table. Players must manage their finances carefully to enable their course to generate an income to ensure they can afford the ever increasing land costs and resources required to design and build each hole. The winner is the player whose course design best links back to the club house, has the best design, bunkers, woodland and water hazards and optimizes the use of the natural environment.<br/><br/>The Front Nine has direct player interaction and competition and an economic engine with an interesting spatial aspect where careful thought is needed for card purchase and placement.<br/><br/>",

The colleagues in the town office are desperately trying to keep everyone working, in the tax office the civil servants are trying to avoid giving money to anybody and the ecologists in the environmental office can hardly accept the job office's plans to build even more plants.<br/><br/>Of course everybody works as fast as possible, and the messengers are running for their life. That's no surprise, as all files have to be transported strictly through the official channels - all files?<br/><br/>Well, maybe one or another player manages to speed up some files through less official channels. A telephone call here, a special delivery there, and in cases of emergency the consumption of dextrose drops increases rapidly. Main thing is to put things to file (&quot;ad acta&quot;) at the right time. But be cautious: Delayed files might get into the shredder ...<br/><br/>Players lead the town hall, the tax- environment- or job-office and try to put their own dossiers to file at the time promising the highest score.<br/><br/>",

With increasingly serious global warming, the last area of ice on land at the North Pole is melting and all the polar bears are homeless. Players in this game will be a team formed by all nations to save them. This is a co-operative game for 1-4 players. Players will co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects, so that they can save all of the homeless polar bears.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a ship of a nation at the beginning of the game and he or she will be the captain of the ship. Different ships have different abilities, which can be improved during the game. Also, there are various cards of 4 main kinds in this game. Captains start with some of them and they can get or use them during the whole game. Rescue Polar Bears is played in turns. In one captain&rsquo;s turn, he has several actions to choose, such as moving, delivering and using cards. A captain has 3 action points per turn, which can be used to choose the actions mentioned above.<br/><br/>The homeless polar bears stand on ices, waiting the captain&rsquo;s rescue. The ices they stand on is melting with time elapsing, accidentally or step by step. When an ice is melt, the polar bears on it may drop down into the water and face their unlucky fate. So it&rsquo;s crucial for the captains to co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects before that tragedy.<br/><br/>The game can be ended by 3 ways: Saving all polar bears, using up time or having a polar bear fall into the water. You group will get scores, based on your performance, in either ending. Then, share your scores with your friends and families!<br/><br/>",

Defend the city against two hundred years of history!<br/><br/>Two to four players compete to defend the city walls to the best of their ability. They build the defences, hire soldiers and prepare the walls for four historic sieges.<br/><br/>The game is played during the course of four historical sieges. The game begins at the start of the Eighty-Years War, then the end of the Eighty-Years War, the French Expansion Wars and finally the Napoleonic era.<br/>During each era, players must collect resources, cards and plan their defences. Then players can build the defences they claimed, hire the soldiers they claimed and collect the services of the great churches of the city. Finally, at the end of each era, the siege starts against progressively stronger enemies.<br/><br/>The game offers diversity, requires strategic thinking and illustrates the participating factions of the sieges. Players can influence their opponent's actions by petitioning the churches and guide the attacking forces to their opponent's side or lure the more influential attackers to their own part of the walls in order to earn the most points.<br/><br/>",

The crews venture into the Rocky Mountains, exploring new hexes and drawing their discoveries in crayon. A player needs to manage their crew in trapping, hunting, dangers, movement, exploration, encounters, and more. While the beaver pelt is prized, further money can be made in exploration, discoveries, and finding routes to the Great Salt Lake and mapping the Colorado River.<br/><br/>Rocky Mountain Man is played either solitaire or against another player. If 2 players, both will play in a kind of simultaneous solitaire fashion.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, a turn comprising several phases. After a turn is conducted another begins, continuing until either the time limit is complete, the goal is achieved, or the Trading Post is built (if playing a campaign), or if all crews have been killed.<br/><br/>In a two-player game, each player goes as fast or as patiently as they prefer. Each player may be in a completely different part of a phase than another. One player may complete several more turns than another, depending on their speed.<br/><br/>The game can be played in timed sessions, by achievement of goals, or as a campaign.<br/><br/>Victory is based on the kind of play. In s two-player game Victory Points determine the win. In solitaire, achieving a goal will provide victory.<br/><br/>Rocky Mountain Man is based on the Source of the Nile (1978) game system. While there are many of the same game rules, some have been adjusted and others added. For players familiar with Source of the Nile, it is good to know the general pattern of that game, but do not assume a rule will be exactly the same.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

One of these three brothers is you, but the road to becoming a knight is extremely long!<br/><br/>In Knights, you have to travel the vast royal lands &mdash; crossing snowy mountains, haunted lakes, and dark forests &mdash; in search of bracelets of bravery.

You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles.

The card has both a &quot;chop&quot; value and a point value; using Axe cards, you roll dice to try to meet or exceed the &quot;chop&quot; value. When you do, you collect the tree (and the points). Flapjack cards can add to your roll, while blister cards can take away.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Campaigns of 1777 is a two-player, point to point wargame in which you command the Patriots or the British in the northern Colonies during 1777, the critical year in the American War for Independence. The tone for the British was set by leaders like Howe, Burgoyne, Cornwallis and Clinton while the Patriots marched with leaders like Washington, Greene, Arnold, Schuyler and Gates. The Battles fought in the northern Colonies include the Sieges of Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Stanwix, the battles of Brandywine, Germantown and Saratoga as well as the surrender of Burgoyne&rsquo;s army at Saratoga. The objective of the British player is to control certain spaces in order to fulfill their Victory Conditions. The Patriot player&rsquo;s objective is simply to prevent the British Victory. One inch on the map represents about 20 miles. Each Strength Point (SP) represents an understrength regiment of roughly 300 to 500 men. Each game turn represents one to three weeks.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #316<br/><br/>Note: 1777: Year of Decision was printed on the cover of the magazine but that was an error as the correct title is Campaigns of 1777 as shown on the map &amp; rules.<br/><br/>",

Both games use the same rules and share many game pieces, but each has a separate full size map.<br/><br/>2ND EDITION<br/>France &rsquo;40 2nd Edition is a major upgrade to the original game. The rules for Extended Movement, Combat, Advance After Combat, Breakthrough Combat, and Determined Defense have been updated so they are more in line with the recent games in the 19XX series (such as Stalingrad &rsquo;42 and Salerno &rsquo;43). A new scenario has been included designed by Mark Merritt that combines both maps.<br/><br/>In addition, many new units have been added and some old units modified to provide a more accurate order of battle for both Sickle Cut and Dynamo. A few minor cities, some roads, and a fortified hex were added to the Dynamo map.<br/><br/>And most importantly, both scenarios have been sent through the playtest cycle again to make sure they are better balanced than they were in the first edition.<br/><br/>This game has long been one of my favorites due to the exciting situation and short playing time. I&rsquo;m really pleased with this 2nd Edition and excited about the new features it has.<br/><br/>- Mark Simonitch<br/><br/>",

Despite ominous setbacks in Spain, Napoleonic France before 1812 was at the height of its expansion. The continental system was holding, if imperfectly. Monarchs friendly to the Empire (several, members of Napoleon&rsquo;s immediate family), ruled in every capital of the continent. Only Britain remained unbowed. By the end of 1813 the story had changed dramatically&hellip;<br/><br/>Napoleon&rsquo;s Eagles is a highly playable, action-packed card game set during the wars of 19th Century Europe. Two battles are featured: Borodino, the sanguinary clash before the gates of Moscow featured in Tolstoy&rsquo;s famous novel War and Peace, and Leipzig, the great &ldquo;Battle of Nations&rdquo; which marked the beginning of the end of the French Empire.<br/><br/>Two smaller battles are included (Shevardino and Lieberwolkwitz), as well as two campaign games that cover multiple days of battle: September 5th-7th, 1812 at Borodino and October 14th-18th, 1813 at Leipzig. The game includes rules for cavalry charges, artillery bombardment, army morale and army commanders. Emphasis is placed on the role of reserves and the judicious  commitment of infantry and cavalry.

Sheriff Croc Holliday is shuffling and hustling to find his next deputy. Looking to fill the vacancy, Croc has decided to put a pool of new recruits to work helping clean up some of Bandit Bluff's most wanted outlaws and will choose the most dedicated to be the new deputy! A little lying, some stealthy scheming, and the sense to know a good time to tell the truth might just help give a leg up over the rest of the herd. Who will out-law the other applicants to become the new deputy?<br/><br/>OutLawed! is a social game of bluffing, truth-telling, and out-thinking your opponents. Each player has an identical set of eleven outlaw cards imagined as animals escaped from the zoo somewhere in the wild, wild west. Over a series of rounds, players take turns playing a card face down and making a claim about which character card they played. Players are free to tell the truth about the character played or to make a bold-faced lie! After players have played cards and made their claims, all the characters are revealed and each player assesses whether or not they have met their outlaw's &quot;apprehend if&quot; condition. Players who were successful add their outlaws to their jail pile while all other players place the card back in their hand. Lionel Manesworth, for example, can be captured only if you tell the truth. The Vixen Twins get nabbed when others are convinced to play the same card during the round. Lawman Croc Holliday will catch anybody who isn't on the up and up.<br/><br/>Once a player fills up their jail, everyone compares their total reward value of apprehended cards to see who has earned the most rewards and gets to fill the vacant position as deputy of Bandit Bluff.<br/><br/>",

The small nation of Crumplehorn, scared of being left behind by its rivals, looks once again to Master Pennington B. Knickernacker to save the day.  And he&rsquo;s more than eager to help!  Reports say the eccentric businessman, an avid plane enthusiast, is secretly devoting his substantial financial resources to build a fleet of flying machines that surpasses all others.  But does he work for the glory of king and country?  Or to line his own pockets?  No one knows.<br/><br/>The schemes of past Knickernacker patriarchs are legendary, and Master Pennington is as peculiar as his predecessors.  But he keeps his cards close to the vest.  He has entrusted his grand designs to an exclusive group of industrialists known only as the Planecrafters.  Fiercely independent, these Planecrafters battle amongst themselves to create the most efficient, and profitable, plane-building operation.  And as the other saying goes, &ldquo;to the victor&hellip;goes the money and lots of fancy stuff.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Two to four players assume the roles of Planecrafters working for the Knickernacker estate.  Players compete to hire the best employees, assemble the most productive factory, and deliver planes to Master Pennington.  Maybe the planes they build aren&rsquo;t always the prettiest (or even symmetrical).  That&rsquo;s O.K.  Master Pennington doesn&rsquo;t mind.<br/><br/>Object of the Game:<br/>Players earn crowns, the native currency of Crumplehorn, primarily by selling planes.  Better planes sell for more crowns.  But what really makes a factory succeed is its workers.  Hiring employees for your factory will cost you crowns, but they're also a great investment.  Employees can speed the production of planes, help you find better parts, sabotage your opponents&rsquo; factories, or receive crowns from the bank.  At the end of the game, the player with the most crowns wins.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of 4 phases: <br/>  Hire: Spend your crowns to hire new employees to work in your factory.<br/>  Acquire: Gather new parts cards from one of the parts depots.<br/>  Flyer: Play your parts cards into your factory to build your flyer.<br/>  Buyer: Sell your plane to the buyer, Master Pennington.<br/><br/>",

A 1 is the strongest single card, but any pair beats a single with two 2s being the highest pair; Rs are the weakest cards.<br/><br/>After dealing out the deck, the starting player lays out a single card. The next player can pass (in which case they're out for the remainder of the round) or they can play one or two cards that rank higher than what was played; if they do, they take the previously played card(s) in hand. Each subsequent player can either pass or play a higher set of cards of cards, but a set that includes at most one card more than what was played most recently. Once all players pass, the cards in the center are removed from play, and whoever played most recently leads in the new round.<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and players score points for the cards they've collected.

        "description": "&quot;Point Blank&quot; is Lock 'n Load Publishing tactical World War 2 squad card wargame for 1-2 players pitted against each other in situational combat scenarios.<br/><br/>There is also a solo option as well as partnerships in teams of 2.<br/><br/>Each scenario presents the players with a unique situation involving squads of men, support weapons, leaders, and individual armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>This game pits the forces of the USA against Germany just after the landings in Normandy (June 1944) through October 1944. Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.<br/><br/>The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield, all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system, and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.<br/><br/>One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain, they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards, such as Recon, help players manage what terrain they occupy, but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.<br/> Combat in the game is similar to how combat is conducted in Lock n Load Tactical. 2 players can play a game in about an hour (depending on the scenario size), and if you cannot find an opponent, then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and exciting and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.<br/><br/>-description from publisher.<br/><br/>",

The game will also include 1 double-sided play mat, 24 specialty dice, 4 status counters, and a full-color rulebook. Completely compatible with all current Monsterpocalypse series.<br/><br/>--<br/>Kakaris Maelstrom adds:<br/>Voltron: Defender of the Universe is a standalone game in the Monsterpocalypse game world, targeted at gamers who were hoping to see more &quot;name brand&quot; monsters in the game. The Voltron box offers players an excellent (and complete) way to get into the game but with some characters you're likely already familiar with. The game is also fully compatiable with other Monsterpocalypse miniatures and maps, so you'll no doubt start to see Terra Kahn vs. Voltron and such.<br/><br/>Voltron (and his nemesis Lo-Tron) are morphers, a type of monster whose Alpha form is made up of a series of unit-sized pieces. Voltron is unique in that previous morpher's Alpha forms were made up of 4 units, whereas Voltron and Lo-Tron are both 5 units.  In addition, the battles are fought in space rather than on a traditional Monsterpocalypse city block.<br/><br/>Monsterpocalypse is a unexpectedly strategic CMG. Based in the world of kaiju (loosely translated from Japanese as &lsquo;giant monster&rsquo;), you'll control a monster and a legion of support units. You'll vie for control of critical board positions as you try to optimize your die pools. Then unleash your fury against your opponent's monster using a variety of power attacks, destroying a city block or two along the way.<br/><br/>",

Once you reach the bottom of it on your opponent's side, you take control of the village.<br/>     Gain Magic Force, which you can use to deal direct damage to an opponent's monster or draw a tile.<br/>     Earn gold coins<br/>     Seize the Power Stone pawn that gives you the advantage in case of a tie situation in the village.<br/><br/><br/>The order in which you choose to perform your actions will tremendously impact your strategy and the outcome of the game. Good Luck, CEO Pretender!<br/><br/>",

Each year (i.e. every round) players produce a yield, then deliver it to Cluny. Petrus Venerabilis uses the revenue from the yields to make life easier for the monks. The player who delivers the highest yield in a round gains the most Glory (victory points). However, he will get the least support (thalers) for further investments. Whoever delivers the lowest yield in a round receives the least Glory, but the most thalers for further investments. Consequently, players need to decide in each round whether they want to earn more thalers in order to invest in the development of their monastery, or to obtain more Glory in order to be the winner in the end.<br/><br/>But each player pursues his own plans, so every round brings a scramble for the best ranking on the street to Cluny, which might bring unpleasant surprises to some players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Star/White Eagle: The Russo-Polish War, 1920, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by David Williams, remastered and updated with this all-new edition. Celebrated by many as one of the finest and often sought-after game titles ever produced by Game Designers&rsquo; Workshop (GDW, 1979) on a fascinating, almost forgotten conflict that would determine the course of European history for the next twenty years or more.<br/><br/>To the West, the First World War was &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;. To the submerged nationalities of Eastern Europe, this war removed the obstacles to their political aspirations&ndash; Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917; Germany and Austria-Hungary were defeated in 1918. The disintegration of these empires sparked a chaotic period of struggles in Eastern Europe, as proponents of the old order, nationalists, and revolutionary socialists fought for supremacy. The conflict between the Poles and the Bolsheviks was the most important campaign in determining the borders of Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>Red Star/White Eagle is an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the 1920 conflict over the border areas of Eastern Europe. Game play is not for the faint of heart with open maneuvering creating a fast and fluid situation as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. Nearly any defensive line can be bypassed in the wide-open expanse of West Russia, forcing players to probe for vulnerabilities and seize the initiative. An exhaustive Order of Battle helps capture the key historically facets of the campaign including supply, cavalry charges, armored trains, loss of command, inter-front cooperation, rail nets, railroad reserve, flotillas and marines, border garrisons, numerous specialized units, and more.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the GDW 1979 release that honors the original game design. All aspects of the game are being enhanced, based on years of player experience and feedback. One example is adding initial set-up and reinforcement entry codes to all units to ease set-up and play. Play time can vary with three scenarios provided and the Campaign Game. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, the Campaign game is credited as allowing for up to three players (with two playing the Russian side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic design by David Williams. All components are upgraded to include a larger playing surface () and to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    two maps<br/>    two countersheets (344 5/8&rdquo; counters)<br/>    five player aid cards <br/>    one small deployment map<br/>    one rule book (28 pages)<br/><br/><br/>(from the publisher and back of the box)<br/><br/>",

People are coming to the town from the surrounding countryside in hopes of a better life. You have seen an opportunity to make your fame and fortune as the town is built.<br/><br/>In Builders of Blankenburg you are competing to construct the town and earn the most prestige while doing so. Each player takes on a persona which provides a unique benefit during the game. You begin the game with some basic resources and a small amount of silver. While all structures can earn you prestige, only building what the town's citizens demand will earn you the silver necessary to bid for and purchase more resources. Each turn consists of four phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Bidding (the primary means of gaining resources)<br/>    Building (constructing and occasionally demolishing)<br/>    Income (gaining silver for the structures you own)<br/>    Marketplace (an opportunity to buy plans and resources)<br/><br/><br/>The game introduces the citizen track, a growing group of town folk that allows all players to see which structures will earn them income. It also serves to signal the end of the game once the town is full. The town is split into four districts, each limited in size and awarding bonuses at the end of the game for anyone who controls more of a district than their opponents. If there are no other plots on which to build, the game also ends. Beware, while the citizens are known, the best laid plans can be ruined by events and visitors to the town. The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a simulation of real-world events. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position such as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to &quot;change history.&quot; No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

As the ultimatum was rejected, Austria-Hungary then declared war, marking the outbreak of the war.<br/><br/>While France and Russia immediately sided with Serbia, Germany joined the Austria-Hungary and started a surprise offensive in the west with the objective of quickly defeating the French, to then turn east and knock the Tzarist Russia out of the war.<br/><br/><br/>1914 is a game of World War I conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought by Germany on the Western Front in 1914. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War I.<br/><br/>The game is recommended for two or three players, but has a good solitaire suitability.<br/><br/>Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over a 64x86 cm multicolor mapboard, with more than 200 wooden components painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into two major sections which can be learned one at a time:<br/><br/>&bull; The Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.<br/>&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Surprise Attack, Retreat, Marne Offensive, British Fusiliers and more.<br/><br/>In 1914, 1 cm is approximately 27 km, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation, normally corps size with some divisions.<br/><br/>The game must be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent).<br/><br/>",

Each player fights over four categories &mdash; pure, dawn, spiral, and faith &mdash; that correspond to four colors; there are 12 cards with the value 1-3 in each category, and the cards are dealt so that each player has a mix of the same value cards in their deck, with some cards being secretly removed from play.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they present two cards from their hand face up. The opponent takes one of those cards and places it on their side of the board, adding to their power in that category; the other card is added to the score for that category at the end of the game. Players alternate turns until all of the cards have been distributed, then players see who has the most strength in each category. The winner of a category wins all the points in that category, and whoever collects the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Facing them on the beaches and in the hedgerows are some of the finest, and worst, formations in the German Army. Except for the near disaster on Omaha Beach, the landings go well.<br/><br/>Both sides begin the race to build up, and the Allies, with total command of the seas and skies, begin to pull ahead of the Germans as the month of June wears on. The Allies are under intense pressure to advance quickly, and not just for purely military reasons. Progress, however, is painfully slow. The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance. The Americans face weaker opposition, and despite taking the port of Cherbourg, they become bogged down in the endless maze of hedgerows.<br/><br/>Can the Germans buy enough time to form more reserves and stave off disaster? Can the Allies break the stalemate earlier than they actually did and perhaps win the war sooner? Play June 6th and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tranquility: The Ascent is a standalone sequel to Tranquility, with players working together to complete a grid of numbers as they scale the mountain.<br/><br/>Starting at the bottom of the mountain, players are tasked with completing a pyramid-shaped grid from the base to the summit. The base of the mountain is nine cards wide, the row above that is eight, and so on, with the top row consisting of a single summit card played once the rest of the grid is complete. On your turn, you must play a card onto the mountain or discard two cards. Cards are numbered between 1 and 12 and feature one of three different types of terrain. You may not play cards of the same terrain type next to one another, and you must also discard the difference between cards when played next to one another, e.g. placing a 7 next to a 4 would require you to discard three cards.<br/><br/>Rows are completed from left-to-right, and the numbers on the cards can ascend, descend, or remain the same. Rows can include any number barring this one restriction: the number on a terrain card must be equal to or higher than the number of the row, which means that a 1 can be played only in the first row whereas numbers 8-12 can be played on any row.<br/><br/>You can start a new row once at least the first two cards in the row below have been placed. Cards must always be &quot;supported&quot; by the two cards immediately below them, but they do not relate to the rows above or beneath in any way, i.e., the first row could start with a 10 while the next row starts with a 1.<br/><br/>If players complete the mountain and top it with a summit card, they win; if a player cannot take an action on their turn, everyone loses.<br/><br/>Tranquility: The Ascent includes three mini-expansion modules that can be added separately or together. &quot;The Green Path&quot; requires players to form a continuous path from the bottom to the top of the mountain. &quot;The Panorama&quot; module gives players specific number sequences to photograph. And finally, herd &quot;The Mountain Goats&quot; up to the summit where the grass is greener in the final module.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Captains of the Golden Age is set in a fictional East-Indies, in the golden age of trading and piracy, a time when pepper was worth more than gold!<br/><br/><br/>Four brightly coloured ships of different shapes and sizes lie anchored at Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove.<br/><br/>Their sails are lowered and their crews are resting while they gently rock back and forth on the waves. An albatross circles the shipwreck that lies broken on the shore. The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.<br/><br/>Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing. A parrot closely watches the whole scene from a chandelier above the table. The colourful captains don&rsquo;t seem to mind; they talk, rest, laugh and enjoy their beers.<br/><br/>Suddenly a small boy runs in, holding a sealed letter for the innkeeper. After reading the letter, the innkeeper glances at the other guests before walking over to the four captains. In a low whisper he says &ldquo;Friends, my contact from the Republic tells me that the price of pepper has just surpassed the price of gold&rdquo;, and turns back to his bar.<br/><br/>The mood changes as a storm on a summer day and the captains reach for their weapons as if struck by lightning. Cautiously, they slowly stand up and back off from the table, but as their greed gets the better of them, they start running to their brightly coloured ships&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Players start the game on smuggler's cove as one of these brightly coloured captains. Each captain owns a small ship with a tiny crew, one cannon and an empty cargo hold. Over the course of the game, each captain gathers resources to upgrade their ship at the shipyards of the Orient and the Republic or trades its cargo for valuable pepper in the Orient to get shares in the Trading Company and ensure their victory.<br/><br/>The amount of sails determines how far you move per turn. Crew is used for boarding other ships and plundering cargo. Cannons deal damage to other ships and the size of your cargo hold determines how much cargo you can load and carry.<br/><br/>Each player holds a hidden hand of cards from his own deck that can be used as temporary buffs to sail further, carry more cargo, or change the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Besides all this players can hire the notorious pirate at Smugglers Cove, to secretly ambush other captains.<br/><br/><br/>CotGA has 0% randomness, all skill. Its main mechanics are pick-up and deliver combined with hand-management and bluff. Players choose the length of the game by the size of their starter ships.<br/><br/>Trade cargo to upgrade your sails, crew, cannons or cargo holds. Attack other captains and board their ships to plunder cargo. Hire the notorious pirate to ambush competitors. Whatever your strategy, always keep one eye on the captain with pepper in his cargo hold.<br/><br/>",

The bombs started falling on the third day, and by the 19th day ninety-nine percent of the earth&rsquo;s population was dead or would be soon. Wars and conflicts had raged now and again for decades prior, populations rising up, and the global government seeking to quell the conflict and maintain the status quo. But in the most recent five year period, the conflicts escalated rapidly, and the world order began to come apart&mdash;leaders became scared and trigger fingers twitchy. No one knows who pressed the button first, and in the harsh realities of the world that followed, no one cared. What mattered was surviving and, if possible, rebuilding.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will draft and simultaneously play a card from their hand (&quot;pack&quot;) to indicate their action for the turn. This may be moving citizens or airships to explore or expand around the modular board, building structures, researching technology, initiating conflict, producing or gathering resources, and abating radiation. All of these things can earn you points in different ways. If you cannot store resources, they are left on the ground and are available for anyone present to use. Each card has an action and a lesser version of another action, so you're never stuck being entirely unable to do a particular thing, and you can also store cards for future.<br/><br/>Once all actions are complete, hands are passed to the next player and a new card is added to each one. If a &quot;Winter&quot; card is added, it is discarded and replaced, and the game timer advances. As the game timer advances, both expected events (spread of radiation, combat, feeding your citizens) and unexpected events may occur. When the Winter track reaches the end, the game is over, and points are scored.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Built long ago by an ancient evil, a lair lies at the heart of a dense forest not far from your village. Silent for generations, a noxious reek now wafts from the entrance and unsettling noises from within signal that something terrible is about to awaken. Do you dare venture into the depths and combat what monsters lurk inside?<br/><br/>Wakening Lair is a fully cooperative dungeon delve for 2-6 players who take on the roles of heroic adventurers banded together to defeat the monsters inhabiting a nearby lair. Play heroes from nine different character classes, each with unique abilities to help vanquish foes. Double-sided hero cards provide both male and female versions of each class for a total of 18 heroes from which to choose.<br/><br/>A variety of monsters, nine different monstrous terrors, and randomized boss monster awakening changes the game narrative each time you play. Six different room types can give you an attack bonus if your character type matches the room advantage. Weapons have character preferences and arming the right weapons can increase the power of your attacks. Use magical items for rerolls, healing, or other boosts for yourself or members of your party. Monsters have attack vulnerabilities and immunities, so you need to watch out and square off with the best suited members of your team!<br/><br/>Players take turns exploring rooms in Wakening Lair, defeating monsters, disarming traps, and gathering weapons and magic items. Equip those items to maximize your hero's abilities, all in preparation to defeat the slumbering monstrous terror that is bound to awaken at any moment. When it does, you need all your collective power to keep it from escaping the lair and destroying the land!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to strategically place tiles that deflect one of the four constantly moving dragons into your opponent's war tent while defending your own.<br/><br/>Colorful tiles, representing the forces of nature and the forces of man, interact with the dragons and influence their movement. Clever tile play creates an ever-changing landscape where opposite edges of the board connect.<br/><br/>As quickly as one marauding dragon is deflected another may threaten you. Players must balance both offense and defense in order to succeed.<br/><br/>The game play is quick and offers a different experience each time you sit down to play.<br/><br/>Dragons of Kir is a themed version of Darter, which won the 2006 Origins Vanguard<br/>Innovative Game Award at Gama, with some new tiles and different rules.<br/><br/>4 Player Wood Expansion Set adds rules for 3 and 4 players, wood dragons<br/> and war tents, and introduces the dragon token.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Darter<br/><br/><br/>",

Or will you join the ranks of the Drug Enforcement Administration, ready to slap the cuffs on the lawbreakers who would dare peddle their poison in your city?<br/><br/>In more detail, when playing a criminal faction, your goal is to produce Blue Sky, then sell the quantity needed to win before your opponents can. You can also win the game by taking out all of your opponents by using cards to bomb, shoot, or otherwise eliminate them. As the DEA agent, your goal is to seize the criminal factions' labs (by playing DEA Raid cards). You can also win the game by taking out all of your opponents, either by killing them or putting them in jail. In game terms, on their turn, a player takes two of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw a card.<br/>    Play a card from their hand.<br/>    Produce Blue Sky (dealer only).<br/>    Sell 1 Blue Sky on their faction board (dealer only).<br/><br/><br/>Be the one who knocks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The city of Gads Hill was founded in 1872, and it gained popularity through the first train robbery in Missouri committed by the James Younger gang. Today, there is hardly anything that remains of Gads Hill &mdash; only a sign at the place where the gang stopped the train gives evidence of the earlier existence of the city. How did Gads Hill look like 140 years ago? Where did the duels take place? Where was the hotel located where the Pinkerton detectives spent the night? Where had the Younger brothers been seen?<br/><br/>Take your part on reconstructing the city in Gads Hill 1874. The player who brings the most relevant information to this reconstruction project wins the game.<br/><br/>Gads Hill 1874 is based on the concept of the award-winning game Old Town.<br/><br/>",

I remember fondly two incidents:<br/><br/>In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;<br/><br/>In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!<br/><br/>The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.<br/><br/>",

They do this using the included deck of cards, 12 hidden realistic clue documents, and the Internet. Through a choose-your-own-adventure mechanism, players make decisions that influence the course of the game and lead to solving the case in the end. One by one, they enter different realistically designed locations and encounter the various suspects. Then they choose from 3 different ways to deal with the situation and receive points based on their decisions. Complex puzzles and escape room elements must be solved in order to progress further in the case.<br/><br/>Thematically, the game moves in the environment of the mafia in today's New york. As a member of the mafia you have to uncover the mole in your own ranks who caused the death of the eldest son of the godfather. It's up to you whether you act morally or use other methods to make your victims talk.<br/><br/>The game is closely intertwined with the real world, and players have to keep using traditional apps like Google Maps or Wikipedia to gather information. Writing emails, detiallated web pages and cell phone calls are also part of the immersive gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manaforge is a dice-rolling resource management game of crafting magical equipment for 2 to 4 players. Each player plays a wizard that specializes in creating magic items. These wizards cater to rich adventurers looking to trade their hard-won spoils for magical gear to make themselves more powerful. Each wizard owns a magic shop in which they display the fruits of their labor for gold-laden adventurers to come in and purchase. However, the adventurers' funds are finite. The wizards are competing to make their shops the most famous so that the adventurers will stop there first. And the best way to make a shop famous is to have the most impressive selection of useful and powerful magical gear. Whichever player's store obtains the most Prestige (victory points) will attract the customers and make the sales. May the craftiest wizard win!<br/><br/>Manaforge is played over nine rounds. At the beginning of each round, six cards representing the items that can be created that round are placed on the center board. Each player rolls their own handful of dice, the symbols on which represent the types of mana that they have to spend this round. Then in player order, each player spends that mana to construct one of the items in the center, taking its card and adding it to their collection. Some cards have an instantaneous effect and are then discarded, while other cards stay in play and grant the player benefits such as additional mana each turn or the ability to turn mana into Prestige. Beware, though: time is short! Each player may create only one item each round, so a player can only ever get nine cards in total.<br/><br/>A game of Manaforge takes an hour on average, depending on the number of players and their level of skill. Manaforge is intended for players ages 13 and up.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.<br/><br/>There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.<br/><br/>The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Murat&rsquo;s early gains were soon forfeit against the two advancing Austrian corps, but these two corps become separated by the Apennine Mountains.

One player commands the French army, taking the role of the returning Emperor Napoleon. The other player assumes both the roles of Wellington for the Anglo-Dutch forces, and Bl&uuml;cher for the Prussian forces, respectively.<br/><br/>Two months after returning to France, Napoleon had an army of 280,000 men and was mobilizing half as many again for the next two months, but he was set upon by Allied coalition armies of nearly 1,000,000 soldiers who were preparing to move against France. The British (110,000 men) and Prussians (120,000 men) were closest, in Belgium, and Napoleon struck first before their numbers could be combined against him. With speed and surprise, he invaded Belgium with fully 125,000 men in a bid to defeat each of these armies in turn before they could unite.<br/><br/>",

Millions of poor immigrants were arriving from Europe, and the population of cities on the East Coast swelled enormously. Endless plains and huge mountain ranges &ndash; thinly populated by Native Americans and rich in game, farmland and minerals - started luring large numbers of them. Settlers traveled in wagon trains, and established themselves ever further west until they finally reached California and the Pacific coast.<br/><br/>The players represent shrewd businessmen who benefit from passing wagon trains, continuously moving westward across the North American continent. It is divided into huge vertical tracts of land: New England, the East Coast, the Great Plains, the Midwest, the West and finally, California.<br/><br/><br/>",

Take on the roll of Bounty Hunter and gain a good reputation by hunting down &amp; capturing wanted bandits that plague a small town. Gather enough &quot;Rep&quot; points to work your way from Bounty Hunter all the way to Marshall. Better hurry, you are not the only one after the job!<br/><br/>The game includes over 100 game cards, 10 General Store cards &amp; 6 custom shooter dice. On each player's turn, they flip over a card to hunt for a wanted bandit.  Each bandit has a sequence of suit symbols (heart, diamond, spade &amp; club).  The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!<br/><br/>Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions. Higher ranks gain the ability to re-roll a certain number of skull dice.<br/><br/>Reward money can be traded in for General Store cards which can help you on your journey or played to hinder another player's. But choose wisely, spending your reward money will sacrifice the Rep you have gained for those bandits!<br/><br/>The game deck also contains event cards.  Some events award you with General Store cards by completing a rolling task. Other events may cause you to lose the bandits you are wrangling, or have your previously captured bandits escape from your jail!<br/><br/>Be the first player to be promoted to Marshall to win!<br/><br/>Think you have what it takes to win the west? Then roll into D6 Shooter! Yeee-haaw!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mint Condition Comics is a game where players compete for the best comic book collection. Players pick through piles, trade comics, and grow their collections wisely to score the most points!<br/><br/>The game is typically played for 3 rounds. Each round the comic book cards are shuffled to form a deck which is then used to create a market (the Comic Book Shop) and three piles of comics. The round ends when the deck and piles have run out. In their turn, players first determine to trade with either the Comic Book Shop or with another player, then they proceed to pick piles. Players look at the last pile and decide to keep it or move on to the next pile, adding a card to the pile they just looked at. Once a player picks a pile, the cards are immediately added to their collection and are used to form or expand comic book sets. At the end of the round, players score points based on how complete their sets are as well as any special bonuses for that round. After the third or final round, the player with the most total points wins!<br/><br/>Original design by John Retterer-Moore<br/>Development by Miguel Martinez and Aaron Burghard<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are other reference cards available for the other scale miniatures for extra cost. Players will have to supply their own miniatures and paint them. Some scenarios are available for purchase but the fun of the game is researching your own battles from the ACW period to recreate.<br/><br/>The first edition was published by Adventure Games in 1983. GDW released a 2nd edition with minor changes in 1988, with a scenario book &quot;To the Sound of the Guns&quot; the same year. Johnny Reb III, published by John Hill in 1996 is a very different game, with major changes to the scale (1&quot;:50 vs 1&quot;:40 yards, 1:30 vs 1:20 men, artillery batteries vs sections) and games mechanisms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the two-player strategy game Iro, you win by moving one of your pieces to the opponent's starting row, but the movement of each piece is dictated by the colors on top of it.<br/><br/>To set up, each player arranges six tiles in front of them; tiles are divided into 2x2 grids, with the four spaces of the grid each being in a different color: blue, red, green, and yellow. Arrange the tiles in a rectangle six spaces wide and four deep, with a space of each color in the row closest to you. Place 12 of your 16 pieces on the two rows closest to you, with the remaining pieces going into a reserve. Each piece shows three different colors or one color twice and a second color a single time. Once you've done this, reveal your set-up and place your tiles against the opponent's to create a board eight rows deep.<br/><br/>On a turn, you have two options:<br/><br/><br/>    Swap: Swap one of your pieces on the board for a piece in your reserve.<br/>    Move: Move one of your pieces on the board 1-3 spaces, with moves being orthogonal or diagonal. The spaces that you move on must match the colors of that piece, and you can land on a color only as many times as the number of times that color appears on the piece. You can move onto a space occupied by your own piece, but you can't end your move there. If you land on an opponent's piece, place that piece in the opponent's reserve and end your movement.<br/><br/><br/>If you land one of your pieces in the row closest to the opponent, you win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Bushido: Der Weg des Kriegers (the subtitle means &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot;) players take on the roles of Daimyo, feudal lords in medieval Japan, and compete to become the next shogun of the empire, who gets appointed by the emperor. And this truly has to be an honorable man.<br/><br/>Basically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.<br/><br/>The first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.<br/><br/>What needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:<br/><br/>Daimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.<br/><br/>Samurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.<br/><br/>Bushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.<br/><br/>Sensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.<br/><br/>The battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.<br/><br/>The tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.<br/><br/>",

Twenty-four scenarios are included. Guadalcanal is a stand-alone game; no other game from the series is required to play any of the 24 scenarios.<br/><br/>Guadalcanal introduces several types of Marine units: Marine rifle, parachute and Raider units plus scouts. The Marines usually have very good morale, and have excellent leadership and strong firepower. Where they&rsquo;re at time lacking is in support weapons: The Army gets first call on tanks and artillery, and the Marine versions on Guadalcanal are not up to the high quality of the riflemen.<br/><br/>Japan counters with Army and navy units of low firepower but fanatically high morale. Japanese artillery isn&rsquo;t very good, their handful of tanks will barely keep out rifle bullets, and there are few direct support weapons. The key to Japanese success will be to enter close combat with the Marines, where the Japanese warrior spirit can be used to full advantage.<br/><br/>Scenarios cover a wide variety of actions. The maps, thought by many to be the most beautiful in the Panzer Grenadier series, cover &ldquo;historical&rdquo; terrain rather than the generic coverage of most other games in the series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Discern the Secrets of Napoleon's Greatest Maneuvers. &quot;My God! Can these Frenchmen fly as well as fight?&quot; Jena! The name we give to one of the truly decisive campaigns in history; whereby the sons of the French Revolution under the command of emperor Napoleon Ier, meet and utterly destroy the heirs of Frederick the Great.<br/><br/>Five scenarios span the opening engagement at Saalfeld through the French victories of Jena and Auerst&aelig;dt. The Campaign Game opens with the French exiting the mountains of Franconia and Thuringia in a drive on Leipzig, hoping to knock the Saxons out of the opposing alliance. Their cavalry probes ahead. They have no idea where the Prussians are, or their Russian allies. At the same moment Brunswick directs three Prussian armies to drive across the supposed French line of communications. As flank guards skirmish, the veil is lifted. Both sides find their armies abreast one another heading in the opposite directions! It is a race to see which army can adapt to the new circumstance quickest. Napoleon has the edge, and it is what separates warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries from one another ... La Batallion Carre!<br/><br/>With Jena, like its predecessor L'Armeé du Nord: the Belgian Campaign 1815, players can come to full grip with the game in less than 12 pages of rules. The playing surface varies by scenario and can be one, two or three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps in size. Jena also includes 1 and 1/2 sheets of the most elegant, state-of-the-art playing pieces today.<br/><br/>",

The eccentric characters and tumultuous events of Oxford's history are brought to life in cards, featuring original illustrations, famous quotes and amusing written accounts.<br/><br/>In Dreaming Spires, players each build a college of Oxford University out of building tiles placed according to simple rules. Tiles display whole icons and half and quarter icons, which can be placed next to one another to complete whole ones. These icons represent the benefits of your college: Beauty, Academics, Status and Sociability.<br/><br/>Famous men and women of Oxford can be admitted to your college if it has the relevant benefits to attract them. These scholars can be used to increase the reputation of your college directly in their subjects but also indirectly using their unique special abilities.<br/><br/>Each turn there is an historical event pitting the colleges against one another in various activities for a reward. The winner becomes Chancellor and leads play for the following turn.<br/><br/>The college, which has the greatest reputation at the end of the game is the winner. This is calculated from the scoreboard with an innovative scoring system that leaves ample room for different strategies to succeed and keeps everyone in with a chance till the end!<br/><br/>",

To set up, choose one of three ready-to-play themed building sets, or put together a set of your own. Each set consists of five building cards, with associated building tiles for each card.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one square land tile in play. Each land tile is divided into a 2x2 grid, with one of five types of terrain in each grid space; a space might also hold a gear icon or one of four types of relics. Players also have three land tiles in hand, and five land tiles are displayed face up.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a land tile from your hand or the display, then add it to your community, which can be at most four tiles on each side. When the tile has a gear, you can either place an inhabitant from the reserve on this gear or place a building tile in your community...but each part of the building must be supported by a gear and all of these gears must be on the same type of terrain.<br/><br/>After you have a building in play, you gain the power of the building card and can use it once on each of your subsequent turns. Maybe you can place relic tokens for additional points, place additional inhabitants, junk an opponent's relics, or score for building large sections of a terrain or having more of a building than anyone else.<br/><br/>Once everyone has sixteen tiles in their community, players score for what they've built, earning points for blocks of terrain of at least seven spaces, surrounded energy sources (which are a special type of tile), inhabitants, relics, and buildings.<br/><br/>",

Answering that summons has thrust you into a world of magic and mystery: fairies, gargoyles, old myths, and legends are all very real. The Librarians are members of an ancient fellowship dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and the protection of the innocent from those who would misuse magic. Experts in history, languages, mathematics, and a dozen other disciplines, they lead lives of adventure - unraveling magical mysteries, battling ancient conspiracies, and saving the world every week. Twice before Friday.<br/><br/>The Librarians: Adventure Card Game based on the hit TV series and movies is a 1-4 player cooperative experience in which you and up to three friends each take the role of a Librarian or one of their allies.<br/><br/>Each character has strengths and weaknesses that lend themselves to a different playstyle and a deck of cards that represent the knowledge, skills, and capabilities you will need to survive. Between character selection and deck customization, the game lets you play your character your way.<br/><br/>The game is scenario-based. Each session will takes you on a new adventure, complete with unique challenges to overcome and goals to pursue. But your antagonists have their own agenda, which they pursue relentlessly pursue behind the scenes. You resolve actions by rolling unique dice that take into account your character&rsquo;s skill and the difficulty of the action. Success requires that you make thoughtful choices: Draw cards or gain the resources needed to play them? Thwart your enemies or advance your own goals?<br/><br/>The choice is yours!<br/><br/>Although other characters will be included as playable heroes in future expansions, the following four heroes are included in this base set: Colonel Eve Baird (Guardian and Team Leader), Cassandra Cillian (Librarian, Doomed by Her Gift), Ezekiel Jones (Librarian, In it for the Challenge), and Jacob Stone (Librarian, Blue-Collar Art Historian).

The basic game is played as follows:<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the first player places the neutral Moeraki-ball on one of the nine central intersections of the board. After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.<br/><br/>The game can be won in one of four ways:<br/>1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.<br/>2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.<br/>3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.<br/>4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.<br/><br/>The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.<br/><br/>In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior). Once during the game, a player may place the Tane on the board instead of a tribal marker. When he does so, all he chooses a direction. Any fields between the Tane and the edge in that direction cannot be claimed; any markers already present are removed.<br/><br/>",

As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required. Knowledge of traditional American national symbols is helpful, but that information is also provided in the app if you need it.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>",

You need to plant your fields strategically with cacao, coffee, peanuts, and vanilla, then use those beans efficiently to make the best confectionaries around! Using every resource is necessary to beat out your competition.<br/><br/>In Dulce, each player has their own deck with beans on one side of each card and a factory on the other, as well as their own field in which to plant. Every round, one player draws a card and the others search their deck for the same card, then everyone chooses their action simultaneously: plant, harvest, or build a new factory. Planting gains you new cacao, coffee, peanut, and vanilla resources, and harvesting allows you to use those resources in your factories.<br/><br/>Each confectionary made in your factories earns you one point, and at the end of twenty rounds, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Research new abilities and how to use mystic artifacts to aid you along the way. Try to uncover what terrible force is behind the darkness creeping into the city, before the entirety of London is consumed by it!<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>The Shadow Over Westminster is unlike any co-op deck builder you've ever experienced. Varying card backs allow for vastly improved strategic planning - knowing what card type is coming up next allows you and your fellow Agents to make more informed decisions.<br/><br/>Players are free to move around the board and tackle challenges however they see fit, but a lack of co-ordination will allow the darkness to creep over the city, and the Cataclysm to be at its strongest.<br/><br/>The Agents<br/>Players take on the role of an Agent. Play as the media-savvy Shadow, the noble Knight Templar, the mysterious Watcher, or the enigmatic Outsider, and employ your unique gifts to aid your fellow Agents.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm<br/>The goal in The Shadow Over Westminster is to save the city (and the world) from the oncoming Cataclysm. At the start, the Agents don't know what the Cataclysm could be, only that it's coming - but as the game progresses, the team can use their research, investigation, and special talents to uncover what doom approaches.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm is chosen randomly at the start of the game and placed face down until the Agents have done enough research and investigation to uncover the threat. Uncovering the Cataclysm is only half the battle - once uncovered, the Agents must overcome the Cataclysm's unique effect and drive the evil back out of this world, using the research, investigation, artifact, and talisman cards they've collected throughout the game.<br/><br/>With over a dozen cataclysms, who knows what the more malicious denizens of London are up to in the shadows.<br/><br/>Scales for 1-4 players to enjoy in 60-90 minutes.<br/><br/>",

With an injunction in place to keep the guests from leaving, Moss has only a short window of opportunity to investigate and question the suspects. Can he eliminate the innocent and arrest the culprit before the injunction expires?<br/><br/>In this game, you get to play as Inspector Moss, exploring a 25-room house consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.<br/><br/>On each turn, you roll 7 white dice and 1 colored &quot;time&quot; die up to 3 times. You may then use up to 6 of the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). After performing any actions, you must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.<br/><br/>There are 10 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 9 of them, you must arrest the remaining suspect and escort him/her to the waiting police car. If you can do all of this before time runs out, you win the game.<br/><br/>",

The moonlight casts a pale light over the battleground as you compete with your team, earn experience, gain skills, and battle rival ninja clans in this league/campaign style game.<br/><br/>Featuring world class Chibi style sculpts from the world famous Soda Pop Miniatures team (makers of Super Dungeon Explore), expect fun and whimsical game play to be married with fantastic and unique style and fun.<br/><br/>Ninja All Stars allows for 2 to 4 players to take control of a team of ninja (this may be a pre-rolled team or a team purchased with points) and battle over objectives.  Each Ninja Clan is drawn from a different element (6 in total), with each element providing different bonuses in-game.  As well, the game's dice mechanic is based on the element system, using a rock-paper-scissors type of dice elimination to determine the outcome of various aspects such as combat, searching, and special abilities.  It is important to note that combat is not a simple &quot;I rolled more swords than your shields&quot;; the elimination of dice will give the winner a choice of different combat results based on the remaining dice.  The interesting point here is, ninja don't die in this game-rather,they are knocked out and placed in their team's dojo, where they rest and recover and may eventually be brought back onto the board.  The rules allow for one-off scenario games as well as league play with guidelines on ninja advancement, meaning that players can develop their ninja over many games.<br/><br/>The game comes complete with enough miniatures to allow for 4 teams, each of a different element, the game board, and numerous tokens for game effects.<br/><br/>",

Through social grooming, these apes remove dirt, insects, and debris from the difficult-to-reach and difficult-to-see places of each other&rsquo;s fur. Reciprocation is expected and awarded in this kind of monkey business! The player who acquires the most diverse and exotic collection of groomed goods will earn the respect of their fellow primates and be awarded the golden banana of victory.<br/><br/>In Gussy Gorillas, players start out with a personal deck of face-down cards. Without looking at the card(s) in their hand, players simultaneously trade or keep their hand, one or two cards at a time, to form a personal collection. Once all cards have been traded or kept, players tally their collections and the highest score wins &mdash; but pairs can cancel out and special cards are not always helpful, so trade carefully!<br/><br/>Similar to the popular game Hanabi, in Gussy Gorillas players hold their cards facing away from themselves...but instead of being a co-operative memory game, this is a competitive negotiation and bluffing game. Things get even more interesting once players realize that every card can either be very good or very bad for one's collection, depending on the context. You'll have to convince your opponents to keep bad cards for themselves and give great cards to you if you want to swing away with the win...<br/><br/>&mdash;Description from the Publisher<br/><br/>",

A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.<br/><br/>Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience. Game time is 2-4 hours for both days of Shiloh.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunder At Dawn: The Battle of Wilson's Creek (August 10, 1861) is the 5th title of the Revolution Games American Civil War Series using the Blind Swords Tactical level system.<br/><br/>On August 10th, 1861 the first major battle of the Trans-Mississippi theater, and the second major battle of the American Civil War, was fought near Springfield, Missouri. Three rather green forces (one Union army and two Rebel forces) met at Wilson&rsquo;s Creek and clashed on &ldquo;Bloody Hill&quot;. Little did they know how bloody the war would be.<br/><br/>The commanders were also new to this level of fighting and two novice errors shaped the historic battle. The Union commander, General Lyon, detailed his battle plan to his commanders and then was talked into dividing his smaller force in two at the last minute. The Rebels had dissention amongst Generals McCulloch and Price over whether they should attack immediately or not. After cancelling an advance to attack the next morning (August 10th), they forgot to repost pickets when they returned to their camps. This mistake left them open to the Union surprise attack the next morning. After great initial success, the Union forces ran low on ammunition, lost General Lyon and ended up leaving the field. It didn&rsquo;t have to be that way as the Union forces had a very good chance of conducting a successful &ldquo;spoiling&rdquo; attack. The &ldquo;What If&rdquo; scenario gives the Union player a chance to adjust his strategy and win the battle.<br/><br/>The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of the battle that can be completed in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system, which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOWs&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Components:<br/>-22 x 34 inch Map<br/>-176 x 5/8 inch Counters<br/>-Full Color Exclusive Rulebook<br/>-Series Rulebook (Black and White)<br/>-5 Player Aids<br/>-Box or ziploc bag<br/>-2 Dice (Boxed Version)<br/><br/>",

(キャッチー！) is a tug-of-war-like trick-taking game for two players.<br/><br/>In Catchy! you will try to allure Alex, a fickle cat, and have him come into your arms by showing him what he likes. But be careful, as he is so much whimsical that he changes his mind so often; the thing he loved to play with may not be his kind anymore a minute after!<br/><br/><br/>    In this game, Alex is represented in a tile, and it is two-sided; one side is red colored and the other is blue colored.<br/><br/><br/>In Catchy! players play ordinary trick-taking game in which the latter player must follow the suit, if possible. Two players take turn to play one card for one trick, and if both two players play &ldquo;odd&rdquo; numbers, Alex flips to the other side; red side being up, it flips to the blue, and vice versa.<br/>Then, he moves towards one of the players by one step according to the rule following: if its red side is up, he moves to the player who took the trick, and if its blue side is up, he moves to the other, s/he who did not take the trick.<br/>After players&rsquo; hands have been exhausted, or Alex has moved into one players field, arms, one round ends and the player who has Alex closer to him/her scores points.<br/>Rounds are played on and on until one player gains 7 points, then s/he who has 7 points wins the game.<br/><br/>As you may see, in this game, even in one round, you sometimes have to become eager to take tricks and sometimes you do not. This tricky twist is the core of Catchy!<br/><br/>This game is small (only 17 cards used), but needing its players to think strategically and concentrate on making most of their hand.<br/>This portable game surely takes you to a cute but strategical &ldquo;catchy&rdquo; world anytime, anywhere, and anywhere you are with.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dice don't have legs, but in Dice Run they'll scamper as quickly as they can to get ahead of their fellow cubic cross-country runners. If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.<br/><br/>Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.<br/><br/>A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.<br/><br/>After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!<br/><br/>",

A lot has changed since then, but we believe we can keep the same magical feeling, providing a faster and more adrenaline-filled game experience.<br/><br/>Warstones is a tactical army-building game, with a dexterity mechanism at its core. Choose your units, deploy them on the battlefield, then flick... eh... lead them! Control key areas to gain victory points, defeat enemy units or just push away the strongest. Dexterity is just one of the countless features of Warstones. Army building provides a lot of options and flexibility, so even if you don't believe in your flicking skills, don't worry! There are different kind of armies, and plenty of room for customization; you will find the army that works for you!<br/><br/>&quot;Low profile, don't lose control!&quot; thought Bramhun while crossing an unknown tavern's door. Wildlife sought shelter from an unnatural cold in the southernmost regions of the kingdom that year. That's why many dwarven hunters like him found themselves lost in such hostile lands.<br/><br/>&quot;Adapt to the situation, even if it means compromising with the enemy.&quot; Facing the long journey back to home would have put himself and that big load of skin in danger. Mokgul, an orc all covered in blood and tannin, suddenly turned his head and sized up the unwelcome guest, like many other inn patrons did. He closed the door. The curious barrel on his back couldn't be ignored. A complex, twisted rod made of wood and iron &mdash; a ridiculous dwarven hunting tool, indeed.<br/><br/>Brahmun spoke to the orc behind an heavy wooden counter. &quot;Where's the tanner?&quot; The innkeeper pointed at a table by the fireplace with a nod. The light of the fire shone off Mokgul's face. On his table, there was a pelt with a map carved into it. You might have seen three rudimentary towers lying on it, and many rounded and flat stones, painted with stylized warriors, too.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want from me, dwarf?&quot; said Mokgul, while he was just staring at the table.<br/><br/>&quot;I don't like doing business with you just as much as you don't like doing business with me, but I got a considerable amount of skins, precious as...gold.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Sure, but I think I could smash your dwarven head and take your stuff instead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Be my guest, but I'm not that naive. They are hidden far away from here, mate. If I die, you won't find them, ever, and you will lose your share.&quot;<br/><br/>Mokgul suddenly stood up, then raised his voice to get attention: &quot;And what if me and my mates force you to tell us where all your goods are, in exchange for the opportunity to see sunrise tomorrow and to walk out of here on your two feet?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fine! Here's the deal: I'm gonna give you all my goods and all my money, but you have to defeat me. On the other hand, if I win, you will pay me twice their value!&quot;<br/><br/>After that statement everyone in the room gathered round the table yelling &quot;Warstones! Warstones!&quot; Bramhun came up to the table and collected a handful of painted stones. With a quick movement of his fingers he flicked a stone right behind one of the towers: The war of stones had just begun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Envelopes of Cash is a Euro board game with a very American theme: college football recruiting.  Players square off as rival college programs, doing their best to attract the most valuable high schoolers to join their college teams.<br/><br/>Game play is driven by a card draft, in which players acquire the potential to hire new personnel, build new facilities, strengthen their program's culture, or boost their fundraising prowess, but to actually put those cards into play, the need to generate income via careful selection of 6 different colored dice, which are rolled at the start of each turn.  Those dice generate the most valuable currency in the game -- Envelopes of Cash -- which are used to lure the athletes to your program.  To succeed, you need to balance the benefits of your cards, which make recruiting easier, with the nuts and bolts of actually getting out there and recruiting, by sending lots of recruiting mail, traveling to visit the athletes in their home states, and most importantly, slipping them those valuable tokens of your affection in little colored envelopes.<br/><br/>You only have 12 months to gather as many different recruits across a variety of football positions (like QB, LB, etc.), so the tension between less income now vs. more income later plays a role in shaping your strategy.  Should you jump out to a quick start and get the best recruits before your opponents, or should you build up a big stash of envelopes of cash and have a major blow out month towards the end of the year.  Or can you build a strategy more around your personnel and culture, turning their special abilities into a victory point engine and leave the grubby business of bribes to others?<br/><br/>Envelopes of Cash lets you be the head coach of a major football program, working closely with your bag men to make sure you come out on top in the race for the most recruiting points.  With 120 different cards and a different mix of recruits across regions each time, the game offers high replay value, especially since there are many different ways to build a successful program that churns out points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After discussion amongst themselves, the other players must decide which way to take, and which of their special powers to use to move along the track; if they cannot agree, then they must vote.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the Sidibaba and his friends, the Leader of the thieves (the game moderator) knows that Sidibaba and his friends are in his cave and are after his treasure. Sidibaba and his friends win if they manage to get the treasure and get out of the cave before their oil lamps go out. The leader of the thieves wins if Sidibaba and his friends don't get out of the caves in time, or when he manages to catch Sidibaba and his friends when they don't have a spare oil lamp left. As a result, each camp has its own objectives and its own mode of operation.<br/><br/>Sidibaba is a real-time game in which players have a limited amount of time to negotiate or else they'll watch their torches go out one by one, eventually leaving them lost in the dark.<br/><br/>Sidibaba was originally designed as Theseus, with the players trying to outwit the Minotaur in its maze.<br/><br/>",

Faction Zeta will utilize the unique skills of each member to fight for final victory over the Faza.<br/><br/>As you move across the board, you will be combating enemy drones and recruiting Rebel Faza to attack each mothership.

As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required. Knowledge of traditional American national symbols is helpful, but that information is also provided in the app if you need it.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>",

How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?<br/><br/>The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.<br/><br/>The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.<br/><br/>The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.  Players add the values of their paintings to their cash on hand.  The player with the largest total wins.<br/><br/>",

In Ivion, your deck IS your character, and you build it from a variety of classes and specializations. Each character type has numerous cards from which to choose, along with wildly different playstyles. Mix and match them to create your own, unique character!<br/><br/>Upon the field of battle, crush your opponent with various strikes, stabs, slashes, spells, and other mayhem at your disposal. Be careful, though, as they have numerous ways to block, dodge, parry, fizzle, and disrupt your assault. Only one can be the victor, and the battle will be bloody!<br/><br/>In Ivion: The Hound and The Hare, you can battle as the wise and faithful Saint or the deceptive and cunning Illusionist. They can battle one another or any other character in the Ivion line of games.<br/><br/>",

The trick-taking phase follows the standard rules of must-follow suit, with the highest trump card winning the trick, and if none were played, the highest card of the lead suit wins the trick.  The players keep tricks they win in a 2x5 grid marked by tokens.<br/><br/>After each round, players determine who earns points for each available mission.  There are 5 basic missions each game, and they can be achieved once each hand.  Additionally, there will be a selection of &quot;emergency&quot; missions that can only be completed once each game.<br/><br/>The game ends after 5 rounds, with each basic mission being worth 5 points and the emergency missions being worth 2 to 4 points.

During your journey, you need to achieve your scenario objective, then return to the king's castle in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Each turn starts with bidding to see who will first use magic and who will first move on the board. During the magic phase, players take turns trying to harm opponents with nasty magic tricks or enhance their own character's abilities. Movement takes place on a game board divided into three continents, and the two inner continents can be moved via magic stones to hinder an opponent's movement or allow a player access to blocked areas. During the journey, players need to combat opposing figures, destroy monsters, find treasures that might boost character abilities, and gain or invade resource pools to fuel a player's economy.<br/><br/>Realm of Wonder mixes area control, dice rolling, and bluffing. The game is beautifully drawn with a set of miniature figures for each character. Random elements can be minimized with an alternative rule set that makes this a great game for both younger people above 9 and hardcore gamers alike. Playing time with six players should be less than an hour.<br/><br/>",

Each player's cards and shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.<br/><br/>In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many words and phrases on the cards as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!<br/><br/>Time's Up!

Wooden blocks are used for fog of war.  This campaign involves point to point land and water zone movement.  Group movement can only be done with commanders and some commanders can move faster than others. The British win by capturing Washington or reducing his army and holding New York City at the end of the game.  The Americans win by avoiding British victory or reducing the British army to less than 20 strength points.  Quick playing, deep strategy, and battles that show the weakness of militia facing trained professionals.<br/><br/>The New York 1776 campaign of the American Revolution  pitted a newly formed American army, comprised of Continentals and militia, facing a large, highly disciplined British army that included a significant number of Hessian soldiers. This campaign involved the largest number of troops of the war. An inexperienced army faced a very experienced one. It unfolded with an intricate set of maneuvers around New York City and its waterways involving a large British fleet executing numerous amphibious landings in an effort to trap the Colonials. It was truly the best opportunity the British had for capturing Washington and America&rsquo;s entire army. Historically, the Americans just barely escaped to live and fight another day. Can you, as the British player, defeat the American army and end their revolution in its infancy? Or as the American player can you, like Washington, defend your country while avoiding disaster?  The decisions are yours&hellip;<br/><br/>",

Gather strawberries, figs, bananas, pineapples and watermelons before Grandma comes back to scold you and do your best to impress the tanuki family.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, the player holding the Polo card, draws fruit cards and distribute them among the different carts. During this time and at any time, players can race to grab one cart and display its fruits on their five tables. Each table gives a different value to the fruits it holds, ranging from one to five points. Each table can only hold one kind of fruit and players cannot have two tables holding the same fruits. And beware, some fruits are rarer than others!<br/><br/>The game ends when the Grandma card is drawn, after which players finish the round. Players count their points, taking into account the special powers displayed on some of the fruit cards and the bonuses given by the Polo card and the Grandma card.<br/><br/>An advanced variant with additional carts and a solo mode with virtual player are included.<br/><br/>",

Every time you defeat a monster, you go up a level. The first player to level 10 wins.<br/><br/>This is a core set for Steve Jackson's Munchkin game, based on the hit webcomic by Ethan Nicolle (age 29) and his brother Malachai (age 6). It can be combined with other games in the series.<br/><br/>The game doesn't have any new mechanics and should be easy to learn for anyone who's played one of the other Munchkin games. Hirelings are included and are called allies. There are four classes: Cop, Man, Soldier, and Warrior (which is identical to the class of the same name in fantasy Munchkin). This set also has powers; there are seven of them with two cards each, for a total of 14 cards. The mechanics of powers are exactly the same as in the other Munchkin sets that have them.<br/><br/>Several Santa monsters are included, as well as two new monster categories, Alien and Robot, which currently aren't recognized in any of the other Munchkin games.<br/><br/>It's not necessary to know anything about the Axe Cop webcomic in order to enjoy this set.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Of the many mah jongg (mah jong) variants extant today, American mah jongg is unique. The single most popular variant in North America, it's also the least well documented. Prior to the publication of this book (A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg, Elaine Sanberg, 2010), you could not find anything about the American game in bookstores. Instead what you would have found is descriptions of various modern regional variants, the classic Chinese rules (still played today in Europe), or the rules played in  Australia or the United Kingdom. Modern American rules, and especially strategy tips, were simply nowhere to be found (Sandberg, Tuttle Publishing, 2011).<br/><br/>The American game of Mah Jongg differs in more than the spelling with two &quot;G&quot;s on the end. In the 1920s, when the Chinese game hit the United States, Babcock's rules and R.F. Foster's rules were largely discarded. Each group developed their own house rules and special hands.<br/><br/>In 1937 the National Mah Jongg league standardized and streamlined the scoring system. Elements like Jokers and the Charleston which were part of various card games found their way into the game. Each year a Scoring Card of hands and rule changes is released. In 1999 the American Mah Jongg Association published its own scoring card each year and sponsors cruises and special events.<br/><br/>American Mah Jongg is a rummylike game for four players. Players try to capture pungs, kongs, quintets, and sixtets from discards and complete hands listed in a scoring card released by one of the two Mah Jongg leagues.<br/><br/>",

Though a Corsair enters the Expanse with but a single old ship and a handful of loyal crew, they may eventually command up to three customized ships, a trio of cargo shuttles, and more than a dozen squads of seasoned soldiers.

Hideous invaders like Anthrax, Pertussis, Cholera, and the Black Death are running rampant inside the country&rsquo;s borders, attempting to murder innocents. The only hope for these helpless villagers is that the Apothecary Healers, their god-like saviors, will save them. Led by ancient warriors Penicillin, Cipro, and Tetracycline, the Apothecary Healers rush into battle, destroying wave after wave of attacker just in the knick of time. Yet it&rsquo;s not that simple: the Apothecary Healers have different specialties, and must be deployed in a sophisticated manner. And worse: the invaders learn quickly how to resist and evade the Apothecary powers, and some become even stronger when they are struck down.<br/><br/>Healing Blade: Defenders of Soma&nbsp;immerses you in a fantasy realm that represents the real world struggle against infectious disease and bacterial resistance. It&rsquo;s a two player card game wherein one player attacks with bacteria, and the other defends with antibiotics. The game requires no prior knowledge of medicine, yet accurately reflects the current state of actual antibiotic use against the most common and most feared bacterial infections. Designed in a collaboration between hardcore gamers and practicing physicians, Defenders of Soma offers a complex strategic gameplay experience, while also increasing familiarity with today&rsquo;s medical quandries in the face of waning antibiotic effectiveness.<br/><br/>",

Growing up near Leeds, you heard all the rumours: leeches, witches, cannibals, strange gatherings in the woods, and dead people on the radio. &quot;You're local, you won't stick out.&quot; Only, the last guy they sent didn't report back. Police are unlikely to be much help: dozens of people disappear every year, adults and kids, and no one says boo. Happened to your cousin when you were a child.<br/>Driving into town, thinking about lunch, her voice comes on the radio to read the station ID: &quot;You're listening to WXXT.

P. Lovecraft and other authors, re-imagined as noir detective stories.

The ultimate goal is to score five &quot;puzzle&quot; clue cards in order to piece together the big picture before running out of time or mental stability.

You are one of the many wizards who have come to claim the stone, but gaining control of the stone won&rsquo;t be an easy task.<br/><br/>This free-for-all magical showdown pits 2-6 wizards against each other over a series of rounds. Each round is a magical duel between all the wizards, which includes six different types of magic: Blades, Fireball, Frost Wave, Lightning, Quake and Metamagic. These magic types will aid wizards in their duel.<br/><br/>Players take turns casting an initial spell that will set the rule for the round, set the rank other players must beat, and earn them a potential Shard (VP). Players then take turns playing cards of equal or higher rank from their hands to the table; if they match the spell suit, they place a Shard on that card. The round ends when a player can no longer play a valid card from their hand. The player that could not play a card returns any Shards on their played cards back to the center, then takes card damage equal to the amount of Shards that are still on cards. All other players then take the Shards on cards they played to their Victory Pool. The player who played the last card gets a bonus Shard.<br/><br/>When a player takes damage, they draw cards from the deck equal to the amount of damage and place them face down in front of them. If they ever accumulate 5+ damage, they immediately discard their hand and a Shard, then take their damage cards in to their hand.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has enough Shards. 15 in a two-player game, 12 for three or four players, and 10 for five or six.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "None of a Kind, a.k.a. Schwarz Rot Gelb, is a quick-playing pattern-building game &mdash; well, anti-pattern-building really. The game includes 80 color cards and 30 point cards (valued -4 to 10); each color card has 1-4 words on it, with the words being one of five colors but printed in one of the remaining four colors. Thus, the card might have &quot;Gelb&quot; (yellow) printed twice, but in black ink.<br/><br/>Shuffle the color cards, then spread them out on the table. Reveal as many points cards as the number of players. Each player takes a starting card and places it at the beginning of a row. Simultaneously, players start flipping over cards to find one that fits next to their rightmost card, with &quot;fits&quot; meaning that neither of the two colors on the rightmost card are repeated on the new card and the number of words showing on the two cards differ. If you draw a card that meets this description, add it to your row and draw again; if not, place it face-up on the table.<br/><br/>Once a player has a certain number of cards in their row &mdash; 7 to 11 depending on the number of players &mdash; they call &quot;Stop!&quot; All players check their card rows for errors, discarding any mistaken card and all cards played after it. The player with the longest row of cards claims the highest point card on display; the player with the second-longest row the next highest point card; and so on.<br/><br/>Shuffle the color cards for a new round of play. After five rounds, the player with the highest point total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race For Bastogne is a Grand Tactical Series (GTS) game that covers one sliver in the history of the Battle of the Bulge. On 16 December 1944, the Germans launched their great offensive through the Ardennes.<br/><br/>The XLVII Panzer Corps attacked with the 2. Panzer Division and 26. Volksgrenadier Division, reinforced by the Panzer Lehr Division. Defending was part of the 110th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division. It should have been a blitzkrieg through the thin defenses but stubborn resistance, the terrain, and the well-managed commitment of American reinforcements caused the German attack to fail to take Bastogne just as the 101st Airborne Division arrived. Even as German forces by-passed Bastogne to extend the &ldquo;Bulge,&rdquo; the 101st was hard pressed to defend the critical crossroads town.<br/><br/>Race For Bastogne simulates the German XLVII Corps attack across the Our River through the 110th Infantry Regiment, the delaying actions by Combat Command Reserve, 9th Armored Division, and Combat Command B, 10th Armored Division, followed by the defense of Bastogne by the 101st Airborne Division. The game covers the night of 15 December to the night of 25 December 1944. The German initially commands three &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; and the American two &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; on two maps laid end to end.<br/><br/>Race For Bastogne includes one Campaign Game and six scenarios; five of these use a single map (or portions of a single map), and the sixth uses both maps.<br/><br/>Race For Bastogne components:<br/><br/>&bull; Grand Tactical Series (GTS) 2.0c Series Rules (40 pages, color)<br/>&bull; Race For Bastogne Exclusive Rules (60 pages, color)<br/>&bull; Rules Summary (8 pages, B&amp;W)<br/>&bull; Race For Bastogne TRC/TEC set (2 cards, color)<br/>&bull; Race For Bastogne Divisional Charts set (5 cards, color)<br/>&bull; Race For Bastogne Off-Map Display &amp; Turn Record Chart (2 cards, color)<br/>&bull; Two single-sided 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps<br/>&bull; One double-sided 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; map<br/>&bull; Eight countersheets (5/8&quot;)<br/>&bull; Four 10-sided dice<br/>&bull; One box and lid (*Note: this is our standard 3&rdquo; box and is not the same style of box used for The Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron, Where Eagles Dare, and The Greatest Day).<br/><br/>Designer: Joe Chacon<br/><br/>Developer: Nick Richardson<br/><br/>Game Art: Nicolas Eskubi<br/><br/>",

These particular rules include an historical commentary and the victory conditions for each scenario. The aim of this system is to refight at the regimental scale the numerous battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. It uses a map on which the players move counters representing the combat units involved in these battles.<br/><br/>The present game simulates battles of the campaign of 1815 in Belgium that belongs to the legend. After he returns from Elba, Napol&eacute;on reconstructed an army and landed a preventive strike on the two closest armies, the Prussian army under the old and faithful Bl&uuml;cher, and the Anglo-Allied army under the Duke of Wellington. At first spread over a vast area, these two armies eventually assembled and fought four legendary battles at Quatre Bras and Ligny on the 16th of June, and then two days later at Wavre and of course Waterloo, called Mont St Jean by the French, and La Belle Alliance by the Prussians. This campaign is an impressive collection of missed opportunities on both sides.

Players are Native American shamans who want to impress the tribe by conjuring various animal spirits and having long discussions with them. The problem is that the shaman doesn't always remember the right incantation and somewhat calls the wrong spirit &mdash; hoping no one will notice.<br/><br/>Each player in turn plays an incantation card face down in front of an animal totem. Other players can call the bluff if they think it's not the right animal. A player can also try a full ceremony if he thinks enough incantations have been made to a given animal spirit. A player wins by getting rid of all their incantation cards or fulfilling two ceremonies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleonic 20 #17<br/><br/>When the capture of Vienna failed to bring the Austrians to the bargaining table, Napoleon sought more direct means of ending the War of the Fifth Coalition. His first attempt was a nearly impromptu effort to force a crossing of the Danube, then in full spring flood, with the handful of forces that were immediately available. Almost predictably, the resulting battle of Aspern-Essling resulted in a crushing French defeat. Stung by the setback, Napoleon then spent the next month and a half preparing for another assault at the same site, this time concentrating all available troops to ensure his success.<br/>In the ensuing battle of Wagram, the second largest engagement of the Napoleonic era, Napoleon managed to defeat the Austrians but failed to achieve the decisive result he'd hoped for, forcing him to acknowledge that his foes were &quot;no longer the enemy of old.&quot;<br/><br/>Danube 20 features in a Twin game combo games both the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram, allowing players to examine this pair of critical battles fought just across the Danube from Vienna. Featuring low unit density (twenty or fewer pieces) and modest complexity, the game focuses on dramatic, fast-playing turns and creating a strong historical narrative. The use of &quot;story-driven&quot; random event cards and the tracking of army morale provide for operational pauses and the &quot;friction of war&quot; to give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex about 1200 meters, and each turn roughly 3.5 daylight hours (8 hours at night).<br/><br/>",

You have no equal...aside from your sibling.<br/><br/>And to the half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power. From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.<br/><br/>The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus, breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one of you will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.<br/><br/>Songs of Far Shores | Omen Game 1 is a standalone card game for two players.<br/><br/>Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.<br/><br/>Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City become Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).<br/><br/>The turn structure is broken into five Steps:<br/><br/>WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!<br/><br/>SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.<br/><br/>PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.<br/><br/>WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).<br/><br/>OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.<br/><br/>While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: A Reign of War title or expansion.<br/><br/>",

In each round, players from each team sit side-by-side and look at the same word card. Word cards differ in 3 ways. (1) With one neutral colored word listed, each member models to communicate the same word. (2) With 3 neutral colored words, each modeler has free choice but may end up molding the same word. (3) With 3 words listed in 3 different colors, modelers can only mold according to the color of their dough. To start, each modeler places their ball of dough onto their plastic mat, which outlines start positions for their hands. Each modeler simultaneously tries to represent their word. The first team to shout out the correct word winsxed amount of dough from their opponent's model using a plastic extracting tool. The winning team can also reclaim a previously extracted amount. A team can lose for calling out a color coded word that another team member is modeling.  Once a team loses all of their dough, the game ends, and the team with the most dough wins.<br/><br/>",

During the game, the players have a team of heroes with which they will fight against an ever increasing amount of powerful enemies. As a general rule, the game has a duration of five rounds, with one wave per player each round. Each wave is divided in four phases:<br/><br/>1. Lord Morth's phase: The starting player rolls the enemy dice into the portal board to determine in which path the enemies enter the boards. To do this, the player rolls as many enemy dice as indicated on the turn track, and a 12-sided die to determine the exact position of the portal. Also, the players receive cards to trump their opponent's strategies.<br/><br/>2. Portal phase: The players may pay gold to turn the portal, modifying the initial enemy distribution. In turn order, each player may pay as much gold as they want to move the portal in any direction. Once all players have moved the portal or have passed their turn, they take the enemy dice that ended the phase in their zones of the portal board, placing them in the corresponding paths.<br/><br/>3. Heroes' phase: Players move and attack with their team of characters, trying to eliminate all threats from their boards.<br/><br/>4. Assault phase: Enemies advance, trying to exit the player's boards. The starting player rolls a three-sided die, and each player has to add the resulting number to the initial movement value of each enemy. If an enemy escapes a player's board, the player takes damage.<br/><br/>Once all rounds are finished, the game ends and the player who has the fewest damage points wins!<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions.

Flowers reward points when collected from a player&rsquo;s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can).

Between 1665 and his death in 1680, Riquet was completely anbsorbed by the planning, financing and construction of his canal system.  Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.<br/><br/>You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne. Each player is an engineer who must use their best workers to build the greatest length of the Arriala (cannal in the Occitan language of southern France). You can move all workers, but only those on your team will gain you fame points for completing sections. The placement of your workers when construction is completed is critical.  Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?<br/><br/>Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game. What's more, your expertise also extends to cultivating the  vines that make this region famous and will bring you valuable points when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

At the orders of the king Hayam Wuruk and his vizier, the great Gajah Mada, you have set out across the sea to expand the great mandala of Majapahit through commerce and diplomacy. You and your fellow nobles have recently arrived at the remote island of Buru, eager to earn your place in history. Here, you will dispatch your parties to the island to explore, trade, and pay your respects as you compete to win over Buru's residents and ultimately gain the favor of the King himself.<br/><br/>Buru is a mid-weight, Euro-style board game for 1-4 players. Over five game rounds, you and your fellow players secretly deploy explorers to the four different regions of the island in order to gather resources, recruit islanders, set them to tasks, and pay tribute to the spirits revered there. The object of the game is to win the islanders' esteem. You can earn esteem in many ways, primarily by paying tribute, but also by pleasing elders, tasking local nobles, fulfilling the king's decrees, and holding a totem when any player pays tribute to that spirit.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most esteem wins and is declared the new governor of Buru!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The tallest dams bring the most points, but you need to keep the garbage clear of your dams because no one likes to see that, so don't neglect the beaver garbage collection crews.<br/><br/>In detail, before play begins, lay out the fifteen dam cards in five piles based on the &quot;dam sum&quot; total at that top of the cards; for cards with the same number, stack the cards worth more points on top of those worth fewer. Shuffle the deck of wood, garbage, and garbage removal cards and lay four out in a face-up row; give each player four wood cubes. On a turn, a player either builds a dam or takes a card. The player can take the leftmost card for free; if they want a different card, they must place a wood cube on each card they skip. (If you take a card with cubes on it, add them to your supply for possible use later.)<br/><br/><br/>    If you pick up a wood card, add it to your hand.<br/>    If you pick up a garbage card, immediately discard a garbage removal card or else place the garbage in your scored dam pile.<br/>    If you pick up garbage removal, add it to your hand; you can use it to remove garbage drawn later, or you can use it in a dam.<br/><br/><br/>When you build a dam, you lay down wood cards of all different types, with each wood card having a value of 1-3. Based on the sum of the dam, take the topmost dam card that best matches the value of the dam. If you play a garbage removal card in a dam, count it as a joker wood of value 2.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out or all the dam cards have been claimed, the game ends. Sum the points on all dam cards collected, add 1 point for each two wood cubes you have, then subtract the square of the numbere of garbage cards you've collected, up to a maximum of -25 points.

        "description": "The eternal struggle between vampires and werewolves is coming to an end. The last Vampire Master and his Apprentice, Strigoi from Wallachia, are dwelling in the ancient fortress of Tismana: a stronghold haunted by evil undead creatures. Nevertheless, the POWERWOLF  &mdash; sons of the Legends of the Night and the Armenia Savage Army &mdash; the defenders of the &quot;Real Truth&quot;, prepare for a last frantic assault knowing there are no alternatives to victory!<br/><br/>Armata Strigoi is a game in which the Powerwolf win or lose as a team, but each player makes their own decisions about their actions and movements. Each player represents one of the Powerwolf heroes which assault the Strigoi&rsquo;s fortress as a single pack. In order to win they have to defeat both Vampires. However, the two foes are initially invulnerable and their vitality is intrinsically linked to their dwelling fortress, thus, upon the demise of the first vampire the whole structure will start to crumble and collapse on itself, making the victory a race against time!<br/><br/>The Powerwolf act collectively, but a pack of werewolves during a furious assault is not known to be a highly organized band that can devise and set up high-profile strategies and tactics. Hence, the players are forbidden from sharing details about their cards, though they can talk to each other, propose joint actions, or heal a comrade.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by defeating both Strigoi. To make them vulnerable, the Powerwolf must first collect Blood Points by decimating the fellow Creatures of the Night who haunt the fortress. During their quest, they can also collect weapons and magical artifacts.<br/><br/>If one Strigoi perishes, the other immediately turns into a Supreme Master Vampire, making them even more lethal. At the same time, the fortress starts to crumble and collapse room by room. If both Strigoi are defeated, the Powerwolf pack wins the game. It is not an easy task, but let the hunt begin!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Artwork credits:<br/>Original Illustrations by Zsofia Dankova<br/>Boardgame artwork by Paolo Vallerga<br/>Miniatures sculpted by Alan D&rsquo;Amico - OrcoNero<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game contains five fictional train companies based in different Swedish cities on the map.<br/><br/>A game of 18Svea follows a fixed set of rounds. Four Stock Rounds (SR) when players manage their private shareholder investments in available train companies mixed with seven Operations Rounds (OR) when train companies expand their rail network, establish train stations, run trains, and generate money to its shareholders. The game also contains twelve strategy cards which ensures that every game will be different. When the game ends, the player with highest combined wealth in money and company shares wins the game.<br/><br/>18Svea is heavily inspired by the fantastic 18XX train games originally developed or inspired by Francis Tresham and do not normally involve dice rolling or other random events during play. Apart from shuffling the deck of strategy cards and potentially rolling one die once when determining the placement of an off-board connection, players must rely on their own ability to outwit and outmaneuver each other while playing. In 18Svea the luck factor is small, and the player interaction factor is very high already from round one.<br/><br/>",

There is a great deal of truth in those three words and Legends of Boxing is designed to bring that fistic chemistry to life.<br/><br/>Designer's Notes<br/><br/>One aspect that I wanted to capture in this boxing simulation was a feel for a fighter's style - his tendencies from round to round. With Legends of Boxing, I wanted fighter's styles to merge into certain types of action. That is the single biggest difference in this game and any that have come before it. The fighter's strategies, or modes, are an integral part of a his ratings in this game, reflecting his tendency to be defensive, fight from the outside, brawl on the inside, or &quot;walk down&quot; and pressure his opponent.<br/><br/>I have played many hundreds of bouts with LOB since 2000 and I still enjoy it as much today as any other sports game I own.

        "description": "The Red Palace is a standalone game set in the Alhambra Universe that provides a new style of gameplay and is designed specifically for more complexity in the base game. It features:<br/><br/><br/>     The (3D wooden) buildings and walls are now separated.<br/>     Guards as a new mechanic, which make choosing and constructing buildings more exciting and introduce new powerful extra actions that might bring you closer to victory!<br/><br/><br/>Each player constructs their own Alhambra by taking money cards and using these to purchase buildings of different types. Which buildings you can build are displayed on the building market. Unlike the base game of Alhambra, the buildings are not printed on the tiles, but instead players draw a tile and then a chip which tells them which of the wooden buildings is placed onto the tile. In each of the three scoring rounds, players will receive points if they have the most of each building type, as well as points for their longest connected wall segment.<br/><br/>When buying a tile, players check for guard icons on the walls, placing one guard on each icon. The guards do two things:<br/><br/>     Guards standing on your longest wall give you bonus points during scoring.<br/>     They can be discarded to do powerful extra actions during your turn.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Note: All existing expansions for Alhambra can be added to Red Palace except currently the tile based expansions from the Mega Box are not compatible due to the different size of the tiles (45mm vs 50mm)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Throughout the 18th century, Britain and France waged a bloody series of wars for nothing short of global domination. Massive sailing warships, armies of bayonet-wielding soldiers, and their skilled allies fought for control of North American, African, and Indian colonies. In many ways, this was the first &quot;world war&quot;.<br/><br/>In 1750: Britain vs. France, you play as Britain or France, wielding your forces to decide the outcome of this struggle. During the game, you recruit generals and admirals from the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) and the War of the Austrian Succession, and send other military forces to take colonies by force, with colonies producing exports to aid your economy. Your units roll dice in combat against enemy forces, and you can modify those results by playing historic event cards to turn the tide of battle, modifying dice rolls and destroying enemy cards at critical moments. You'll also engage in political efforts to persuade other world powers to enter the conflict on your side and bring their resources to the fight.<br/><br/>Your final score is decided by the number of colonies you have captured, countries you have gotten to join your cause, and enemy leaders you've taken as prisoners. Will you change history, or will history repeat itself?<br/><br/>",

Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point. After five rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Roman Empire is broken. The crisis of the third century - a decades-long fever dream of civil war, plague, and economic ruin - stretched it thinner and thinner, until finally, inevitably, it splintered. The Palmyrene Empire to the east, the Gallic Empire to the west, and sandwiched between them, the remnants of the Roman Empire. Deprived of its richest provinces and stuck in a series of endless wars along the frontier, it seemed destined, at last, to fall. But in 270, when the emperor died, troops along the Danube did what troops along the Danube always did, and demanded that their commander take the purple. His name was Lucius Domitius Aurelianus, and over the course of his short reign, he would do the impossible: he would put this broken world back together again.<br/><br/>Aurelian, Restorer of the World is a Strategic level Solitaire board-wargame from Tom Russell, the designer of Agricola, Master of Britain and Charlemagne, Master of Europe. Like those titles, three cups are used to represent shifting attitudes toward Aurelian's rule; actions you take will move chits from one cup to another. This game is shorter and faster than the two previous games, lasting a maximum of six turns. It's also more difficult. Beyond marching around the map, quelling revolts, and smacking down usurpers, you must manage monies, maintain a strong defensive line along the Danube, make war against Germanic tribes, build up city defenses, and spread the cult of Sol Invictus. You do not have nearly enough time or resources to do all of these things equally well, and will need to make hard choices. If you succeed, you will earn the title afforded to Aurelian by the senate: Restitutor Orbis, &quot;Restorer of the World&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He decided to hide them in his pyramid to prevent then from being stolen.  Unfortunately he is no longer sure where he has buried what.  With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.<br/><br/>After chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players won&rsquo;t know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.<br/><br/>Mixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:<br/><br/>Sandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.<br/><br/>Gift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.<br/><br/>Risk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.<br/><br/>Mirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.<br/><br/>Desert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.  If he succeeds then he can take one of your search cards.  If he fails then you can take one of his.<br/><br/>End Game: The Pharaoh is happy because all the treasure has been found.  As soon as this (Pile 3 only) card is turned over the game ends and the players total up the points that are shown on their search cards.<br/><br/>After each player has found a treasure the board is rotated through 90 degrees in a chosen direction.<br/><br/>Once all the search cards from the second pile are used up then pile &quot;3&quot; is used.  In this final round all the treasures on the search cards are worth 4 points and anyone who has not yet been particularly successful can, with brains and luck, overtake all the others.<br/><br/>When a player finds a treasure chip that is not the one that he was looking for he is out of the game.  The remaining players continue.  Play continues until all the players are eliminated or the End Game Card is turned over.<br/><br/>All the players total up the points that they have showing on the search cards they have collected.  The player with the greatest number of points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's the year 325 and it's a pretty chill time to be a Christian.<br/><br/>Not only has it been a hot minute since they were forced to renounce their faith on pain of death, but the emperor Constantine has really leaned into it, hoping it will unite the often fractured Roman Empire. So, the big guy isn&rsquo;t super-thrilled when bishops immediately get into nit-picky, esoteric arguments that John Quintus Romanus doesn&rsquo;t give two flips about. He demands that the bishops gather together in the city of Nicaea to come to an accord. He doesn&rsquo;t really care what these nerds decide, so long as they decide something.<br/><br/>This gathering is given irreverent treatment by Amabel Holland in this game for four, five, or six players. Like Constantine, it treats the theological positions argued at the first ecumenical council as fungible. Whether a position ends up accepted orthodoxy or damnable heresy has nothing to do with theology and everything to do with politics - with personal ambition, petty rivalries, and social dynamics. This is a sort of shared incentives game, in which each player commits to one of two sides in various theological disputes; guess which one the majority will go with and you&rsquo;ll score points. Score the most points, and you&rsquo;ll win the game.<br/><br/>Unless the player with the fewest points has accumulated the most political influence. That player is powerful enough to splinter the church, provoking a schism and stealing the win. To prevent this, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that someone that powerful isn&rsquo;t left out in the cold during the final settlement.<br/><br/>At once a slick tableau-building game and a study in emergent alliances, Nicaea gives a rude but affectionate raspberry to what was perhaps the most pivotal event in the history of the early church.<br/><br/>",

Heaps of money are said to be behind these walls, money that you would only love to steal &mdash; even though both of you are anything but professional thieves. You want to try your luck, but the rooms are equipped with numerous lasers that must be avoided, and you must work quickly before time runs out...<br/><br/>In the co-operative game Complices, players have two minutes to steal as many coins as possible without hitting the security lasers present in the room. To do this, each player puts on glasses with a red or blue color filter that prevents them from seeing one of the types of lasers. The player with the red glasses must then trace a path in the room with the marker in order to recover the coins and treasures, while the player with the blue glasses is their guide. Communicate as well as possible to avoid obstacles! Each coin recovered is worth 1 point, while each laser hit causes you to lose 1 point. If you collect enough coins to fill your hideout after four rounds, you win the game.<br/><br/>Complices contains sixteen rooms in four levels of difficulty, with new laser shapes and new mechanisms for each level.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.<br/><br/>In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.<br/><br/>Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.<br/><br/>For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.<br/><br/>In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>        Bughouse Chess<br/>        Vendetta<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the rulebook:)<br/><br/>The game starts in October 1791, when the Legislative Assembly is installed.  It ends in September 1795. The game mechanics are mainly diplomacy and negotiations.  Each player represents a &quot;Political Current&quot; (or simply a Current), because at this time, there was no permanent political party, but only shifting groups of politicians.  Each Current acts to strengthen its position and increase its fame.  The game uses also elements under no player's control, but which react to the players' actions.<br/><br/>A game can end in several ways, depending on the current political regime, and depending on each player's victory points.  In the real world, the end was the installation of the Directorate in September 1795.<br/><br/>One interesting feature of the game is the strict seating arrangement: Players are seated from left to right depending on the political stance of their &quot;Current&quot; (Sans-Culottes on the left, Royalists on the right, and everyone else in between).  One cannot leave the room to conduct negotiations, but one can whisper--thus it's easier to secretly negotiate with one's neighbor than with someone on the &quot;other side of the aisle&quot;.<br/><br/>",

They don't know the island is the final home of dinosaurs, survivors of millions of years, and they aren't happy to let outsiders explore their island. Of course, the pirates also don't know that the island is sinking or that there are other pirates looking for the same treasure. Who will get away with the most loot and become the pirate remembered by history?<br/><br/>Before the game, players outfit themselves with a variety of crew, weapons, and gear before choosing the section of the island that they will explore, knowing that the jungle takes longer than the beach as they look for their parts of the map. The search can be interrupted as other players play dinosaur (and other) cards to cause mayhem and carnage. Once the treasure is located, players draw treasures from a bag, looking to avoid the pirate ghost and island sinking events, and return safe to their ship &ndash; a question of how far they'll go in pushing their luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;What is this all about&quot;<br/><br/>- David Livingstone<br/><br/>Well David,<br/><br/>This is a game of adventure and exploration where you, together with five other players, venture into deepest Africa. The time period is mid-19th century and you start your expedition at one of the six Ports of Entry.<br/><br/>Your journey is financed by a major newspaper and publisher back home, and they expect you to bring home fantastic stories that they can publish. Your expedition consists of you and armed askaris, which are local African soldiers, and porters that carry food and gifts. There will be occasional local guides and goats to keep you company.<br/><br/>The quest is to trek into what is unknown to you. You will interact with people that you meet, while searching for the myths and legends that are said to exist somewhere in Africa. To walk the land among people that might not appreciate your presence, to face hunger and predators, and to reveal what perhaps should remain hidden is dangerous. Not only are the lives of your expedition at stake, but your sanity as well.<br/><br/>But then again, as the old trader said, &quot;are you not entering the Heart of Darkness?&quot;<br/><br/>The map covers Central and Southern Africa and is divided along ethnic groups. Your expedition/marker moves from area to area searching for myths and legends. You only carry gifts and food and is therefore forced to interact with local people and to hunt. You will encounter wildlife, hostile people and various disasters which will wear down your health and sanity. Your object is to accumulate more Drama Points (for the publisher back home) than your competitors before any of the player's explorer dies or goes mad in the bush.<br/><br/>",

The player must manage such specialized units as sappers, snipers, spotters, flamethrowers, and military police.<br/><br/>Very limited intelligence with respect to the location of Enemy forces is a key characteristic of the game system. You can name it &quot;double-blind&quot; due to the fact that you just manage your own troops on your own map while your opponent is managing his forces on his own map. The opponent's forces have to be detected and then be marked with &quot;known/unknown&quot;-markers on your own map.<br/><br/>Twenty scenarios include historical conflicts ranging from 1956 to 1979, and hypothetical situations involving NATO, Soviet, Chinese, and irregular forces.<br/><br/>A comprehensive guide to scenario design is included.<br/><br/>[Note: The actual name of the game, as given in the rules, is &quot;Cityfight.&quot; People often call it &quot;City-Fight&quot; because the name had to be hyphenated on the front of the box cover, and is also hyphenated on the box sides and on the maps where there is no such imperative.]<br/><br/>Firefight: Modern U.S. and Soviet Small Unit Tactics is a similar game utilizing the same base system but without the many complications introduced in Cityfight.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 20 seconds<br/>Hex: 55 feet / 16.67 meters<br/>Units: Individual Infantry &amp; Vehicles to Fireteams<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two identical 17 x 22&quot; four color mapsheets<br/>Five dual-side printed countersheets (1400 1/2&quot; counters - 567 combat &amp; 833 markers)<br/>Two 64-page Cityfight rulebook<br/>One 40-page Cityfight TO&amp;E, Charts &amp; Tables booklet<br/>One 8-page Charts &amp; Tables booklet<br/>Four 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Very Low<br/>Complexity Level: Variable<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-100 hours<br/><br/>",

The real departures were a one-shot, one-armor save mechanics (unlike roll to hit, wound, armor save, save as in 40k) and flexible movement that had the two players alternate between armies rather than move all of one army at a time.<br/><br/>This edition was distinguished by particularly purple prose in the world view section, excellent art accumulated from the Mutant Chronicles universe so far, and a generic feel to the squads and characters.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Warzone<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Though now largely forgotten the successful defense of Cholm by Kampfgruppe Scherer ranks as one of the great small unit sieges of the Second World War and perhaps of all time. Now you can relive the first ten days of this epic battle, when the underfed soldiers of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army attempted to capture the town, its food, and its vital road hub &ldquo;on the march&rdquo; and avoid what would ultimately become a long and unsuccessful siege. As the Soviet side you have more men, stronger artillery, and armor. As the German side you have the town, the high ground, and air power. Hitler has declared Cholm a festung: there will be no withdrawal. In the waist-deep snow and sub-zero temperatures the battle will be fought to the last man and the last grenade.<br/><br/>Circle of Fire by designer Michael Rinella utilizes an updated version of the low-complexity area-impulse system first used in the award-winning Avalon Hill classic Storm over Arnhem. Unlike that game, however, this design includes a hallmark of later area-impulse games: the &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; mechanism to end turns unpredictably. The game includes a full size area map produced directly from aerial photographs and situational maps, and 176 large counters. Easy to learn, quick to set up, and fast to play, Circle of Fire is both a great introduction to the area-impulse system and a great introductory conflict simulation game.<br/><br/><br/>    Map - One full-color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 176 full-color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 8 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Low<br/>    Solitaire suitability - Low<br/><br/><br/>",

These spaces are connected to each other through the network of Roman roads, rougher connections (mostly in uncivilized territory) or river connections (mostly the Donau and the Rhine).<br/><br/>Players take turns playing cards in order to activate Generals (Loyalist Roman generals such as Aetius, Usurper Emperors like Magnentius, and Barbarian leaders such as Atilla or Alaric) for movement and/or sieges, bring new Barbarian invasions into play, recruit new Legions, lead barbarian bands in raids across the border into the Roman interior, settle formerly hostile tribes on Roman soil, or even successfully usurp the Imperial Throne from its previous occupant! As leaders move, they will encounter enemy armies and battle, earning eternal glory or an unrecognized grave. Barbarian tribes will probe the fortified border for weaknesses, while the outnumbered Legions have to use interior lines (and the excellent Roman road network) to face each threat to the unfortified Italian, Iberian and Gallic diocese.<br/><br/>From the days of Valentinian I and the first Vandal and Frankish migrations through Theodosius I and the Gothic invasions to Attila and the Huns, Barbarians at the Gates will allow players to vie for the future of Western Europe. Will enough of Roman civilization remain to eventually spark a Renaissance, or will Europe remain forever in the Dark Ages?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Collect wood and bamboo to build canoes and huts with them, or try to make the longest necklace of seashells. Whoever plays their cards most skillfully will win.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player in Moorea starts with a hand of six commodity cards, with three such cards placed face up and the rest placed as a face-down deck. Lay out the four types of tools, then lay out ten product cards in a face-up display; the products are separated into two types, with the easiest to acquire coming into play first. On a turn, you must draw a face-down commodity card from the deck, then you take an action or pass, then you discard down to your hand limit, which starts at six cards. When you take an action, you can:<br/><br/><br/>    Discard two commodity cards in hand to take one of the face-up commodity cards.<br/>    Discard hand cards for a product card from the display, adding that card to your hand (if it's a hut, canoe, or stoneware) or placing it in front of you.<br/>    Discard a set of commodity cards to acquire a tool card, which you place in front of you; tools increase your hand limit, use fish as jokers, draw two cards at the start of your turn, and draw from the face-up commodity cards instead of the deck.<br/>    Discard one or more commodity or product cards to an appropriate store placed in front of you.<br/><br/><br/>If the commodity deck runs out, shuffle the discards to create a new deck. When you can no longer fill the product display to have ten cards available, each player takes one final turn, then the game ends. Players then tally the points on their product cards, tool cards, and commodities and products laid at stores, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ScrumBrawl is a board game where players control fantastic creatures vying for supremacy within the Arena, scoring goals by maneuvering various types of enchanted orbs into portals set within the Arena or fighting other creatures to the death to prevent them from reaching the portals. The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.<br/><br/>When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.<br/><br/>Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal. No lead is safe and no two matches are ever the same making each game a unique and often humorous experience. The name is the combination of Scrum (a Rugby term where players strive for possession of the ball) and Brawl (a roaring fight, in our case, to the death). ScrumBrawl is the inaugural title for VicTim Games LLC.<br/><br/>Game time ranges from 20-40 minutes for a 2 player game, 30-45 minutes for a 3 player game, and 40-60 minutes for a 4 player game.<br/><br/>",

During a turn a player moves one of his or her ships along the the spiral exactly the number on the die.  A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.<br/><br/>The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.<br/><br/>In the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

        "description": "From Osprey's publicity:<br/><br/>The Dark Age of Britain, from the middle of the 4th century to the end of the 8th, was a time of violence and warfare, when charismatic warlords such as the fabled King Arthur could gather together armies and carve out their own kingdoms. With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.<br/><br/>From the playtest introduction:<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an army&rsquo;s commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.<br/><br/>All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways. An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.<br/><br/>",

Can they capture enough to win the game before the first reshuffle.<br/>Game play uses point-to-point movement and area control, hidden army strengths, and decks of cards providing the command choices;  there are no dice. The Axis and Allied players each have their own card decks, reflecting the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. Each player will have the chance to be the aggressor and defender trying to win the game by the time they have cycled through their card deck for the last time. Victory is achieved by having accumulated the required amount of victory points by capturing victory locations.<br/><br/>As the decks are cycled, the Allied player adds some better quality cards, with the Russians and Americans entering play during the 1st and 2nd reshuffle. The Axis player adds will burn through his early game quality cards, becoming weaker as his resources dwindle. The underlying game mechanism is one of &quot;deck destruction&quot; rather than the more normal deck-building.<br/><br/>Cards have multiple uses and can be recycled if used one way but during the course of the game you have to decide which cards are going to be permanently sacrificed from your deck cycle to allow you to build units.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>Mounted Game Board<br/>2 - Decks of 60+ cards<br/>3/4&quot; counters<br/>Rules <br/>Box<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

By the end of the day, Tilly's lumbering army lay smashed beyond redemption, the victim of rapid-firing artillery, fast-moving infantry and hard-charging cavalry.

The village elders prohibited venturing out into the dark starless night for fear of the dangers that lurked there. One night after her mother cooked dinner, a young girl, frustrated with these restrictions, took a bit of ash and roots and cast the red and white embers into the sky, forming the milky way and the other stars, in an attempt to illuminate the night so the villagers could safely collect resources necessary for their survival.<br/><br/>As a village elder, gaze upon the new stars in the night sky and discern the forms of constellations to provide wisdom and illumination to the village. Draw constellations into the earth, with your depictions gaining light, stars, and stardust for the village. Then, as villagers guided by this newfound light, venture into the surrounding darkness to collect much needed resources, including fruit, fish, and small and large game. The resources you collect for the village will boost your reputation, and the player with the highest reputation at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 1920s &mdash; a time that is often referred to as the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, a boisterous period characterized by rapidly changing lifestyles, financial excesses, and the fast pace of technological progress. In 1919, the requisite number of legislatures of the States ratified the 18th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, enabling national Prohibition within one year of ratification. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (a.k.a. bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. Federal Prohibition agents were given the task of enforcing the law. Even though the sale of alcohol was illegal, alcoholic drinks were still widely available at &quot;speakeasies&quot; and other underground drinking establishments.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Opulent, a posh speakeasy located in vibrant Atlantic City! In The Opulent 1-4 players are tasked with the operations of a successful nightclub during the historic Jazz Age. Each player takes on a distinct role that plays a vital part in the success &mdash; or failure &mdash; of the Opulent. Cater to the recognizable social classes of the 1920s. Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew. Pay lookouts to deter Federal Agents seeking to shut the club down. Hire flappers, a chanteuse, cocktail waitress, or other helpful hands and amenities to improve your club.<br/><br/>Manage the Opulent in ten scenarios dating from 1920-1929 during one of the most historic periods of U.S. history! Each scenario has a dollar value that is associated with the cost of operating The Opulent for that particular year. Players must have enough money in the club coffers to cover this cost in order to win the scenario if playing a single session game, or to progress to the next scenario if players are taking on the Opulent campaign.<br/><br/>With a focus on theme and history, &quot;The Opulent&quot; is a light cooperative asymmetrical game set during 1920's prohibition where players operate a campaign driven upscale speakeasy.<br/><br/>",

Players travel with their game pieces to different locations on the board, and once these pieces are at all the locations on a destination card, that player earns the points specified. Each area also has a location where a player can collect postcards, for which he'll receive points at the end of the game. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You're in Iraq. It's 2003. The country is swarming with civilian companies hired by the US government to rebuild the infrastructure. The US military has its own in-country priorities. It's up to your Private Military Company (PMC) and your team of mercenaries to provide the tactical security and escort firepower needed to keep the construction teams alive. All while fulfilling your personal goals for being there. And of course, making a few bucks to provide for your retirement once the shooting stops!<br/><br/>You begin by creating your Company. This includes, hiring your starting employees, deciding on a Company Goal, as well as your starting assets and liabilities. Your employees level-up as they complete contracts. They progress from Squad Soldier, to Non-Player Soldier, to finally Player Soldier.<br/><br/>If you want to use military-grade hardware, you need to purchase the the proper licenses. These purchases will come out of your starting budget or you can purchase them during the campaign. However, until you have the proper licenses, your employees are limited to civilian weapons.Your headquarters is in your home country and your compound is in Iraq. You have to pay monthly rent on all of these facilities, so you&rsquo;ll probably start with just the basics. As you complete contracts you can improve your company.<br/><br/>Warfighter: Private Military Contractor is a complete, standalone game set in the Warfighter Modern era.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Byzantio is a game of medieval intrigue in the east in which players take the role of the heads of the main Byzantine dynasties, and scheme to choose the successor to the imperial throne.<br/><br/>In the 11th century A.D. the empire is torn between four factions, two of them provincial, military aristocracies (the houses of Comnenid and Phocas) and two of them urban, secular aristocracies (the houses of the Dukes and Angels). It is 1025, and the emperor Basileios II has ascended into the heavens without providing for an heir. In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.<br/><br/>It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.<br/><br/>Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption. May the rightful heir arise!<br/><br/><br/>Nekken is a fantasy-themed implementation of this game using the exact same materials as Byzantio and with a map on the reverse side of the game board, giving a different game experience and essentially two games in one.<br/><br/>Four tribes have been living in peace for over 3000 years despite the ancient hatred of each other. United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.<br/><br/>In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective. Hopefully no other ruler intends on settling in the same place!<br/><br/>",

It closely captures the choices, tactics and mission strategies of the videogame. In teams, or as individuals, players will maneuver units and battle for control points to collect manpower, munitions and fuel. Players spend these resources to construct new buildings, purchase units and upgrade abilities, eventually unlocking the powerful end-game units of their nation.<br/><br/>The Second Edition of the Company of Heroes Board Game introduces extensive improvements to gameplay, tactical choices, unit balance, faction differentiation, mission parameters and more.<br/><br/>More Units - Bigger Battles: 2nd edition adjusts unit and building costs, resource generation and other mechanics to allow for more units to be purchased, fielded and used over the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Community Feedback: After thousands of games and feedback from the player community, the 2nd Edition further tweaked and balanced units, factions and commanders to a high polish. These changes were incorporated with an eye towards emphasizing faction identity and distinction.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

This is a quadrigame or set of four games, each featuring a full-size, 22x34&quot; game map and covering battles from 1862: <br/><br/>     Antietam, 5am-9am, September 17th<br/>     South Mountain, 9am-6pm, September 14th<br/>     Mill Springs, 7am-12pm, January 17th<br/>     Bloody Valverde, 10am-5pm, February 21st<br/><br/><br/>Command rules are simple and abstracted. There are no combat results tables. Combat and all checks are resolved using six-sided dice, in which results of 5-6 mark success, and 1-4 failure. Brigades activate via chit pull, with their constituent units moving and fighting individually. Stacking is limited to two units per hex. Massive 1.5&rdquo; hexes allow two 3/4&rdquo; units to fit side by side&hellip; no information is obscured!<br/><br/>Distinctions are made between formed and unformed infantry, deployed and limbered artillery, mounted and dismounted cavalry. Unit facing is not an element of play. Instead, unit deployment in adjacent hexes can trigger pass-through fire, which simulates flanking fire, or fire on compressed lines (both dangerous situations for civil war units).<br/><br/>Battle Cards introduce an element of uncertainty and excitement to play. Unique off-map displays track every brigade's reserves and casualties. Once a unit's reserves are used up, it becomes exhausted and liable to break.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 20 minutes<br/>Hex: 100 yards / 91 meters<br/>Units: Regiments and Batteries<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Four 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets (1.5&quot;/38mm hex size)<br/>Four dual-side printed countersheets (520 .75&quot;/19mm counters)<br/>One  dual-side printed countersheet  (228 .5&quot;/12.7mm counters)<br/>One  24-page full color rulebook<br/>One  36-page full color scenario book<br/>Five dual-side printed brigade display player aid cards<br/>Two  dual-side printed activation track display player aid cards<br/>Two  dual-side printed sequence of play/terrain effects/combat chart player aid cards<br/>One  deck of 52 battle playing cards<br/>Two  save rolls playing cards<br/>Six  off-board artillery playing cards<br/>Six 6-sided dice (3 blue/3 gray)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-high<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-4 hours<br/><br/>",

Only this player's ducks may be shot at in this round.<br/>b) Bird flu: kills all ducks on the pond at once.<br/>c) Frank-ent-stein (pun in German: Ente = duck): kill three adjacent ducks and bring one of your killed ducks back into play (built from the mortal remains of the former???)<br/>d) Featherbrain: played on another player with a duck in the crosshairs. If that player has a fire card, he has to shoot his own duck.<br/>e) Shot in the dark: Kills the topmost duck on the draw deck.<br/>f) etc.<br/><br/>- There are three duckling cards shuffled together with the other ducks and the water cards. While one of them crosses the pond, no shooting is allowed (no violence in front of minors). Then, the duckling leaves the game.<br/><br/>- The German version now also has a gameboard and cardboard crosshairs (just like the old American version)<br/><br/>- The colors of the 6 duck families are completely new, so the game should be combinable with the old game for an up-to 12-player experience (not tested, nor recommended by the publisher)<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player either lays one card face up in front of him &ndash; thereby openly showing a stock in a particular type of good &ndash; or plays 1-4 cards of the same spice onto a market. Once a market has a type of goods on it, only goods of the same type can be added to it. No market can have more than four cards on it, and the same good can by played into at most two markets. The player then refills his hand to seven cards.<br/><br/>When all the markets have cards in them or two markets are full with four cards, the round ends. Each player reveals his secret stock; for each stock card that has a market devoted to it, the player scores 1-10 points, depending on the type of spice and the number of cards in the market. A player can score an identical spice card only if two markets carry this spice.<br/><br/>Players clear the markets, then begin a new round.

Thousands of guests from all over the country were invited; traveling merchants, monks, soldiers, and many others flocked to the capital. But, oh no! Because everyone had hoped for last-minute discounts, no one had pre-booked a hotel room. Now the great race for the last free rooms begins!

Miraculously, every man survived.<br/><br/>The game does regard this as a miracle &ndash; as the least likely result - and evokes it not through reproduction, but through its absence. This is a bleak and grueling game about suffering and perseverance. Faced with circumstances beyond your control, you must make the best choices you can. You'll be hunting for food, buoying the men's spirits with distractions, and managing your ever-dwindling supplies while dealing with a hostile and unpredictable environment.<br/><br/>This game is unique in that there is no victory or loss condition. The game will end either when the men are rescued, or when rescue becomes impossible.

Whoever ends up with the most gems wins!<br/><br/>The gems are on tiles that are shuffled, stacked, and placed inside a cardboard castle. Using a plastic slider that goes under the bottom edge of the castle, players push out tiles to create a row of gems that the wizard is levitating away from the castle.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four colored pebbles. On a turn, you move your figure to a new space on the path of tiles, paying a pebble of the color space to which you move. You then draw pebbles from the bag based on the space to which you moved. Finally, if you can pay pebbles exactly matching the number and color of the gems depicted on the tile, you claim that tile. (You have tricked the wizard into stealing pebbles instead of gems.)<br/><br/>Reveal the bottom of the tile to see whether nothing happens, a number of new tiles are revealed, or you take another turn. Continue taking turns until the magic path tile is revealed from the castle. At the end of that round, count your gems to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!<br/><br/>To this basic game, Ocean Labyrinth adds an underwater theme and a twist: some tiles have special rules on their backsides. When a tile of this  type is pushed out, a special rule is used for the next turn:<br/><br/><br/>    Pufferfish: the current player is so scared from this fish that they lose their movement for the current turn.<br/>    Diving scooter: you move more quickly: take an additional turn<br/>    Oxygen tank: you don't have enough oxygen, so you must return your pawn to a freely chosen start tile.<br/><br/><br/>",

It's an experience of survival, betrayal, and fragile alliances in the moments before Earth is annihilated. Anyone who doesn't want to die on the soon-to-be-burning rock will have to team up with a partner to outfit their janky rocket transport for the interplanetary jump. But everyone's looking out for number one, and alliances can change at any time.<br/><br/>Every turn, each player secretly decides which direction to send their rocket. They reveal their choices simultaneously, then take turns collecting resources from the board, or stealing them from each other. This would all be safe and pleasant if it weren't for the deadly meteor that will strike at the end of the round, drastically altering the map and damaging any rockets in its path. One player knows in advance where the meteor will hit, but depending on who they choose to share that information with &hellip; well, friends tend to come and go during the meteor apocalypse.<br/><br/>To win the game, you and one other player will both need to acquire enough resources to launch, prep your rocket, then survive for one more round without getting stolen from or blown up. There's no limit on the number of teams that can pull this off &ndash; it's even possible for everyone (or almost everyone) to win, as long as everyone plays nice. But once the first wave of rockets launch, anybody left on the planet is stuck. The players who made it to space win; everyone else is obliterated by meteors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Geoff Noble - Designer<br/><br/>On the 15th December 1899 General Sir Redvers Buller tried to cross the Thukela River in order to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith. He was faced by well entrenched Boer commandos who inflicted a reverse upon the British that ultimately led to Buller being relieved of command.<br/><br/>Redvers Reverse is a solitaire area movement game that recreated the difficulties for the British in trying to affect a successful crossing of the Thukela against the Boer commandos (who are played by the game system).<br/><br/>The game is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced. The player is provided with the same level of information and ability to influence events.<br/><br/>Units are activated by orders sent from HQ to the various commanders, with the caveat that the receiving commander may not react as required. Orders remain in place until a rout or a commander initiative role. The nature of orders are to occupy a designated area.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved rolling a 10 sided dice with a minimum number to hit. The impact on the two sides, from hits received, differs considerably due to the asymmetrical situation, both historically and in game terms. In addition there are numerous die modifiers for Dug in (mostly Boer), Terrain of area, Density of units in the area, Flank fire etc etc.<br/><br/>Boer fire is usually determined by each Gruppe firing at the closest occupied area but there are certain designated exceptions.<br/><br/>Besides combat loses units can become Disrupted, Suppressed or Rout. Leaders can Stand Firm or Panic. Both Units and Leader can recover from these postures during the Recovery Phase.<br/><br/>For the British it is a race against time, the longer he delays the higher the Boer confidence goes, this is measured by a &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; which rises and falls according to events on the Battlefield. As the level of Boer confidence, alongside the extent of the Boer loses, is central to determining if the Boer retire and thus the British win, it must be kept low at all costs. This simple rule prevents the British concentrating against the Hlangwane and turning the Boer flank, he just hasn&rsquo;t got the time to redeploy his forces.<br/><br/>There will also be a simple rule to handle Hart&rsquo;s confusion when trying to find a fordable crossing of the Thukela.<br/><br/>The Boer Gruppe are in their historical positions but their exact Firepower can change slightly from turn to turn. The British player does not know the exact firepower of each Gruppe until they are engaged. As loses are inflicted upon the Boer&rsquo;s their firepower will slowly decline and the likelihood of them withdrawing slowly increase. Whether or not they withdraw is determined at the end of each game turn by revealing the full firepower available, the position on the &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; and a die role.<br/><br/>The British can win but it won&rsquo;t be easy, the system will win most of the time. The intention is for the player to feel that if I give it one more go I can do it.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>Map: 22&quot; x 34&quot; area map with a scale of 3&quot; to a mile.<br/>Units: Company/Battalion/Battery with individual leaders.<br/>Turn: 30 minutes each.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vive l'Empereur Series - Vol. VIII<br/>Quatre Batailles en Espagne (Four battles in Spain)<br/>Peninsular War, 1808-1814<br/><br/>Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.<br/><br/>Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.<br/><br/>Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.<br/><br/>Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.<br/><br/>(source: Legion Games website)<br/><br/>",

Which agency will be able to gather enough intel on their high profile targets and at what costs? Who will have built the best Shadow Network?<br/><br/>Shadow Network is a worker placement style game where players are deploying their agents around the globe collecting fragments of intel. These fragments are then promoted to an actionable state that can be used against a high profile target and earning player's influence &mdash; the currency in the game. As the players gather intel from a city, intel is also leaked to other cities thereby potentially helping other agencies. Additional agents can be deployed but at a cost. Furthermore, handlers can assist with exchanging intel thereby giving the agency the leg up. At end of four rounds of play, agencies will bribe their high profile targets for more influence.

It is played on a hexhex board and a sufficient supply of stacked checkers.<br/><br/>A stack can &quot;see&quot; a hex, when they are connected by a straight line, with no stacks in between. The players take turns placing stacks of their tokens on hexes that are seen by at least one friendly stack. The height of every newly-placed stack equals the number of your stacks that see the new stack. Replacing an existing stack with a new stack is possible, as long as the new stack is taller than the previous one. This works with opponent stacks (to capture), or your own stacks (to reinforce).<br/><br/>Before the game, the host sets up the board and the guest decides which side he wants to play.

If the building reaches the rightmost position, it is destroyed.<br/>Since the amount of cards in one's hand is the amount of mana the player gets at the beginning of their turn, and defeated creatures go back into your hand on the rightmost position, knowing which creature to play and which creature to let die is key to managing both your position on the board and your life total.<br/><br/>",

But winning or losing only depends on your decisions &ndash; not on dice or drawing luck. Join the ultimate battle between strategy and haphazardness. But keep an eye on the interests of your competitors and beware of Trolls, Thieves and Turnados.<br/><br/>The basic rules are simple. Secretly choose a hunter for a designated hunting area: Sea, Air, Forest or Plains. He or she will catch a creature for your awesome wildlife park. You get the creature unless another player has sent a hunter to the same hunting area. The shy creatures will hide if more than one hunter is in their area. So think ahead of your opponents.<br/><br/>Will they go for the most worthy creature? Will they try to block the creature you desperately need for a combo?

Pursued by two Union forces, Jackson decided to stand and fight before his opponents could effect a junction.  At Cross Keys, he easily repulsed General Fremont's half-hearted attack.  At Port Republic, after some of the bitterest fighting in Jackson's experience, he managed to rout General Shield's lead brigades.  These two battles sealed the fate of the Union campaign to subdue the Shenandoah Valley that year, and allowed Jackson to leave the Valley altogether and join Lee in the defense of Richmond.<br/><br/>Each hex on the mapboard represents 210 yards of real terrain from side to side.  Each Game-Turn represents 45 minutes during the day or 6 hours during the night.  The units are infantry and cavalry regiments, and sections of artillery.

Each game in the series uses a set of standard rules, which cover melee attack, small-arms and artillery fire, cavalry charges, and the effects of leadership.

The game is an action packed, fast strategy experience. Brightly colored tanks move across a hexagon-tiled battlefield filled with three-dimensional scenery representing trees, barns etc. The colorful board and the cute animals with a twist of historical characters make the game accessible to kids and hilarious to adults. We used the same principle while creating the rules, they have an increasing complexity to ensure fun for both beginners and hardcore players.<br/><br/>Armymals uses an intuitive system based on a set of unique dice and cards to generate a different choice of actions each turn. Animals in tanks are able to carry out many orders: moving, shooting, accumulating energy, using character skills, and more. To win, players have to collect victory points, which come from completing operations that are chosen at the beginning of the game and can be different each time. Depending on the active operations, players will have to destroy enemy tanks, capture the flag, control strategic locations, complete crazy tasks from mission deck, and more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "12 Days of Christmas is a card game designed by Dr. Gord Hamilton for 3-8 players.<br/><br/>To play, deal out twelve cards to each player; the deck consists of 78 cards: one 1, two 2s, and so on up to twelve 12s. By following the lead established by the first player, each player attempts to give away all of her cards before the other players can. The first player can lead a single card, a set of at least two cards of the same value, or a straight of at least two cards. The next players either pass or play a similar combination of cards (although not necessarily the same number of cards) that includes at least one card that's as low or lower than the lead player's low card. Whoever has played the lowest card once everyone has passed becomes the new lead player.<br/><br/>Whoever runs out of cards first claims one of the available gift cards; whoever has the most cards left in hand must give a gift card to this round's winner! Whoever has the most gifts when the gifts run out wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. The powers from those characters help collect valuable Dragonstones, lend their magical powers, help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.<br/><br/>For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time, and the winner of the auction gains control of the card's powers. Depending on the card, you may win additional coins or Dragonstones, gain powers, place spells on other players, or score points.<br/><br/>The rules of Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition have been updated from the original Fist of Dragonstones to improve gameplay, including the introduction of the King's Favor, which speeds up play. The game includes more than 70 special character cards in the game, compared to 25 special characters in the original game. Some of these special characters can be saved for later use in the game. Thematically and artistically, the game has been re-imagined into The Dragon &amp; Flagon universe.<br/><br/>The Legend:<br/>Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.<br/><br/>Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to Adventurers who could bring them the Dragonstones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures &mdash; all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.<br/><br/>This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend, yet at a cozy inn known as The Dragon &amp; Flagon, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the Adventurers that frequent the tavern. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade the Adventurers to recount some of the ancient tales. And if they take a particular liking to you, those Adventurers may bring out their own collection of magic coins and challenge you to a simple game of skill and luck, giving you a chance to have your own Fist of Dragonstones.<br/><br/>",

Each has a unique path to victory. The Octopus, known for its cunning and adaptability, sneaks around the board by playing cards and managing their hidden and revealed blocks, channeling the creature's remarkable ability to camouflage and deceive. On the other hand, the Shark, embodying the ruthless and determined predator, patrols their territory and attempts to hunt down the elusive Octopus by rolling dice and using special abilities to mitigate their luck, showcasing the creature's natural instincts and predatory behavior. The game is a thrilling mix of deck-building and dice bag building, as well as hide and seek, bluffing, and manipulation.<br/><br/>In hopes of providing a deeply immersive experience, the designer Carl Robinson has incorporated the authentic characteristics and strategies of these marine animals into the gameplay. Carl was inspired by a moment in the Netflix documentary &lsquo;My Octopus Teacher&rsquo;, in which the octopus&rsquo;s behavior was so ludic and sneaky that it was his wish for players to not only engage in a thrilling battle of wits but also gain a deeper understanding of the fascinating lives of these animals in their natural habitat.<br/><br/>With stunning illustrations by renowned artist Weberson Santiago, Kelp promises to be just as visually striking as it is engaging.<br/><br/>",

The game is divided up into 2 separate rounds.<br/><br/>In the first round, each player takes turns being the judge. The faces-line-up board is filled with 6 male faces. Then the judge reads an impressions card aloud. It will say something like &quot;The Republican&quot; or &quot;The one who just ate something sour.&quot; Then the judge chooses which numbered face best fits the description and places that numbered card facedown on the table, and all the other players try to match the judge's number. Players that matched the judge move one space, and the judge moves one space for each player that matched. Then the selected face is replaced, and the judgeship passes to the next player. Once everyone has been the judge twice for Male faces, you do the same for Female faces, and then for Animal faces. The first round ends when everyone has been the judge 6 times (2 for each type of face.)<br/><br/>In the second round, the number cards are put aside and players are dealt a hand made up of 2 Male, 2 Female, and 2 Animal faces. Players again take turns being the judge, and the judge again reads an Impressions card. Then the judge looks away and the other players put out a face from their hand that they think best matches the description. Once all the choices are out, the judge selects the best one.

Will you be the last one standing to claim the title of Kung Fu Master?<br/><br/>Kung Fu is a dice-driven card game for 2-5 players to compete for the title of Kung Fu Master. After drafting 10 Kung Fu cards and adjusting the initial status, each player will play 3 cards from their hand simultaneously for each round. Based on the overall initiative values, players will take turns to be the attacker while all the others must defend for themselves. During the fight, each player rolls their own 7 dice and assign them in sets to activate their three Kung Fu cards to attack or defend.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one player standing, or after three rounds, the player with the most HP remaining wins!<br/><br/>",

After your move, you may place markers in an adjacent triangle &ndash; exactly as many markers as the number of steps you made and always only in one triangle.<br/><br/>So far, this seems pretty easy to manage. But after that, you may exchange opposing markers for your own. This changes the majorities within the areas very quickly, and therefore you won't be able to determine the winner until shortly before the game's conclusion.<br/><br/>In the end, only the majority of markers per area counts. Until then, players fight for each triangle, and ownership changes constantly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legend has it that a long time ago, mankind was ignorant to the extent of not knowing how to count or tell the years apart. The ever-benevolent Jade Emperor wanted to help mankind out. From there, the idea of a twelve-year cycle and the naming of each year in the cycle after an animal was born.<br/><br/>But how should the Jade Emperor choose twelve animals from among so many animals in the living world, while remaining impartial? To resolve this equitably, the Jade Emperor decided to hold a race involving all animals on his birthday. The first twelve animals to cross the river and reach the Heavenly Palace will have a year named after them, in the order of how they finished the race. The race became known as The Great Race and the twelve-year cycle was named the Chinese Zodiac.<br/><br/>Race for the Chinese Zodiac is a board game that recreates The Great Race. Each player has a hand of eight action cards (numbered 1-8) as well as energy cards of different values and karma tokens. Each player selects one animal token and takes the corresponding animal card, which grants the player advantages during the race. All players place their animal token on the start space of the racetrack. Players assemble the dual-layered and double-sided action wheel that's used to determine the effectiveness of each action and place it in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, all players select an action card and an energy card from their hand, then they reveal these cards simultaneously. If the action card selected is one value lower than the player's previously played action card, the player must spend one karma token; if two or more values lower, they must spend two karma tokens. Players then resolve all played actions based on the orientation of the wheel, ideally gaining movement, new energy cards, and karma. Everyone places their played cards face up in front of themselves, then rotate the wheel clockwise by one space and start a new turn.<br/><br/>The first animal to complete the race earns the coveted right of having the first year of the Chinese Zodiac named after it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only recently have you discovered how to extract iron from the ore in the peat bogs, and it's best to use your new discovery before others use it against you. As a Teutonic lord, your duty is to ensure your family line is preserved and that your land prospers and grows. Of course, every other lord seems to be thinking the same thing. The gods grant favors both to control creatures and to aid your goals. Make the proper sacrifices to the &AElig;sir to appease their whims, and you will win the game.<br/><br/>In Asgard's Chosen, you build armies to achieve the desires of the gods. Each god has a request and will help you to gain ground. You use the favor of the gods to aid your cause, and in return you appease their desires. In order to win you will need to appease the various gods in your deck. Appeasing gods requires dramatic losses to your position or the composition of your deck. When you appease the appropriate number of gods, the game ends, and whoever has appeased the most gods wins.<br/><br/>The game board is composed of different landscape tiles: Mountains, Forest, Hills, Scrub, Bog, and Lakes. Each tile contains two different terrain types and an enchanted land. Players will create the board in the beginning of the game by joining the tiles together. City tiles are used to fill in some of the open square spaces on the map not used by enchanted lands. There are a number of different kinds of cards in the game: God Cards, Creature Cards, Town Item Cards, Enchanted Item Cards, and Event Cards. Players build a deck with cards to take over land and to battle each other.<br/><br/>Asgard's Chosen plays with 2-4 players, and includes both a solitaire version and a two-player co-op version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Fury at Midway&quot; has been originally published in Japanese by Bonsai Game as &ldquo;Midway: Turning the Tide in the Pacific&rdquo;. Changes in this Revolution Games version include making it a two map game, one for each player, which makes for an increased degree of hidden information regarding air strikes, damage, and combat air patrol. Four additional event cards were added to better cover the range of historical events of the battle. Anti-aircraft fire was reduced and rules for hitting the wrong carrier force were introduced. The map areas were expanded a hex row and the counter art was redone as well as many other small changes.<br/><br/>The game system is primarily one of air operations. When to strike and with what planes is the primary question of the game. This is balanced by how you defend your own fleet and the island of Midway for the Americans or the invasion fleet for the Japanese. The Japanese have to either take Midway or win the carrier battle to win the game and having two objectives really challenges the Japanese player to make a good plan while the American situation is simpler but his forces are not as well trained and errors in navigation, strike coordination, escort, etc can take a toll. Surface forces are not shown in the game except in their effects in AAA, bombardment, or the slight chance of an abstract night surface battle. This is a simple yet pretty accurate version of Midway that was a lot of fun during testing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These cards allow players to host festivities with the help of their fellow mollies and create joy. But, those same cards can also lead players to be arrested and to the ultimate ruin of the molly house.<br/><br/>As players encounter the Society&rsquo;s enforcers, they will often have to pay bribes or may be coerced into becoming informers for the Society.

This is a very playable game with two sheets of large die-cut counters, one map of Russia and bordering states, at a scale of about 33 miles per hex, 15 days per game-turn. Each unit counter roughly represents a division.<br/><br/>The Invasion of Russia (1812) is very much a wargame, with an emphasis is upon the challenges of leading and co-ordinating armies during the Napoleonic period. Victory will generally go to the player who is best able to formulate and implement a cogent strategy aimed at attaining well defined objectives, whilst allowing a margin of error for enemy action and ill-fortune.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>    A 24&quot;x17&quot; map of Russia and Eastern Europe<br/>    A rules booklet<br/>    2 Charts<br/>    A sheet with 216 large ( 5/8&quot; ) counters<br/>    A set of 36 Random Event Cards (for the Advanced Game)<br/>    Cover-folder<br/><br/>(from publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Radetzky's March: The Hundred Hours Campaign&quot; allows you to fight the 1849 campaign and the bloody battle of Novara<br/><br/>March 20th, 1849: the Piedmontese forces, about 85,000 men with just over a hundred guns, are positioned around Novara, ready to to cross the Ticino river and invade the Austrian territory, moving towards Milan, in an attempt to regain it.<br/><br/>Field Marshal Radetzky, commander in chief of the Austrian forces, 83 years old, conceives a daring plan: to concentrate all his forces, about 75,000 men with over 200 guns, right around Pavia, ready to cross the Ticino, quickly invade Piedmont and force the piedmontese army to a decisive battle.<br/><br/>Counters represent all the military forces of the time: Hussars, Uhlans, Dragoons, Line infantry, Grenzer, J&auml;ger, Artillery, Bersaglieri, Pontoon Crew, Commanders.<br/><br/>On a very accurate map that took years of research, Austrians and Piedmontese troops engage in bloody attacks and retreats, cavalry charges, strategic movement, pontoon building ...<br/><br/>All these actions are performed by the players alternatively, but not in a conventional two-turn system. The game features a random activation mechanism that makes it always compelling and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.<br/><br/>The heart of the system is the command: simply check how many points you have in the turn, choose the formations you will activate, put them inside a mug;  your opponent does the same, then mix and draw.<br/><br/>GAME SCALE<br/>- Complexity: 2 out of 5 <br/>- Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 5 <br/>- Time Scale: Three hours turn<br/>- Map Scale: 1km/hex <br/>- Unit Scale: Regiments with their guns, battalions, two squadrons of cavalry<br/>- Players: one or two <br/>- Playing Time: two to six hours<br/><br/>WHAT'S IN THE BOX?<br/>- One 22 x 34 inch map (55,8 x 86,5 cm)<br/>- 216 counters  <br/>- Two player aid, colored cardboard (Terrain effect chart and Fast placement sheet) <br/>- Rule Booklet (with complete order of battle, game tips, campaign history and sources) <br/>- One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Included scenarios  - In addition to the basic game, there are some scenarios and variants that allow for shorter games and explore other strategies:<br/>- Mortara and the Sforzesca, the Piedmontese attempt to stop the Austrian advance <br/>- Novara, the bloody final battle <br/>- Ramorino obeys orders; this scenario allows the Piedmontese to deploy the V division at the beginning of the game<br/><br/>",

Then recruit, dig at your own risks and fight!<br/><br/>Beardiest player can begin! Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, each player taking one turn at a time until the game ends.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player must perform one (and only one) of the 2 following actions:<br/><br/>     Play a Dwarf and apply its effect<br/><br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>     Recruit a Dwarf<br/><br/><br/>A player can play one (and only one) &laquo;Dwarf&raquo; card on their turn.

Each has a particular effect:<br/><br/>    A Warrior can fight enemies and make the access to the mine harder for other players.<br/>    A Scout is allowed to see the 3 or 5 first cards of a Mine (depending on their Recon Value) without showing opponents...<br/>    A Digger can, of course, dig in a Mine and try to find treasure!<br/>    The Blaster makes all the Warriors in a mine run away. All Warriors are discarded.<br/><br/><br/>To recruit a Dwarf, the active player picks a &laquo;Dwarf&raquo; card available in the &laquo;recruitment center&raquo; and adds it to their hand. Then they immediately put a replacement card face-up from the deck to have 5 cards in the row again. A player cannot have more than 6 cards in their hand.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when 2 of the 3 decks of &laquo;Mine&raquo; cards are empty.

In Borodino 20, players can recreate the historical battle and the human foibles of the commanders fighting it. In addition, they can experiment with scenarios presuming a faster Russian response to the French threat, or Napoleon heeding the advice of his &ldquo;Iron Marshal,&rdquo; Davout, to try a daring flanking maneuver.<br/><br/>Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; which gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Smolensk 20<br/>    Napoleonic 20 Expansion Kit<br/>    Berezina 20<br/><br/><br/>Part of the Napoleonic 20 series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board game Rancho is the younger sister of the well-known and acclaimed game Super Farmer, which was designed by Karol Borsuk (an eminent Polish mathematician and professor at Warsaw University) in 1943 during World War II. After the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, the university was closed and the professor lost his job. He came up with the idea to sell the game to financially support his family. In occupied Warsaw, &quot;Hodowla zwierzątek&quot; (&quot;Little animal farm&quot;) &ndash; as the game was then known &ndash; became extremely popular. After the end of the war, the game was forgotten and it reappeared on store shelves only in the 1990s through Granna.<br/><br/>Rancho, designed by Michael Stajszczak, was made to honor the memory of Karol Borsuk and to commemorate the success of &quot;Hodowla zwierzątek&quot;, a.k.a. Super Farmer. Rancho expands the possibilities which Karol Borsuk's original game presented to players as now farmers must not only exchange their animals well and breed them, but also plan purchases of pastures on which to graze their herds.<br/> In more detail, you breed animals in order to have the best ranch in the region. You buy pastures so that your animals will have a place to live. Your animals breed and this brings you profit. You can convert animals to other types of animals if you decide it's worth it, or you can buy more pastures to have space for more animals. To win, you must be the first to collect a herd consisting of at least a horse, a cow, a sheep, and a rabbit. But all your plans can go awry if you are not careful because in the nearby forest there are prowling predators, specifically a wolf and a fox. Your animals can easily become their prey...<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>     Super Farmer<br/><br/><br/>",

The war like its predecessor, the War of the Spanish Succession (excellently portrayed by Don Herndon&rsquo;s No Peace Without Spain!) was fought primarily to determine who would succeed to the throne of a great empire, in this case the Austrian Empire. When the current ruler of the Austrian crown lands and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Charles VI died without male issue he had laid the groundwork for his eldest daughter Maria Theresa to succeed to the Hapsburg crown lands.  Known as the &ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rdquo;, this diplomatic effort obtained the agreement of the leading powers of Europe to her accession to the Hapsburg dominions and the election of her paramour as the next Holy Roman Emperor. However, with the opportunistic seizure of Silesia by the young Frederick the Great of Prussia, the agreement unraveled and the war began.  In time, it would involve virtually all of Europe.<br/><br/>One player represents the Austrian interest represented by the Austrians and those powers in Europe faithful to the original agreement, (&ldquo;the Pragmatic Alliance&rdquo;). The other player represents the challengers to the Austrians, the Bavarian rival for the Imperial title, Charles Albert and his supporters, primarily the Bourbon rulers of France and Spain intermittently joined by Prussia (&ldquo;the Bourbons&rdquo;). Each &ldquo;faction/alliance&rdquo; consists of a number of allied powers representing the military forces of various states and royal houses of Europe.<br/><br/>The simulation is based upon the &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; system, yet adapted to reflect the historical situation of 1741. Victory is determined by the faction that more closely obtains their goals - represented by victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game explores the modern combat tactics of World War II and the usage of combined arms, with a new innovative battle system. The battle wheels for land and sea combat reduce die-rolling luck and promote the use of well-balanced forces.<br/><br/>Players represent German East and West fronts, the Soviet Union and the Western Powers. In the 3 and 4 player variants players have to balance co-operation with competition since only one player can win the game. <br/>Each player has access to various resources such as different ground troops, warships, aircraft and industrial regions. In turn, each player produce new troops, move units and engage in battle when confronted with the enemy. The goal is to take control over enemy production centers.<br/><br/>The game is quick to learn with a comic-book tutorial and short rules, and quick to set up with starting positions illustrated on the game board.<br/>The game includes 360 sculpted plastic playing pieces of 8 different types, a mounted game board and two mounted battle wheels, dice and markers, a comic-book tutorial and a rules booklet with historical background.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tara each player strives to become Ard Ri or High King of Ireland.  Through the play of cards representing your supporters and the use of 'cumals' (a cumal is worth three cows), you attempt to promote your followers from Farmers to Herdsmen, through Warriors to Chieftains and finally to the ruling King in the region.<br/><br/>Tara is played in rounds of three cards.  A round is completed when each player has used three cards.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.<br/><br/>In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.<br/><br/>When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:<br/>A    Place pieces into a region;<br/>B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;<br/>C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;<br/>D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.<br/><br/>If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.<br/><br/>By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.<br/><br/>After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.<br/><br/>",

The game is scenario-driven, and you never know when a player &mdash; or which player &mdash; will turn into a monster (the deranged of the title). The only way to turn back into a human is to kill another player. There is no player elimination, but each death increases the level of doom, with the player receiving a curse or with other bad stuff possibly happening to the group as a whole. You might have better odds of surviving Deranged if you form temporary alliances, but good luck keeping those in place when you might have to kill one another...<br/><br/>Deranged includes deck-building elements, and each player has their own hidden objective.

        "description": "Europe in Turmoil II follows in the footsteps of Europe in Turmoil I. Once again, two players take sides in this political CDG set in the Interbellum era between the two World Wars, this time one representing the Moderate Left (socialists and liberals), and the other player representing the Moderate Right of the time (conservatives and nationalists).<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are rather similar to those of Europe in Turmoil I, with the main changes being the replacement of the Naval Arms Race by seven concurrent Rearmament races (for each of the six scoring regions of the game plus the Soviet Union) and the removal of the stability and mobilization decks in lieu of a new extremist marker that facilitates support checks.<br/><br/>While players represent moderates, the cards they are using contain some of the more extreme people and factions of the period. It is possible to harness their large political prowess in order to make quick gains, but at the cost of becoming less and less moderate, which may eventually hamper your possibility to win the long game.<br/><br/>The map represents the political reality of Europe in the Interbellum, divided in six scoring regions (Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain and the Little Entente of Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechoslovakia).<br/><br/>Play progresses over three periods: The Roaring Twenties, followed by the Great Depression and finally the Appeasement period.<br/><br/>Europe is in Turmoil again! Will you be the one to extinguish the forces of extremism, or will you fan the flames on your way to Domination?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Terra Futura is an engine-building card game, in which you build your land of tomorrow. By placing and activating cards in your territory you get resources and goods. Try to be more effective than your opponents and you win the game.<br/><br/>There are many ways to build your economy. You may take a quick route resulting in pollution, or you can take it slow and clean. In every turn you choose a card from the display and place it in your territory in front of you. This will activate all the cards in a column and a row in which you placed the new card. So, think twice where you put each card.<br/><br/>Pollution is a vital part of the game. Using international transport and speeding your production may help you get needed resources faster, but it creates pollution, which may block your cards and even stop you from scoring some of your resources. But using it carefully might lead to victory.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players built their territory of 9 cards (3 &times; 3 grid). At the end they activate their territory once more based on their secret scoring card. Players get victory point based on resources and goods they acquired during the game and they score bonus points from their secret scoring cards. Before the winner is announced they subtract points for each polluted card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website (fireandfury.com):<br/><br/>Regimental Fire and Fury: <br/>Wargaming the Civil War with Miniatures<br/><br/>By Rich Hasenauer<br/><br/>Fire and Fury is one of the most popular historical military miniatures wargames in the hobby. This new regimental edition provides players a more in-depth look at American Civil War combat. The smaller scale allows you to take command of individual regiments and batteries and refight in greater detail many of the war's smaller engagements, as well as critical actions of the conflict's famous battles.<br/><br/>For the new player it is an easy game to learn and enjoy. The veteran Fire and Fury gamer will find much that is familiar, like the play sequence, maneuver table, and combat system, while discovering a game taken to a new level of sophistication. Refined game mechanics strike a balance between playability and historical accuracy that draw upon twenty years of the Fire and Fury gaming experience.<br/><br/>Brief Description<br/><br/>Scope. A set of wargame rules using military miniatures, that allows players to recreate the small engagements and portions of larger battles of the American Civil War, 1861-1864.<br/><br/>Scale. Tactical. 10-15 minutes per turn. 1&quot; = 25 yards. Units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and gun sections grouped into batteries for artillery. Intended for 15mm figures, other scale figures can be used by increasing or decreasing the basing and ground scales as described in the rules.<br/><br/>Basing. Each 1&quot; x 3/4&quot; stand with 3 infantry figures, and 1&quot; x 1&quot; with 2 cavalry figures, represents 40 men. Each 1&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; stand with a gun model and 2 or 3 figure crew represents a 2-gun section. Unit size can range from 3 to 20 troop stands per regiment, with the average of 8-12 stands per unit. Batteries are represented by 2 to 3 gun stands.<br/><br/>Game Turn Sequence. A game turn is divided into an alternating Union player turn and Confederate player turn. Players must follow the Player Turn Sequence. Each player turn consists of three phases. One phase must be completed before moving to the next. Some activities in a phase are performed by the opposing player or jointly by both players.<br/><br/>Maneuver Phase - In the first phase of a player turn the player must resolve a maneuver check for each unit which he controls on the game table. A maneuver check involves either one or more units under the command of a single leader, or a single unit that is out of command. The maneuver check combines the elements in warfare of morale, command and control into a single die roll procedure using the Maneuver Table. The effects from the table describe the movement and other maneuvers that each unit is allowed or required to perform in this phase.<br/><br/>Musketry and Cannonade Phase - There are two kinds of combat in the game: fire combat and charge combat. All fire combat is resolved in the second phase of the player turn. Both Union and Confederate units may fire during this phase. The phase consists of two rounds of fire combat. It begins with a round of defensive fire followed by a round of offensive fire. In the Confederate player turn only Union units may defensive fire, and only Confederate units may offensive fire. During the Union player turn the order is reversed with Confederate defensive fire followed by Union offensive fire. All fire combat is resolved using the Musketry &amp; Cannonade Table to determine casualties and other combat effects.<br/><br/>Charge Phase - In the third and final phase of a player turn a charge combat must be resolved wherever a charging unit made contact with the enemy. The relative position between attacking and defending units will determine which combats need to be divided into less complex combat situations. Both sides then follow a joint die roll procedure to resolve a round of charge combat. The Charge Table is used to determine casualties and other combat effects. Depending on the results of the first round of combat, a second round of breakthrough charge combat may follow after all first round charge combats are resolved. After all charge combat is resolved, the current player turn ends and the next player turn begins.<br/><br/>Battle Scenarios. The book provides guidelines for designing your own scenarios and six historical scenarios covering different periods and theaters of the war:<br/><br/>1.The Battle of Ball's Bluff, October 21, 1861.<br/>2.Bloody Hill, The Battle of Wilson's Creek, August 10, 1861.<br/>3.Casey's Redoubt, The Battle of Seven Pines, May 31, 1862. <br/>4.The Battle Comes to Sheridan, The Battle of Stones River, December 31, 1862.<br/>5.Little Round Top, The Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863.<br/>6.The Battle of Olustee, February 20, 1864.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Final Fantasy VIII contained a sub game called &quot;Triple Triad.&quot;  This game was actually sold in card form.  Boosters only.  10 cards per booster.  5 game cards, 5 visual art cards.  No modifications made.  Now internet play has been fan-made.  Only published in Japan to my knowledge.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Play is on a 3x3 grid.  Each player has 5 cards he does not show the other player.  Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are &quot;levels&quot; of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a &quot;compass rose&quot; of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you &quot;flip&quot; mine, and both are now your color.  You are trying to get the most cards to your color.  You can &quot;chain&quot; cards too.  If you flip a card, it can flip other cards.  Each card is only flipped once per turn.  Some cards have an elemental symbol on them, giving a +1 number bonus against anything not of that element.<br/><br/>The nice thing is you only need 5 cards.  In FFVIII, you could actually take one of your opponent's cards they played with if you won.  House rules for this type of play vary.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card Football is a playing card-based board game which follows the basic rules of American football. Players battle to win the down by playing the strongest hand.<br/><br/>Game play combines elements of classic playing card games to simulate the action on the field. Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style 'Power Hands'. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play strong card(s) immediately, or to hold back in hopes of using it to put together a stronger hand.<br/><br/>Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.<br/><br/>Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on 'the system' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, or after a few series of downs.<br/><br/>If it happens on the field, you'll find it in Card Football. From field goals, punts and extra points, to fumbles, interceptions and last-second heroics, you get it all in four quarters of Card Football action.<br/><br/>",

In doing so, the bustling guilds both have an eye on the other guilds and the dreaded Circumdate Caelo Trust, which also lays claim to this region and does not shy away from using military means.<br/><br/>Players assume control over a steam guild and explore the newly opened region for natural resources, gaining crystal and ore samples, and building new mines to exploit the land. The government of Tharos awards different medals for the players&rsquo; services, which increase the influence of their steam guilds with the player ideally winning enough influence to take over as leader of their guild.<br/><br/>Tharos is a &ldquo;Dice-Bag-Building&rdquo; game, where dice represent actions and their respective strengths. The dice are used on the player boards and for activation and usage of the player cards. Additionally, each player has a deck of cards that could substantially help them achieve their goals.<br/><br/>The game plays over the course of four rounds with four turns per round. The &quot;game board&quot; consists of a 4x4 grid formed by the 16 region cards. After setup, one player reveals the top attack card. Afterwards the players determine the transformer effect. Now each player draws dice out of their bag (normally 5) and rolls them. Then, each player takes one action with one or more of their dice, until all players have used all of their dice.<br/><br/>Dice may be placed on a player&acute;s own player mat;<br/>To use an already built Public Building;<br/>To activate one of their own Player Cards; or<br/>To use an active Player Card<br/><br/>At the end of a turn the players have to defend themselves against the attack of the Circumdate Caelo Trust.

You&rsquo;ll play as a powerful Sage, summoning warriors from the Twig, Leaf, Droplet, and Pebble factions and fighting to prove your prowess. As the battle continues, you&rsquo;ll level up and gain access to extraordinary abilities and fierce new recruits. Protect your Sage at all costs and vanquish your opponents to earn the title of Master of the Elements!<br/><br/><br/><br/>How to PlayYour turn is divided into four phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1<br/>During Phase I, you&rsquo;ll use daybreak effects denoted on the cards in your formation! You may use those effects in any order during Phase I of your turn. If you continue to Phase II without using a daybreak effect, you may not use it later in your turn.<br/><br/>Phase 2<br/>During Phase II, you'll have 4 Action Points (AP) to spend doing any of the following: <br/> - Summon an Elemental from your hand to the formation<br/> - Play a Command card from your hand<br/> - Swap the positions of 2 connected Elementals in your formation<br/> - Draw a card from your deck<br/><br/>As the game progresses, you'll be able to unlock special Faction Actions after you've defeated 4, 6, and 8 of your opponents Elementals! Faction Actions are powerful abilities that give you a leg up during the game.<br/><br/>Phase 3<br/>During Phase III, you may use your gold to buy cards from the markets, sell cards to collect more gold, and refresh the markets.<br/><br/>Phase 4<br/>During Phase IV, you&rsquo;ll clean up your hand before ending your turn. Do this by discarding any number of cards from your hand, then draw from your deck until you have 5 cards in your hand. If you have more than 5 cards in your hand when you reach Phase IV of your turn, you must discard cards until you have no more than 5.<br/><br/>The game ends when your opponent's Sage has been defeated!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The tribe that makes the most prestigious totem poles wins the contest...<br/><br/>In Wakanda, players compete to create valuable totem poles, but the value of the poles is determined as much by where they stand as by what's in them. Each player starts the game with three headdresses. Six of eight village tiles are placed in a row, with three of the tiles tilted 90&ordm; to show that they're out of play; each tile has a unique scoring rule on it, and that rule will apply for all of a player's totem poles if he acquires that tile.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player first draws one totem pole from the bag; the game includes 21 totem pole pieces: one eagle, two chiefs, three tomahawks, four animal skins, five teepees and six suns. The player then either places one of his totem pole pieces on an available village tile OR places one of his headdresses on an existing totem pole to claim it; in the latter case, he places this tile in front of himself and tilts the next village tile in line (if any) to make it available for play.<br/><br/>Once all six poles have been claimed, the players tally their score based on the rules on their tiles, e.g. score 3 points per animal skin on all of your poles or score 2 points per piece for your tallest pole. High score wins.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most captivating story will be the winner!<br/><br/>In twelve turns players will fill their maps with events the heroes must get through. It sits right in the flip &amp; write genre, where two event cards are drawn each. Every player must choose one of these events and draw its symbol onto their map. There is a catch though. The third card drawn each turn is a landscape card and limits your choices.<br/><br/>Players must be careful, plan and make sure the hero gets equipment before taking on a Boss, or not facing many enemies before visiting a resting place. There are many events players can choose to maximize their points, such as magical portals, saving a princess, catching fish or finding a treasure.<br/><br/>Balada can be played in two difficulty modes. In standard play your hero makes a journey to the mountain and then back again on the second side of the map. And because they transfer unhealed wounds and unused equipment, it is possible to count on a long-run strategy. Easy variant lets you play on one side of the map with only one deck of 12 event cards without getting to choose from two events every round. You still have to think hard about where to draw the event though.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As they wield their influence to amass support, players must choose&hellip;.will they use that power to bring unity amongst the clans of the Wildlands... or will they seek domination.... All the while they must be wary of subterfuge from the other players, who they see as insidious imposters...<br/><br/>Arkon is a fast paced strategy card game, played from one central deck of 52 cards. Players must win clans, either through a bidding process, that functions like an silent auction, or through using their cards as actions, to take other players clans. The first player to get each of the four clans, or four of one type of clan out into play, wins.<br/><br/>Arkon hinges around a few central dynamics. First, cards can be played in multiple ways. Players will constantly be challenged to make tradeoffs, as they choose whether to use a card for some sort of advantage, keep it as a counter (all action cards can be countered by their matching action card) or use the card for its influence value to win a bid and move the player closer to winning the game. Because cards double as influence, and winning bids is a key component of your victory condition, Arkon reduces the &quot;dead card in hand&quot; phenomenon.<br/><br/>Arkon pushes you to create a game plan but also to stay dynamic, as opponent's actions may force you down a different path. Because all players draw on each turn, you are constantly getting new cards in hand and new options to leverage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The twist? Art school really broke the bank, so you must share a canvas with your rival classmates!<br/><br/>Abstract Academy is played over three rounds by either two or four players, with the players completing a new canvas each round. At the start of the game, you lay out 2-3 scoring cards for each round, so you all know what you're trying to achieve to score. Additionally, at the start of each round, each player receives an inspiration card that shows a pattern they're trying to create on the canvas.<br/><br/>In the two-player game, players take turns playing canvas cards into a shared 4x4 play area, and in the four-player game, they play in a shared 5x5 area. Canvas cards are divided into quadrants, and each quadrant is colored yellow, red, or blue. The canvas grows organically as you all play cards, and the edges aren't fixed until you have four (or five) cards in a row or column. The edge of the canvas closest to you is your home row, and once the canvas is locked in size, no one else can play in your home row (unless all other spaces are filled).<br/><br/>Once the canvas is filled, the two rows closest to you form your scoring zone. If the color patterns in your zone complete a scoring card better than the patterns in anyone else's zone, then you claim the scoring card. Additionally, if you've created the right pattern in your scoring zone, you can score your inspiration card. Whoever has the most points after three rounds is the star pupil of Abstract Academy and wins!<br/><br/>Admin note: The logo of Flatout Games is shown on the English-language edition of Abstract Academy, but Flatout Games is not involved with the publication of this game.<br/><br/>",

But you got the chance to run a club. A very small club, of course. But hey, you got to start at the bottom.<br/><br/>Club Stories is a game for 1 or 2 players. You play solo or co-op. You try to defeat the 5 different scenarios in the right order. Every next scenario has its own story. If you win it, you move on to the next scenario. You may move on to a bigger club. Of course you can also replay the scenario&lsquo;s to defeat your high score and reach higher levels of professionalism.<br/><br/>The goal of every scenario is to reach a certain level. In the 1st scenario you have to reach the level of unexperienced professional manager. If you earn enough manager points during season (respect) you win the scenario. But every scenario has different season goals. Reaching these goals, may help you earn the manager points. For example, In the 1st scenario you try to prevend relegation, in the 2nd you try to get rid of all the corruption and in the 5th scenario you want to finish your new stadium in time.<br/><br/>The game is played over 8-10 rounds, depending on which scenario you play. Every turn you use 6 dice to plan your actions. There is a realistic push-your-luck system in the game which fits to the theme very well. You can push your chance up to 100%.<br/><br/>Your turn always starts with a board meeting. Your 3 board members will make a decision about a dilemma. Choose your board members well, because they have different opinions about a football club. You may want to attend the meeting and use your dice to influence decisions. After this, you plan your actions. Hire players, staff, send scouts to watch opponents or players, train tactics, hire a sponsor, etc.<br/><br/>You try to keep the markers on the 4 tracks on the board (income, fitness, morale and popularity) as high as possible. Otherwise, bad things may happen. For example, if your morale is low, your players may get suspended more often. After planning your actions, you choose tactics, select your team and play the match. If your form is high, you may end up high in the league. But bigger clubs will be intested in your players more often. Can you convince them to stay? There is a lot going on in Club Stories.<br/><br/>",

In a fragile monarchy, each member of the court will scheme to achieve as much influence on the coming succession as possible. And if victory seems impossible, it might be time to plan your revenge.<br/><br/>There are seven unique characters in the game, each with its own special abilities and victory conditions. The King can be played by a Game Master but this is not mandatory, though reccomended. More players can act the roles of minor character, roleplaying the effects of the various cards being played. The seven unique characters are:<br/><br/>    Ambassador<br/>    Archbishop<br/>    Baron<br/>    Queen<br/>    Royal Bastard<br/>    Steward<br/>    Treasurer<br/><br/><br/>Long Live the King is a live-action strategy game that blends diplomacy and backstabbing with strategic control of cards and limited ressources. During the game, each player will receive money and intrique cards and use these to increase their favor with the king, make alliances with other player or further their own goals. But as each player has a unique victory condition, alliances never lasts long in the court of the king. There are three distinct phases in the game, in the Audience phase ressources are distributed, in the Diplomacy phase off-table diplomacy occurs and finally the Council Phase is where players will make and discuss petitions. There is also a heavy emphasis on roleplaying, and each card and ability is recommended to be acted out by the players, as the King can grant Favor to those who perform particularly dramatic or cunning.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    31-page Rulebook<br/>    Seven Player Portfolios<br/>    Royal Bag of Coin<br/>    Coins of the Realm<br/>    200 cards divided into six different types<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>From award-winning designer Ted S. Raicer, The Fall of the Third Reich covers the dramatic last two years of WWII in Europe, as the Western Allies and the Soviet Union fight against fierce German resistance to bring down the Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>The time is July, 1943. From the beaches of Sicily to the plains of central Russia, millions of men are poised to decide the fate of Europe and bring about the end of WWII...<br/><br/>Two large hex maps cover Europe from France to Central Russia, and Leningrad to Sicily. Units are Armies, Corps, and in a few cases, Divisions. There are twelve two-month turns.<br/><br/>Those turns play quickly, and yet there is a lot of subtlety within each one, with rules for both reaction and exploitation. Getting the most out of the various movement segments is essential for both players: as the Axis for plugging gaps in the front line, and as the Allies for exploiting every last opportunity to move ever further into the Third Reich proper. But the German player will quickly learn that a passive defense is doomed to fail, and that selective counterattacks are vital to hold the enemy at bay.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for Soviet and German Command (Stavka), while the effects of Hitler's increasing interference in military affairs is presented through a rule which requires the German player to use OKW (West Front Headquarters) or OKH (East Front HQ) to be able to retreat infantry units from an enemy ZOC.<br/><br/>While the Soviets and Germans begin the game locked in a death struggle at Kursk, the Allies face the early dilemma of where to invade, with a choice of invasion sites ranging from Holland to Greece. Knock Italy out of the war or Second Front Now! in Northwest Europe: the choices are yours.<br/><br/>Supply rules have been kept as simple as possible, while still modeling the historic importance of logistics. The Western Allies in particular will learn the importance of ports in supplying their armies, and have to base their strategy around them.<br/><br/>Perhaps most significantly, the game effectively models the Strategic Air War over Europe with only a few simple rules and a handful of counters. But though easy to learn, this &lsquo;game within a game&rsquo; can have a dramatic impact upon the course of the war, as the Allies must prioritize their air resources while the Luftwaffe struggles both to slow the Allied air offensive and support the German armies in the field. The challenges are numerous and subtle.<br/><br/>Other rules cover variable (and degrading) German troop strength,  Allied Airborne drops, Strategic Transit, Forts, Yugoslav Partisans, and Axis Minor Powers, including Italian Surrender<br/><br/>The game can be played by two (Axis and Allied/Soviet) or three players (Axis, Allied and Soviet) but also works well solo. The Fall of the Third Reich is a game of large scope and nail-biting decisions, combining fidelity to history with a fun playable game system.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months<br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 30 miles<br/>Unit Scale: Armies, Corps and some Divisions<br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played well with 3 players or solitaire<br/>Playing Time: 6-10 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europe, end of 20th century. Our economy runs entirely on fossil gas and coal-fired power plants. Climate change is a fact. Which region will have sustainable (non-fossil) electricity production first and wins the game?<br/><br/>Each game round, the electricity demand (in GW) in your region increases due to the fate of the Dice. It's up to you to build power stations to produce the required GW demand. This provides you with income, with which you can eventually close the old fossil power stations and replace them with sustainable power stations that do not emit CO2. You can trade GW surpluses and GW shortages with the other players or External Markets to balance supply and demand.<br/><br/>So are you going to increase sustainability quickly (with the risk of GW shortages), or are you more careful (at the risk of being late)? The region that is the first to produce more GW than the GW demand and has closed all its fossil power plants, wins. But beware, wind and solar energy sometimes only generate half of their GW power peak.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

(This was the last of the three liberation wars fought between Cuba and Spain; the previous wars were the Ten Years' War (1868-1878) and the Little War (1879-1880). One player controls the forces of the Spanish colonial government, fighting to retain Cuba; the other player controls the Cuban rebels fighting for their independence.<br/><br/>Gameplay represents the main insurgency and counterinsurgency operations that took place, and players must make key strategic decisions to achieve their objectives while balancing their resources and preventing their opponent from doing the same.<br/><br/>There are event cards that help and hinder both players; disease, ambushes, assassinations, and the reactions of the American press and government. Steamships, railroads, telegraphs were all common, but there were no radios, almost no automobiles, and no airplanes, just like in the U.S.. Newspapers and magazines were the cutting edge of media, so print was &ldquo;king.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As the Spanish, can you maintain control of the island, keep the economy going, and keep the U.S. claws out of the island?

        "description": "The original Champions of Aerim have long since faded from memory. Technology has begun its slow and steady rise within civilization, while many still cling desperately to the magic of old. Astaria itself has grown into a vast, sprawling empire, yet rebellion is carried on whispers from deep within the shadows. The strength of steam could spark a revolution. But for the Eternals, the cycle continues as it always has. For them, there is only... strife.<br/><br/>Strife: Shadows and Steam is a stand-alone sequel to Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. Using the same core mechanics, Strife: SaS introduces new characters, abilities and a unique twist or two that will be sure to add a fresh take on this exciting game. This sequel is also fully compatible with the original game, so you can face off with champions of Aerim from different ages!<br/><br/>Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.<br/><br/>Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.<br/><br/>Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

On the royal stand in the harbor, the preparation is intense. The King has arrived to watch the fleet set sail: five mighty ships, commanded by five shrewd captains whose intelligence will be put to the test in the years to come. The cannons roar, giving the departure signal. The anchors are pulled up, and the sails unfurled. The voyage that will circle the globe has just begun.<br/><br/>In Magellan: Elcano, you assume the role of a captain on one of these ships circumnavigating the world, and you want to collect as many goods as possible. Each player has an identical deck of 15 cards, and you start with five random cards in hand. These cards have values on them in two colors (from red, blue, and green) on opposite ends, and three decks of  ocean cards in red, blue, and green lie in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Reveal the top card of each deck. Each player then takes turns playing a card from their hand in front of them, building up to three piles &mdash; one in each color &mdash; and rotating a player card as desired to make it one color or another. Continue around the table until all players have passed or have no cards remaining in hand. Whoever has played the highest total in red discards their played cards and claims the matching ocean card; all other players return their played red cards to hand. In  the event of a tie, all players return their cards to hand, with the red ocean card remaining in place. Do the same with the blue and green cards.<br/><br/>All players draw two cards from their personal deck, then you reveal a new red, blue, and green ocean card, piling up cards of the same color if they weren't claimed the previous one. Continue playing rounds until all players' decks are empty. Total your claimed ocean cards. Whoever has the highest sum wins!<br/><br/>",

To help grow their power, the fascist group known as The Rat Pack has been pinning the galaxy&rsquo;s problems on cats. Now, these fuzzy creatures could be forced into exile all together.<br/><br/>That is unless a band of rebellious felines, led by Rocket (the freedom fighter), CJ (the medic), Pepper (the pouncer), and Ophelia (the smuggler) can stop these fascist forces from seizing power - all while building a new galaxy where all species are free together.<br/><br/>Space Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game where you play as a band of rebel cats trying to stop fascists from seizing control of the galaxy. In Space Cats Fight Fascism, you&rsquo;ll hop from planet to planet, scratching away at fascist forces and freeing animals pinned under the fascists&rsquo; claws.<br/><br/>Your goal is to liberate four planets before the fascists take control of the Galactic Alliance. You&rsquo;ll have three actions on your turn, and each player will use cards from their hand to build up the Animal Resistance on the twelve different home worlds. Cards and other basic actions will allow you to teleport across the galaxy, restock on supplies, as well as adopt new paw-ers as the game goes on - making each game unique.<br/><br/>Once the Resistance has at least four liberation tokens on a planet, you will place a Liberated flag there! When four planets have become liberated, the fascists have been defeated by the Resistance, and the animals of the galaxy rejoice! But watch out, because the fascists are always right on your tail! With cards like Anti-Cat Propaganda and The Fascists Use Laser Pointers to Distract Us!, they&rsquo;ll try to wrestle back control of liberated planets from you while occupying even more planets to cement their power. The Fascists can win the game in one of three ways: by placing three Occupied flags on the board, by getting every single fascist onto the board, or by gaining too much power on the Fascism Scale.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simulation of the battle of Flodden, 1513.<br/><br/>Re-published in Battles magazine #9.<br/><br/><br/>(from the designer:)<br/><br/>The Flowers of The Forest covers the Anglo-Scots battle of Flodden in which an invading Scots army under the charismatic James IV was destroyed in hand-to-hand combat by the Earl of Surrey&rsquo;s force. This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           <br/>           <br/>The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           <br/>           <br/>The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           <br/>           <br/>The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios. It also addresses the great independence (in practice) of Scots nobles over their Sassenach equivalents. The game is not balanced but plays quickly so that each player may have a turn at each side.<br/><br/>",

Send them into battle. <br/>        3. Clobber till content.<br/><br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where conflict lies in wait around every corner and the shadows are acrawl with mystery and adventure, where liberty wanes, government waxes, and a chosen few don capes and cowls to take their stand in a world gone Wyrd....<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game features 32 original Heroes (and/or villains, depending on your perspective) and several Crews of secondary characters, including Freedom Patrols, Liberty Bots, Diabloids, Arachnidrones, Darklings, thugs, and zombies. Each Hero is defined by personalized stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Vigor) and 3 unique Powers, while each Crew is defined by personalized stats and 1 unique Power. Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.<br/>    <br/>Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:<br/><br/>1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.<br/><br/>In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.<br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game! Let the battle begin!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Conquerors is a projected series of games that will focus on history's great conquerors, those figures whose vision, greed for power, and remarkable military abilities have changed the map of the world, sometimes fleetingly, often permanently. The first game in this new series is Alexander the Great, a game that covers the career of the fabled King of Macedon, from his ascension to the throne until his army has &quot;Hellenized&quot; half the known world.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses an interesting new system that gives the players a feel for the era and the problems of campaigning therein. For one, there are no turns. Play keeps going until the Macedonian Player wins or Alexander dies. And winning, for the Macedonian Player, is no mean feat. Yes, his armies are mighty, but Alexander is a game in which the player must not just win battles, but also overcome the logistics of campaigning &hellip; building armies, getting them to where they're needed, understanding battle fatigue and weariness, dealing with personalities, and adapting to the society you are trying to seize.<br/><br/>The player's goals, as Alexander, are multiple and difficult. To win, he must maintain his hegemony of Greece, become Great King and establish his Deity. The latter two require him to achieve eight separate, often difficult objectives, including controlling key provinces, building Alexandria, gaining control of the Royal Family, and invoking proskynesis (homage by prostration). A clever Persian player has many ways to stop the Macedonian from earning these, and the money and manpower to help him. Given Alexander's &quot;greatness,&quot; play testers found the game to be remarkably balanced.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses cards, but it is not a game &quot;driven&quot; by cards - this is not a Paths of Glory system game. Rather, it uses them to provide the players with the historical opportunities and outside events that shaped Alexander's campaigns. The cards cover such events as Alexander's drinking problems, the shadowy figure of Bagoas, the friendly presence of Black Cleitus, and possibilities of assassination, mass marriages, Spartan revolts &hellip; even a Honeymoon for the weary Macedonians!<br/><br/>Combat uses a fun, two-tiered battle resolution system that accounts for many more factors than just numbers, and often leaves armies- even winning armies- in far worse shape than you may want.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great is a game rich in historical detail, a game that places major burdens on the players to achieve victory, and a game that's great fun! It can be played by two to four gamers in around 4 hours, and it can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1-2<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>    140 half-inch counters &amp; 88 5/8-inch counters<br/>    55 Event cards<br/>    One 22&quot;x34&quot; Mapsheet<br/>    24-page Rule Book<br/>    2 Player Aid Cards<br/>    Three six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Designed by Richard Berg<br/>Developed by Bill Ramsay<br/><br/>(from GMT webpage)<br/><br/>",

Better hope your partner didn't accelerate! Race to the finish line in this wacky game of mayhem and shenanigans.

There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.<br/><br/>The game comes with two operational maps, covering the South China Sea and the East Indies, and these maps overlap with the maps in the &quot;Eastern Fleet&quot; product.<br/><br/>As with all &quot;Great War at Sea&quot;/&quot;Second World War at Sea&quot; games, the tactical map is a generic field of blue hexagons that ships and aircraft move to when fleets meet on the operational maps.  Combat is simple - roll 1d6 for every 'factor' the ship has, with a result of '6' equaling a hit.  Compare the weapon that hit (primary gun, secondary gun, tertiary gun, torpedo, or bomb) vs the armor of the area hit to determine if penetration occurred.  If it did, mark off a damage box.<br/><br/>&quot;Strike South&quot; includes 15 scenarios, of which 8 of these are limited &quot;Battle Scenarios&quot;, that just use the tactical map.  The larger 'Operational Scenarios' can take some time to play out - sometimes a whole evening, although Avalanche Press tries to focus them on a 2-hr timeframe - and include such actions as the last mission of the British Battleship Prince of Wales, the Battle of the Java Sea, the Battle of Sunda Strait, and the Japanese invasion of the Philipines.<br/><br/>Strike South includes: <br/><br/>     Two 32&quot;x22&quot; strategic maps <br/>     11&quot;x17&quot; tactical map <br/>     420 game pieces <br/>     12-page rulebook <br/>     12-page scenario book <br/>     2 player aid cards <br/>     1 organizational card <br/><br/><br/>",

Careful placement of your umbrellas will unlock sections of your tourist map, which will add more tourists into your pool to place out on your board.

Players pick up the story one year into the Hikari's colonisation efforts and everything has fallen to ruin. Scientists aboard the ship were attempting to genetically engineer life forms to explore the planet below, unbeknownst to the ships general populace. But a series of tragedies lead to the truth being discovered and the ensuing chaos released the creatures from containment, where they rampaged through the ship, killing anyone they came across. Now the remaining crew live in small groups, salvaging whatever they can to survive.<br/><br/>Game overview<br/><br/>     Complete various missions as a standalone game or an overarching campaign.

        "description": "Impetus is a set of wargaming rules that allows you to play battles from the Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance periods. It is produced by the same team that publish the Italian 'Dadi &amp; Piombo' miniatures wargaming magazine.<br/><br/>It is an extremely flexible system which allows players to recreate armies from a huge period of history - from Ancient Egypt, Romans and the Crusades right through to the Hundred Years War and Samurai.<br/><br/>Impetus is designed to be played using miniatures in various scales: 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm, and 25/28mm are all catered for.<br/><br/>Miniatures are based in elements - 60mm wide for 6mm &amp; 10mm, 80mm wide for 15mm, and 120mm wide for 20mm &amp; 25/28mm. The depth of the element is stipulated, but is not vital. This enables you to play the system with armies already based for other games systems.<br/><br/>The game play is turn based, but is not traditional i-go/u-go. Players roll dice for initiative every turn, but units are able to react to enemy forces out of sequence.<br/><br/>Units have 3 or 4 statistics, the most important of which is VBU, a combination of unit strength and morale.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and simple. Units roll dice equivalent to their VBU in combat, with various modifiers giving bonuses to the number of dice thrown. Any score of '6' or double '5' score a hit. There is some record keeping required, as unit hits cause a reduction in VBU. When VBU is reduced to 0, the unit routs and is removed from the table.<br/><br/>Armies are points based, with average armies ranging between 300-500 points. There are 15 army lists detailed in the original rules, usually in 'matched pairs'. These include Alexander's Macedonians &amp; Later Achaemedian Persians, 2nd Punic War Romans &amp; Carthaginians, Gauls &amp; Caesar's Romans, Crusaders &amp; Saladin's Army, and French &amp; English armies from the 100 Years War.<br/><br/>",

This will result in an exceptional increase in volume that will cause it to engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth itself.<br/><br/>In the best-case scenario, the increase in volume will stop short of our planet&rsquo;s destruction, but life as we know it would have already been destroyed due to radiation and the dramatic increase in surface&rsquo;s temperatures. Our only hope, as mankind, is to build a colossal interstellar spaceship that would allow a fraction of humanity to evacuate on a &ldquo;new earth&rdquo; we have located in the Trappist star system during our search for viable extrasolar planets.<br/><br/>Such a project, however, is far from simple: the resources we need can&rsquo;t be found on our planet, and the few made available from the solar extraction technology are still insufficient. The only way to complete this monumental task is to harvest the materials needed directly from the other planets of our solar system.<br/><br/>In Starship Interstellar, you are the leader of one of the world's most influential Corporations, that has chosen to rise to the occasion and do their part to help complete this project.

After going around, your decision is made: you will improve it and make it prosper. Build buildings, hire qualified staff, buy land, manage your finances, because the mayor of this city is you!<br/><br/>Your Town is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Julian&quot;, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame of intermediate complexity simulating the situation across the Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. There are two opposing players: Roman and Barbarian. The Roman player represents the high command of a centralized empire; the Barbarian player represents the various chaotic forces working to destroy that empire. The Roman objective is to reconsolidate the threatened empire and secure its frontier regions to prevent further barbarian invasion. The Barbarian objective is to grab as much Roman territory as possible. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier S&amp;T games: Series: They Died With Their Boots On (Decision Games).<br/><br/>The Barbarian side is divided into &ldquo;forces,&rdquo; each representing an independent people or coalition of tribes, such as the Goths. The Persians and Armenians, though commanded in the game by the barbarian player, are considered &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; forces (along with all Roman and rebel units).<br/><br/>Each turn represents one year. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 miles (162 km) from side to opposite side. Each unit represents 10,000 to 30,000 troops and camp followers, etc. Special rules cover such things as: usurpation, stratagems, random events, reinforcements, pursuit, taxation, Caesar and Augustus units, naval movement, fortresses and bases, fog of war, the Huns, political crises, tribal homelands, militia, field armies, supply trains, pursuit combat, amphibious operations, pillage, civic works, and more.<br/><br/>",

The question might be, &quot;Who would you rather be for a day?&quot; All the players debate the match-up and then all openly vote on it.

The bonus pick is where each player tries to guess what one of the other players will choose as the winner of the tournament. The points for each pick is in parentheses.<br/><br/>The contenders are drawn randomly from 500 tiles and placed on the bracket in four categories (including an example of one contender from each.)<br/>Arenas - aka &quot;Places&quot; - Jamaica<br/>Contenders - aka &quot;People&quot; - Mark Twain<br/>Moves - aka &quot;Actions&quot; - Showering<br/>Gear - aka &quot;Things&quot;- Cocktails<br/><br/>After all the tiles are placed, a player draws a random &quot;Knockout&quot;card.

In it, you take the part of an interstellar civilization competing to control a newly-discovered star cluster! Construct your empire, fight for resources, and research technology. Each alien species has its own unique flaws and advantages, and victory lies in recognizing this. The game is physically attractive, and includes well over one hundred figures of spaceships, starbases, colonies, alien citizens, and so forth. It takes place in a star cluster built up of individual pieces that changes every time you play.<br/><br/>The base game has four different alien civs from which to choose, but various expansions and add-ons increase this to 25 total alien Civs (one of which is secret, to be revealed during the Kickstarter campaign). The game does not have any sort of upkeep or victory phase. Instead, when it is a player's turn, they perform three actions, then play passes to the next player. This continues around and around until the game ends, by accumulation of victory points. Most actions cost metal or atomic resources, and include moving, building, research, combat, salvage, production, and so forth.<br/><br/>As with other Petersen Games products, the game is highly asymmetrical, and the various civilizations have unique abilities, homeworlds, weaknesses, super-units, and super-technologies.<br/><br/>Driving the strategy are a player's need to advance along the victory tracks. These permit players to score points by advancing along Probe, Research, Industry, and Battle tracks (representing exploration, experimentation, expansion, and extermination).<br/><br/>The base game supports 2-4 players, but with expansions the game can support up to six players. Unlike many multiplayer games, the game is balanced and works just as well with 2-3 players as it does with 4-6.<br/><br/>",

By rolling their own player dice and with the help from the pirate crew, the players try to get at least the same amount of dice to each mission part to fulfill this part. Each part grants rewards and penalties, and each mission has another endgame trigger condition: Each mission gives a reward if the crew fulfills it and punishment if they don't. What's more, if pirates don't fulfill the mission, they also risk that the next part of mission will be more difficult because of the curse of the black dice. In the end, only the player who has captured the most amount of gold wins &mdash; that is, if the ship doesn't sink and take all players to the bottom of the ocean with it.<br/><br/>Sail together to find treasures, board ships, plunder villages, or even kill the mighty Kraken...and betray the other players when they don't expect it.
