During the game your workers can be flipped; One side blocking your opponents from taking the same action as you, the other allowing your opponent to also take the same action at the cost of returning your worker to you,giving you an extra turn.<br/><br/>The first player to submit enough points to one of the available prize cards will get to claim it, gaining victory points and a powerful unique ability they may use for the rest of the game. Abilities such as; gaining an additional worker, being able to take multiple actions with one worker or even choosing where their opponent must place their worker.<br/><br/>The first player to claim three prizes wins. Or if the 4th/5th prize(depending on player count) is taken and a single player has yet to claim three prizes, then the player with the most victory points will win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Steal your neighbor's gnomes if you must because the cops are gnomewhere to be found.<br/>Set traps to protect your precious gnomes, and hoard away because the HOA isn't writing fines for cluttered lawns. Or at least try... let's face it, thieves will be thieves.<br/>Let the War for Lawn Supremacy begin!<br/><br/>In Oh Gnome!, players will be playing three different card types: Gnomes, Traps, Abilities. Gnome and Trap cards each with their own values helping the player to achieve enough points to be crowned the victor. Each Gnome has a unique power that activates when they enter a lawn. These powers can be used strategically to create chain combos to devastate your opponents' lawns. Be careful though because if you don't protect your Gnomes, they can be stolen right back without regard. Players can arm traps which generally do something bad when they are tripped but some are simply caches to boost your lawn value and achieve a sly victory. To cap off the card types, there are ability cards which are one time use cards that have great effects. The deck runs out fast and there's no reshuffling so paying attention to how many are left can be used to achieve a spectacular game ending combo.<br/><br/>This is a quick play game where games generally last around 10 to 20 minutes and occasionally get up to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

For example, the formation commander will not be deciding on which type of ammunition (HEAT, APDS etc) each tank will be firing when engaging an enemy unit, this would be left up to the tank&rsquo;s own crew. So many parts of the rules that may seem simple or &ldquo;glossed-over&rdquo; are simply below the player&rsquo;s (acting as overall commander) level of command.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/>Various sequences and methods of unit activation were considered however it was decided to go back to the classic &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; sequence (albeit with interruptions form an opponent&rsquo;s units on overwatch).<br/><br/>Morale<br/>Morale has been heavily simplified to a single dice roll at the end of each turn for any units that have come under fire and been suppressed.

        "description": "GeoXpert is an original combined alignment and guessing game with collector cards to better know the countries of the World. The principle is simple. From a card which shows a flag, you first guess which country it is. Then you place the card in a line, ranking by area horizontally or by population vertically. If you loose, you get more cards to get rid off. The winner is the first to exhaust his/her stock.<br/>With GeoXpert, learn all countries' flag, name, capital, and other facts and quiz your family and friends.<br/>GeoXpert may be played with 2, 3, 4 or more players. It may be played alone too.<br/>There is a card of each country. The verso has only the flag and the continent, the recto gives country's name (in English, French and the official languages of the country), capital, currency, area, population, flag and coat of arms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The longer you play, the harder the game becomes, until there's nothing left for you to do except watch as the world burns.<br/><br/>Each player has an open hand of cards which are played to categories around the central Octagon in the hopes of reducing the villain's HP to zero before HE reduces the World's HP to zero. But cards only score when played atop other cards, and every time a turn is taken, the villain (the game itself) has a chance to remove players' cards from the Octagon before points can be scored against him. Not only that, but interspersed throughout the villain's deck are cards that render categories unusable for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Bang! is a two player strategy skirmish game where you go head to head as commanders leading your squad of soldiers onto a battlefield in an attempt to eliminate each other. The only tools at your disposal are the Combat Card, your wits, and the roll of the dice.<br/><br/>The game is split into three phases. You begin in the Spawn Phase, placing your squad onto the map, choosing carefully where to set them along the orange spawn clicks. Clicks are the spots on the board used to determine movement. Once both players finish the Spawn Phase, you then enter the first Move Phase. Start by taking your units using a limited number of moves out of their spawn while attempting to establish line of sight so you can take shots at the enemy. Both players go through one Move phase without firing shots. After your second Move Phase is finished, you enter the Kill Phase and get to take any shots you have available by rolling the dice. Once your Kill phase is over, the turn goes to your opponent, and he gets to do the same by Moving then Killing.<br/><br/>Each class of soldier is unique and has an ideal range for engagement. The Sniper and Light Machine Gun are best from a distance, the Shotgun and Sub-Machine Gun are great up close, and the Assault Rifle has a sweet spot in the middle.<br/><br/>The Combat Card details every soldier's stats, and will show you what you need to roll to land a killshot. After you've taken your shots, any soldiers you hit get the chance to roll for cover, and if they make it, will stay alive and get to keep fighting!<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! uses a classic Deathmatch win condition, so the first person to fully eliminate the enemy squad wins.

These options include the ability to play Injury Cards on your opponents to slow them down, playing Adrenaline Rush Cards to take a card even when it is not your turn, and, due to the fact that every player has their own discard pile, players are given more options for selecting a card at the beginning of their turn.<br/><br/>The three stages (runs) needed to win the game are:<br/> &bull; Stage One: A run of five cards that can be a mixture of colors and suits<br/> &bull; Stage Two: A run of five cards in a single suit or all the same color<br/> &bull; Stage Three: A run of five cards all being of the same suit and color<br/><br/>To help in accomplishing the stages, Triathlon has three suits; swimmers, cyclists, and runners, and three colors; red, blue, and golden. This gives Triathlon 9 unique sets of cards. Each set has eight cards, 7 numbered cards, and a Pro Card. Pro Cards are wild in number but cannot change their color or suit.<br/><br/>In addition to the cards mentioned above, the deck also contains three Super Pro Cards that are wild in number and color, but cannot change their suit.<br/> -description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Medieval Mayhem, a co-op game for 2-4 players, play the role of 4 heroes: Rogre, Emera, Gallandor, and Kijam as they attempt to rescue all 24 villagers from the dragon Malevol. Actions include moving, rescuing, transferring, and dropping off villagers. Work together and utilize cards from the deck as well as hero effects!<br/><br/>Contents include 24 Meeples, 8 Player Tokens, 4 Hero Cards, 16 Location Cards, 16 Action Cards, and 1 Rulebook.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Malevol, the fabled wicked dragon, has emerged and has his eyes set on villagers. Four brave heroes: Rogre, Emera, Kijam, and Gallandor, must rescue the villagers and drop them off in Farlorn Village. However, if Malevol emerges, and the heroes aren&rsquo;t on Safe Haven spaces while rescuing villagers, the villagers will die! An orc, a mage, a knight, and an elf must team up to save the villagers from Malevol&rsquo;s wrath!<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>Your team must rescue 16 of the 24 villagers. Use action cards and hero effects to help make the objective easier!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Select a player to go first, then play proceeds to the left. A player may perform (3) actions in any order of their choosing. Actions:<br/><br/>Move: Move your token one space vertically or horizontally (diagonal is not allowed).  Your piece must move onto a Location Card your first turn and may never leave the game area again.<br/><br/>Transfer: When two players&rsquo; tokens occupy the same Location Card, a transfer may occur.  You may give one Villager that has been rescued to the other player.  Each transfer costs one Action.<br/><br/>Rescue: A player&rsquo;s token must occupy the same space as the villager being rescued. When moving, be sure to move the villager next to your token.<br/><br/>Drop-Off: When you get to the Village, perform a Drop-Off action to ensure the villager is same from harm.<br/><br/>Each player has one turn each round. After the round ends, reveal a card from the Action Deck. If it is an Action Card, any player may add it to their hand and play it on any of their next turns at no extra action cost. Action cards are discarded after use. However, if it is Malevol, anyone who does not occupy a Safe Haven Location Card will lose 1 villager, then shuffle Malevol back into the Action Card deck. Lost villagers are removed from the game. Each player has an effect that may be used during the game; this does not cost an action to use and can be used any time when applicable. NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, only 1 villager can be rescued per Hero card before drop-off.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/>The game ends when 16 villagers have been rescued and dropped off at the village; in this case, your team wins! The game will also end if 9 villagers die from Malevol; in this case, your team loses.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Some always tell the truth, some always lie, some always do what they're told, and some always do the opposite of what they're told.<br/><br/>16 of each of four colors of pieces are placed on the 64 spaces of the board, which has the property that any two spaces have a unique shortest path between them. Each round someone decides which color of piece represents which type of person and also picks one of the liars to be Quigley. The other players have to find Quigley.<br/><br/>On a turn a player may move their piece up to three spaces and then asks the person there how to reach Quigley. A die is rolled to determine if they are told to lie or not, but how they actually answer of course also depends on what type of person they are. The controller for the round places an arrow pointing along the shortest path to Quigley - or not. The arrow is white if the die said to tell the truth and black otherwise.<br/><br/>Alternatively a player may ask a person if they are Quigley, in which case they always receive a truthful answer. The player finding Quigley scores 20 points. An incorrect accusation costs 5 points. The controller scores a point every time a player takes a turn.<br/><br/>",

Land on the planet, loot weapons and armor, and duke it out on the battlefield!<br/><br/>Each player takes control of a single contestant in this deadly popularity contest. During their turn, they can move around the hex grid of the battlefield, open &ldquo;loot boxes&rdquo; to receive new equipment and attack their opponents with the weapon and action cards they found. However, all items are hit with planned obsolescence, and will quickly be discarded over the turns.<br/><br/>Each action can earn them Prestige Points, and the first player to reach 20 points wins the game. Being KO&rsquo;d doesn&rsquo;t remove the player from the game but will give their assassin a big bonus in Prestige Points.<br/><br/>Rumble Planet is inspired by the French audio-series La L&eacute;gende de Xantah and was developed by their authors, but doesn&rsquo;t require any knowledge of this series to be enjoyed!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The game comes with four different variants makes it a suitable match for different age groups and will work well with Sunday schools, youth groups and other Bible oriented contexts.<br/><br/>The first edition is published in Swedish in November 2020. If there is interest it may be translated in to other languages as well.<br/><br/>Bibellinjen is inspired by the game Time line by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Henry.<br/><br/>Gameplay (standard rules):<br/>Players try to collect points by gaining cards. When it is your turn you deal five cards and place them face up in front of you. You should then try to rearrange the cards so they are placed in the same order that they appear in the Bible. Each card has the name of a Bible book on one side and on the other side there is a number that indicates what order that book has in the Bible. By flipping the cards you can see if the order you settled for is correct or not. If all cards are not in the right order you must remove cards from the sequence until a correct sequence remains. Once that is done you may keep any cards still in front of you. The other cards are discarded to a discard pile which is shuffled into the draw deck when it runs out. The game ends when there are not enough cards in the draw pile to finish the round. The player who collected the most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Bibellinjen &auml;r ett enkelt spel som g&aring;r ut p&aring; att l&auml;ra sig ordningen p&aring; Bibelns b&ouml;cker.

The first player to collect 3 case of intel or successfully assassinate the enemy spy to win.<br/><br/>There are 16 spy cards laid out face up (in a 4x4 grid), there are 5 intel brief cases spread out between them.  Each player is given a card (facedown) that matches one of the 16 cards in front of both players.  These are their spies for this game.  Each player takes turns moving through the crowd, collecting intel briefcases and trying to deduce who their counterpart's spy is.  The first player to either collect 3 briefcases or successfully assassinate their opponent wins.<br/><br/>This is a mint tin game, with simple to teach rules, quick games, where the more you play, the deeper the strategy gets.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can complete 1 of 3 actions.<br/><br/>1. Switch ANY two adjacent spy cards on the grid. Your spy does not have to be either of the two spies that are switched.<br/><br/>2. Pick Up Intel: If your spy is next to an intel briefcase, you can pick it up &amp; place it in front of you. Be aware that now the other player can deduce that you are 1 of the 4 spies next to the Intel Briefcase.<br/><br/>3. Assassinate: If you are confident that you know who the enemy player&rsquo;s spy is, you can attempt to assassinate them. To do this, you simply announce that you want to attempt to assassinate a spy. Pull the card from the grid you want to assassinate. The enemy player then reveals their facedown Green Falcon Card. If it is a match you win! If it is not a match, your assassination failed and you lose the game. So be sure that you know who they are before assassinating them!<br/><br/>",

When the tableau is complete, players score for the bugs they have secured.<br/><br/>Players try to get their kids to form intersects around some bugs. This means that only one squad can catch each bug.<br/><br/>The kids are ranked by their skills 1-3 with the older kids better more able, and the bugs are also valued 1-4 and -3. Kids can only catch insects if their individual or combined skills are equal or better than the wisdom of the elusive critters. Catching a risky insect like a hornet scores negative points. If multiple squads are competing, the squad with higher skills in total wins the insect.<br/><br/>As the grid develops, players can place good catches at their own kids, and bad catches onto their opponents. The game is quick and easy to play.<br/><br/>At the finish, the highest total score wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

One side features Pitch &amp; Play Baseball which utilizes ringed marbles as in Rebound as baseballs and a pinball style bat to swing downfield. Players have plastic gates to simulate fielders to prevent the batting player from hitting into the slight wells to score runs. The other side of the board features Fling Football, a traditional paper football style game where players can block out 5 or 10 yard sections of the field with their defense tokens to make it more difficult for the offensive player to make it downfield. It also features a plastic catapult and foam football for kick-offs and field goals.<br/><br/>",

Each card contains three questions in three different levels of difficulty, sometimes plus a bonus question about song lyrics. The questions on a card always are about three different bands, musicians or events, so players being confronted with a question about a band they don&rsquo;t like won&rsquo;t be punished thrice.<br/><br/>In the two-player-variant, players get a four cards each. The first player asks the questions of his first card starting with the lowest difficulty. If answered correctly, the second question is also read and the same for the third question. The answering player is awarded victory point cards for each question answered correctly based on the difficulty level, then the opponent reads his card. The game continues until all eight cards have been played. The player with the most victory points after these eight to twenty-four question have been asked wins the game.<br/><br/>In the multiplayer variant each player gets one trivia card. Questions are read and tried to answer in turn, first the easiest level of difficulty, then the second and finally the third. Whoever answers a question correctly first receives a victory point card according to the difficulty level of the question. After all questions have been read and victory points have been awarded, the player with the most victory points is declared winner. In case of a tie, all song lyrics questions are asked providing a bonus round after which the winner is determined.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After your eyes are tired from any computer / mobilephone / TV / smartphone etc - screen - it is great to spend time playing  just with a piece of paper, pencil and 2 (d6) dice. Also you can organize a tournament for any amount of players and for any amount of time. To start you need to download a score sheet and it is the score sheet for one player.<br/><br/>Goal of the game: To get as much as possible points.<br/>To get points you must make as many continuous Lines as possible with Dots along the vertical, horizontally and diagonally. The more Dots in the line, the more points you get. You must have at least 3 Dots in a Line to get any points. First it looks like a very simple game but more you play more hints and tactics you will find.<br/><br/>ROLL DICE and you get two numbers from two ordinary 6-sided dice. The numbers on the Dice are the coordinates where you need to put a Dot on a gaming board.<br/>If the coordinates are occupied and the player cannot place a Dot, then he receives a penalty point (draw a cross in the low left of the gaming board). Each GAME lasts up to 3 penalty points. After getting the third penalty point - GAME ends &ndash; start to count the lines.<br/><br/>​<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All members of the class were lost by mid-1944. Another ocean-going submersible using 533mm forward and aft torpedo tubes, it served in the South Pacific as well as the waters off Australia. I-177 sunk the hospital ship AHS Centaur off Stradbroke Island. It was presumed lost with all hands on 18 November 1944, while the I-176 was lost six months earlier off of the Solomon&rsquo;s.

The depth charges were intended to be planted by the pilot of the boat, after which he would then make his escape. Although nearly 10,000 were built, they accounted for the sinking of only 5 ships, mainly landing craft.<br/><br/>The Imperial Japanese Navy fielded a number of variants on a standard torpedo boat design, differing mainly in machinery fit which affected displacement, giving the illusion of more variety than existed in practice. 238 boats were built within these designations, all armed with two 18-inch torpedoes and 25mm or 13.2mm guns.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>3 Kaidai-7-class Submarine<br/>2 Shin'yo Kamikaze boat sections<br/>2 T-14 MTB sections<br/>Ship Cards<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It really captured the whimsical tone we were hoping for, and I'd love to work with her again!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>A postcard dexterity game, where players race flickering pennies.<br/><br/>The first player, on their first turn, uses a finger to flick or push their penny so that it touches or crosses the first line - but not the second line. On each player's subsequent turns, the player flicks their penny so that it is closer to the right of the card that the other player's penny but does not completely cross two different lines on the same flick. If unsuccessful, the get one chance to retry.<br/><br/>If a player is unable to successfully complete their turn on a retry, they lose the game. If a player is able to flick their penny past the 500 mark without breaking the other rules for their turn, they win the game.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the May 2017 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

There she runs into a group of people who have no idea what&rsquo;s going on, except that they heard the dead have risen and are attacking the living.

If the zombies are already on the map before spawning new ones, you would check if they break any Barricades, enter the saloon, Move, or attack any players.<br/><br/>Then all the player characters will take their turns in any order they want. They can take a 30-minute action or an hour as long as they haven't taken a 30-minute action already during that hour.

Instead of controlling a particular historical leader or empire, players take on the roles of celestial beings who are pulling the strings of history from behind the curtains. The celestials must help each other to make the divine plan for the world unfold, but beneath the thin veneer of cooperation there is fierce rivalry... for the Lord of Time, as ancient as creation itself, will give a rich reward to the celestial who shows the most skill at influencing world events. This is why all actions in the game&mdash;recruiting agents, collecting coins, claiming forces, playing cards and more&mdash;are ultimately aimed at just one thing: to gain as many Influence Points (IP) as possible. At the end of the game, the player with the most IP wins.<br/><br/>Forces of History is a complex strategy game that combines the best of several different worlds. It simulates world history, yet every playthrough is different from the one before; it offers rich historical lore to the hobby-historian, but you don't need to know or care about history to play it.<br/><br/>The game offers several different game variants: Classical-Medieval Age game (standard), Classical Age game, Medieval Age game, and team play (2v2) in any of the above settings. The playing time can vary from 2 hours up to 6-7 hours, depending on the variant chosen (and on player familiarity). NOTE: The Modern Age is not yet available, but if the game is released and becomes as successful as we hope, it will be released in the upcoming expansion.<br/><br/>This is a game that doesn't easily fit into any established category.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Without the public's knowledge, the United States is just months from this becoming a reality.<br/>     <br/>In Los Alamos, an extensive, embedded network of spies have been biding their time, waiting for the right moment to carry out their orders to steal the top secret information. Unfortunately, they catch word that the entire network is exposed and you must act now. Can you steal all of the documents and get out of Los Alamos before getting caught?<br/><br/>The Los Alamos Conspiracy is a tile laying game where you are trying to match certain tile patterns to &quot;steal&quot; files. With each turn you will place a tile and flip a tile (representing the Military Police). If you can exhaust the entire stack of tiles with all four resources, you win! If the Military Police catch up with you or you cannot get out of town with all four files, you lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Depending on how many of their predictions are correct, the boss will call out the sound &quot;Kon!&quot;. If the boss calls out more than two &quot;Kon&quot;s, it means a fish has been hooked. However, if the fisherman fails to call out &quot;Hit!&quot; before the boss finishes saying a total of 10 &quot;Kon&quot;s, the fish will get away!<br/><br/>In the case that the fishermen calls out &quot;Hit&quot; in time, he or she will get to take a card from the Wakasagi fish pile. If not, the Boss will receive a card instead.<br/><br/>After either player draws a fish card, he or she will also need to draw an event card. An event card can be either positive or negative (for example, get an extra 2 fish...or a fox steals one of your wakasagi cards).

        "description": "Virtue is a co-operative game for 2-4 players that pits your team against the spiritual forces of good and evil. You will strive to live a good life and balance the pursuits that give it meaning. You will quest for internal tranquillity and life-long peace. You will struggle with existential conflict as your angels and demons battle to shape your soul and define your character. You and your fellow man are in this together. Don't let them down.<br/><br/>Each round represents a decade of the players' lives and consists of three phases: Actions, Existential Conflict, and Spiritual Warfare. In the action phase, players move their focus on various vices and virtues, cleanse their soul of the demons that plague them, enhance life pursuits that will unlock new abilities, and increase their tranquility, which will aid them in removing demons. The action phase prepares the team for what is about to come.<br/><br/>After the action phase, each player draws from a deck that will (among other things) swarm their souls with angels and demons. Then, they check for existential conflict, i.e., an abundance of uncontested demons with no angels to stand in opposition. For each existential crisis that occurs, the player has new challenges to overcome.<br/><br/>Finally, the spiritual warfare phase ensues in which the forces of good and evil battle, and the dominating force is left standing for the next decade of their lives.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This demand contained a long list of capitulations including allowing Axis forces to enter and occupy fundamentally any &quot;strategic location&quot; they felt was appropriate. <br/>Summoning his inner Leonidas, Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas' apocryphal response to the litany of demands was simply &quot;&Omicron;&chi;&iota;&quot; ... No.<br/><br/>The scenario is designed to represent the battle as a skirmish at 1 figure:1,000 men, for QILS rules using 25mm or 28mm figures on 1&rdquo; bases. Fifteen millimeter figures on 3/4&rdquo; bases can be used by using centimeters instead of inches.  <br/>And of course, instead of skirmish figures you could use 6mm or 3mm figures on 1&quot; bases.  <br/>The scenario makes a small board that is nice for games in more restricted environs, while still capturing the top level command challenge. <br/>The troops are specified for our free QILS skirmish rules.

Recruit brave knights and assassins to crush your enemies. Get priests and peasants into your kingdom to expand faster. But don't lose your king or your kingdom will crumble before your very eyes.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player starts with a king card in their hand. If you lose your king card you are out of the game. You have to play cards to force others to lose their king. Some cards may help you to gain cards and other cards may be used to deplete your opponents cards.<br/><br/>Certain types of cards can be used to battle against other people. You can use Horsemen, Knights, Guards, Squires and even Peasants to attack and defend your kingdom. If you play enough cards, your opponent will have to discard 3 cards. Other players can join in the battle by playing their battle cards during a battle onto either player's side.<br/><br/>Envoy cards like the assassin, thief, imposter, baron and strategist have effects that involve taking a random card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. If you choose the right card you get a good effect. Barons and strategists have good effects for both players. assassins, thieves and imposters have negative effects for the other player. Your opponent won't know what card you used until you take one of their cards. But they can chose the guard against you if you want to play and envoy card. By playing guards, they can check cards in your hand for assassins, thieves and imposters. But if they check your barons or strategists, they will have to discard their guards.<br/><br/>You have to convince your opponent not to guard against you in order to play assassins, thieves and imposters or you can trick them into guarding against your barons or strategists to make them lose their guards.<br/><br/>By having power points, you can expand your kingdoms even faster. For every 5 power points you have at the start of your turn, you can draw an extra card. Power points allow you to gain cards faster quickly turning you into a dominating force. Cards like Peasants, Priests, Princesses and Princes will give you power points.<br/><br/>When all the players have lost their king cards the last player left is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Four battleships and eight heavy cruisers were available, with three more battleships being fitted out. However, there were no aircraft carriers (initially), not least because the Regia Marina was intended to operate near to friendly air bases in Italy and Africa.<br/><br/>As might be expected from a force operating among the islands of the Mediterranean, light forces were quite numerous, including 14 light cruisers, 128 destroyers and 62 motor torpedo boats, which was a weapon favoured by the Italians and well suited to local conditions. No less than 115 submarines were available. The main Italian naval base was at Taranto, home of the battleship force. Lighter groups were based out of ports on the Italian mainland, Sicily and the Red Sea.<br/><br/>The Regia Marina was primarily tasked with interrupting British logistics and trade through the Mediterranean, and with keeping the Axis nations&rsquo; links to North Africa open.

        "description": "The Littorio class was the first new Italian battleship class for nearly a decade when design work began in 1930. Initially designed to remain within the 35,000-ton Washington Treaty limit, the final displacement was just over 40,000 tons. As well as being good-looking ships, the Littorio-class included a number of new features including high-velocity guns. They were probably the first of the &lsquo;fast battleships&rsquo; that would come to dominate capital ship design in the late 1930s and onward.<br/><br/>Vittorio Veneto saw extensive service in World War Two, participating in the Battles of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and Cape Matapan in March 1941. Though struck by a torpedo at this latter engagement and again later courtesy of a British submarine, she would escape unscathed from the British raid on Taranto of November 1940. 1941 and early 1942 was spent attempting to attack British convoys en route to Malta, until fuel shortages forced the end of such activity. In the armistice of 1943, she was surrendered to the Allies after Italy withdrew from the war, spending the next three years under British control in Egypt. Thereafter she was allocated to Britain as a war prize and was scrapped.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Submarines: Compared to a German Type VII C submarine, the Marcello-class were much larger, displacing 1,060 tons versus 769. Speed and range between the two classes were almost similar, but the Marcello-class had more torpedo tubes than the famous U-Boat. The Marcello-class should be considered one of the most successful produced by the Italian shipyards and showed very good qualities &ndash; being fast, structurally robust and relatively manoeuvrable.<br/><br/>MTBs: Capable of 45 knots, the Italian Motoscafo Armato Silurante (Armed Torpedo Boat) or MAS Boats were extremely active in the Mediterranean theatre. Though they were not well suited to rougher seas, they still achieved a great deal of note, including the torpedoing of HMS Capetown and an attack on the harbour of Malta, though the latter was a failure that cost two MAS Boats.<br/><br/>Based on German S1 class S-Boats the Italians found in the port of Cattaro in Yugoslavia, the MS Boat was larger and far more seaworthy than the MAS designs. Though not as fast, it was far better suited to long range patrols in the Mediterranean being more stable and more comfortable. It was an MS Boat that sank the largest vessel of any MTB in the war, HMS Manchester, in 1942.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now they have to think fast and put their plate on the card that shows the monster or item that will be left over after everybody has been eating.

        "description": "You and your crew are on a mission manning an experimental ship to prove that alternate realities exist. The ship malfunctions and crashes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy in an unknown reality full of ferocious monsters.<br/> Each player takes control of a hero trying to defend against an endless swarm of monsters, all while repairing the downed ship. Players each roll 5 dice at the start of every round that can be spent to perform actions such as moving, searching, gaining XP, and attacking. They also have a unique starting ability that changes gameplay for that player from the very beginning.<br/><br/>The face of a die only affects searching and attacking, though there are many ways to manipulate the dice keeping randomness at a minimum. There are also several free actions that do not require spending dice, giving players a large variety of choice and wildly-varying turns.<br/><br/>Along with the 6 unique heroes to choose from, each hero also has their own 6-card deck of Level Up cards. Only 3 of these cards are used each game, providing a unique experience even when playing as the same hero multiple times.<br/><br/>Monsters spawn onto the board and are trying to get to the ship to destroy it once and for all. Monsters are on cards which have die faces on them acting as their HP. To attack these creatures, players spend the matching dice to damage or defeat the monster. At the beginning of the game, the monsters only have 2 HP. However, as the game progresses the monsters get increasingly difficult with more HP for each beast. Players may want to gain XP and level up their heroes to combat these stronger baddies.<br/><br/>The monsters are attracted to the smell of leaking oil coming from the ship. To prevent more monsters from spawning, players will want to contribute scrap metal to the middle of the board each round to plug the leak. Although, while searching for more metal, heroes may uncover a boss monster who is the fiercest of them all.<br/><br/>The ship has 4 damaged rooms that must be repaired. Players will find ship parts for each room by searching different locations. Once a ship part is brought back to the ship, players choose what section of the matching room they wish to repair, providing a one-time ability and giving more freedom of choice. Each room also an alternative side of one-time abilities which can be chosen or selected at random during setup, offering more replayability.<br/><br/>Once the heroes have repaired the ship, cleared the area of monsters, and everyone is on board, they can take-off and return home. Dice manipulation, as well as most actions not requiring specific dice, leaves players with the difficult decision of whether to attack, search, repair, gain XP, etc. rather than focusing on getting the best roll. The many different strategies to victory, along with the unique heroes and setup, provides a one-of-a-kind experience with each play.<br/><br/>It was all going so well&hellip; and then monsters showed up.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Mottomo Momotarō nanowa Mochiron Ore!&quot; translates roughly to &ldquo;Make no Mistake, I&rsquo;m the Most Momotaro!&rdquo;.<br/> <br/>Momotarō is a famous hero from Japanese legend but recently there&rsquo;s been an influx in Momotarō imposters.<br/><br/>  In order to prove he is the real Momotarō, Momotarō needs to gather up his old traveling buddies. Just who really is the genuine Momotarō?   <br/><br/>A light set collection game featuring 14 cute characters and easy-to-grasp rules. The first player to gather dog, monkey and pheasant wins the game!<br/><br/>There are two types of cards: items and friends. Each card has a Momotarō-ness score in the top left corner, as well an effect.<br/><br/>During each turn of the game, a player may chose to either (A) draw &amp; play a card, (B) use a Kibidango chip, or (C) pass.<br/><br/> If the player chooses A:<br/> After drawing a card from the stack they will proceed to place one card face up from his or her hand. This card will belong to the player unless another player takes it using (B). In addition, the effect of the card can be used.<br/><br/>  If the player chooses B: <br/>The player should declare their use of the Kibidango chip and put the chip into the disposal pile. He or she can then chose one friend card from a single opponent&rsquo;s exposed cards. In addition, the effect of the stolen card may be used.  <br/><br/>Note: You may not choose action B if the player in front of you has just used a chip on his or her turn. Chips also cannot be used if the card stack is empty.  <br/><br/>If the player chooses C:<br/> Nothing happens.<br/><br/>  The first player to collect the friend cards of dog, monkey, and pheasant wins. Alternatively, there is also a wild card that can be used to replace one of these three animals to win.<br/><br/>  When all players have empty hands and no one has been able to collect dog, monkey, and pheasant, use the total Momotarō-ness score of all the cards that belong to a player (placed in front of them) to determine the winner. If there is a tie, the player with the most friend cards wins. If there is still a tie, both players are the winners.<br/><br/>",

For example, &quot;my father's first cousin is my second cousin.&quot;<br/><br/>The deck's 64 cards represent everyone from great-grandmother to third cousin. Of course, there are a few wild cards, to get you out of tight spots. The figures on the cards have what Smith calls Egyptian-like, angular features. These, she said, are universal faces.<br/>Smith said she started working on the game in 1975, &quot;even before Roots came on television.&quot; It seemed simple, she said, until she realized there are hundreds of possible combinations of relatives.<br/><br/>Smith obtained a patent on &quot;Family Treedition&quot; two years ago. She paid a printer to produce 100 copies of the game last October and has sold them all, many as Christmas gifts. Another 500 copies are on the way for $14.95 each. The game can be purchased from Smith, or through Stanley 5 &amp; 10 Cent Stores in Brookland.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NomadSed is a strategic board game where players assume the role of nomadic herders and try to increase their livestock capital. They have to make decisions that do not only depend on the state of the pastures, but also on daily challenges related to life in the steppe. At times, it makes sense to invest money and buy extra fodder; at others, sheep have to be sold at the market; and sometimes, cooperating with your neighbours is the best choice.<br/><br/>The players&rsquo; goal is to obtain as many animals and as much cash as possible. In the end, it will be seen whether this is best achieved by exploiting the lands or through considerate resource utilisation.<br/><br/>The players possess livestock herds, monetary resources, rangelands, and their own labour force which is expressed in action points. Not all pastures on the board are equally productive: fertile grasslands, as well as barren steppes, provide the dietary staples for the animals, and both are easily exhausted. Herd mobility is therefore vital.<br/>Moreover, the players have various options for action so they can persist in the face of external adversities and prevail against the others. At the market, they may buy fodder, sell part of their livestock, or purchase additional animals. Development cards open up new options and alternative income sources.<br/><br/>The challenges faced by nomads are considerable. Year after year, they have to cope with different types of unexpected events. Recurrent external influences, whether local (drought, snowstorms, illness, legislation) or global in nature (price increases in animal fodder), determine their scopes of action. Only those who are flexible enough will prevail in the world of NomadSed.<br/><br/>NomadSed is entertaining and instructive all at once. Current problems that are faced by nomadic societies across the globe have been adapted into a game which offers insights into a unique subject matter. It has successfully been used in schools and universities to delve into the complex social-ecological conditions of land use in drylands. <br/>The board game can be borrowed for educational purposes in an easily transportable version whose design has been registered.<br/>The game was jointly developed in the context of the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Centre 586 &lsquo;Difference and Integration&rsquo; in cooperation between the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research &ndash; UFZ Leipzig, the University of Leipzig, and the Berlin University of the Arts.<br/><br/>",

There are two types of cards: apples and trees. An orchard is made up a tree column and an apple column. Tree cards are played into the tree column to form a trunk. When the total value of the trunk is greater than or equal to 100, harvesting begins. If the trunk&rsquo;s value is exactly 100, it is an abundant harvest and therefore the player may harvest all apples that they have placed into their apple column. If the value is greater than 100, the player may only harvest a single apple (the uppermost card aka the most recently placed card).<br/><br/>After harvesting, all tree cards are disposed and the player must work to grow another tree.<br/><br/>In addition, a player may also place down cards horizontally to achieve different effects.  <br/><br/>An apple card of the same number can be placed horizontally to create a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; of fruit. If, for example, this cluster is at the top of the apple column and a player begins harvesting after going over 100 in value, the player will be able to collect all the apples in the cluster (instead of just a single apple). However, if a player harvests their apples upon fulfilling the exactly 100 value requirement, they will only be able to harvest up till the first cluster and not the whole column.  <br/><br/>A tree card of the same number as another tree card can also be placed horizontally to create a branch. After harvesting, the non-trunk cards of this branch do not need to be disposed and instead can be rearranged to form a new column as the new trunk.  <br/><br/>In addition, branches give the player the option to include or exclude the cards forming the branch in their total tree value count (towards 100).<br/><br/>Branches and clusters can only be continuously built on the uppermost card (aka most recently placed card) for the column.<br/><br/>In this game, you can also chose to help tend your neighbor&rsquo;s orchard. You may play any card into their orchard instead of your own. If by doing this you fulfill the 100 value requirement for harvest, you will receive half of your neighbor&rsquo;s apple cards (you chose which half). If you fulfill the over 100 value requirement instead, you will battle with your neighbor over the single apple/cluster card(s).<br/><br/>  Battling consists of playing a &ldquo;war&rdquo;-esque game where both players simultaneously reveal a card from their hand. The player with the higher value tree card will win the apple Card. (Except for in the case that the highest card is 50, which will then allow for a 5 card to win instead.)<br/><br/>  At the end of the game (when the drawing deck is empty), this battling comes back into play to decide who gets the remaining unharvested apples in everyone&rsquo;s orchards.<br/><br/>There are also some special cards including a pigeon card, a woodpecker card, and a bug card which have different effects. Like apple and tree cards, players can choose to play them into their opponents&rsquo; orchards. <br/><br/>",

The amount of each company stock to be distributed is listed on the information cards. The rest of the certificates are kept in the bank for purchase during the game. Players can only buy one stock certificate per turn. All stocks begin at the same price level.<br/><br/>This concept allows mystery during the entire game as to the holdings of all players. It is harder to establish strategy for gaining majority when the available amounts vary and the knowledge of other players holdings are unknown. The decision of choosing a company when opening is predicated on the hand that is held from the original dealing of stock.<br/><br/>Since players are only allowed to purchase one stock certificate per turn, their money supply will usually last longer. Most players never run out of money throughout the entire game. The other benefit derived from the lower amount of stock purchases is that the player's ability to make quicker decisions for purchases is enhanced. Therefore, the rest of the players are not waiting as long for other players to finish their turns.<br/><br/>Play your game of ACQUIRE in a manner that allows mystery and a little bit of nostalgia. With the ACQUIRE 1963 World Map Conversion Kit your ACQUIRE board game can go back in time to the way it was first played 50 years ago.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roma Victrix is a grand strategic, moderate complexity wargame for 1 to 6 players, covering a time period ranging from 218 BC to 533 AD in twenty separate historical and hypothetical scenarios.<br/><br/>We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. - Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, De Re Militari<br/><br/>City. Republic. Empire. Roma Victrix &ndash; &ldquo;Rome Victorious&rdquo;.  Rome was forged in war.  Even the story of its legendary founding was rooted in a fratricidal conflict.  From her humble origins to her ultimate fall, Rome was either in a constant state of war, or preparing for it.  <br/>Beginning with the Punic Wars until the deposition of the last emperor in the West, Rome was the dominant force in the Mediterranean basin.<br/><br/>Roma Victrix is a game which endeavors to re-create the conflicts between Rome and her neighbors to achieve and maintain that dominance.  A simple interactive sequence of play guides  each player through the process of revenue collection, recruiting and maintaining military forces, conducting land and naval operations, diplomacy, field battles and sieges.  Special rules are included to emphasize the importance and effects of leadership, cavalry superiority, mobility and attrition. Random events are also represented, adding an element of unpredictability to even the best laid plans and the likelihood that no scenario will ever play the same.<br/><br/>Seventeen historical scenarios range from the 2nd Punic War through the attempted reconquest of the lost Western territories by Justinian in the mid-6th century A.D.  The rivalries of the later Republic, the Year of the Four Emperors, Imperial expansion and civil war, the Parthian and Persian frontier, the upheaval of the third century and the Germanic invasions are all represented. Three hypothetical scenarios are also included in which players can create their own history. Of the twenty scenarios in Roma Victrix, two are ideally suited for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>    Time Scale: 1 year per turn<br/>    Area Movement Map<br/>    Unit Scale: Legions, Legionary Equivalents, Barbarian Warbands<br/>    Players: one to six<br/>    Playing Time: 3-8 hours depending upon scenario<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Terra L&igrave;bera is a board game inspired by the ancient history of Sardinia. It wants to convey, through a game experience, the social transformations of the peoples who inhabited Sardinia through Nuragic, Phoenician, Punic and Roman times. Players go through history by living it in a game, looking for resources and being careful not to get enslaved.<br/><br/>The players assume the role of different populations in Sardinia. They are represented by nuraghes (ancient megalithic edifices) of different colours, that must collect resources (minerals, grape, oil, wheat, livestock, wood, brick). Depending on the number of nuraghes built in a territory, they will be considered free, masters, or slaves, and in the latter case, they will have to deliver the harvest to the master. During the turn, the players can increase their nuraghes population, move the nuraghes on the map, fight the opposing nuraghes to hunt them or to rebel against the masters, plunder the enemy's harvest. They also use the accumulated resources to improve production (mine, vineyard, quarry, field), transport, or start trading.<br/><br/>The aim is to solve more objective cards than the other players, trying not to hold unresolved objective cards on hand at the end of the game.<br/>The most skilled players will be those who will be able to adapt to what history asks them.<br/><br/>",

Any or all can win &ndash; or lose.<br/><br/>In medieval North Africa, towns are built by families like yours. Show your strategic and collaborative skills in Lost &amp; Found: New Harvest, a historical strategy game of balance between community and family needs.<br/><br/>Take on one of five roles in a struggle to address dilemmas, overcome crises, and avert disasters that threaten to destroy everything you know and love.<br/><br/>Look out for your family, but be sure to collaborate with your neighbors as well. Any number of players can win, but if anyone goes destitute, everyone loses.<br/><br/>This, the first standalone expansion to Lost &amp; Found, explores how lost and found possessions were addressed under Islamic jurisprudence, as informed by Al-Hidayah and The Distinguished Jurist's Primer. These texts were written in the 12th century by great Islamic scholar and jurists Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani and the polymath Ibn Rushd (Averroes). They provide guideposts for behavior, but it&rsquo;s up to you to decide how to solve dilemmas.<br/><br/>Explore the ways in which these medieval religious legal systems helped to hold society together and helped to keep neighbors cooperating with one another. Optionally, when you pair Lost &amp; Found: New Harvest with the original, players can take on both Jewish and Muslim roles, and explore how these laws play out for these two communities living in Fustat (Old Cairo) in the 12th century.<br/><br/>Will you follow the laws of lost and found possessions? Will you break them? Will you go above and beyond the law?<br/><br/>Find out in Lost &amp; Found: New Harvest!<br/><br/>",

(Trump Recount!!) consists of a board which shows a map of the United States, with some &quot;battleground&quot; states in white, and other states colored red or blue, to represent their political leanings in the 2020 United States' presidential election.  The game board lists 13 battleground states, and places to play cards for each state along the edge.  (Players must provide their own cards.) The map has a scale showing the progress of J.BIDEN and D.TRUMP towards an electoral college victory.<br/><br/>One player takes the red cards (diamonds and hearts) from a deck of cards, and the other player takes the remaining suits (clubs and spades). First the players gather their heart and spade cards, and, beginning with the red player, alternate placing cards at the 13 battleground states.  Then, the players do the same with the other suits.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the &quot;counting&quot; phase begins, and players have several options, such as to privately count a state and either declare victory or announce that the counting is still in progress; recount a state where your opponent has declared victory; ask for a public recount; or pass.<br/><br/>If any player declares defeat, the opponent's side wins. If neither player declares defeat, the game will never end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Summon Skate you play a Figure Skater. No, not the kind you&rsquo;re thinking. Instead you are a summoner who skates out complex magical diagrams to summon Figures - mythical gods and creatures - to fight giant monsters of chaos in high-speed, tactical battles.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Summon Skate is divided between puzzle solving/investigation and tactical combat. Players will check out strange happenings in their city to piece together the true nature of the chaos manifesting there. These investigations generally involve making checks using the simple 3 Attribute, 2D6 roll-under resolution system. Once the mystery is solved, the chaos gathers and takes on a physical form born from human nightmares - a Chaos Figure, the main enemies of this game.<br/><br/>Once combat with the Chaos Figure begins, the players are teleported to a magical stage represented by a 12 x 12 grid. Each turn, players must use their limited movements points to draw out summoning diagrams on the grid. Once a diagram is completed, players can summon the Figure tied to the diagram. Summoned Figures are the primary means of fighting, guarding, healing and supporting in the game. Meanwhile the enemy Chaos Figure will spend its turns trying to either kill the player characters directly or shatter the stage by creating cracks that extend from one side to the other. If all the players run out of HP or the stage is completely shattered, it&rsquo;s game over and the world falls to chaos. You&rsquo;ll need cooperation and planning to make it through these battles alive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The rules are very easy, and games go fast, but there is a lot of complexity to uncover, especially in understanding the ability combos.<br/><br/>Each player builds a small army of dragons with which to face their opponent, chooses in which order the dragons approach the enemy lines, and attempts to be the player with dragons remaining in hand at the end.<br/><br/>This expansion adds two new dragon types to the original Dragon Line deck.

        "description": "Hot Sauce by Kenneth Thompson. Ken always has a bag of tricks and this one was in the form of about 20 Taco Bell hot sauce packets. He had a neat domino feel tile laying abstract game in which Ben and Jason tightened a wee bit. In the end it's two things: 1) a full game made out of 7 cards or 2) a rule card that you can take with you to your favorite taco restaurant. Both have their perks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>A 2-4 player game that is played with sauce packets.<br/><br/>Shuffle the packets and place them into a pile of face-up and face-down packets. TAke the top 2 packets off the pile and place them in the center of the table, face-down next to each other.<br/><br/>Players will take turns drawing a packet from the top of the pile(any one that isn't covered by another packet) and then either 1) placing it in front of them for final scoring, or 2) placing it onto the center of the table so that it connects to a minimum of two other packets. After placing it, the player must flip over a packet that is touching it.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last packet is placed. Players score points for the packets in front of them. Each packet is worth 1 point for each face-up matching packet on the center. If there are no matching packets in the center, packets are -1 each.<br/><br/>Nuclear Packets do not score for players, but are wild in the center. They count as the type of any face-up packet that they are touching.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the March 2016 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.<br/><br/>",

It felt too fitting to not have kids do the artwork.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>You actually play with real candy. Players grab handfuls of candy with different types (different colors, different brands, etc), and hide their stash from the other players. They then take turns using powers described on the card trying to get another player to eat pieces from their stash. The last person with candy still in their stash wins.

Do you want to use muscle like The Warrior, or perhaps your intellect, like The Scientist. Are you more in tune with something spiritual, like The Shaman? There are many ways to play it!<br/><br/>Card by card, the story unfolds...<br/><br/>Each round, the storyteller lays contributed cards, as well as a few unknown cards, in a face-down spread. The reading of the images is performed similar to how a fortune teller would read Tarot, with images deriving meaning, and the orientation of the cards mattering. &quot;Ordered&quot; cards (correctly viewed) add positive events to the story, and perilous events happen when cards are &quot;Mirrored&quot; (upside-down).<br/><br/>During the reading of a spread, players are given the opportunity to say what they would like their character to do, and roll the die to see if their actions were successful. If players are successful, they may begin to turn cards in the spread to become ordered. A spread containing an Ordered Mind (blue), Body (red), and Spirit (green) card is considered a success for The Miri, and flips the next of five Suspense tiles in favor of The Miri.<br/><br/>However&hellip; Being unsuccessful in Ordering the cards allows the dark forces known as Ichor to get its clutches on the story! If all three Clutches of Ichor tokens are placed on the cards in the spread, you flip the next of five Suspense tiles back over in favor of Ichor.<br/><br/>If all five Suspense tiles show &quot;The Miri&quot;, you WIN and conclude the story with a victory for the players! ...Unless the story was lost to the Clutches of Ichor!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Written by Gen Z parents living the COVID life 24/7 with Gen Z kids, the game exudes its own version of twisted humor.<br/><br/>Players initially race around the board, buying up stock before the value collapses. While doing that, you are spreading a virus wherever you go, drawing notification cards (made from the insane things that have happened in 2020), and collecting toilet paper and homeopathy pills. Eventually, as spaces get quarantined, players are forced into the Bunker for the Lockdown Round.<br/><br/>At any point in the game if any one player dies from too much virus the game ends. You have to work together to stay alive, while also trying to get the most resources. Once the game ends players count their resources to win &quot;Trophies.&quot; Trophies can be won for things like holding the most stock, the most toilet paper, AND (of course) a &quot;Participation Trophy&quot; for the individual who loses so - trophies for everyone!<br/><br/>The player with the most trophies wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is the only reliable way to keep getting cards.<br/><br/>All cards have their own unique stats and a variety of Effects, which twist the rules and vary wildly in power &amp; utility.<br/><br/>Because of the sheer number of cards in this first Deck, you may very well play half a dozen games of BBT before you see all of the unique, comical, and wonderfully surreal characters that we've packed into this first installment.<br/><br/>- The Details -<br/><br/>Recommended game size: 2-6 players<br/>BBT is really designed for groups of 3 or more players, but does work with two players. More than 6 players can play BBT at a time, but game time will be longer as a result.<br/><br/>Avg. Game Length: 5-20 minutes<br/><br/>Ages 12+<br/><br/>- The Makers -<br/><br/>BBT is a labor-of-love project by Clown Car Entertainment, a small group of artists and creators centered in Pittsburgh, PA.<br/><br/>The game was first created in fall of 2016 when the makers were in college, and quickly won the hearts of their peers who played it between classes and during get-togethers. We're eternally grateful for all of the support they gave us; it helped us turn sketches on index cards into a fully fledged game project that anyone can play.<br/><br/>",

Each token reaching the target will get one point.<br/><br/>Game Setup<br/>The game board consists of 36 squares along the sides of the board making up the game zone.  The middle part of the board with diagonal lines (squares) only function as a passage and tokens cannot stop on it.  Start is on one corner and 19 which is the Target is on the opposite corner.<br/><br/>Players take multiple sets of 10 tokens in their color depending on how many players are playing (2 players = 6 sets, 3 players = 4 sets, 4 players 3 sets.)  The tokens are numbered 1-10 in each set.<br/><br/>The game starts with setting up the board for the first 12 turns.  Players take turns putting their &quot;1&quot; tokens on start, rolling one die (for the 1st 6 turns, 2 dice after that) and moving forward.  Play moves counter-clockwise around the board.  When moving diagonal, play moves clockwise.<br/><br/>If they land on another player the player sitting on that square is bumped diagonally across the board. If a player lands on a player in corner square, the player sitting in that corner square is bumped on backward.  As more tokens are placed on the board multiple chain-reactions can take place, bumping multiple players to new spaces.  After 12 &quot;1&quot; tokens have been played on the board the game is ready to start.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>During game play only 12 tokens are allowed on the board.  Tokens can be replaced with higher numbered tokens.<br/><br/>During game play you choose which one token you wish to move.  Once a token reaches the Target (19 space) they replace their token with the next higher number token which gets placed on start and if the dice number is higher than the number needed to reach the Target then the upgraded token moves the additional spaces from the Start space.<br/><br/>The game continues until on person reaches the target with their number 10 token.  Their points for that token will be 11.  All players then count the number of all their tokens on the board and the player with the highest point total wins.<br/><br/>",

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>In more detail, players use washable crayons to draw their train routes over a map of the North Pole, including North America, Greenland, Asia, and Europe. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase, a player may pay to build more track or upgrade their train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect their track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to get more points than your opponent every play to advance your marker on the score card. After 4 plays, offense will either score points (simulating a field goal all the way to a touchdown with a 2-point conversion) or defense will score 2 points for a safety. Play continues with the opponent assuming the role of offense.<br/><br/>All of this can be interrupted or changed if an opponent intercepts the ball, recovers a fumble, etc. And every action played has counters. Winning players have a little luck but play their cards strategically to maximize when to play combos, which cards to play vs. keep, and how to predict their opponent's plays. To add further depth, each card has an Offense and a Defense side to it, providing for many more play possibilities.<br/><br/>The deck represents either a full game, a half, or a quarter of a game. Once a full game is complete, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1244: The Fall of Montsegur is a strategic board game inspired by the historical event. One player takes on the role of commanding the crusading army. The other player takes on the role of commanding the defense of Montsegur. In a series of turns the players fight to gain control of the area around Montsegur and the souls of the Cathars trapped inside the castle. At the end of the siege, victory points are scored to determine if the Cathar faith survives the fall.<br/><br/>The goal in 1244: The Fall of Montsegur is to claim the majority of the souls of the Cathar perfects trapped inside the castle. The inquisitors of the Crusaders try to get the misguided to repent, while the Cathars perfects try to escape or to have faith to make the final sacrifice: Burn for their belief.<br/><br/>The religious struggle takes place on the background of a military campaign, where each side strives to gain control of the battlefield and to endure the hardships of the long siege.<br/><br/>In a number of turns each representing roughly one month of the siege, each player in turn plays cards to advance his goals and to sabotage his opponent. Each card can either be played for the point value on the card to take one of the standard actions or be played for the event on the card. Some events benefit solely the Cathars, others the Crusaders, and some can benefit both depending on who plays it and what the position on the board is. In every turn one card from each player's hand is not played but is kept for the final scoring.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is the most crowed area of space. 1000s of spacecraft pass overhead and orbit slots are hotly contested. Take control of your LEO spacecraft, manage its resources to deliver the maximum data back to the ground.<br/><br/>In LEO (400-800km) players take control of a spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit.  Each turn they move their spacecraft to the next orbit card and resolve the events on that card (discharge battery, damage memory, use thrusters to maintain orbit, place new orbit card).<br/><br/>After the events, the player can then take one of the following actions:<br/><br/>     Adjust orbit (either moving up to a higher orbit, or down to a lower orbit),<br/>     Recharge battery,<br/>     Activate instruments (storing science or image data in their memory area)<br/>     Downlink data (remove science &amp; image data from the memory area and score points on the science and image track)<br/><br/><br/>As the game progresses players will be eliminated as they run out of fuel and can no longer maintain their orbit.<br/>Once all players have been eliminated, the player with highest, lowest scoring track is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Good practice in recognizing and completing picture - and lots of fun, too.<br/><br/>One Child Alone: can play Captain Kangaroo TV Lotto by spreading all 4 Master cards on table or floor and matching the Lotto pieces to the cards by putting each piece in its proper place.  Older children may like to match up the pieces by checking the numbers in the corners of the picture pieces with the corresponding numbers on the Master cards.<br/><br/>For Group Play: each player selects a Master card and puts it face up in front of him.<br/><br/>The Lotto pieces are mixed and placed face down, in a pile in the middle of the playing area.  The first player in turn lifts a Lotto piece from the pile and holds it up for all to see.  If the Lotto piece matches a section of his Master card, he places it over the matching section and has the opportunity to pick the next card from the pile.  The player continues picking from the pile until he selects a Lotto piece that does not match his Master card.<br/><br/>The player on whose master card the Lotto piece belongs, calls &quot;here!&quot; and takes it.  He places it on the right spot on his Master card and continues picking Lotto pieces until he cannot use it.<br/><br/>Unclaimed picture pieces are returned to the bottom of the pile and called out again at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The first player to complete a picture by covering his Master card with all 6 pieces is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Instead of simply lining up evenly-matched armies and fighting to the death, the players can have realistic objectives (such as the capture of a vital piece of terrain or delaying a superior enemy to cover a retreat) and be confronted with more challenging tactical decisions. Devising such scenarios can take a lot of effort, and more critically, time, which is always in short supply. This book is designed to take the time and effort out of organising fascinating and challenging wargames set in the Peninsular War.<br/><br/>In addition to 20 carefully devised scenarios of varying size and complexity, this book contains a concise introduction to the theatre of operations and an integrated chronology of battles and campaigns, showing where the scenarios fit into the wider events. The scenarios and orders of battle are intended for use with Pen &amp; Sword's own Napoleonic wargame rules, Grand Battery, but they are easily adaptable for use with other leading systems.<br/><br/>&bull; Briefing notes on the context of the battle and the dilemmas and objectives facing each commander.

The player places the triangle on the table. In turn order, the other players place one of their triangles adjacent to the last played triangle with the same length (similar to the principle of domino). A player who cannot do so must pass. The player who gets rid of all his triangles wins.<br/><br/>In addition, mathematical facts are presented about the Golden section, the theorem of Pythagoras and about parallelograms.

Where aircraft are set to operate, static ground-based weapons batteries will often be deployed in advance to protect vital assets and add to the fleet&rsquo;s firepower.<br/><br/>Hydra flak batteries are common across Imperial war zones. The version used by the Astra Militarum can be erected quickly, and then dismantled and sent to the advancing front as needed. Their quad-barrelled cannons fill the skies with a storm of lethal shrapnel.<br/><br/>Basilisk Anti-aircraft Emplacements hurl massive Earthshaker shells to saturate the air with clouds of burning debris, tearing apart airframes and smashing engines to bits. When deployed in clusters, an entire section of the sky becomes a near-impenetrable wall of deadly flak.<br/><br/>This finely-detailed resin kit allows you to build one of each type of ground weapon, including two heavily-armoured bunkers in which to house them, plus a fuel depot to be used as an objective during your games. All three of these resin kits feature the rough-and-ready aesthetics of the Imperial Guard, visually distinct from the ground assets of the Imperial Navy.<br/><br/>The set includes:<br/>- 1 resin Hydra flak battery<br/>- 1 resin Basilisk Anti-aircraft emplacement<br/>- 1 resin fuel depot<br/><br/>Profiles (stat cards) for the two weapon emplacements are included.

        "description": "The year is 1861. Tensions between the industrial north and agrarian south have been strained for years. Immoral as it may be, slavery is an institution in the south and, like it or not, its major asset. As new states are added to the union, slavery there will likely be prohibited. The south will thus eventually lose federal political power while the north gains it. Additionally, burdensome tariffs which mainly affect the south have been doubled, hurting its economy. Abraham Lincoln, a northern lawyer and railroad man, is sworn in as the new President of the United States. During his inaugural address, Lincoln promises not to invade the south or curtail slavery as long as tariffs are collected there and handed over to the federal government. The south secedes nonetheless. Lincoln won&rsquo;t let it go, and attempts to reinforce Fort Sumter in South Carolina, hoping to provoke the south into firing the first shots, and it does, leveling the fort. With war fever in the north at its zenith, the stage is set &ndash; for Lincoln&rsquo;s invasion of the south!<br/><br/>Lincoln's Invasion 1861-1865 is a highly playable card game of light complexity, with a small rules set. Over the course of 17 or 18 battles the USA and CSA will duke it out over the fate of the union. Event cards generally play out to the advantage of CSA in the beginning and USA toward the end, while diceless combat reduces the luck factor.

Exorcists deduce the true name of a demon, the name being a hidden four-digit number.<br/><br/>One player is the demon king, and chooses its secret name from four digits in order. The other players are the exorcists, and must deduce the demon's name. If they do, it loses all its power and they win.<br/><br/>The demon also possesses one of the exorcists in secret at the start of the game (they don't know it) and can lie when answering this exorcist, thus sowing lies in their midst.<br/><br/>The exorcists start the game knowing one of the digits each. They can discuss their ideas for a few minutes, and then in turn, each exorcist makes a claim of the four digit number. The demon answers in such a way that they might deduce which numbers are correct, and in the correct place.<br/><br/>If the exorcists discover the true name within the time limit, they win (and lose if they fail so), but only if they also can conceal who knows which number. For if they land on the correct sequence, the demon king and its possessed aide can now discuss which exorcist had which digit. If they get this correct, the demon king escapes victorious with the assistant.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for playing online.

        "description": "Secret Mission is the reimplementation of Hexdominimum for the Puppy Park set, by the same designer, released as a bonus game.<br/><br/>Up to 4 players can play. It can be played with or without the expansion, although the dog houses and tree-poop tiles are not used.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the tiles face-down on the table. Each player then draws a tile without showing it to the other players, looks at it, then keeps it before them facing down so the other players can&rsquo;t see it. If both dogs are the same (i.e. it is a double tile) then discard the tile to the supply and re-draw until you get a tile with two different dogs; then reshuffle the supply. This is your &quot;mission tile&quot;. Each player then draws a second tile; this is your &quot;playing tile&quot;.<br/><br/>The first player places her playing tile on the table face-up. Then, starting with the second player, players take turns in anticlockwise order, placing their playing tile on the table adjacent to at least one placed tile so that the tiles fit into an imaginary hexagonal grid, then drawing a new playing tile from the supply (if possible). The dogs of adjacent tiles don&rsquo;t need to match.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last tile has been placed on the table, and each player then calculates her score. For each of the two dogs on your mission tile, find the largest contiguous, connected group of that dog. Count the number of dogs in that group. Once you have counted the largest group for each of your two dogs, multiply these two values to determine your score.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest score wins. In case of a tie, the tied player who played her final tile first wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to reach the opponents' 9 starting spaces with the snips of the same color (like in Salta). Movement is in knight-move forward and backwards on the grey and red spaces. Double moves are possible by jumping over friendly snips. If a snip has passed the red spaces into the opponents half of the game board, it can't return to its own half.<br/><br/>Snip-Jagd (2-4 Players)<br/>Each player has 2 hunters, which start on the spaces marked with a &quot;J&quot; and a runner starting on the spaces marked with a &quot;L&quot;. The players have to move their runner around the game board till it reaches its starting space again. Movement is determined by 2 dice. When a runner moves through an enemy's circle, he risks being caught by the two enemy hunters, which can't leave the circle. A runner may be caught by other runners, too. A caught runner returns to his starting space to begin anew. If a runner manages to catch a hunter, the hunter is out of the game permanently. The first runner to reach his starting space, after completing the track around the game board, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kongō (金剛, &ldquo;Indestructible Diamond&rdquo;), named for the mountain, was the first battleship of her class, serving in both the first and second world wars. At the time of construction in the early 1910s she was a capital ship (the last Japanese Capital ship to be built outside of Japan) and was among the most heavily armed ships in any Navy. She received two major reconstructions throughout her life, the first being in 1929, she was rebuilt as a battleship, then later in 1935, along with her sister vessels, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, resulting in an increased rate of knots that would allow her to keep pace with the developing carrier groups &ndash; thus reclassifying her a s a fast-battleship.<br/><br/>Kongō&rsquo;s World War II service history includes covering the Japanese amphibious landings in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies in 1942, shortly before engaging American forces and Midway and during the Guadalcanal campaign. 1943 saw her almost entirely stationed in the Caroline Islands, only being deployed in response to aircraft carrier raids against Japanese Islands scattered across the Pacific. She was part of the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944, successfully sinking enemy vessels in the latter. Her ultimate fate was at the hands of a US Submarine (USS Sealion) whilst crossing the Formosa Strait on 21 November 1944. She has the unfortunate distinction of being the sole Japanese battleship sunk by submarine in WW2.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Mikuma then participated in the Indian Ocean Raids, before being recalled for the Midway operation. It was here she met her demise; on 5 June 1944, she was badly damaged by a friendly ship collision attempting to evade US submarine torpedo attacks. A succession of attempted airborne attacks, from B-17s to Vought SB2U Vindicators all failed. The next morning, however, SBD Dauntless dive bombers from USS Enterprise and Hornet managed to successfully inflict 5 bomb hits resulting in a cataclysmic chain reaction of explosions of the onboard AA shells and torpedoes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

She was the first ship with a turbo-electric transmission, capable of a cruising speed of 10 knots. She served as an escort to President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s voyage to Brest, France, for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. She operated repeated exercises in Pacific and Atlantic waters in the interwar period and received major modernisation between 1931 and 1933.<br/><br/>Initially, in World War II, the vessel was involved in neutrality operations in the Atlantic. This soon changed after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She returned to the Atlantic and participated in shore bombardments including at Attu and Kiska, Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, the Mariana and Palau Islands Leyte, Luzon and Okinawa. She also performed escort duties, patrols and received refits during this period.

        "description": "Built during World War Two, USS Essex was the lead of her class of aircraft carriers. She was commissioned in December 1942 and went on to serve in several campaigns in the Pacific Theatre of operations. For her efforts, she received the Presidential Unit Citation and 13 battle stars. She operated right until the finale of the war, participating in the final raids against the Japanese home islands between 10 July to 15 August 1945.<br/><br/>Though already moderately armed, the primary offensive capability of a carrier was, of course, its aircraft, known as &ldquo;Sunday Punch&rdquo;. This comprised up to 36 fighters, 36 dive bombers and 18 torpedo bombers. Typically, the standard fighter would be the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the dive-bomber/scout the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and the torpedo bomber the Grumman TBF Avenger as the torpedo bomber.<br/><br/>At the close of the war, Essex was decommissioned but modernized and recommissioned in the 1950s, serving as an anti-Submarine carrier. During this time, she participated in the Korean War and was key in the Cuban Missile Crisis. She also has the distinction of being the primary recovery carrier for the Apollo 7 space mission.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Tanzimat reforms were an ambitious attempt on the part of liberally minded Ottoman sultans and politicians to modernize the aging empire and thereby keep it from disintegrating.<br/><br/>Players in the game represent Ottoman court factions who enlist Statesmen to use their bonuses, enact Reforms and reduce the number of Troubles in the empire. They must keep an eye on three common resources: Finances, Army and Standing. Event cards are drawn at the start of each turn that add new Troubles to the map, possibly causing Revolts.<br/><br/>The game consists of two Ages. At the end of each Age, a Crisis happens. (The Crisis may happen earlier if the number of Troubles and Revolts reach a critical number.)

Your opponents will sabotage you with unexpected incidents: a broken viaduct, an appeal to the public auction, blocking the works and see if you can repel the attack of opponents with negotiations, allocation of funds, any new builder or with some electoral promises.<br/>It is recommended for 14+ years old players.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>     Cards with cities will be shuffled and equally distributed for all players. If any cards remain undistributed, you need to put them in a separate stack on the table.<br/>     Cards with vignette will be stacked on the table.<br/>     Cards with sabotage actions will be shuffled and given 10 to every player (if there are 6 players, any of them will be given 8 cards). The rest are placed on the table.<br/><br/><br/>All players start from Bucharest and roll the dice. They need to move their pawn an equal number of points as corresponding on the dice (but he can't step twice on the same point in a turn). If the pawn is placed on a highway point, the player can ask for the related card, by initiating an act of sabotage against the player who owns that card.<br/><br/>What is sabotage:<br/>Sabotage cards have a number of points (e.g.: 1 / 2 / 8 / 0.1 or -3 / -5 etc). A player who wants a card for a highway, needs to put down a sabotage card of negative value (e.g.: -3). The opponent must repel the attack with 1 or more cards with positive value until their sum is greater than the opponent's card (-1 equals +1 or overcome with +2). In case of equality, challenged player can keep his card. Otherwise, if the challenged player overcomes the attack, he can choose a card with cities from the player who initiated the attack. If the challenged player is defeated, the player who initiated the attack receives his requested card.<br/><br/>Vignette cards: <br/>Can be used only at border crossing points in order to obtain 3 sabotage cards OR to ask for any of highway city cards.<br/>Every route has a specific number of points. The player with most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Meta Olympia, you play a Martian colony 'football' club in the not-too-distant future, playing rules that resemble soccer on Earth. The objective of the game is to be the most bad-ass team on the planet by achieving the most combined point.  Player's teams are made up of athlete cards, each offensive, defensive or special abilities.<br/><br/>There are two different stages played over 4 rounds. In the Pre-Season phases, players take turns moving their miniatures forward along modular tiles.  Each tile either helps players improve their team (via recruiting and trading athlete cards) or collecting resources that improve players tactical options.<br/><br/>In the tournament round, players get to to go head-to-head against each other in player vs player matches. Matches are played in 3 rounds where each player uses one athlete card and a die role per round.  Players can also play tactics cards, resources earned from the pre-season phase, to buff or nerf.<br/><br/>Each round determines goals, saves, and potential injuries; with the final match result based on the final score of all 3 rounds.<br/>As players move into the following stages, they have the resources to continually strengthen their team by adding higher-value players.<br/><br/>In tournament in stage 4 is the final championship.  For 2 players, it is a best of 5 matches.  For 3 or more players, it is a round robin. Players go all out to either defend their lead or challenge the leaders.<br/><br/>The final winner is determined by tallying up all the points collected, either through wins, game currency, or special resource cards.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of hiding, seeking and spooking.<br/><br/>Inspired on the cult film Beetlejuice.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the December 2016 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/><br/>A lovely couple has died, and in a panic to save their home from the living family that's moved in and ruined everything, accidentally unleashed a dangerous ghost promising to rid the house of the living.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Choose one player to be the Bio-Exorcist. You are a ghost, and you are trying to scare the living residents of this haunted house out, by moving items spookily around their house.<br/><br/>The other players leave the room to split up 2+ roles: 1 Occultist, 1 Goth, and 0-3 Folks.<br/><br/>While they're gone, the Bio-Exorcist moves as many objects as the number of living players, and hides a spook (represented by a card or a coin) under each one:<br/><br/>     One spook is the postcard, The Handbook for the Recently Deceased.<br/>     One spook (the joker or the largest coin) is Scared to Death.<br/>     The rest of the spooks are the love of the ghost couple.<br/><br/><br/>SPOOKING OBJECTS<br/>An object you spook must be noticeable moved from where it started. To mess with their heads, the Bio-Exorcist may also move 3 more objects without hiding any spooks under them.<br/><br/>It's important that the Bio-Exorcist remembers where they put each card/coin. Record this info, if needed.<br/><br/>Finally, the Bio-Exorcist calls back the living and the game can begin.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>Each living player may ask one question of the Bio-Exorcist and may peek under one object. They may do this in any order, at any time; there are no turns.<br/><br/>The Bio-Exorcist must answer questions truthfully, but may interpret ambiguous wording as they please. They cannot speak, they answer only with knocks: once for &quot;yes&quot;, don't knock for &quot;no&quot;, in numbers knocking that many times.<br/><br/>When a living player peeks and finds a spook, they reveal it and earn another question and another peek.<br/><br/>WINNING AND LOSING<br/>Anyone who reveals Scared to Death loses the game immediately.<br/><br/>If the Goth reveals the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, they get to fulfill their dream of becoming a ghost. The Goth and the Bio-Exorcist win.<br/><br/>If the Occultist reveals the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, they exorcise the Bio-Exorcist and the ghost couple. The Occultist and the Folks win.<br/><br/>If all of the love spooks are revealed, the ghost couple  and the living become friends, and get rid of the Bio-Exorcist. All of the living players win.<br/><br/>If no one has any peeks left and there are love spooks unfound, the living have been driven from the house. The Bio-Exorcist wins.<br/><br/>",

The number can include zero to make it single digits.<br/><br/>Each player must then make a claim using two face down cards from their hand to represent the digits.<br/><br/>After each player chooses their cards, all player will reveal their claims.<br/><br/>After the claims are revealed, players will use their J-Q-K to bet on the factual nature of any or all other player's claims:<br/><br/>     Jack: must be Joking. None of the digits are correct.<br/>     Queen: not Quite right. One of the digits is correct and one is not.<br/>     King: 100% Korrect.

When you run out of cards, you are considered &quot;out&quot;. Last person out is the Misfit. The game is based off of a traditional card game call &quot;Sh!thead&quot;, among other names. To make it simple, we've created a 1-10 number system for the hierarchy of cards, as well as a few &quot;Power Cards&quot; that can be played on anything. To give Misfit a story and personality, we've chosen a &quot;Warriors&quot; theme for the first available edition. The beauty of Misfit Card Game is we will make many different editions tailored for any person's interests!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Laid down in 1937 and commissioned in 1941, HMS Duke of York was a King George V-class of battleship. She had the distinction of transporting Winston Churchill across the Atlantic to meet Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Winter of 1941. Churchill wrote of his experience, &ldquo;Being in a ship in weather such as this is like being in a prison, with the extra chance of being drowned&rdquo;. Between March and September of the next year she was involved mainly in convoy escort duties, but in October was dispatched to Gibraltar to become the flagship of Task Force H.<br/><br/>She saw little action during this period, her main role being protection of the task force&rsquo;s aircraft carriers, but nevertheless assisted the Allied invasion of North Africa. She subsequently participated in operations to divert Axis attentions away from Sicily in Operation Husky, and Operation Leander in an attempt to disrupt German merchant shipping of the coast of Norway.<br/><br/>On December 26th 1943 HMS Duke of York encountered the German battleship Scharnhorst. Exchanging fire, HMS Duke of York suffered some hits with little effect, but for her part landed several hits upon Scharnhorst, silencing a turret and hitting a boiler room. This forced Scharnhorst on the defensive, and she was sunk by torpedoes as well as further heavy fire from Duke of York.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This work was not finished until 1924.<br/><br/>Initially deployed in the Indian Ocean against the threat of German commerce raiders, Eagle also saw service in Mediterranean and the China station. At the outset of war, the Fleet Air Arm was severely lacking fighters, so her complement of aircraft was limited to solely Fairey Swordfish Torpedo bombers until late 1940.<br/><br/>Upon the Italian entry into the war on the side of the Axis, HMS Eagle was the only Royal Navy carrier available to the British in the Mediterranean, but performed sterling service in ferrying fighters to the island of Malta. It was whilst performing this latter duty that she was sunk in August 1942, when torpedoed by the German Submarine U-73.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Admiral Franz von Hipper was commander of the German battlecruiser squadron of the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and subsequently became commander-in-chief of the German high seas fleet. It was for him that Admiral Hipper was named, the lead ship of her class.<br/><br/>Admiral Hipper saw significant action over the course of the war, with a heavy emphasis on the Battle of the Atlantic. She also led the assault on Trondberg during Germany&rsquo;s invasion of Norway, sinking the British destroyer HMS Glowworm in the process. In December of 1940, she successfully broke out to the Atlantic in an effort to disrupt Allied Merchant convoys, but failed to achieve much success. Her next sortie in February 1941 saw much more success when she sank several merchant vessels, before being transferred back to Norway to raid convoys to the Soviet Union. ON New Year&rsquo;s Eve 1942, at the Battle of the Barents Sea, after sinking a destroyer and a minesweeper she was forced to withdraw due to the efforts of HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica. Following the failure to destroy any merchant vessels in this battle, Hitler ordered the majority of surface warships scrapped. Admiral Hipper returned to Germany and was never restored to operational status after being bombed by the Royal Air Force in May 1945.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the 1930s she served as a training vessel for cadets, but the outbreak of World War Two saw her conducting operations in the North Sea, though she didn&rsquo;t encounter any British warships at this time.<br/><br/>She was present at the attack of Bergen during the German invasion of Norway and was the only member of the K&ouml;nigsberg-class to survive the operation (codenamed Weser&uuml;bung). Later, in 1942, she was experimentally modified to carry a Flettner FI 282 helicopter, and returned to Norway, though she failed to see action. Remaining there until 1945, she eventually returned to Germany only to be sunk in March by American bombers over Wilhelmshaven. However, she remained on an even keel, and with her gun turrets above the waterline, was able to provide fire support to the defenders of the city until war&rsquo;s end in May 1945.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

She was the second of the Admiral Hipper-class of heavy cruisers, completed shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She was assigned to the task force supporting the invasion of Norway in April 1940, serving as the flagship of Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz, leading the flotilla of ships to capture Oslo, she was struck by numerous coastal defences including outdated 28cm coastal guns at close range, and two torpedoes fired from land-based batteries.<br/><br/>These hits resulted in a major fire breaking out aboard the vessel which spread first to the ship&rsquo;s magazines, and then to her fuel bunkers, resulting in further major explosions that could not be contained.

An early victory was the sinking of HMS Rawalpindiin November 1939.

The kitchen permits to recruit kitchen helps or to collect &ldquo;special&rdquo; cards, while the pantries make it possible to collect ingredients.<br/><br/>However, each place has a certain number of &ldquo;Hot Potato&rdquo; cards that will send one of your kitchen help to the emergency, if you draw one of these cards. Be careful, if you haven't more clerks, your chef will be in danger and you'll risk elimination.<br/><br/>The last chef in the competition will win the golden chef's hat and earn points based on the number of ingredients harvested.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The deluxe game can be played with the base rule set, or a separate rule set for a different mode of play.<br/><br/>In either version of the game, first a crime scene is established using the Crime, Suspect, and Evidence decks. Then, players will use the Investigation Resources deck to try to acquire their own Evidence cards in order to try to match them to the requisites of the Crime and Suspects' dossier. Evidence is acquired in rounds of a &quot;bidding&quot;-type action against the other players.<br/><br/>Apart from competing to acquire evidence, however, players can also interfere with one another's investigations by deploying Special cards, or by utilizing a special action allowed to their Investigator type. There may also be a traitor in the game, playing as Father Brown's nemesis Flambeau, whose goal is to masquerade as a detective and stop anyone from solving the crime.<br/><br/>There are also risks in some investigations: a player's Investigator might be killed in the line of duty, forcing that player to draw a new Investigator role and start out again back-footed in his or her investigation!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As such, the game can be used as a team builder, an ice breaker, as a filler, or as a gateway game.<br/><br/>Top Tale: The Original Game - Volume 2, is the second volume in the Top Tale series, designed and published by the Indie Game Alliance studio, Yub Nub Games.<br/><br/>Top Tale: The O.G Vol 2 is a stand alone companion to all other Top Tale volumes, and includes topic cards that expand on the topics from the first volume without compromising on the quality of play testing each card topic has gone through.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Top Tale: Tall Tale is a spin off of Top Tale: The Original Game (O.G.), where the twist is that for each topic a fantastical element must be added into the players' responses. Similar to The O.G. series, the game can be played with 2-10 players, ages 10+, and a typical game lasts 30+ minutes, taking less than two minutes to learn.<br/><br/>In Top Tale: Tall Tale, players will still get to know each other, however the stories aren't expected to be based solely on the truth. The stories are expected to be exaggerated and unbelievable, which makes the best story often times the most entertaining story.<br/><br/>Top Tale: Tall Tale can be integrated with other Top Tale volumes during gameplay, where the Tall Tale cards are clearly marked to cue players to stretch the truth. The other game play mechanics are all the same as the rest of the Top Tale series.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player will have four fighters they can use to attack others and lay claim to the enemy's strongholds but it will always be at a cost.<br/><br/>Players should also be careful of the very planet itself, as Arrakis is a harsh place and to survive it will take its toll. Luckily, if a player owns certain territories they either gain by force or are naturally given it from the start, they can receive riches in the form of the spice melange.<br/><br/>With the spice, players can bribe and trade with each other and afford to survive in the hostile deserts of Arrakis. But players should be cautious, as deals can be broken and players can lie their way to getting spice. Calling them out on not following through on a deal or catching them in a lie can cause them to lose a turn but a player falsely accusing someone of lying can have harsher consequences.<br/><br/>The game ends when any of the unique faction specific winning conditions are met.<br/><br/>",

In these operations off Norway, Gneisenau along with Scharnhorst, engaged and sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious, but in turn Gneisenau was damaged in action against HMS Renown and was subsequently struck by torpedoes.<br/><br/>After further actions in the Atlantic in 1941, the two ships put in at Brest, and were subject to repeated Allied bombing raids. Despite suffering damage, Gneisenau was repaired in good time and in early 1942, the two battle cruisers participated in a daylight dash up the English Channel, sailing for Germany. Gneisenau reached Kiel in early February and went into drydock. On the night of 26 February, the British launched an air attack on the ship, with an explosion in the forward ammunition section causing such heavy damage that it was deemed that the ship's weapons would be refit (as had been originally planned), necessitating a rebuild for her to accommodate larger 38cm guns (her original 28 cm became shore batteries). These plans were abandoned on Hitler's order in 1943. <br/>On 27 March 1945, Gneisenau was sunk as a block-ship in German occupied Poland. Eventually, she was broken up for scrap in 1951.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Construction on the ship that would eventually be christened Graf Zeppelin was eventually halted in 1940.<br/><br/>However, with the role of the carrier proving itself in the Battle of Taranto, in the sinking of the Bismarck and at Pearl Harbour and Midway prompted construction to briefly continue. The Graf Zeppelin was almost completed in 1943 but Hitler, disappointed with the Kriegsmarine, halted all surface fleet construction. The Carrier was captured by the Soviet Union at the end of the war, and was sunk as a target ship in 1947.<br/><br/>Though obviously never seeing action in reality, Kriegsmarine players are afforded new tactical options in Victory at Sea with the opportunity to include this carrier in their fleet.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During a series of air strikes against the North Korean port of Hoeryong, the four MiGs were intercepted as a result of intelligence provided by the US National Security Agency. Williams lost contact with his wingman and found himself in a 6-on-1 confrontation against the fearsome MiG 15. Nevertheless, he downed four of the enemy jets and upon returning to the USS Oriskany, his Panther was found to have sustained 263 hits from cannon shells and was beyond repair.<br/><br/>What makes this feat all the more remarkable is that the four MiGs downed were confirmed to have been flown by Soviet Naval Aviation Pilots.

        "description": "カミクライム! (Kami Climb!) is a dexterity game from Japan, exhibited for the first time at Tokyo Game Market Autumn 2019. Before playing, the paper mountain is constructed by hand using the paper materials supplied. Through paper folding, a large column with angular sides is built, standing in a solid base unit. The shape resembles the artificial climbing walls found in modern sports centres.<br/><br/>Once the piece of paper is transformed into a steep rocky mountain, the players operate their climber with one finger, to aim for the top of the mountain. The player first pushes their climber up with their finger and hooks it on the anchor to proceed. The anchors match the climbers' colours.<br/><br/>There are two phases, plan and climb. Reach the anchors on the 3D board in turn order. When climbing, if the climber reaches an anchor in their colour, they take another move.<br/><br/>Players can win by reaching the summit faster than the others. But a player can still win if they take the harder routes. Players must choose between easier, faster routes, and harder, more technical routes. If a player can conquer the hardest route in three turns, they win.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&lsquo;IRON TRIANGLE&rsquo; OUTPOST PORK CHOP HILL, KOREA 6 July 1953: At 1025 hours on the night of July 6th a massive artillery and mortar barrage preceded an onslaught by 700 soldiers from the CCF 200th Regiment, 67th Division. The sounds from the crashing shells concealed the oncoming Chinese, until they burst forward in what was described as &ldquo;a moving carpet of yelling, howling men--whistles and bugles blowing, their officers screaming like women driving their men uphill.&rdquo; In a bunker CP just beneath the crest of the hill Corporal Dale W. Cain heard his radio come alive with reports of &ldquo;enemy in large numbers&rdquo;. Company A reported hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. The battle was fought in a driving monsoon rain, making evacuation of the wounded difficult, as well as re-supply. As the battle swayed back and forth, the Chinese made repeated pushes to take the hill while both sides unleashed a storm of artillery fire upon the struggling soldiers. During the course of two days, parts of four companies defended Pork Chop. At dawn on July 8th, the rain ended for a time and the initial defenders were withdrawn. The defenders counted nine enemy assaults during the night of July 6-7. By 11 July General Taylor reluctantly decided to abandon Pork Chop Hill. As had been the case on Old Baldy, Taylor could not justify risking more lives for a hill that was of minimal strategic significance. The armistice was finally just around the corner.<br/><br/>Newly remastered - really NEW as the terrain has changed in some instances, not to mention the retro art and then some &gt; AND THE MAP IS about 120% ENLARGED!

Can the astronauts find the intruders  and expel them from the ship before it is too late?<br/><br/>U.S.S.

In the first phase all players secretly choose a location in the ship to work in.  In the second phase players will find out who else is working in the same room, and then the intruder players can attempt to kill a player in the same or adjacent room.  In the final phase the players discuss who is an intruder and decide if someone is going out an airlock.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns fighting each other and defending themselves until someone destroys his enemy's commander and wins the game. Each player's deck is made up of many cards. Some cards - called puns or inside jokes - have powerful, one time use effects (just like the look your friends get the first time you say a corny line). Others are fighters who act both as your offensive and defensive line. They are super important and can even be upgraded with items, a third type of card.<br/><br/>The game gets more and more intense each turn because the more turns that go by, the more resources that gather in your resource pile.

Players take turns fighting each other and defending themselves until someone destroys his enemy's commander and wins the game. Each player's deck is made up of many cards. Some cards - called puns[ or inside jokes - have powerful, one time use effects (just like the look your friends get the first time you say a corny line). Others are fighters who act both as your offensive and defensive line. They are super important and can even be upgraded with items, a third type of card.<br/><br/>The game gets more and more intense each turn because the more turns that go by, the more resources that gather in your resource pile.

        "description": "In 2088 only monolithic cities of trans-humanistic worship protrude from the crust of the earth. Between these cities lies The Expanse, where all opposed were banished. The first to stabilize an economy was Neo Tokyo. The 3 foundational levels that stabilized the economy are as follows:<br/><br/>THE UNDERBELLY<br/>The Underbelly is at street level and is home to the augmentation junkies looking to merge with machines as much and as fast as possible. This is a wild jungle with extremes in morals and values. The Underbelly is a powerful economy completely driven by tech advances.<br/><br/>THE PEN<br/>The Pen, home to the sheeple. The Pen is completely self contained ecosystem above the Underbelly. It is a stable economy but possesses a docile culture which needs protection provided by corporate security called &quot;The Regulators&quot;. Now that The Pen faces a new threat from the villains henchmen, their fear needs to be managed because if the The Pen falls, so does the city.<br/><br/>THE QUANTUM<br/>Above it all sits The Quantum, the home of the Corporate Elite. Completely sealed off and secured, these are the lever pullers. Their key to success was helping to facilitate a social contract with the citizens and their representatives. This unwritten understanding is what made Neo Tokyo possible and has yet to be displayed, defined or quantified.<br/><br/>When word got around about the quality of Aug's/Mods and the success rate, many, including Natalia Burtolla (an accomplished hacker known as Liquid Squid) rushed to Neo Tokyo. Born without legs, she came for the best money could buy.  She quickly fell in love with the city and the feeling was mutual. She finally feels at home and will do anything to protect Neo Tokyo.<br/><br/>With great decadents comes greater corruption and the stench of that sludge attracts the greatest of villains.<br/><br/>When the villains henchmen hit the streets many were caught off guard. Liquid Squid was well aware and prepared for this threat. To The Underbelly, this was only a matter of time.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>A Super Villain is hell bent on terrorizing Neo Tokyo into his control. If he takes out 3 Landmarks he gains the levers of power over the entire city. When the 3rd Landmark has been targeted for attack the Super Villain himself and his elite army descend to make sure the job gets done right. Try to foil the attacks on Landmarks until you can assemble an army of allies powerful enough to defeat him and end the chaos.<br/><br/>DEFEND NEO TOKYO<br/>Neo Tokyo is rife with the Villains Henchmen and natural enemy factions that will destroy anyone and anything in their path. You must protect the citizens from these threats. At the same time you must try to foil attacks on Landmarks until you are prepared to face the Super Villain.<br/><br/>BUILD AN ARMY<br/>Build rep with powerful city influencers by completing missions, assemble your army of allies and temper public fear.<br/><br/>END THE CHAOS<br/>When the third Landmark is triggered you go toe-to-toe with the Super Villain and his army with only one option for an ending. Explosive.<br/><br/>THE STREETS<br/>The streets are the underbelly of Neo Tokyo and have 3 stand-alone districts which hold 36 key locations. The Villains henchmen are causing chaos across the city. It has become a monstrous jungle war between the treacherous and the savage. The Villain needs to destroy three landmarks to throw the city into proper chaos and take control of the primary levers.  You must defend the streets while building an ally army and when you&rsquo;re ready, end the chaos.<br/><br/>PUBLIC FEAR<br/>During play the Villain will trigger events that spook the general public. The higher the Public Fear meter rises the more carnage the Villain will rain down on the city. Gain reputation with influencers and they will use their platforms to try and calm the public.<br/><br/>MISSIONS<br/>There are 126 missions offering reputation and gadget rewards. When visiting locations around the city you can access Mission Control to see what missions are available and select at least one.<br/><br/>ENEMY AND ALLY POOLS<br/>The enemy pool builds randomly during play, these forces are inserted into a scenario when they are triggered. A Landmark is triggered when 3 enemies appear on it. You build the ally pool and those are the forces you use when a Landmark is triggered.<br/><br/>LANDMARKS<br/>There are 12 Landmarks across the city. Each has a unique one-shot combat scenario. When a Landmark is triggered place the scenario on the board, try to defuse the situation and exit with as much loot as possible. If an ally does not reach an exit they are removed from your forces.<br/><br/>POINTS of INTEREST (POI)<br/>In order to hack from the streets Liquid Squid must enter a POI. POI's can be destroyed as well but do not count as Landmarks. Most missions involve POI locations and NPC's from those locations.<br/><br/>HACKING<br/>HACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENEMIES<br/>Liquid Squid is a balanced dance between physical combat and hacking. If you have an angry mob on the other side of the city, not a problem. Hack in and set-off a Regulator Alarm, that will make &lsquo;em scatter. Facing an overpowered enemy? No problem. Hack into his system, overload it and watch the fire works. The synergy between problem solving, physical combat and hacking is what makes Liquid Squid so enjoyable.<br/><br/>In order to hack there has to be a Mobile Hub in the district. You will always have a 50% chance that there is a Mobile Hub in the district. But you can gain control of Mobile Hubs and dedicate them to certain districts granting 100% hacking as long as you maintain control of the Mobile Hub.<br/>In order to hack the streets, Liquid Squid must launch the hack from a Point of Interest. In a scenario she must launch a hack from a Hack Entry Point. Hacking consists of O-Hack/D-Hack gadgets, Offensive/Defensive Programs (Oprog/Dprog) and NODES.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>The Syndicate (Ally)<br/>The Syndicate are a network of gangs in the Tokyo Underbelly lead by Robert Crisp. Attain Ally status with Crisp and they will join you in your fight.<br/><br/>Regulators (Ally)<br/>The Regulators are corporate security and the law in Neo Tokyo. Attain Ally Status with Chief Yamasaki and they will join you in battle.<br/><br/>The Coda (Enemy)<br/>The Coda are the Villains henchmen. They are a mixed bag of characters with a wide range of mod limits. They are exceedingly loyal to their boss, relentless terrorists and your sworn enemy.<br/><br/>Outliers (Enemy)<br/>Outliers are the Villains Praetorian Guard. They have taken exceptionally well to merging with machines and poses a fervor to watch the world burn.<br/><br/>Mercs (Ally)<br/>Mercs are deadly mercenaries for hire. They have a natural disdain for oppressors and Outliers in particular. Mercs further modify their Mods for optimum carnage. Mercs will join Liquid Squid free of charge.<br/><br/>Drones (Enemy)<br/>These nasty machines are the Super Villains master assassins. They have destroyed the competition, even Regulator Drones. Now they only exist to hunt you and your ilk.<br/><br/>Block Rockers (Enemy)<br/>Block Rockers are massive mechs with on board sentient AI. They will cut off passage through the block and are chock full of Gank Rating. Each of the three types of Block Rocker requires a specific gadget to engage them.<br/><br/>The Chimera (Enemy)<br/>The Chimera are mutants who suffered grotesque side effects from merging with machines. Chimera can be found in the Underbelly and below. Besides general carnage they also maintain coordinated attacks of &quot;The Pen&quot; above.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the light of a new dawn, a clan of Neanderthals wake by a smouldering fire. They&rsquo;re hungry and tired of eating berries and small game. Excitement soon spreads like wildfire as they peer from their cave, across the vast grasslands and forests to the clear mountain peaks beyond. The clouds have lifted, and a warm sun softens the snow around them. Winter has passed and soon to follow are the giants of fur and bone; the mighty Mammoths!<br/><br/>Prehistorica is a two-player asymmetric deck-deconstruction board game in which one player managers a tribe of Neanderthals and the other migrates a herd of Mammoths.<br/><br/>As the Neanderthals, you&rsquo;ll have to gather resources, build traps, and craft weaponry to succeed in hunting the Mammoths. As the Mammoths, you&rsquo;ll have to fend off attacks and migrate through three different territories; the grasslands, forests, and mountains &ndash; grazing and eating plenty of berries along the way &ndash; until you are safe from the Neanderthals&rsquo; hunting party.<br/><br/>The Neanderthals win if they successfully hunt all four Mammoths, and the Mammoths win if they successfully migrate across the board with at least one surviving member of the herd.<br/><br/>For the Neanderthals, this is the most prosperous time of year&hellip; but for the Mammoths, it&rsquo;s the most dangerous leg of their journey.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ボムゴルフ (Bomb Golf) is a quick flicking game from Japan. The players lay out a simple obstacle course and use markers to mark their steps as they knock the bomb around.<br/><br/>The game comes packed in a plastic round black bomb with a red fuse. Inside the bomb is a small bag containing six small coloured discs, one for each player, a standard die, and two small stars. The bomb is not perfectly round, it has a flat base on which it stands easily.<br/><br/>After removing the contents, the bomb is re-assembled. Players build a simple obstacle course on a large enough flat surface like a table, using household objects that players navigate around. One of the stars is used for the goal. The other star can be put back into the bomb to add weight and a little eccentricity (or similar can be used such as a small coin).<br/><br/>The six-sided die is used to count rounds. If nobody reaches the goal after six rounds, the bomb explodes, and the player closest to the goal wins.<br/><br/>Players take turns to hit the bomb towards the goal, avoiding the obstacles as they go. The rules say to use an open hand, or the back of your hand, or a chopping hand, to strike the bomb, instead of flicking with your fingers. In this way, the gameplay is meant to resemble golf.<br/><br/>After a hit, the player uses their marker disc to show where the bomb got to, and the next player retrieves the bomb to the start and does the same. Once all the players have all had one turn, the die is turned to show the second round. The starting player then puts the bomb on their marker and continues.<br/><br/>If the bomb should go off the table, that player doesn't advance their marker and continues next turn in the same place.<br/><br/>The winner is the player or players who reaches the goal in the shortest number of turns.<br/><br/>The graphic design was by ASOBI.dept.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Sadly, he died of COVID-19 himself before the world realized he was sounding the alarm of an impending pandemic.<br/><br/><br/>In the card game Doctor Li, the corona virus is spreading at a threatening pace all over the world. Two to five players do everything they can to keep the curve of their land flat with good preparations and thus avoid a high death toll.<br/><br/><br/>To do this, they collect sufficient hospital capacity, effective leadership and social distance. But beware, while there are some benefits to be gained from a creative and benevolent population, there are also numerous aggravating circumstances lurking. Hoarding behavior and a new wave are never far away, while government leaders of all kinds are looking for ways to deal with this crisis.<br/><br/><br/>Each player starts with 4 category cards in his hand. The player with a date of birth closest to November 17 (when the first case of Corona was discovered) gets to start.<br/><br/>Goal of the game<br/> The last round of the game is played when 1 player has completed all three categories. All other players may then play 1 more turn.<br/><br/>A player can discard a category when he has at least 3 unique cards of 1 specific category that the player can put down in 1 turn. This can be a category of 3 or 4 unique cards. The missing unique card in a category of 3 cannot be added later in the game.<br/><br/>After the last round is played, the points are counted:<br/><br/>     1 point for each 3-card category discarded,<br/>     2 points for each category of 4 cards discarded<br/>     1 bonus point for the player who is the first to complete all three categories. <br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, the player who finished first wins.<br/><br/>How does a round go<br/> 1. The player takes the top card from the category pile or the top card from the category discard pile and takes it into his / her hand without showing the others the card.<br/><br/>2. The player then takes the top card from the action card pile and places it face up on the discard pile, visible to all players.<br/><br/>     If the card has a logo in the top left corner, the player picks up the card in his / her hand and may play during this or subsequent turns.<br/>     If the card is an 'aggravating circumstance' or 'a boost', the consequences will apply immediately and only to the player who turned the card.<br/>     If the card is a &quot;hamster&quot; card or &quot;a new wave&quot;, the card applies to all players and all players must react immediately so as not to be affected by the card (see chart types overview). <br/><br/><br/>3. A player now has the chance to play the remaining cards from his / her hand, or to discard categories.<br/>When the player tries to discard a category, any other player can now play a 'Trump' card that forces the active player to discard any card of the hand played and take the remaining cards back into hand. Unless the active player can supplement the category with other cards from his / her hand OR plays another 'Trump' card that destroys the previous card.<br/><br/>4. If there are no more players who wish to play additional 'Trump' cards and the category is still complete, then the category is now considered 'discarded' and cannot be removed for the remainder of the game unless there is an 'I don't think so' card is played. The next player can now start his / her turn.<br/><br/>",

Fortunately there is a vaccin that can help, but a few do everything they can to prevent people from getting vaccinations...<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>The games takes place during the Covid pandemic. One player is &quot;Lange Frans&quot; (a Dutch rapper and TV presenter who believes in conspiracy theories) and tries to prevent the other players from achieving group immunity. The other players are common people who try to get everyone vaccinated at least once to achieve group immunity. There is also a game master who controls the flow of the game. The players together decide who will be &quot;Jaap van Dissel&quot; (the Dutch equivalent of Anthony Fauci), whose vote breaks ties.<br/><br/>Each round of the game has three phases: the conspiracy, the surge and the vaccination. In the conspiracy phase, the common people are anesthetized (have their eyes closed) and Lange Frans secretly guesses who will get the vaccine this round.<br/>During the surge, everyone wakes up and rolls a special die to determine how to deal with this, which may help or hinder the player. In the vaccination phase, the group discusses and votes who should be vaccinated (gets a vaccination card), keeping in mind that three vaccinations for one person constitutes an overdose. If Lange Frans guessed right, the vaccin is not given but destroyed!<br/><br/>In total there are 12 vaccinations available. There is also an untested Russian vaccine. If this is used on a common person, all people lose all their vaccines, but if Lange Frans is vaccinated with it, he loses the game. He also looses if he gets an overdose. Lange Frans wins when the people cannot be vaccinated in time anymore.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Er heerst een pandemie!

Through the fog laying over the bay you see a shape moving, you take it as nothing, seeing things from a late watch. You take a swig of coffee from your canteen to clear your head. Suddenly you see the shape move out of the fog. A great lumbering beast low in the water, black smoke billowing from its smokestack, flying the flag of the Confederacy. You sound the alarm, and watch as this beast begins to make its way towards your ship. You hear your shipmates start to bark orders, and the guns open up. <br/>FDOOM! FDOOM! FDOOM! The cannonballs fly through the air at an incredible speed, <br/>CLANG! CLANG! You stare in horror as the shots bounce off the shape, as if it were made of iron! Suddenly your ship lurches underneath you, throwing you to the deck. You regain your footing and see the nose of the beast buried in the hull of your ship. It reverses its engines and slowly pulls itself out opening the hole to the sea.<br/><br/>In Salt &amp; Iron you can reenact famous naval battles from the American Civil War right on your tabletop! <br/>These fast play rules are great for playing out any size battles in the matter of a couple hours.<br/> These can be casual games amongst friends or historical scenarios to see if history can be rewritten. <br/>What would have happened had Virginia destroyed Monitor, or if Monitor had even failed to arrive?<br/><br/>Every Civil War historian is very familiar with the great commanders such as David Farragut, Samuel Francis Du Pont, Franklin Buchanan, and Raphael Semmes. <br/>With Salt &amp; Iron, you can put yourself on the deck with them commanding some of their famous ships, along with many others. <br/>There are many ships represented in Salt &amp; Iron, plenty to take action in almost any scenario one can think up.<br/><br/>Now is the time Captain, prepare your fleet and lead daring actions against the enemy!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Brocken is the highest peak in the Harz mountains in northern Germany. In folklore, it was the gathering place for witches to celebrate their rites (Goethe writes of it in his work Faust).<br/><br/>In this game, three witches must travel to Brocken to join their coven. Having already prepared their flying potions in the previous game, they now fly using a chair, a broomstick and a goat to carry them. They must pass through the perilous woodlands and swamps, and avoid the spiders.<br/><br/>The game is for three players only. Each player has a deck of cards, each showing a rune. There is a set of three dice, also with the runes. One player throws the dice, and the players must try to match the runes thrown with their hand cards. This allows them to move across the forest, as the cards each have special actions (such as move three places, or bring other witches to you).<br/><br/>The first player to successful get to the peak at Brocken is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Alice behaves poorly! She enters somebody's house and eats their cookies without permission, and goes into another house and drinks without permission too! She ruins a tea party, disturbs the Queen's cricket match, and so on!<br/><br/>Finally, Alice promised to leave, but only if she was given lots of souvenirs to take home.<br/><br/>In the game, the players use white sheep to collect souvenirs for Alice. The game is a semi-co-operative game, with players working together to get Alice out, but also competing to provide the most popular souvenirs.<br/><br/>As Alice moves around, different souvenir tokens appear on the game board. Players place their sheep tiles adjacent to the tokens they want to collect. The highest value sheep will take the token, using a 'butting' mechanism, like  Hols der Geier, with equal values cancelling out. Players also have black sheep, which can trump the white sheep of equal value.<br/><br/>The best souvenirs score the most points, but Alice is fickle and her tastes change as she progresses along the path. The souvenirs are ranked, but the order of their rank changes during the game.<br/><br/>When she finally reaches the gate, the game ends. Once the final score is determined, players turn up the ending cards, and discover what kind of end the Land Of Sheep has.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

In Japanaese ヒ秘 means 'secret'.<br/><br/>The Savannah is a 4*4 tableau of face-down tiles, which might be food or water, or hazards such as cobras, leopards, or rival baboons. The players start their baboon leader in a corner and move up to three spaces. After looking at a face-down tile, a player can mark it, and must remember what the marking was for.<br/><br/>Each player has a small board showing the size and health of their troop. The players are trying to get their troop to be the largest by the end of the game.<br/><br/>During the game, a player might turn up a sunset, which ends the round. The game ends on a fifth sunset.<br/><br/>There are also wildfires on the Savannah, and these cause tiles to be replaced. Players must contend with their own memories and changes to the tableau.<br/><br/>",

Players control the Norman, Saxon, Viking, and Scots/Welsh Factions and use Events, Commands and Special Abilities to place and move leaders and pieces on the map to control areas, gain support, and win victory.<br/><br/>Edward the Confessor returned from exile in Normandy after decades of Viking rule in 1042 to become king of England. Magnus the Good of Norway also claimed the throne, and threatened war, but was dissuaded by the childless Edward, who promised to make him his heir. Edward gave the same promise to Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark, William of Normandy, and Harold Godwinson. When he died in 1066 four powerful warlords claimed to be his rightful heir. It would not end well.<br/><br/>Cards are drawn from the deck one at time, with one card in play and the following card face up on top of the deck. Each Event card shows the order in which Eligible Factions may choose to resolve the Event or one of their own Commands, sometimes with one of their Special Abilities. Resolving an Event or Command makes the Faction Ineligible for the next card. Crown Events interrupt play as a King is crowned, Victory is determined, Revenue is collected, and Support is expanded.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Thirteen Colonies have gone from a restless bunch to a group of independent entities.  Throughout the process, a number of documents and other writings have played an integral role in motivating the citizenry and justifying the need for Independence.  As a publisher, your goal is collect and publish more parts of these documents than your competitors.  Publish a significant portion of a document or series of writings and you will attract Advocates that will boost your score. But beware, there is a heavy price for beginning a collection and under-delivering.  Or, will you take the ultimate risk and publish only Loyalist writings?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to gain points by playing cards to different collections of writings. A card played to a collection represents one part of a published writing. But, there is a catch - once you begin publishing to a collection your score in that collection starts negative. You must continue publishing to that collection to achieve a positive score in it. Once to have played three cards to a collection you may also play Advocates to the collection which can double, triple, or quadruple your score.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, a card is played either to a collection or to an appropriate discard pile. Then a card is drawn to replace the played card, either from the deck or from the top of one of the discard piles. Cards played to one of the player's collections must be in ascending order, but not necessarily consecutive. Play continues until the draw pile is exhausted at which point the players scores are tallied.<br/><br/>If a player decides to publish the Loyalist writings, they may only play to the Loyalist collection and no other collections, their initial score is doubly negative, and all cards in the Loyalist suit are double valued. It is a high risk, high reward option.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Some draw cards chain together; others allow you to skip or change the direction to affect different players.

Birds, butterflies, mammals, and insects are dazzling with beauty. And you have the best mission in the world: to collect and study them all! This will definitely be your lifetime expedition.<br/><br/>Celebes offers games that can be enjoyed by families, which can be played by 2-4 players. The main mechanics of the game are Point to Point Movement and Set Collection. Each player will be provided with a set of logistics cards, botanical tokens and cash. The player's task is to move from one point to another to get data on flora &amp; fauna endemic there. Each turn the players will play one logistic card, later the value printed on the card will be additional travel capital for this turn. If they want to retrieve data, they have to pay a certain amount of money to be able to put the botanist on the game board following the existing path. Players will get a flora / fauna card if they succeed in placing their botanists in a new area.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round there will be one event card that is opened, this card can change the playing conditions and change the player's tactics. The game ends when the last event card has been executed. Players will get points for having a certain set of cards. However, a new set is counted when the total is more than three cards of the same suit. If there are only one or two cards in a set, the value does not count or is considered forfeited. The player with the most Victory Points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea of the game is to get into the Blue Book or Social Register of &quot;High Society&quot; in the middle of the board. Naturally, more than just money is required for admission. Players must also possess their own estate, a piece of property, four status symbols, 200 liquid asset points (money), and a formal invitation. This game is about acquiring all those items and being the first to make it into the Blue Book.<br/><br/>High Society is designed primarily for four players, although rules for five to eight players are also included. Players move their pawns around the track by means of dice rolls or to specific spaces specified by &quot;strategy cards&quot;. Players acquire an estate or property by being the first to land on it. After acquiring an estate or property, they may be able to charge a trespassing fee to players who land on it. Players also acquire Status Symbols and points (money) by landing on any of the eight Status Symbols spaces.<br/><br/>Players gain or lose points and Strategy Cards or Status Cards as they land on spaces around the track. Any player who cannot pay their debts is eliminated. Once a player has all the requirements for admission to the Blue Book, they proceed to one of four Country Club Lane paths to the center of the board. Once a player is in one of the Country Club Lane paths, they roll the dice to advance. At the last space before the Blue Book, the player rolls one die and specific rolls determine whether they lose a turn, return to their estate, or win the game. A player in Country Club Lane may also be &quot;Blackballed&quot; by another player in which case they return to their estate space on the board.<br/><br/>",

The Junkyard or the Farmstead,to find Items. Each Item has a Value. At the end of each round, players reveal their Treasure Cards and see which Location yielded the highest  Items value. All players who chose that Location get a Victory Point.<br/><br/>Objective:The first player to score 5 Victory Points wins if no other player has 5 or more Victory Points. 6 Victory Points wins if no other player has 6 or more Victory Points.7 Victory Points everyone with 7 shares the win.<br/><br/>Setup:Pick a starting player. At the beginning of each round, the starting player shuffles the cards and deals 2 cards face-down to each player. Then they deal 2 of the remaining cards face up in the center of the play area. Each round has 3 phases.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Choose Treasure Cards. <br/>Opening with the Start Player and moving clockwise, each player will choose a card in their hand as a Treasure Card. They will place this card face up in front of them. Using the other card, hide either the top or bottom half of the shown Treasure Card so that only the Item or Location is visible. *This is very important!<br/><br/>Phase 2: Trigger Active Abilities                                                                      <br/>Beginning with the Start Player and continuing clockwise, each player displaying an Item with an Active (A) ability may use it.<br/>For example, if a player is showing the Compass, they would choose another player with a revealed Item. The targeted player would have to discard their revealed Item card if they correctly guessed the targeted players location. <br/>Note: A player can only be targeted by the Compass, Abacus, Whistle and Dog Mask once per round.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Award Victory Points                                                                               <br/>All players now reveal their chosen Treasure Cards unless their Treasure Card was discarded in Phase 2. Each player with a Treasure Card showing a Passive (P) ability may now use that ability.<br/>Add up the value for each Item at each Location. The Location with the highest value of Items wins the round.<br/>Each player with a revealed Treasure Card with the winning Location receives 1 Victory Point. If there is no winning Location, then all players with a revealed Treasure Card earn 1 Victory Point. If a player had to discard their Treasure Card, then they cannot receive Victory Points.<br/>After Phase 3 is complete, check to see if any player has achieved the winning objective. If not, then pass the Start Player token clockwise and start a new round.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tiki-Taka: a card game, two players take on the role of opposing football managers, using player and action cards to dominate the pitch and outscore their opponent. By carefully devising a strategy around their goalie, captain, tactical style, and players, a savvy manager can outwit and overwhelm the opposition. But every great manager must also monitor the flow of the match. Play too cautiously and you risk ceding goals before your team is at full strength; play too aggressively and you risk losing momentum just as the match reaches its climax.<br/><br/>Over four rounds of intense competition, players will go head-to-head, seeking to score more points than their opponent in each third of the pitch. Win a majority of these zones and you score a goal; win a majority and shut out the opposition completely, and you score two goals! The player with more goals at the end of the regulation 90' match (four rounds) is the winner.<br/><br/>Players win zones via points obtained by player cards and action cards. Player cards are drawn and drafted at match start and halftime, and are placed on the field for the duration of the match. Building a team with similar nationalities and complementary strengths is the foundation to success. Action cards are drawn and drafted at the start of every round and can be played only once for their points or other effects. But crucially, these cards may also be saved between rounds, forcing smart managers to carefully conserve their strength.<br/><br/>Just as in real football, the very best managers must blend the strengths and weaknesses of their squad, the tactical styles of both teams, and a keen sense of momentum to exploit the opposition and lead their side to victory. Are you up to the task?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The defences consisted of two 300mm twin gun turrets, together with supporting defences and an observation post all set on high ground with excellent fields of fire, and were intended to be a tough nut to crack.  This is what the Germans had to attack in 1942 in order to capture Sevastopol and ultimately the whole of Crimea.<br/><br/>As a module, it is not a complete game in itself but requires ownership of the Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rulebook and Beyond Valor module as a minimum.  However, it is a very distinctive module with rules for previously-omitted areas such as fighting in the underground bunker complexes and with a map that makes you understand the size of the challenge to take on a well-prepared defence - these go beyond what is normally seen in ASL.<br/><br/>There are 12 scenarios ranging from small engagements to larger battles which will enable players to experience the struggle whilst attempting to capture (or defend) a significant fortification.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "POT SMUGGLIN' BLUES consists of a board map of the Caribbean, a spinner that drives the game, four HOT WHEELS that locate weather conditions and police hot spots, and four sets of CARDS that determine weather conditions, mechanical difficulties and other fortunes &amp; (Mis)Fortunes. Your goal is to sail your load of marijuana to a North American port and payola.<br/><br/>Except when you are safely in a North American port, every move begins by spinning the spinner. Each number on the spinner also contains 6 colors.<br/><br/>When a player spins, the number and color landed on not only select the load amount offered and country of origin, they also rotate one of the Hot Wheels. The number spun tells you how far to move your sailboat or determines when you've encountered Mechanical Difficulties or a (Mis)Fortune. The compass direction you've spun sets the wind direction.<br/><br/>&gt;- Decide who goes first and have each player select a colored boat stand.<br/>&gt;- Everyone's first spin determines their load's quantity, quality, and country origin. The number spun is the number of thousands of pounds you are smuggling (2 on the spinner means 2,000 pounds). When you decide to take a load, borrow your stake, and place the appropriate sail, depicting the country of origin and the quantity of pot, onto your boat.<br/><br/>You will face challenges with rough weather, mechanical difficulties, avoiding the US Coast Guard, getting through US Customs, and the Bermuda Triangle.<br/><br/>The Pot Smugglin' Blues board game is drawn from true-life experiences of a bygone era. Will Berger&rsquo;s true-life experiences. Practically everything that can happen playing the game actually did happen to Will Berger while sailing the Caribbean back in the 1980's. In those precartel, pre-terrorist days, smuggling marijuana was considered romantic adventure, not to mention a fantastic way to create great stacks of fast cash, and in the process encounter informers and snitches, get busted, lose all your money and go to jail with the blues. All of which conspires to make the Pot Smugglin' Blues game suspenseful, emotion-filled escapism.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Load your sailboat with the good herb, plot your course north for a safe passage, hoist sails and find your wind, get out the star charts and see the Southern Cross for the first time, deliver the weed to the promised land and reap millions of dollars for your success. Do it now-- when they legalize pot, the thrill will be gone. Smooth sailing!<br/><br/>",

The players race around the around the track for 1 1/4 mile. You can play strategy cards on your turn. You can also pick up cards off the track by landing on a &quot;charley&quot; which are played right away. Use the tools the track gives you to send other opponents back or propel yourself forward.<br/><br/>Ride the rails on the bends for a shorter race or take the longer outside tracks to grab cards to jeopardize your opponent.<br/><br/>During the race players will encounter bears, deer, goats, snakes, and murder hornets while dealing with collusion, elbowing, impeding and broken legs. Then there's those nasty &quot;trade places&quot; which you have to use before someone crosses the finish line.<br/><br/>You collect cards by rolling doubles or by landing on an opponent and some cards allow you to steal a card from a player. If you can steal an opponent's jockey card, they can't cross the finish line without one. Crossing first doesn't guarantee a win since all players get to finish their turn. Horses unfortunately die on the track so we added one death card. You have be careful using it because if the opponent neighs it, you're dead. Neigh cards are used to block actions of an opponent or have them miss a turn or to save your own hide.<br/><br/>The cards coupled with the track makes for a hilarious game where the horses are all over the place. You won't know who wins until the last player goes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is therefore easy to learn, quick to play, yet difficult to master! Suitable for two to forty players!<br/><br/>The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. It is possible to start with only 20-odd miniatures, but that can easily be expanded. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies. Similarly, the distances are given in inches for use with 28mm scale soldiers. Feel free to adapt to centimetres should you not have the space or when you use a smaller scale of miniatures.<br/><br/>This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1860 to roughly 1914, the age in which European countries forged empires all over the world and combated each other and the various indigenous people. The rules will work for skirmishes in colonial settings, the Franco-Prussian War and other Wars of German Unification, the Balkan Wars, the Spanish-American War, the Boer Wars, the Boxer Rebellion and other clashes. It will also work for the early clashes of WW1.<br/><br/>Designed for the beginner with a minimum of miniatures, it also allows you to field large armies on the table top and play to a conclusion in two to three hours.<br/><br/>The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and be removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry charges and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a unit, but also between units and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>This product come with two commander dice. Markers can be downloaded.<br/>Cards are available separately.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher FB page<br/><br/>",

Along the top of the sheet additional panels list the game's rules, and a panel along the left edge contains an index of important terms. A central panel bear the &quot;Peter Schencken&quot; imprint against an architectural backdrop adorned with military hardware.<br/><br/>The sheet could be dissected for use as a traditional deck of cards or left intact for use as a board game, using the rules printed at the top. These rules appear to be fairly straightforward, involving the rolling of dice to determine one's moves, the victor being the first to land on panel number 53, the Complete Vestung (&quot;Complete Fortification&quot;). Additional rules add spice to the game; for example, anyone landing on panel number 16 &mdash; the Aussenwercke (&quot;Outworks&quot;) &mdash; must sit out two turns. By progressing through all the panels, players are exposed in sequence to the various elements of fortification, from basic geometry through the digging of counter approaches.<br/><br/>",

When two players play each takes a separate path. The game came with a spinner, called a &quot;spino&quot;, which displayed numbers from 1 to 8. Players take turns spinning and moving their counter the corresponding number of squares.<br/><br/>Some squares on each track are marked with a letter of the alphabet and a player must follow an instruction that corresponds to that letter. For example, landing on the &quot;A&quot; square of the left track results in the instruction &quot;Forgotten lunch. Back to start&quot;; landing on the B square results in &quot;Tiger snake on road.

        "description": "In Europe, the first two decades of the eighteenth century were characterised by almost constant warfare. Western and Central Europe had been involved in the Nine Years&rsquo; War that ended in 1697. The peace was shortlived and by 1701 Western Europe was once again plunged into a new conflict, the War of Spanish Succession. Elsewhere, Denmark, Russia, Saxony and eventually Prussia all sought to dismember the Swedish Empire and share it amongst themselves. This conflict, known as the Great Northern War, was to last over twenty years.<br/><br/>Designed to refight the battles of the period, In Deo Veritas: Captain General is an expansion book for the popular rule set In Deo Veritas. The rules focus on the command decisions needed to maintain the motivation of the army. The battle scenarios offer the player a series of different challenges from the wars of the early eighteenth century.<br/><br/>Battles are played at the brigade level with all major elements on 75mm/3&quot; wide bases. Using smaller scale figures (6-15mm) lets players give their units a realistic feel. The ground scale of 1&quot; = 40yds means the typical 6ft x 4 ft table is large enough to accommodate most battles of the period.<br/><br/>Most players will already have everything needed to play (d6, tape measure and a deck of cards). More scenarios and game support will become available in the future.<br/><br/>To learn the rules will take 2 hours or so using some of the smaller battles. Once you have become familiar with the core elements then your games will flow more quickly and a larger battle such as Blenheim should last for 3-4 hours depending on the arrival of the reinforcements.<br/><br/>Nothing is certain, but generals that hone their skills are more likely to be victorious.<br/><br/>You will need a copy of In Deo Veritas: Fast Play Rules for Exciting Seventeenth Century Battles in Smaller Scales to use this book.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

During the Draft, players will take turns drawing and drafting basketball players to form their basketball team. Each basketball player has a skill level (1-6) for each of the shot attempt skills. The higher the skill number, the higher the chance of that player scoring on their shot attempt.<br/><br/>Once their teams are established, players will begin play. Players will shuffle their player decks and draw the top 5 basketball player cards to form their lineup. They then will choose one player from their lineup to put into the scoring position.<br/><br/>Next, one player will reveal the Shot Attempt Card and reveal what shot the players will attempt. Both players will roll their basketball die and compare the number rolled with their basketball player's skill number of the shot that is being attempted. If the player's skill number is equal to or exceeds the number the player rolled on his/her die, then the scoring attempt is successful. The player gains the number of points the shot attempt awards (1,2, or 3 points). Players then move their scoring marker on their player scoreboard.<br/><br/>Players will repeat this process until the Shot Attempt Deck is depleted. This completes a quarter. The game consists of 4 quarters. After all 4 quarters, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Every game, every round your skills are tested in the pursuit of the perfect KOOBA shot!<br/><br/>A Kooba game has 4 main components.  3 darts called Aeros that somewhat resemble fidget spinners, 5 round discs that magnetically attach to the gameboard, 2 sticks, and the game board itself.<br/><br/>The Aeros have a large hole in the center.  The two sticks are stuck through this hole and made to form an X.  The shot is then taken by quickly pulling apart your hands so that the Aero is forced to fly forward.  Depending on where you land on the board you can score or knock your opponents back.<br/><br/>The game is won by scoring enough times to advance your marker to the end of it's track and then tagging the KOOBA in the center.<br/><br/>",

The meaning of this game is to collect as first all the ingredients for your dessert. Each player receives a dessert and 5 ingredients in their hands at the start. The dessert is placed on the table in front of you. The remaining cards form the pile, the top card is turned over as the discard pile.<br/><br/>The player takes a card from the pile or puts it on the discard pile if he doesn't need it for his dessert. The player can also play an action card (bulbs) or put the ingredient next to their dessert if they match. Pick a new card until you have 5 cards in your hands.<br/><br/>The player who first collects all the ingredients for their dessert wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a territorial game where opponents fight for majority of votes on the states, and win General Elections. There is a luck component that is easily tamed with plenty of strategies. Strategies get pretty sophisticated as players develop their skills overtime. In a way it resembles a weird mix of poker and chess without following any of their rules. In other words, it is not a twisted version of either. The goal of the game is to win majority in the states, thereby winning Super PACs to fund your campaigns, and ultimately win 3 General Elections.<br/><br/>AUDIENCE: Simple enough for casual players and advanced for professional gamers.<br/><br/>UNIQUE: This game is played continuously. After every game, you can save the setup with its unique challenges for the next time you play. Simply snap a picture of the board. Probably, this is the only &quot;competitive&quot; game where really it is almost impossible to eliminate an opponent from the game (no player elimination).<br/><br/>IMPORTANT..! <br/>Manufacturer strongly recommends you limit a game to 3 General Elections wins rather than 5 as stated in the rules, for a better game experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sister ship to the Bismarck, the Tirpitz was 2,000 tons heavier and thus the heaviest warship to have ever been produced by a European navy. <br/>She served in Norway and the Baltic Fleet acting as a potent deterrent. The Tirpitz became an obsession for the British. After the sinking of the Bismarck, the Tirpitz, as Germany&rsquo;s most powerful warship, was destined to spend much of the war in port.<br/><br/>After the daring St Nazaire raid by the British, it was deemed unfeasible to use Tirpitz against the Atlantic convoys of the Allies. Instead, she was used sparingly, as a deterrent against Allied invasion in Norway and to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. In September 1943, along with the battleship Scharnhorst, she bombarded Allied positions on Spitzbergen. This was the only occasion the mighty battleship fired her main battery in anger.<br/><br/>The relentless attacks of the British, would prove to be the end of the mighty vessel. They launched many raids on her; from mini-submarines and two full scale air raids. She was eventually  sunk in 1944 by Lancaster bombers armed with 12,000 lb Tallboy bombs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, you can't fend off against stronger kaiju alone. Ask a friend to join you in combat for a huge power boost. Work together to take down the final boss, Alexis Kerib!<br/><br/>Event cards in the game feature scenes from the source material, such as the dinner with Alexis and the meeting with the kaiju girl, and whenever Akane happens to move to the same space Yuto is on, his HP will immediately suffer. Guaranteed laughs for fans of the show.<br/><br/>Supports up to 4 players, including a solo mode where you control 4 characters.<br/><br/><br/>2018年秋にアニメ化されて以来、いまだ根強い人気のアニメ『SSSS.GRIDMAN』（グリッドマン）がボードゲームで登場。<br/>本商品は、プレイヤーが響裕太たち「グリッドマン同盟」の一員となり、新条アカネの生み出す怪獣たちと戦う、ダイスを使った協力型ゲームです。<br/><br/>プレイヤーはTVアニメの登場人物（裕太、内海、六花、サムライ・キャリバー、マックス、ボラー、ヴィット）から選び、街に現れる怪獣と戦います。しかし強力な怪獣は1人だけでは倒せません。他のプレイヤーと一致団結して戦うことで攻撃力は大きくアップします。仲間たちと話し合い、協力して最終ボス・アレクシスを倒しましょう！<br/><br/>ゲーム中のイベントでは、アニメの作中で話題となったエピソードを元にした「アレクシスと遭遇」や、「怪獣少女と遭遇」があったり、アカネの駒が裕太の駒と同じ場所に移動すると裕太のHPが減ったりなど、アニメを観ていた人なら思わず笑ってしまう内容が盛りだくさんです。<br/><br/>プレイ人数は4人までですが、1人だけでプレイすることも可能です（その場合は1人で4キャラクターを操ります）。<br/><br/>",

Each round the forming player randomly draws letter tiles one at a time and places them on the grid starting from the center. Each new letter played must either form a complete word, or marked with one of ten pawns as an incomplete word. Each incomplete word must have a possible word declared for the unused letters. After every five letters played the defending player has a blocking tile available to prevent progress of the forming team. Each forming phase ends when the forming player either plays a complete word that uses a corner space, or gets three strikes. Strikes are accumulated for being unable to play a tile, declaring a word that would not fit in the area, or playing an illegal or false word. After each phase, players score points for each letter used in complete words only, and possibly double their score if they end on a corner that corresponds to the round being played.<br/><br/>",

As you know the basic game is the core of the system which deals with the armies of the Waterloo campaign. To use these scenarios, it is recommended that Warfare in the Age of Napoleon be used. The scenarios will be more adaptable to other battalion level rule systems, too. This supplement will encompass more areas of the Napoleonic period and include new unit types, special rules, and army lists. It will be formatted in a similar fashion as the AOM rulebook scenarios.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic era spans a stretch of time of continuous warfare from 1789 to 1825 (if including the wars of liberation in South America). The scenarios will be battles or parts of battles of selected years of the period.<br/><br/>Let's take a scenario/battle from the 1806 campaign of the French invasion of Prussia: Battle of Saalfeld, where a fast-moving French force runs into a Prussian/Saxon rearguard. The scenario will have a short description of the battle, a color map with deployment, and an order of battle. Included with be army lists specific to the battle and any special rules needed for the scenario. In addition, the army list will often include additional troop types not needed in the scenario so one has the means to do other battles of that campaign.<br/><br/>Many of the battles will be familiar to readers and gamers. The ordes of battle will be as accurate as possible, but note that some 'artistic license' is used in some situations. Many sources are available to the reader and the author does not attempt to be an authority on each battle. A bibliography of sources will be included.<br/><br/>With the addition of this supplement, it is hoped you can enjoy this period and its many fascinating campaigns and battle from the Age of Napoleon.

The game incorporates elements of base building, army roster creation and deck building.<br/><br/>Pregame<br/>Prior to the initiation of a game players must make several strategic decisions. First, the player must choose an allegiance. There are four factions within BAD Fantasy each with their own unique playstyle or specialization: The Order (healing, defense), Infernal Legion (damage, offense), Mortis Cults (undeath, auras) or The Warband (effigies and luck). The player must then choose a Lord to lead their army. Lords are powerful heroes with unique abilities. Depending on the scenario or board size players are given a resource pool to recruit additional units. They must also create a deck of 30 cards which is supplemented by a Mastery system of an additional 10 cards.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Players roll for first placement. They highest roll goes first placing 5 units or &ldquo;cubes&rdquo; (cubes are terrain pieces). They players then alternate back and forth until all the starter cubes and armies are fielded. A second roll then occurs to determine who makes the first move.<br/><br/>Turns<br/>Turns are structured in the following manner for each player:<br/>1.    Card Phase 1<br/>a.    Rotation of existing cards (cards may have vary durations&hellip;the corners of the cards determine the turn length that the effects will remain active)<br/>b.    Playing of cards from the hand<br/>2.    Board Phase<br/>a.    Movement/Building<br/>b.    Melee Resolution<br/>3.    Card Phase 2<br/>a.    Playing of cards from the hand<br/>b.    Drawing or holding to end the turn.<br/><br/>The Goal of the Game<br/>A win condition is typically generated by killing the opposing Lord however there are other scenarios available.<br/><br/>",

Baseball is a numbers game - and so is Sabermetrics! Battle it out with your opponent over 9 innings in this race for the pennant. Still hungry for more? Why not make it a double-header!<br/><br/>In Sabermetrics, player 1 starts on the mound, pitching three six-sided dice (two white, one green).  Multiply the two white dice together, and then determine if you want to add the green value (for a fastball), or subtract the green value (for a change-up).  That's your pitch number!<br/><br/>Player 2 next rolls the three dice, and uses standard PMDAS (parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) to mathematically match the pitch number.  If they can match exactly, that's a single!  Calculate exactly twice the pitch number, and that's a double.  Exactly three times - a triple.  Within 1 - well, that's a ball (good-eye).  Within 2 - that's a strike.  Not even within 2?!  That's an out!  Not even half is a double-play, and not even a third is a triple play (assuming you have baserunners).  Three outs ends the top of the first, and players switch roles (as well as rolls), to start the bottom of the inning.  Roll three-of-a-kind as a pitcher, pick a runner off.  Roll three-of-a-kind as a hitter, steal a base.<br/><br/>After nine innings, the player with the most runs wins -- still tied?  Head to extra innings!  Ever winning by 10 or more at the bottom of an inning?  That's a slaughter rule, take the win, hit the showers early.<br/><br/>There are cubes to track the score, the pitch count, the innings, and the outs.  This game can also be tracked with a standard baseball scorecard sheet as well -- but it's much more fun to use meeple baserunners!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons with sides alternating in length between n and n + 2 cells.

On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If this stone creates a new group, write a whole number on it.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full. The player with the lower score in the final position wins. Your score is the sum of the prices of all your groups on the board, plus a komi when applicable.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the number of points which is added to the score of one of the players to offset turn order advantage. To avoid ties, the value of komi must be of the form n + 0.5, where n is a whole number.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi and which side will receive it, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value and recipient side for all games. A half-point komi for Black is suggested as a default value.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsSquare: Played on the intersections of a square grid.

It shows the bravery and doggedness of the British against the abilities of the fledgling Americans Rebels. In their leaders, Howe must attempt to overwhelm the enemy, while Prescott had to organise a defence against them out of nothing. To achieve this, we have written a set of rules to showpiece the distinctive way this battle was fought.<br/> Each side has a unique set of circumstances and using miniature forces on hexes, manoeuvreing, dice rolls, fire and melee the players must face the problems the leaders of the actual battle had to overcome. In this particular case, the Regular British Line must overpower the semi trained Revolutionary Militia of 1775 in their defensive terrain.<br/> The core of the game is aimed at the players, this means that all players should be involved throughout the game. Not having to wait until one player has finished all their moves and firing. The action should be continuous for all players. Just because you have the best soldiers you should not automatically win. The game should be enjoyable and everyone should have a chance to win.<br/><br/>A set of rules that showpieces the distinctive way this battle was fought and highlights the bravery and doggedness of the British against the emerging abilities of the fledgling American Rebels.

The words all begin with P, end with either T or N, and have vowels as middle letters.  3 D6 letter dice are thrown to make one of the words on the board.  One die has all Ps, but includes a different number on each face.  The second has either an N or a T.  The third has the five vowels and a blank.  Before the dice are thrown, players bet on which word will come up.  They may bet multiple chips on one word or more.  (The chips are all one color, so players need to note how many they played on each word.) The dice thrower is the banker who does not bet.  The banker pays the winner(s) the chips they bet multiplied by the number showing on the P die, but collects the chips from the non-winning spaces.  Should a blank be thrown on the vowel die, the banker pays all players, but only chip for chip.  When this occurs, the banker position rotates to the player on the left.<br/><br/>Interestingly, no win condition is stated, though one, such as last man standing, can easily be made up.<br/><br/>",

He has demanded your participation in a grueling set of trials against the foulest creatures in the kingdom. The deal is simple: Survive the test and the king will grant your freedom. In order to maximize the king's enjoyment, you will not be alone and you will be allowed time to prepare.<br/><br/>King's Eye is a cooperative, drafting battle simulator for 2-4 players. Choose a character, draft a deck full of upgrades and equipment, and battle through 7 waves of mobs.<br/><br/>King's Eye is played in 2 major phases. In phase 1, players draft upgrade decks in a traditional pass drafting format using 3 &quot;packs&quot; of 9 cards per player from the 120 included upgrade cards. These cards improve character stats and add new abilities/actions that players will be able to utilize in phase 2. At the end of the draft, players have a 27 card deck full of exciting enhancements with which to power-up their character.<br/><br/>Phase 2 is a cooperative battle through 7 waves of mobs. Each round a number of mobs equal to the number of players joins the battle, players take their turns, and then any remaining mobs take their turns. The 7 waves are split into 3 waves each of basic and intermediate mobs, followed by a boss mob wave at the end. Throughout the wave battle, players are becoming stronger and stronger as they seek to stay alive and dispatch the enemies. Once the boss mobs arrive, players have 3 rounds to clear all enemies. Any player that is still alive after all of the enemies have been defeated shares the victory, earning their freedom and the joy that comes from seeing the shock in the King's Eye.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw a card from your upgrade deck and choose a card in your hand to play. Then you can choose 2 actions to perform from you list of available actions.  Everyone has certain action options: draw a card, play a card, perform a basic attack. Each character, and many upgrade cards offer additional action options for players to utilize.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mackinaw is a perfect information two-player abstract game where players stack and trap tokens while they try to move their pieces to the other side of the board. It is a variable board size game, the most accessible sizes being a 3x6 grid (9 pieces per side) or a 4x8 grid (16 pieces per side). Its closely related to checkers/draughts and can be played with flat tokens.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move your pieces to the the other player's starting position (one piece in each square on the other side of the board). Players take turns moving one piece one space at a time, either forwards, left, or right, but not backwards or diagonal. You cannot undo a move you did on your last turn. Your piece may move on top of other pieces. The pieces underneath are trapped and cannot move until freed when the piece above moves off. If you have an available move you must take it, you cannot pass your turn. If you cannot move, your opponent may keep moving until a move becomes available. Once a piece passes the mid-line and lands in the opposite side of the board with no pieces beneath it, it is 'home' and cannot be moved again. The first player to get all their pieces 'home' wins the game.<br/><br/>Mackinaw was invented in 2019 by Tom Sutton, a Canadian animator and artist. It's name comes from the Ontario slang word for a checkered flannel coat; the first versions of the game were played with dark and light wooden blocks and often resembled the same pattern.<br/><br/>",

Roll two dice to build your route or roll one die to either move or collect. Otherwise play your action card.<br/><br/>When building your route:<br/>&bull; roll both dice  <br/>&bull; grab an ice sheet that has the same number as on one of the dice<br/>&bull; lay the ice sheet next to an existing ice sheet with the other die roll number such that both numbers are adjacent<br/>&bull; if you rolled doubles, see double roll rules below<br/>&bull; stack ice sheet segments as necessary to be at the same level as the top of an iceberg.<br/><br/>When moving your explorer:<br/>&bull; roll a single die and move your explorer<br/>&bull; keep rolling until the explorer can reach an iceberg<br/>&bull; when adjacent to an iceberg and on the same level, flip over its dicecube<br/>&bull; an explorer cannot move within range of any animal<br/><br/>Using your action card:<br/>&bull; played to thwart your opponent. An example is move the walrus to the nearest [die roll] ice sheet<br/>&bull; maintain one action card at all times - can be exchanged in lieu of a turn.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>Upon the last dicecube being obtained, everyone reveals their cards and counts their treasure points. The person with the most points wins. The youngest wins any tie.<br/><br/>Climbing Icebergs<br/><br/>In order to collect the dicecube, the explorer must stack one or more ice sheet segments in steps to be level with the top of the iceberg. Your explorer can then step onto the iceberg to collect its dicecube. To stack, roll both dice - one number on the ice sheet segment must match the number on the ice sheet segment beneath.

The players roll two black dice and a red one. The results are determined like in the first game. If a player has the result on his bingo card, he covers the number with a token. The first player to cover 5 numbers in a row shouts &quot;bingo&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

On one level, mercenary life can seem romantic, an adventure, where often noble Soldiers of Fortune venture forth to save lives, right wrongs and vanquish the evil within our world. On another, mercenary life can appear fraught with danger, hardship and eventual death, with little or no support from uncaring employers. The truth is, the reality can be seen as a blend of these and many other factors. What is known is that mercenaries in one form or another have been instrumental in toppling governments, creating nations and preserving peace / ensuring war across the globe, especially during the post-1945 period and up until the modern day.<br/><br/>The information and rules within this book are designed to reflect the life of a mercenary unit during this tumultuous period within many regions and countries. It blends fact and fiction to create a simple, workable framework within which tabletop units and battles can be created in a range of circumstances. <br/>It is designed to be a skirmish level game using suitable miniatures from 15 to 28mm size, plus buildings, vehicles and other items that are scaled to fit. <br/>Games can represent one-off encounters or be a part of a series of battles, perhaps even a narrative campaign where the units you and your fellow gamers come up with develop over time.<br/><br/>Remember: Get in, get out, get paid -<br/>where the Wild Geese roam, lesser men fear to tread&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Between game-changing rules, cards disappearing, and other players out to get you, you&rsquo;ll never play the same way twice.<br/><br/>Players compete in a steampunk-style game to get rid of their hand of cards. Cards available are number cards (used to increase or decrease the current count piles), direction cards (used to change the direction of the count), and jump cards (used to change the increase or decrease limit of the count).<br/><br/>On their turn, players will play a card onto one of two count piles in play based on the current limitations of that pile. If a player cannot play a card from their hand, they must draw a card and either play the card drawn or remove a non-starter card in play.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players gain points based on the cards left in their hand. The game ends when a player reaches 500 points; the player with the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Because it's a free print-and-play roll-and-write, it's easy for distant players to print their own play sheets and play over video chat.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the classic Russian block-stacking video game or the board game Coppenhagen, you have a good grasp of how UpTower plays. the goal of the game is to build a tower with the highest, largest floor before the end of the game.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, one player rolls a die. This die tells all players what piece they must &ldquo;drop&rdquo; onto their playfield.<br/><br/>After the die roll, play is simultaneous - You place the rolled piece on your playfield at the same time as all other players. To do this, you&rsquo;ll mark off one of the four &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of that piece on the reference side of your play sheet, then you&rsquo;ll fill in the spaces where they piece &ldquo;landed&rdquo; after you &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; onto your playfield from the top edge.<br/><br/>Every turn - before or ater you place the rolled piece - you may place one &ldquo;at will&ldquo; piece. If you do, mark off the &ldquo;at will&rdquo; dot for the piece you want to place, then drop it on your board like a rolled piece. You may do this once for each of the six pieces. Note that you get a score bonus (up to 21 points) for your unused &ldquo;at will&rdquo; pieces at the end of the game, so choose wisely!<br/><br/>Once everyone&rsquo;s placed their rolled and at will pieces, roll the die and start a new turn. The game ends when a player reaches the top of the board (the 15th floor) or if you roll the die and that piece has already been used four times.<br/><br/>Your score is your single highest-scoring floor. A floor scores points equal to its level, multiplied by the number of filled spaces on that level &ndash; if your 7th floor has 9 filled spaces, it scores (7*9) 63 points. You also score a small-to-moderate bonus for unused &quot;at-will&quot; pieces: 6=21; 5=15; 4=10; 3=6; 2=3; 1=1. High score wins; play another turn if tied.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Earth has been a bit of a pesky one for them, however. Turns out humans are pretty resilient, and the presence of super-powered individuals has made the planet almost more trouble than it's worth for the invaders. Almost...<br/>But the Thorathian armies aren&rsquo;t the only presence in the cosmos that has its eyes set on Earth. Ineffable forces stir in the far corners of the galaxy, finding themselves drawn towards our planet&rsquo;s bright and chaotic inhabitants. There have been a few shining moments in our timeline (such as the creation and inevitable destruction of the sentient A.I., Omnitron) that have earned the attention of beings far beyond our comprehension.<br/><br/>The Cosmic Threats Expansion is a massive addition to the total amount of content for Freedom Five, adding 2 new playable Heroes to master, 3 new terrifying Mastermind to face, and a host of Villains, Scenario Comic Books, Mystery Envelopes, extra cards, and more<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rin Jankae sat in his command chair, his thoughts hidden behind his impenetrable black eyes and his steepled, long white fingers. He was trying to decide for himself if today was the day that the Romulans entered the war.<br/><br/>Released in June 2005, this Captain&rsquo;s Log issue supports Star Fleet Battles and Federation &amp; Empire. Shield of the Federation by Randy O. Green is a story of the Day of the Eagle, the day the Romulans entered the General War. Can the cruiser Groton and destroyer Genghis hold off the Romulans and be the shield of the Federation? &ldquo;Lawfare&rdquo; provides some humor in the issue. &ldquo;Aces and Eights&rdquo; takes place nearly a month after the Day of the Eagle and focuses on the destroyer Halsey.<br/><br/>In addition to the story, History includes deck plans for the Romulan SkyHawk, class histories for the Federation battle frigate and Klingon F6, and a history of the Federation bomber program.<br/><br/>As is usual, Communications informs readers about the company&rsquo;s activities. The company hired two new people, thus helping spread out the workload. Captain&rsquo;s Log #30 and SFB Module F1 have after-action reports. The company laid out its plans for new print releases and metal miniatures for the coming year. There are questions and answers about Starlist, which makes it easy for players to contact other players. The Input Guide has guidelines for how not to submit scenarios, ships, and fiction. Admiral Growler answers SFB questions. There is a discussion about some proposals and a call for Rangers. More &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions get answered. There is an interview with Ken Burnside. There are two pages of filk songs. Finally, there are the Star Fleet Awards.<br/><br/>This issue includes seven scenarios for Star Fleet Battles. SL234, The Shield of the Federation, and SL235, Aces and Eights, are based on the two stories in the issue. Set during the Early Years, SL236, Web of Curiosity, involves an encounter between the Tholians and Klingons. SL237, Follies of Second-Hand Goods, pits Orions against Jindarians. An Omega scenario, SL238, An Intruding Situation, has the first covert attempt of the Andromedans to take over the Drex. SL239, Further Intrusions, has an Andromedan-controlled Drex dreadnought attacking a Drex battlecruiser and three gunboats. SL240, Riposte at Anporlax, is a classic matchup of the Federation and Klingons.<br/><br/>Database articles include battlegroups designed with local forces. There is an article on the moray eel. Admiral&rsquo;s Game is updated to allow for ships described since 1999. There is an excerpt of a partial X-refit rule from SFB Module X1R. Rule. There are new rules for creating F&amp;E battle groups in SFB and for advanced ground combat in SFB. There is a guide for converting captured Andromedan ships to fit in the fleets of the Galactic Powers, and vice versa. The final article is an example of how energy balancing works when the ship is damaged.<br/><br/>The Tactics section has primers for the Sharkhunters and Alunda. There are over two pages of term papers, along with another half-page with encore term papers.<br/><br/>The Venues section covers Star Fleet Command, SFB On-Line, playing by email, Galactic Conquest (with an article by Howard Bampton introducing a new Andromedan War campaign, Star Fleet Warlord, GURPS Prime Directive, and Star Fleet Battle Force.<br/><br/>Federation &amp; Empire has a rule from Strategic Operations on Survey Ships. There are four pages of tactical notes. Finally, there are rules and rulings.<br/><br/>New ships and gunboats are added for Star Fleet Battles. The Federation gets its battle frigate carrier, battle frigate scout, battle frigate escort, and battle drone frigate; Klingons gain the F6B battle frigate, F6J penal battle frigate, F6S battle frigate scout, and F6E battle frigate escort; the Romulans get the JayHawk battle frigate; the Kzintis get their battle frigate. The Klingons and Federation each gain their fast destroyers. The new gunboats are recovery PFRs and survey PFQs. Other ships are &ldquo;anarchist&rdquo; ships including a Romulan Intruder, Kzinti Conquistador, and two Andromedan-captured ships: a Gorn battlecruiser and a Lyran heavy cruiser.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start, there is a maximum of two men on one boat.<br/><br/>After determining the starting player using a dice roll, the starting player then throws a dice to decide the number of moves, clockwise or anticlockwise, any one of his men on the boat may move. During play no more than three men can be on one boat.<br/><br/>The player then pulls one of the balls on the island to reel the boat in. If the boat pulled to shore contains the player's own man, then he puts that man on the island and pulls the boat out again.

        "description": "At the beginning of an operation, the commanding officer determines the point from which the operation will begin. This is referred to as the line of departure. In this game, players discover what happens once the soldiers under their command move ... Off the Line.<br/><br/>Off the Line is a wargame of low-to-moderate complexity that depicts man-to-man combat during World War II. Each combat unit represents a single soldier. Games are won through the completion of mission objectives such as the control of locations on the map board, exiting soldiers from the map through specific points, or the simple elimination of enemy soldiers. Although players are open to maneuver their forces as they wish, they&rsquo;ll soon find that traditional tactics for units at the game&rsquo;s scale are the best bet to achieve goals and to keep their forces intact.<br/><br/>Game play is managed through the use of a shared deck of action cards, each of which is used to determine how many soldiers might be activated during a turn, the resolution of random outcomes such as combat and morale checks, and random events. Being able to manage limited resources is a key to victory.<br/><br/>Each soldier is individually named and rated for morale (which determines a soldier&rsquo;s effectiveness under fire), melee, weapon, and in some instances, command. Terrain is represented through the use of twelve geomorphic map panels that can create hundreds of different battlefield configurations.<br/><br/>This initial game includes forces for the United States and Germany facing off through twelve individual scenarios, plus instructions on how to create your own. Plans are in place to add additional nationalities, more maps, and lots more scenarios!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

America is in peril, and the presidents &ndash; from George Washington to Barack Obama &ndash; have all come back together to save us! Playable options for the &ldquo;Big Bad&rdquo; they&rsquo;re saving us from include a pandemic, dictators, monsters, aliens and more. But while the portal to the past was open, the villains of American history &ndash; from Benedict Arnold to Bull Connor &ndash; have come back to stop the presidents and ensure America&rsquo;s downfall. The battle for our country is on!<br/><br/>Publisher’s product page<br/><br/>The core of the game is 24 presidents, divided up evenly among the players. At the beginning of the game, you select a Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America. Every turn, you draw five cards out of your deck and play them. Each president has a presidential power based on that president&rsquo;s actual strengths (such as popularity, party building or policy leadership). Presidents can also join forces to attack villains together, or recruit new cards into your deck. You can add to your deck cards that represent support from other presidents (hello, Millard Fillmore!), constitutional provisions that give powers to the presidency, and other forces from American history. These support cards interact with keywords on your presidents and other game factors, giving you tactical choices.<br/><br/>The players use their attacks to capture 12 villains from American history. Then it&rsquo;s time for the Final Showdown with the Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America, represented by a set of threat cards. The rules for the Final Showdown are different for each Big Bad &ndash; fighting off a pandemic and fighting off monsters require different tactics! If the Big Bad defeats your presidents, it wins; if you defeat it first, the player with the most captured villains and Big Bad threat cards wins. So there&rsquo;s pressure to be capturing villains for the whole game, but victory still hangs on that Final Showdown.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The cards are shuffled and dealt evenly. The beginning child looks for an animal with a one-dot from his cards, says its name and places the card face up. Who has the same animal with two dots, must place that card, the player with the third matching card (three dots) also places and may then call the next animal with a one-dot and place it, etc. The winner is whoever runs out of cards first.<br/> 2. The shuffled cards remain in a pile with their backs up and are picked up individually in turn. Everyone who gets a card with a 1 dot, puts it down after calling it out. Then the cards with two dots  may also be laid out, whoever has the third matching card may take the trio. The winner is whoever has the most cards last. If you make a mistake, you have to moan or cackle etc. depending on the animal with which you did something wrong.<br/> 3. The game can also be played like a Schwarzer Peter&quot;, the black dog is then Peter, the other two dogs are removed from the game beforehand.<br/><br/>Each game in the order above uses slightly more complex rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Game of Power and Intrigue in the Gilded Age<br/><br/>The war of the currents is raging. Thomas Edison&rsquo;s direct current is safe, cheap and simple, but weak. Nikola Tesla&rsquo;s alternating current is powerful, but complicated and occasionally deadly. Which technology will power New York City and then the world?<br/><br/>As the leader of a fledgling electric company you must hire staff, build generators and power lines, win bids, complete projects&hellip;and sabotage the competition. Build your Electric Empire and power the gilded age.<br/><br/>Electric Empires is an engine-building, worker placement game set in the gilded age of New York City. A unique shared reputation mechanism balances semi-cooperative strategy with cut-throat competition. Asymmetric gameplay means different power currents require different strategies and tactics providing great replayability.<br/><br/>Electric Empires is played over the course of 10 years (rounds) each consisting of four quarters (turns). Each turn a player may take two actions: initiating a bid on a project, hiring or assigning workers, building generators, seeking financing or playing action cards.<br/><br/>Each year (round) progress must be made on active projects, debt must be retired or interest paid and maintenance must be performed on in-play power generators.<br/><br/>Completing projects is the main way to gain victory points. Each project represents providing power to a historic location in glided age New York City. Project contracts are acquired through bidding against competing players in terms of how much money you want to complete the project, how long it will take you and the current reputation of your electrical current AC or DC.<br/><br/>In addition to the workers necessary to complete a project you must build generators to supply sufficient power. These generators must be either located adjacent to the project on the gameboard or connected by powerlines which you can also build. Power can be leased either from one of two public utilities or from a competing player using the same current. Projects can be lost due to a lack of progress or malfunctions. Players can sabotage competitors' projects and potentially take them over and gain the associated victory points.<br/><br/>Careful planning of project bidding and generator placement is necessary to build an engine that will produce enough revenue to fund your commitments and enough energy to power projects once they are complete. If power to a completed project is disrupted, victory points from that project are not counted until power is restored.<br/><br/>Each year (round) a new &quot;Annual Forecast&quot; card is drawn which sets unique conditions for all players for the duration of the year (round).<br/><br/>Players may choose either Thomas Edison's preferred current, Direct Current (CD) or Nikola Tesla's Alternating Current (AC). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages leading to asymmetrical gameplay. Both currents (AC and DC) also have an associated reputation or public perception shared by all players using that current. A good reputation makes winning bids and getting financing easier. A negative reputation makes succeeding more difficult.<br/><br/>At the end of year (round) ten, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Amino takes players on a journey into the microcosm of ants.<br/><br/>In Amino - The Ant Game you build a microcosm that every time looks different. In this microcosm you manage an ant colony, and to win you must be the first to collect the best resources. To do this, you lay out new paths and open up new resources and hill. With your opponent you fight for these resources and obstruct their pathways. With &quot;Ant cards&quot; you block paths, build bridges, lend wings to your ant, improve their fighting power or change the existing maze of paths.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to quickly get the best resources for yourself. There are three different resources, which give you one to three points depending on their type. Now, some may be worth more or less to you than they are to your opponent. The first player to collect seven points wins.<br/><br/>",

However, following false leads and uncovering a Trap tile will cause a player to lose Reputation (-5 points) at the hands of devious opponents. The adventurer with the highest Reputation when the available clue cards have been exhausted will win the game!<br/><br/>The game begins as a tile-laying/&rsquo;build your own board&rsquo; adventure, before shifting to an exploration of your opponents&rsquo; dig sites: through the cunning use of action cards and a quest to find hidden Relics, only the most successful adventurer will prevail!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It serves to represent either a lovely little farmhouse in either Tanland or Greenland, complete with tractors, wells, haystacks, plenty of trees, supply crates, and what's that? <br/>TWO NEW CHARACTERS? Why yes! After all, no Fury Farm Battleset is ever complete with a set of new characters to send into battle alongside your Green Guard and Tanzer Elite veterans!<br/><br/>- For the second detail of what this product is, you'll find the agreeable Sergeant &ldquo;Shooty&rdquo; Sean representing the Green Guard, a rather light-footed fellow who is well known for his proficiency with the submachine gun. A good chap for all the sticky, tough jobs, Sean is also quite a card-player and is known for enjoying any and all types of Green Tea. Get it? Green tea!<br/>And for the Tanzer Elite we have the mysterious, gas-mask wearing Sergeant &ldquo;Shadowy&rdquo; Sylvia, one of the few Tanzer Elite soldiers who made it through the Battle of Tanky Meadows and the Retreat Through Popsy Pass with all of her bits intact! Quiet, evasive, and somewhat eerie, she is known to other Tanzer Elite troops as a bit of a lone wolf, yet commands great respect due to her distinguished military career.

Green Guardians is inspired by the precious natural world around us that is being irreparably altered through climate change and habitat destruction. The challenge for the Guardians is to find the balance of seeking prosperity without polluting the world beyond recovery.<br/><br/>Green Guardians is a strategic game for 2-4 players, recommended for ages 10 and up, and after a quick setup lasts 45-60 minutes. Players' choices drive the action and competition but random events provide an extra challenge.<br/><br/>Guardians explore the undiscovered world to gather resources. The resources can be used to build and upgrade to structures that provide additional resources and research. However their actions create waste that accumulates over time to form pollution that prevents the structures from working. In addition, the use of resources subjects the Guardians to disasters that slow down their progress. Guardians overcome these challenges by using their resources to research abilities and cleanup the pollution to keep their buildings productive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Successive players move clockwise.<br/><br/>If more than one player is on the same space, nothing happens. After completing your move, if you are standing on a square with a crate, take a card from the deck of adventure cards and follow the instructions on the card. If you stood on the action space, you execute the command from that space.<br/><br/>Rolling 6 points each time entitles you to extra move. Only rolling a different number of spots ends the turn.<br/><br/>2.Movements cards:<br/><br/>On strategic mode you use movement cards to move around the board - cards marked with dice.<br/>This will give you connection between board game and card game with new oportunity of gameplay.<br/><br/><br/>You went on a trip with friends. After setting up the camp, it turned out that on the way you lost a basket with provisions.<br/>Additionally, one of the backpacks was torn and protective equipment against insects and other items helpful during the trip fell out of it.<br/>You decide to find the lost basket with food in order to play by the camp fire in the evening.<br/><br/>The forest is full of surprises. You can stand face to face with a dangerous bear or meet poisonous snakes on your way.<br/>However, not all obstacles are dangerous, be careful not to get distracted and get lost while listening to the beautiful voice of singing birds.<br/>During the journey, you will also meet harmless animals, observing them and not disturbing them can help you find your way faster.<br/>You will also have to cross dangerous canyons and swamps.<br/><br/>Some facts about the game, I think you should love it  :<br/><br/>Game rules<br/><br/>The game is started by the player who rolls the most dice. Successive players move clockwise.<br/>If more than one player is on the same space, nothing happens. After completing your move, if you are standing on a square with a crate, take a card from the deck of adventure cards and follow the instructions on the card. If you stood on the action space, you execute the command from that space.<br/>Rolling 6 points each time entitles you to extra move. Only rolling a different number of spots ends the turn.<br/>To complete the game, in the last move you need to roll as many stitches as you have left to the basket.<br/><br/>Difficulty level<br/><br/>With this game you can play on several difficult levels what make game more interested and tageted to everyone.<br/>You can play with your yungest child 3+ or play with advanced players in strategic, coop or rivalry mode using standard dice or movement card.<br/>The game can take 10 minutes on child mode or even couple hour on maximum difficulty level.<br/><br/>Normal level - Variant 1<br/><br/>In the basic variant of the game, the difficulty level is on the normal level - 5/10.<br/><br/>You play in classic style:<br/>throw the dice -&gt; move -&gt; get the card if you stand on field with chest -&gt; follow the instruction -&gt; end turn<br/><br/>The length of the game oscillating about 15-30 minutes but depends on the player's luck and skill in throwing the dice, meetings with forest inhabitants and the collected equipment.<br/><br/>Some of example other level in game:<br/><br/>Child mode<br/><br/>Difficulty level - 1/10<br/>This is the fastest game timeand can take 10 minute or less. This level is for everyone who want fast end or have children who can't sit on place more than 10 minute<br/>The goal of the game is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. You don't use any cards, all action spaces are neutral and nothing happens on them. The crossroads are also neutral, and you choose your own direction of travel. If your move ends in a space that has been occupied by another player, you occupy the next empty space.<br/><br/>Meeting mode<br/><br/>Difficulty level - 6/10<br/>You win only when collect all animals you will meet - 15 animals - one card per each. You take adventure cards from the pile of cards only after you have finished moving on the field with the box.<br/>But be careful, if you lose on action fields - ants, bees, swamp, rock pillar, suspension bridge and ponds, you lose all collected card.<br/>When you end your move on basket with food, next turn you will begin on camp and lose all equipment cards and map card.<br/>All your lost cards you need to return the bottom of the pile of cards.<br/><br/>Card mode - strategic<br/><br/>Difficulty level &ndash; 9/10<br/>This mode offers the possibility of strategic thinking and planning, but the game time increases significantly, so it is recommended for players who like the highest level of difficulty in games.<br/>In this mode, you play the base game.<br/>During the game, you only use the dice when you encounter animals. In this mode, you use movement cards to move around the board - cards marked with dice.<br/>At the beginning of the game, shuffle the movement cards and deal 5 cards to all players so that the other players cannot see them. Leave the rest of the cards on the pile.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may use one of your cards to move and reveal it to the players. However, if neither card meets your strategic plans, you choose the first move card in the pile, which ultimately determines your move.<br/>Each used movement card is returned to the bottom of the movement deck.<br/>After you have used all your movement cards, on the next turn, you take the first 5 cards from the pile and continue the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Burrow is a whole series of draw-free annihilation games based on the general concept of capture-templates. To begin a turn, a player takes one of his pieces and captures-via-replacement some enemy piece. Some aspect of the capture provides a template whereby the piece may perform further captures. The template can be the minimal bounding box containing the move, the directions used to achieve the capture, or even the number of friendly pieces in the line-of-sight. Burrow is meant to be a game system and the only presiding rules, aside from the objective of annihilation, are that the template informs all further captures, that the capturing piece must keep moving until it has no available capture according to its template and the mechanism of movement must allow unlimited translation in both dimensions of the board in making the initial capture. Also the game is played on an 8x8 board with a regular alternating pattern of pieces. I invite anyone to put on their designing caps and suggest their own Burrow games. Here are some of my own.<br/><br/>Note: as a general rule in these 4 Burrow games there is no jumping over pieces of any color. However in others jumping may be allowed.<br/><br/>Box Burrow: this is closest to the original. In Box Burrow the template is the minimal bounding box containing the capture with the capturing piece's initial position, and the initial piece to be captured being at opposite corners. Further conventions are that the capture is achieved by a number of orthogonal steps and the horizontal and vertical values of the bounding box cannot be interchanged. Further captures can be made, as long as for each, movement is entirely within a bounding box of equivalent dimension and as with the first capture the next piece to be captured is at its opposite corner.<br/><br/>Path Burrow:  In Path Burrow the template is the exact orthogonal path the piece takes to make the first capture. Further conventions are that the path must only involve movement in no more than two directions, one horizontal and one vertical and that the path can be rotated or flipped in any orientation but its ends (initial and terminating) cannot be interchanged.<br/><br/>Sweep Burrow: By far the easiest of the variants so far, Sweep Burrow's template is simply the two orthogonal directions involved in making the initial capture. The only further convention here is that if the capture was made with just movement in one direction, you cannot employ a second direction.<br/><br/>Tumburrow: Tumburrow has the most distinctive template of these. The template is to count the number of friendly pieces (aside from the capturing piece itself) a queen's move away from the first capture. The other convention is that every capture must only involve movement in no more than two directions (orthogonal and diagonal) however these directions do not provide template data.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each board is different and shows 12 images relating to helping around the house or working with parents and siblings.<br/><br/>The cards  do not have matching images as in a regular Lotto game. These cards are shuffled, The top card is revealed by the parent who is 'running' the game.<br/><br/>Each player now checks their board to see if the named card can be used with any pictures on their board. Note that one image might relate to more than one use. For example; Woodwork Utensils could be matched with decorating the house, building a rabbit hutch or fence, and so on.<br/><br/>The first child to give a correct answer (in the opinion of the person in charge of the cards) is given the card to cover the picture related to their answer.<br/><br/>The first person to cover all the images on their card (or a preset number of images matched), wins.<br/><br/>The game was made in the DDR (East Germany).<br/><br/>",

After you do, you can stop rolling and score or you can roll the dice you haven't collected.<br/><br/>Homogenous sets of dice score the best: two dice score four points, three score nine, four score 16. Consecutive dice score second-best, with a run of two scoring four, three scoring six, and four scoring eight. &quot;Loner&quot; dice score one point each.<br/><br/>If you choose to roll again, what you roll may make you end your turn and score nothing.<br/>&bull; If you're collecting identical dice and you don't get at least one result that matches what you're collecting, your turn ends and you score nothing.<br/>&bull; If you're collecting different dice and at least one result matches a die you already have, your turn ends and you score nothing.<br/>...Otherwise, you may collect one or more valid dice and choose to stop and score or roll the un-collected dice yet again.<br/><br/>The game ends after four rounds.

They finally place their player die on their Joker, with the one pip face up.&nbsp; These two players take on the role of a jester who is attempting to win over the Royal court.&nbsp; They will do this by playing quips on the Kings, charming the Queens to gain their favor, and utilize the Jacks of the trade to manipulate their opponents.<br/><br/>There are specific movement rules for each card in the Royal Court, and the Jokers. which you can simply move to either adjacent card.&nbsp; Jokers are set by each player at the start, adjacent to two cards within the Royal Court, so moving from a Joker means you have two options.&nbsp; From the Kings, the players can move to any adjacent card to that King, meaning it has a number of possibilities, depending on where that King lies. From a Queen, a player may move anywhere within that Queens row, which gives players three options. Moving from a Jack, players must remain in that Jack&rsquo;s column.<br/><br/>Once a player has moved to a new card, they initiate a Jest, except when moving back to a Joker.&nbsp; When a Jest takes place, each player must play a a card matching the color of the In addition to each face card having a different movement rule, they also have their own Winning Jest Scores, and Win Results. Unless the players happen to be on the same card, only the initiator (the one who moved onto the new card), may gain the Win Result for that Jest.&nbsp; When moving to a King, the player who plays the highest car, wins. The initiator may gain one Quip Point for winning.&nbsp; If a player moves to a Queen, the lowest card wins, and the initiator may gain a Favor Token for winning.&nbsp; Finally, on a Jack, the initiating player decides whether high of low will win, before the players play their cards.&nbsp; When the initiator wins on a Jack, they may take away a point of their choosing, either a Favor Token or Quip Point. If there are none to take, the initiating player gains a Favor Token instead.&nbsp; The end game trigger is when a player reaches six quip points, which is indicated by them turning their die with the six pip face up. The players will then compare scores, and whoever has the most points, Quip points and Favor points, wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
