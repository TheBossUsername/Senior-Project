They then cover the other side of the card with an hand and show it at the same time as other players. Cards have an action resolution order, then the chosen card is passed to the left for a new round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a future that it&rsquo;s not so far from us, the earth is going to die. People with huge wealth have created their own spaceships to get away from this bad land. The ones left behind struggle for thousands of years, and finally they are not just surviving, but exploring their own path into the galaxy. They call themselves &quot;The Terran Union&quot;. Uniting more and more civilizations from different planets, the Terran Union becomes stronger and bigger. Eventually, they encounter their &quot;traitor&quot;, the descendants of those people who abandoned them so long ago. The Terran Union doesn't want to bear the name &quot;Tyrant&quot; &mdash; but they do want revenge, so they force these descendants onto deserted planets to let them taste what those in The Terran Union suffered for thousands of years. What's more, they take the rich planets that the descendants were living in and taking for granted.<br/><br/>One of the planets that the Terran Union takes is Cassandra, a planet with a vital strategic position and a high value of complex mines. A family of Chinese ancestry from the Terran Union, who also has an important position in the Terran Union council, is in charge of it. And now the great crisis of Cassandra is quietly coming. Who is the invader? Will the Chinese hold their home? Who is behind all the events? Let's face together the war of Cassandra!<br/><br/>In War of Cassandra, which follows scenarios from the Chinese science-fiction novel &quot;War Of Cassandra&quot; (卡桑德拉战役), players act as different parties within the universe. Players deploy land troops, fleets, commercial wagons, science teams, and diplomats to gain advantages of every perspective among the galaxy. Since the fates of the galactic parties are chained together, the game has a creative &quot;chained event system&quot; mechanism that means whenever an event occurs, it triggers other events affecting other parties.<br/><br/>The game lasts several rounds, and when the last round ends, players count their points according to the scoring guide and check the fate event cards to see whether they match the winning conditions.<br/><br/>",

Quick Fixture was intended to be a companion to other more detailed, longer playing games, but many gamers enjoy just replaying a season using this game alone.<br/><br/>Key statistics such as winning percentage, goals scored, and goals allowed are translated to team ratings for both home and away performance. In other words, each team is rated twice for a &quot;basic&quot; season.  The team ratings make it easy to adjust for certain in-game events, such as injuries or playing short-handed.<br/><br/>Select leagues and seasons are rated as &quot;complete&quot; seasons, adding a bit more detail.  A complete season includes players rated in distribution ranges for goal scoring and for discipline (yellow/red cards) which adds a lot to the story of a match.<br/><br/>This game is for the solitaire gamer who wants to quickly generate realistic results and enjoy a league or tournament from a high-level, observer point of view.

        "description": "This game is a small scale skirmish level game where Superheroes and Villains face off against each other in a 3D tabletop set up. It could be a city, the Wakandan desert, the Savage Lands, the blue area of the moon or anything you like. In Marvel they fight anywhere.<br/>It is played on a 36&quot; x 36&quot; board so will fit on most tables without a problem.<br/><br/>In a game you will usually have between 4-7 characters on your team. Each of these characters act individually using their own Power to carry out different attacks and use Special Powers.<br/>Many can help or hinder each others though with boosts and actions like a Fastball Special.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to win set scenarios by completing different tasks and scoring Victory Points. These could be anything from take down / save the highest Level model in the team or rescue and keep a Cosmic Relic.<br/><br/>Each character comes with their own Stat Card which shows everything they can do. Attacks, Defence, Skills, Power, Damage and such.<br/>These are then used in a 2 D8 mechanic during the game. For example, 2D8 plus Attack Stat vs Defence Stat or 2D8 against your own Agility.<br/><br/>Reformed supervillain Norman Osborn, now calling himself the Iron Patriot, was given leadership of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He reformed that agency into H.A.M.M.E.R. and created a new Avengers team under its aegis. The line-up consists of former Thunderbolts members and new recruits Sentry and Ares, as well as disguised super-villain Moonstone who is portraying Ms. Marvel. Using the Dark Avengers as a cover Norman declared war on the Asgardians, and has the Dark Avengers prepare for the Siege of Asgard. Norman considered The Sentry, specifically his dark side, known as The Void, his secret weapon.<br/><br/>",

It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.<br/><br/>The objective is to stalemate the opponent or to capture his entire army.<br/><br/>Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Petteia XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:<br/><br/>     Push and Crush Attack<br/>     Flank Attack<br/>     Phalanx Attack<br/><br/><br/>Aditionally, Petteia XXI has locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/petteia-latrunculi-xxi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/petteia-latrunculi-xx...</a><br/><br/>",

Once the districts are complete, however, the mighty volcano erupts, sending its destructive lava to burn away what these families worked so hard to build. Only a few remnants of the once proud city still stand. The family clever, and fortunate enough to secure its influence during both the development and destruction of Pompeii claims victory.<br/><br/>Pompeii: Wrath of Vesuvius is a light weight tile laying game, complete with bluffing, building, and destruction. The game is played in two phases. During the first phase, the Pompeii phase, players will be placing their warehouse tiles into various warehouse districts throughout the city of Pompeii. The tiles have a guild icon on one side and a numerical value on the other. Face down tiles are worth one influence on the cities district, and player may choose to reveal the numerical side to all the players in the game and gain influence equal to the numerical value of the tile, and any other tiles still face down in the district. Each district will be scored for first, second, and third place at the end of the Pompeii Phase.<br/><br/>During the second phase, The Vesuvius Phase, players take the role of the mountain, and begin placing lava tokens flowing down from Vesuvius into the city. Each lava token will give the player access to remove a warehouse tile from the board. After all lava tokens have been placed, players will flip up the numerical side of each warehouse tile still on the board and score bonus points for any tiles left. They will earn more points for each tile that is closer to the top of the mountain.<br/><br/>",

Earth was mysteriously torn from its orbit by an unknown force - the Sun disappeared from the sky, and a scarlet dwarf star took its place. No one knows how or why did the Leap happen, but one thing seems certain: it was an act of a superior intelligence with an unknown origin and intention.<br/><br/>The mystery is up to your group of explorers to unfold through a series of plays. Discover multiple variants of the post-Leap Earth in an age when technology is spiraling out of control, becoming both a blessing and a curse. Evolve into a powerful Transhuman on your journey to discover the truth behind the Leap - but hold on to your humanity or face the consequences.<br/><br/>Transhumanity is a story-driven co-operative campaign game where players use point-to-point movement to explore multiple post-Leap Earths. Each game is based on an open card-drafting mechanism where players may use the drafted cards to either influence the current Earth's fate or build their own deck to customize and improve their character for the long run. The campaign will gradually unveil the truth behind the Leap, and leads to an epic conclusion.<br/><br/>The game is based on an award winning science fiction novel by Brandon Hackett.<br/><br/>Are you ready to become the next step in human evolution?<br/><br/>",

Players colonize the modular board, which represents a resource rich area on the Moon, by tile placement where tiles represent colony parts. The player whose colony has the highest value will become the winner.<br/><br/>The colony value consists of individual tile values and the values of functional relationships between individual tiles created by the tile's positions and rotations.<br/><br/>It is 2113. Mother Earth has shown her other face after a long period of prosperity. Ocean streams changed their directions, weather conditions started to be cruel and devastating. Mankind spent our last reserves of fossil fuels, global war has started.<br/><br/>War is never good. On the other hand - it has positive influence on technology development. Mankind is able to control fusion power and reach space - to reach the Moon to be more precise.<br/><br/>The Moon - nobody was interested about the Moon just century ago with the exception of dreamers and poets. The Moon - a huge reserve of Helium-3 - new source of energy. The Moon - a new hope for a new life and peace.<br/><br/>Four nations have sent their colonization ships to the Moon to get all those resources and to end the war - China, Europa, USA and India. Who will manage to conquer the Moon and to enter new age of mankind as a winner?<br/><br/>Moonriser is a tactical card game for 2-4 players with playing time of about 60-90 minutes.<br/><br/>It is not only important WHAT cards are being played in this game but also HOW they are played in terms of their relative positions. Two players can have exactly the same cards but their territories built from those cards can have a completely different strength. One needs to plan really carefully how to place cards into your territory to use the full potential of those cards.<br/><br/>",

The game rules are freely distributed for anyone to share. While designed for 2 to 4 players, it can be played with more as long as there are enough blocks available. After three rounds of building and fighting with rival castles the winner is the player with the largest and greatest castle with the highest towers.<br/><br/>During building a random card determines the block every player gets to place next to their castle. There's a push your luck mechanic in that the players should complete the castle before a dice roll ends the building phase after 8 to 13 cards.<br/><br/>The fighting is asymmetric so that the defender is basically choosing which attackers to target and tries to score high enough dice throws, while the attacker is able to choose where he moves his troops and if he wants to try to conquer the castle to get a block for himself or simply wreck parts of the defender's castle.

As he rose through the ranks, he gained allies in the form of the Batman and Gothams then District Attorney, Harvey Dent to help him create an honest police department and clean up the city.<br/><br/>Gordon was the man to place the Bat Signal on the GCPD headquarters and while he was once secretive about working with Batman, he now openly uses the signal to call the Caped Crusader if needed.<br/><br/>Now, as Commissioner, Gordon tries to carry on the fight against crime and corruption from the top.<br/><br/>Even his daughter Barbara has joined the fight as the well know Batgirl.<br/><br/><br/>In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Law Forces are the normal men and women on the street trying to fight the madness around them.<br/><br/>Commissioner Gordon is now a Gotham Veteran.

Able to get around the board with ease, Batgirl is great to send after anyone on rooftops or in hard to reach places.<br/><br/>The SWAT teams of the GCPD are some of the most well armed, trained and protected professionals in Gotham. Armed with battering rams, riot shields and a range of guns, the SWAT are the Elite force.<br/><br/>The street cops of Gotham also join the fight. While they carry less equipment that the SWAT, the Cops can arrest any criminals that have been taken out and light up any targets for the big guns in the dark streets and back alleys.<br/><br/>The GCPD don't often call on the help of Free Agents but will sometimes make unlikely alliances with those that aren't considered all bad, just misguided.<br/><br/>Catwoman and Mr Freeze can join along side the cops. Even if it's just to get to the Loot from the crimes they are stopping.<br/><br/>The Gotham City Police are great for those that want to take the normal people of Gotham and prove that costumes, capes and code names can still be stopped by anyone determined enough.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>Four white metal miniatures (Jim Gordon and three SWAT Members - Alpha, Bravo, and Delta)<br/>Stat cards for the figures<br/><br/>",

This battle pitted the 2nd Battalion of the 309th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 310th Infantry Regiment of the 78th Infantry Division against units from the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division, including elements of the 326th Volksgrenadier Division. This attack was part of a greater attack by the First Army's V Corps in an effort to capture the Roer River Dams that included the 78th Infantry Division as well as the 2nd Infantry Division to the south. The attack by the 78th Division interrupted Hitler's plans for the northern shoulder of the Bulge.<br/><br/>The recent release of Battle of the Twin Villages got your boots into the snow. Now you're going to have to slog forward, if you are the Volksgrenadier player .. or hold on ... if the Americans. Because the dates are 14-16 December 1944. And that means the height of ferocity of Hitler's last gamble, aka 'Wacht Am Rhein' has been unleashed. And every village, every road crossing, where a stand is made can make the difference between a drive to Antwerp, or a final, crushing blow to the tyrant's dreams as he hunkers in his lair. As all good tactical-level gamers know, the decision was always decided on the ground, at the sharp end ... by individual soldiers and squads.<br/><br/>To that end, we bring you ATS DESPERATE HOURS: Three Battle for Kesternich, a brand new historical module with never before published WINTERIZED map and scenarios &gt; what's more, to make things easy for you to get YOUR boots on the ground, a complete set of all the combat counters you need to play are provided in ALL NEW OLIVE DRAB &gt; American Personnel + American AFVs/H Weapons + German Personnel + German AFVs/H Weapons!<br/><br/>Just bring your ATS Rulebook 2014 and system markers &gt; and you are ready to stand ... or smash through as this is a showdown between the 78th Infantry Division and the 272nd Volksgrenadiers ... and only one side will stand ... or fall.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What Ho World! is a light role-playing game of hijinks and shenanigans set in the breezy upper classes of the roaring 20s. With the improvised storytelling of a roleplaying game and the pick-up-and-play nature of a card game, you can jump right into things and tell a great story together over the space of a few hours.<br/><br/>The deck includes 5 characters: the flighty Gadabout, the dependable Servant, the conniving Aged Relative, the imperious Pillar of Society, and the eccentric Highbrow. Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character - these are the objectives they're trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking it in turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal. Once someone has completed all their goals, the game wraps up with an epilogue showing how things worked out for each character.<br/><br/>User Note: this game also has an RPG item entry: What Ho, World!<br/><br/>",

A complete collection of all ten paintings by any one artist with ratings from 1*to 10*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10) is the highest possible score of 55 and the first trader to achieve that will be an early knockout winner.In the absence of a knockout winner during the course of the game all traders must reveal their collection of paintings face-up on the table at the end of game. After finish of the last auction at the end of agreed number of rounds the trader with highest combined ratings score of any one artist will then be the winner. 2nd and 3rd finishing positions are decided likewise.<br/><br/>",

The Allies must therefore risk attacking these strongly held outposts to clear their main attacks. The villages also give the opportunity to the Franco-Bavarians to use counter-attacks. The French army is no longer the superb weapon of Cond&eacute;, Turenne or Luxembourg: a force hurling itself forward in a furia franchese. It cannot out face the Allies in the open, but by carefully using counter-attacks it can yet confound the Allies.<br/><br/>The Allies need to balance their attacks along the line to keep the Franco-Bavarians pinned and prevent them moving reserves into areas subject to the main Allied attack. Forces are divided into foot and horse, and these two arms will support each other in combat. Problems arise where foot and horse are not both available. Then infantry can find themselves pinned and shelled, and cavalry unable to attack effectively.<br/><br/>",

Kiritchenko has fought countless battles all over the planet in the name of the Motherland. He has spent the last few years with the 5th Guards Separate Spetsnaz Brigade, always at the forefront of special operations in dangerous places.<br/><br/>He came up with the idea of the Red Banner during the bloody battle around the Allied Embassy in Lima, Peru. After days of intense combat, the defending Spetsnaz were faltering in the face of attacks by ASOCOM heavy rangers. Remembering the revolutionaries of 1918, Kiritchenko grabbed a large red table cloth as a makeshift banner. Rallying locals and the surviving Spetsnaz around his position, he lead a charge that won the day for the SSU.<br/><br/>Even if it&rsquo;s unique among special forces to carry a flag, Kiritchenko has done so ever since, earning him the nickname &lsquo;Red Banner&rsquo;, only now he carries the official standard of his regiment. Kiritchenko continues on the path to victory for the glory of the Sino-Soviet Union and the World Marxist Revolution.<br/><br/>",

This Troll roamed the streets demanding a toll from any traveller he met; if they refused to pay, he would steal their trousers. One day the Troll stopped a merchant travelling along the road. As usual, he demanded the merchant pay the toll in order to pass undisturbed. The merchant, who was very cunning, made the Troll a proposal&hellip;<br/><br/>Trade &amp; Troll is an easy to play game as the rules and the main mechanism can be learned in about 20 minutes. The real challenge lies in how to best suit each player&rsquo;s strategy to the developing situation on the board.<br/><br/>Players represent a merchant whose goal is to arrange an efficient production line from the collection of basic resources to their manufacturing and consequent trading in market stands. Each turn players can build resource/stall/market tiles, cobble a road or collect money from tiles they already possess.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when the board representing the developing village is completely constructed, the player who owns the most developed market web, combined with the victory points collected differently during the game, wins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, things become more complicated as a troll arrives in the village! The control of this character swaps each turn after a fierce auction between players, and the one who finally gets it has the opportunity to block the opponents&rsquo; trades until the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Trade &amp; Troll is a European-style game for 2 to 6 players created by Good &amp; Evil Games. It features a double-sided board map of T&amp;T kingdom, 120 high-quality illustrated tiles, 73 wooden meeples, and numerous illustrated tokens.<br/><br/>",

But any more than that was just left to rot on the battlefield. This whole philosophy changed with the first vehicles derived from VK technology: even destroyed these were still very valuable. And even if nothing could be taken from the wreckage, it had to be properly destroyed so nothing would fall into enemy hands. This kind of job is much more seriously done outside of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Hence the creation of a new generation of KV47 with specialized task and equipment. With these, heavy SSU regiments could now take care of their precious vehicles directly during combat. And some of these models proved quite efficient to blow things up as well. The guys piloting these things are among the best mechanics on the planet. They already knew how to make pretty cheap but effective repairs with what they had at hand. But they know how to pilot a walker too.<br/><br/>",

When it was time for a new and improved series, who better to name it after than the Supreme Leader himself?<br/><br/>The Iosef Stalin super-heavy tank is armed with an efficient combination of weapons, each of which has been proven on other tanks. Its main weapon is a 183mm (7.2&rdquo;) D-47T gun. Although not designed to destroy vehicles, the mass of this weapon&rsquo;s round can knock out any tank, no matter how heavy. Its powerful explosive shell is overkill against infantry, but is death to bunkers.<br/><br/>The secondary weapon is an ATO-45B flamethrower mounted alongside the main gun. It is ideal for destroying infantry in buildings and strongpoints. That&rsquo;s if there are still some in range when the Iosef Stalin gets there. Usually there&rsquo;s only wreckage left, or the enemy has fled.<br/><br/>",

It consists of a deck of 100 unique coloured cards which are used to play many different games which are quick to learn and play.<br/><br/>The cards use five 'colours&rsquo;: Red, Blue, Green, Black and White.  Each card has three &lsquo;aspects&rsquo;:  Word, Text and Background.  The Word is the name of one of the five colours, the Text of that word is written in one of the colours, and the Background of the card is in a different colour. Three different colours may feature in a card's aspects, but if the background or text is the same colour as the word, the card will only have two colours.<br/><br/>There are many different games that can be played with ColourCards.  These include ColourCall (spot which colour appears the most among a set of cards), ColourCount (write down how many times each colour appears among a set of cards), ColourSeek (deduce the aspects of a hidden card), ColourSet (find 2 cards with 5 colours), ColourPairs (find 2 cards with matching colours), ColourFind (a memory game of finding matching cards), ColourPerudo (a bluffing and guessing game where players challenge each other until only one remains), ColourFamilies (a cooperative game of making 'families' of 5 related cards), ColourCry (race against each other to put matches cards on top of each other to empty your hand), ColourSnap (a 2-player game of collecting your opponent's cards),  ColourSpeed (quickly say the colour of the writing - based on the Stroop test).<br/><br/>",

Players explore on a mini-map, grinding away as they search for the set-piece encounters - large battles that make or break the players.<br/><br/>The game is set up in Acts, with each act being represented as a box of map tiles and encounters. Each act is meant to be played in a single sitting (1.5-2 hours), and then strung together into an epic 3-act story, concluding with a massive boss fight. That boss is defined by the earlier 3-acts and since the game features lots of different acts, there is lots of replay value.<br/><br/>During the game, players use a bag of tokens that represents their characters &quot;stats.&quot; When players use various abilities, instead of rolling dice to check for success, they will draw tokens from their bag and check the various icons and runes to see if they succeed. As players level-up, they will swap in ever-more-impressive tokens.<br/><br/>These token bags are also used by the heroes' enemies. Get set on fire? Put a fire token in your bag and you'll be on-fire until you draw it out. Get poisoned? Put 3 Poison tokens into your bag taking damage each time one comes out until you find a heal poison potion, etc...<br/><br/>To win the game, players must battle through 3 acts and then a mega boss.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The PanzerKampfL&auml;ufer IV-F &ldquo;JagdLoki&rdquo; is the latest Flak (anti-aircraft) walker in service in the Axis army. The very first vehicles are currently being field tested by the Neue Deutsche Afrikakorps Panzer units. Should these tests be successful (and they seem to be) the &quot;JagdLoki&quot; might soon be found all over the planet. Mounting four 3,7 cm guns this walker can send a hail of explosive shells in the air, literally shredding any airplane to pieces. The vehicle is presented here in its Babylon pattern camouflage, as observed around Mesopotamia circa 1947.<br/><br/>",

Replacing the famed Sd.Kfz. 251/9 half-track, with which it shared the nickname &lsquo;Stummel&rsquo; (Stump) for its short gun, this new vehicle takes it all to the next level by adding walker technology and the capability to carry a full section of infantry as well as a powerful gun. It can carry six soldiers inside its passenger compartment and another six between the hull and the Sch&uuml;rzen armored skirts.<br/><br/>The value of mechanized infantry has been proven numerous times since the war started. It is even more valuable in the desert environment in which the Neue Deutsches Afrikakorps fights - no one wants to cross a desert on foot!<br/><br/>",

The new equipment, as well as East German infantry, are being released as miniatures box sets with East German and Soviet data cards as appropriate.

Be the first to collect 4 of the same kind of nut and move them from your nut &quot;surplus&quot; (cards in your hand) to your winter &quot;stash&quot; (cards you play on the table). Easy right? Ahhhh, but you need to watch out! The sly fox, ravenous raccoon, sneaky squirrel and stinky skunk are all after your nuts too, and players might play one of these cards on their turn to take a nut from you (or your stash) OR make you lose your turn by switching the direction of play!<br/><br/>--description from the publisher:<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Genso Suikoden Card Stories is a collectible trading card game based on the Japanese role playing video game series, Genso Suikoden. The card game used characters encompassing virtually all of the main numbered titles in the video games with the exception of Suikoden V which did not appear in the cards at all. All of the cards as well as the rules are in Japanese only as the game has never been made available outside of Japan.<br/><br/>The game is a trading card game in which players draw cards from their respective decks and take turns playing cards onto the field. Each player uses a deck containing 50 cards. Before the game begins the players agree on a set number of VP (Victory Points) needed to win the game, the rule book suggesting 5 VP being the standard amount to win. Much like many other card games the game can also be won if the player's opponent cannot draw any more cards from their deck.<br/><br/>Players prepare their 50 card deck before the game and once prepared and turn order established, begin the game. Player's place Mission cards and attempt to fulfill the card's qualifications in order to acquire the VP gifted by the card, as marked on the card itself. The opposing player can also attempt to fulfill the cards qualifications, winning the VP for themselves.<br/><br/>Besides this, players can also attempt to construct Facilities cards. They are built in much the same way as Mission cards are played but do not provide VP. If the player succeeds in building the Facilities card they played, they gain the bonus granted by that card. If the opposing player wins, however, the Facilities card is considered to have been destroyed and no bonus is granted to either player. Character cards are used to either attack mission cards to earn the VP or to either build or destroy facilities depending on who played the Facilities card.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner, with control passing between each player at the end of each turn until one player meets one of the victory conditions listed above.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Excavate! is a game for 2-4 players. Each player takes on the role of a unique archeologist assigned to a fossil-rich pit that was recently discovered. Players will use their tactics to manipulate the board and attempt to create the most highly Acclaimed museum. As players continue the game, the play area will be changing as the players dig through the cards and find the sets needed to benefit them the most. The gameplay is about 30-45 minutes, and because of the simple rules, children as young as 8 years old can play it and be a competitor. However, this game offers a deep strategy level so even adults can compete. Easy to play, and very little luck is provided.<br/><br/>Overview of gameplay: players will take 5 actions each turn.  These actions can be any of the following: dig, move, display or sell. When a player takes a dig action, they take one of two adjacent cards to the piece and flip it face up on the other pile.  Any fave up cards can be interacted wroth by a player on their turn.  They can display it in their museum,  sell it for money,  or simply ignore it.  As players display various sets of fossils,  they will increase in the number of Acclaim points.  The player wit the most Acclaim points wins Excavate!<br/><br/>",

Each player has five Opinion Cards in their hand (Fantastic Thing, Good Thing, Who Cares, Bad Thing, and Terrible Thing). These cards are exactly the same for each player, and will be used to express how the players feel about certain topics in the Illustration Deck.<br/><br/>On your turn, as the active player, you will draw the top card from the Illustration Deck, and place it, face up, next to the Illustration Deck. Once the top Illustration Card has been revealed, you must decide which one of your five Opinion Cards best represents how you feel about the Illustration Card revealed. Whichever card you choose, place it secretly, face down, on the table in front of you.<br/><br/>Next, the inactive players attempt to decide which Opinion Card you chose to play, by selecting one of their five Opinion Cards, and placing it face down in front of them. Once all of the players have selected their &ldquo;vote&rdquo; and have placed their chosen Opinion Cards face down on the table, all of the chosen cards are revealed for scoring.<br/><br/>If no other players chose your opinion correctly, no one earns points. If at least one other player chose your opinion correctly, as the active player, you gain one point. If at least half of the other players chose correctly, you get two points. And if all of the other players chose correctly, you earn three points, as the active player. Inactive players who chose correctly gain one point.Using the Score Track, and the Player Tokens you and the inactive players adjust your scores accordingly.<br/><br/>Once scoring is complete, your turn is over, and play continues to the player on your left. This clockwise turn progression continues until one or more players reach 16 points. The first player(s) to reach 16 points wins the game. If the active player is involved in a tie for victory, they always win. Otherwise victory is shared.<br/><br/>",

Invent crazy adventures by picking random tokens and contest your opponents&rsquo; stories to make fun of their heroes!<br/><br/>At the start of a game, each players are given 2 origins and 2 superpowers. They each choose a combo of 1 origin, and 1 superpower.  They then one by one present their superhero to the other players by name, origin and superpower. It can either be very detailed, or simply naming the cards. This gives a feel about the game to new players.<br/><br/>Then supervillains are displayed face up on the table. On his turn, a player chooses a supervillain, and starts telling the story of how his superhero stopped him from accomplishing one of the two machiavellic plans displayed on the supervillain card.<br/>He puts his hands in the tokens bag, and pulls out randomly a number of tokens equal to the supervillain difficulty level. (1 to 3) and throws them on the table and turns the hourglass.  These token have random pictures on them, and the player must tell the story of how his superheroe stopped the supervillain mentionning his superpower, and his story must include all the randomly selected tokens. Other players may play one of their special tokens to add an additionnal random token to the story if they feel it's going to be too easy, and after the player finishes his story, they can also play special token to contest his story by either telling that it's the other players superhero who really did the job, and that this players version was not the truth, or that the superhero was beated by the supervillain and lost his encounter. To do so, they turn over the tokens to reveal new pictures, and tell their stories.<br/><br/>After that, player vote for the best story, and the winning player gets the supervillain card.  If the supervillain won, the cards goes back at the center of the table, and is available to be picked again by the players.<br/><br/>Once a player has gathered a given number of supervillains (depending on the number of players), he picks 3 cards from the retirement deck, and chooses one to play with one last story with the same rules above, but adding how this adventure ended his life a sa super hero and went into retirement.<br/><br/>Once a player retires, every other players also tell one last story the same way, then we count the difficulty values of the supervillains taken by each players. The one with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Ea Ea himself discovered 5-Y on a pentagonal board, which he called &quot;Star Y&quot; (stating the win condition as one wins by connecting three sides, not all of which are adjacent).  Odd-Y generalizes 3-Y and 5-Y further, to any hexagonal grid board with an odd numbered of sides.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Elemental Kings need more than generals, they need heroes &hellip; to die for their cause.<br/><br/>This game requires the following components from TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings &amp; TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos.<br/><br/>MONSTER DECK:    1<br/>STANDARD DECK (DECK):    1 for each player.<br/>LIFE:    20 for each player (default)<br/><br/>Monsters from the MONSTER DECK can be sourced from TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos, this expansion itself or a mix from both games.<br/><br/>The objective of this game scenario is to survive an onslaught from a group of monsters randomly configured and represented by a MONSTER DECK in a cooperative manner.<br/><br/>Players start the game by drawing the top card from their shuffled DECK and the highest number starts first. The drawn top card goes back to the bottom of the DECK. Henceforth, each player takes turns to be the starting player for each cycle of attacks against the monsters in a clockwise manner. Players draw 5 cards from their STANDARD DECK as CURRENT HAND.<br/><br/>During each turn, a specified number of monster cards are drawn from the MONSTER DECK and each player may attack them according to the rules as described in TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings. All attacks played automatically hits unless they are SOLO attacks that are LOWER than a game variable called the Strike Rate.<br/><br/>The Strike Rate refers to the minimum FACE VALUE of each solo card that needs to be used to remove a monster with 1 LIFE. Other categories of ATTACK HAND will automatically remove monsters according to the damage they deal. E.g. playing a TWINS can remove a monster with 2 LIFE or less automatically regardless of its FACE VALUE. Players may accumulate the damage of their attacks on 1 target but may not accumulate cards from multiple parties to form an ATTACK HAND.<br/><br/>Likewise, all attacks from any surviving monsters will hit automatically and the sum of all damage (based on the POWER of the monster) will be distributed evenly across all players (rounded up). E.g. 5 damage scored against 4 players means each player will suffer 2 damage. Players lose half (round down to the lower of) their remaining LIFE if they deck out and reshuffle for a new DECK. For every 10 POWER worth of monsters a player removes, his/her Strike Rate goes up by 1. When the Strike Rate is 10 for any player, SOLO attacks become ineffective.<br/><br/>The CHARGE BAR can be deployed for this game by increasing the deploying player&rsquo;s initial Strike Rate by 1, and once deployed lasts till the end of the game. All spell effects and monster special abilities (printed for TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos) are not used.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the monsters are killed or when all the players are eliminated. The player who eliminates the most monsters in terms of LIFE wins. When there is a tie, the accumulated POWER of the monsters removed will be considered and the higher accumulated POWER wins.<br/><br/>Other than this new semi-cooperative mode of play, TKG ARENA: Monster Mayhem offers an additional new set of 32 monsters to complement the existing 60 monsters found in TKG ARENA: Brethren of Chaos.<br/><br/>Let the mayhem begin!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A little blush, some lip color, and eyeshadow can perk up even an exhausted look and fill the wearer with confidence and social energy. Yet, makeup can be a complicated thing. Youtube is filled with Internet celebrities who give expert advice, magazines roll out new style guides practically monthly, and everyone has a different face, meaning something that works for one person might not work so well for the next. To give younger girls an introduction to makeup, as well as a few deeper lessons about true beauty, Decker Sisters presents Pretty Pro: The Exciting Makeover Race Game.<br/><br/>To play, each player picks a character from the four playing pieces: Lauren, Izzy, Lexie, and Zoe. These characters come with profile cards that give a little background to them. These do not have any affect on the gameplay; they just allow players to get a little more into the game by picking their favorites. Each has a favorite color, pet, and hobby. They also give tips, both in fashion (&ldquo;accessorize with scarves&rdquo;), beauty (&ldquo;always wear sunscreen when outside&rdquo;), and internal beauty, described as a PrettyHeart quality (&ldquo;always have a positive attitude&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Pretty Pro is a straightforward game suitable for younger players. On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves her or his character to a new square on the board. The goal is to land on each square necessary for the six components of a makeover: Lipstick, Blush, Eyeshadow, Brows, Earrings, and the PrettyHeart Tiara, which denotes inner beauty. The board also features stylish cities, where players draw cards. Some are good, such as &ldquo;You are always kind with your words and never say anything hurtful. Find the PrettyHeart Tiara.&rdquo; Others are not so good, &ldquo;You went to bed very late last night. Now you feel grouchy and look tired. Lose your next turn.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Facemask card. Players might be unlucky in landing on a Beauty Block square and missing out on something they need or gain the Facemask, which stops players from adding any new makeup. When a player lands on Beauty Block, she or he may move it to a new space, potentially keeping another player from getting the final square needed to win.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of Pretty Pro is the coloring sheets. The set comes with colored pencils and a pad for each character, and extras may be printed off the website. Through the game, whenever a player lands on a space she needs, the player may color in the makeup on the character&rsquo;s face. This is a great introduction into style, seeing what colors work, what is not enough, and what might be too much.<br/><br/>Pretty Pro is a game for two to four players aged six and up. It is a moderately long game, taking twenty to thirty minutes to play, depending on how quick and lucky the players are. With its randomized dice-rolling play and fun coloring sheets, younger players will enjoy it the most as they eagerly assemble the parts of their makeovers.<br/><br/>Which make-up artist will win the game?  Players use strategy, skill and luck as they race their friends to create the perfect look, but soon learn that inner beauty is needed before any makeover is complete.  Game cards reward kindness and cover fun topics including beauty and fashion tips.  Hurry to be the first to capture the PrettyHeart Tiara and finish the face to win this exciting makeover race!<br/> Ages 6+, 2-4 players, 15-20 minute play time, reading not required to play.<br/> Contents:  Game board, 52 card deck, coloring pencils, facemask, beauty block, PrettyHeart Tiara,  set of 4 make-up sketch pads, set of fun info cards, character playing pieces, stands, dice, instructions.<br/><br/>",

Your fleet of white-winged sailing ships are the collateral you utilize to develop and build your strategy, ensuring your victory against your merchant competitors.  Maritime portraitures of the 17th through 19th centuries give this deck builder a historic feel, and allow for a more intuitive notion of card/effect as play progresses.<br/><br/>Playing in similar fashion to Dominion, each player begins the game with a starter deck of ships (currency) and waterfront property (victory points).  Leveraging their Fleet cards, players determine the best cards and combos from 15 stacks of 25 available with which to best build up victory points until such time as one of several end game scenarios are triggered.  After a medium learning curve, a four player game should progress over the course of about 75 minutes.  Some game mechanics do allow for player vs. player attacks, but will depend on what stacks the randomizer brings onto the table.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most waterfront property and Trade Routes in your deck once the final round is played.  Any player may trigger the end game condition, but may want to consider what their opponents have been doing over the course of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each suit has a reference value with respect to the other suits (i.e., every suit is bigger than another suit). Each suit has 5 cards, and the bigger number cards have greater value. Aces are higher than 3, 4, and 5, but they are lower than 2. As there are 3 suits each with 5 cards, there are a total of 15 cards.<br/><br/>Each player start's each hand of the match with 7 cards. The remaining card remains hidden to both players. One player opens a round with a card which must be responded to by a card with the same suit. If suit respond cannot be made, then must be responded by the same number. The player which played the greater value card opens next round. If responding player does not have either same suit or number then the opening player is granted points according to how long the hand was (i.e. the number of the round played).<br/><br/>Jaque Quince was part of the 3rd Annual 18 Card Microgame Contest in 2016 and is planned to be published in some microgames compilations during 2017.<br/><br/>",

On your first day, you have been assigned to patrol a distant cave alongside other new recruits - It was supposed to be an easy mission. Alas , the moment your patrol enters the cave, the very entrance collapses in on itself, trapping everyone.<br/><br/>Suddenly, you hear someone cry out and everyone turns to look at a dead recruit. The enemy has infiltrated your ranks! Before he kills the entire patrol, you must somehow stop him. To make matters worse, you do not know what powers these other new faces possess. Attacking someone without fully understanding their powers could very well get you killed instead. Time is also running out for everyone. If the standoff lasts too long, food and air will be depleted and that's certainly not a good thing!<br/><br/>Welcome to The Pretenders.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>1) The game does not require a narrator (everyone plays!) nor does it run on a digital 'app' and no, it doesn't play for 1 game day (or night) only. It is a complete game that plays out across many days!<br/><br/>2) Players CAN defend themselves (phew for all the alpha/strong players who always get killed on the first 'voting' simply because they play the game well and other players fear them) Instead, there is a limited amount of 'defending cards' players can utilize to protect themselves. Gone are the days of helplessly getting killed without reason or a chance to defend.<br/><br/>3) Something else is also gone in this game, and we sure don't miss it. The days when you only have ONE single ability and you can only do that same thing again and again. In this game, you are powerful beings who have an entire arsenal of powers at your disposal. Imagine that - a whole range of powers that you can use! And each character has a different set of skills!<br/><br/>4) There is another result besides the good guys winning or the bad guys winning - it is entirely possible that EVERYONE LOSES! You are all stuck in a cave, with lack of food and air. If it plays out too long, everyone dies!! (except the robot dude who doesn't breathe)<br/><br/>5) Even after elimination, players play as Rescue Crew from outside of the cave and can still influence the outcome for their 'team' by deciding what items to throw into the cave as the days go by.<br/><br/>",

Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles on the Africa Front at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.<br/><br/>DS while utilizing &quot;Paths to Hell&quot; base rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:<br/>Sand Storm<br/>Battalion officers<br/>Recon rules<br/>Flamethrower tanks<br/>Motorcycle recon<br/>Rocky ground<br/>Gully<br/>And many other desert special terrains<br/>One 8'5 x 11&quot; chart with many overlays<br/><br/>DS has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.<br/><br/>Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.<br/><br/>Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase<br/><br/>The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other mopboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios. Each map hex represents a distance of approximately 150 to 200 metres.<br/><br/>",

The theme of the game is based on in-character rivalry between the Butchers Guild and the Imperial Orcs within the Live-Role Playing world of Empire by Profound Decisions.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to move their pieces (representing the Butchers and the Orcs respectively) in opposite directions along a track on the board, trying to get their own pieces from their opponent's base to the safety of their own base. Pieces are moved and taken if landed upon in a similar way to backgammon, however two key enhancements give it more depth than classic backgammon. Firstly, the middle section of the track is a dangerous no-man's-land where pieces cannot protect each other, forcing players to judge when best to risk making a run for it.  Secondly, each player has a leader which is at greater risk than other pieces, encouraging players to play tactically to protect their leaders and get them to safety.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Wizards Aren't Gentlemen harks back to a bygone age where masters of magical might, their feckless apprentices and their wily minions play their part in stories of arcane rivalries and eldritch farce. Feud for control of an army of fiends and goblins, seek to be the first to wake the Nameless Tortoise of Peng, and visit other planes in your search for arcane might.<br/><br/>Wizards Aren't Gentlemen is a storytelling card game designed to be played over the course of a single session, without needing any prior preparation. With the improvised storytelling of a roleplaying game and the pick-up-and-play nature of a card game, you can jump right into things and tell a great story together over the space of a few hours.<br/><br/>The deck includes 5 characters: the naive and heroic Apprentice, the wily and demonic Bound Servant, the ancient and wise Hermit, the hardened and perceptive Inquisitor, and the reckless and dangerous Fringe Occultist. Players each pick a character and customise them by choosing ability cards, relationships with the other characters, and cosmetic details (name, appearance, personality etc). Then the group drafts Goals and Assets for each character - these are the objectives they're trying to achieve, and the resources they have to try to do that.<br/><br/>Play then starts, with each player taking a turn to play through a short scene of their character working towards their goal while the other characters help, interfere, or push their own agendas. Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.<br/><br/>As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal. Once someone has completed all their goals, the game wraps up with an epilogue showing how things worked out for each character.<br/><br/>User Note: this item also has an RPG item entry: Wizards Aren't Gentlemen<br/><br/>",

This booster gave us another world (or pseudo-world, depending on how you look at it) to add to the universe of Spellfire.  This booster was mainly focused on attacking, and it did a good job of it!  This gave us the Underdark world (which is still argued whether it should truly be considered a world or just a characteristic), Quest spells (cleric spells castable only by champions of adjusted level 13+), and some of the funniest chase sets around (which was finally back to be 25 cards).  Landmark Cards: Under_____ realms; The Triumverate realms; Drow Justice (#21); Hornung's Guess (#37); Mindkiller (#56); The Unnamed, Avatar of Gruumsh (#64); The Avatar Shar (#72); Ellorelloran (#93); Ring of Gaxx (c#4); The Deep (c#5); The Sword and Helm of Garion (c#21); and Broken Arrow (c#24).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rec-League Quidditch is an exciting quidditch-themed tile-placement game with some elements of skill-building and risk analysis for two players.  During the game, each player will control three characters on a team.  These characters will compete for control of the quidditch pitch, using the quaffle, bludger, and snitch to score points, as well as continually improving their strength, speed, and skill to win the match.<br/><br/>Each round is played by placing the character tiles in a line on the pitch, in between tiles representing the three quidditch balls.  The location on the line,as well as the particular ball that each character is adjacent to will determine the possible action they can take for the round.  Once all characters have been placed, they are activated by either using adjacent ball tiles to score points, or using them to build up their strength, speed, or skill.<br/><br/>Furthermore, one character on each team will be the designated seeker, and will be hunting down the snitch.  Catching the snitch will take not only skill, but a little luck as well, so players would be wise to make sure they time their attempts to catch the snitch when it would only be to their advantage, and not their opponent's.<br/><br/>Catching the snitch awards a team 50 points, and the game is over after the round ends in which either the snitch is caught, or one team has scored at least 150 points total.  The winner is the team with the most points at the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "StrongSword is a slightly quirky but simple-to-learn set of rules designed for playing tabletop fantasy wargames.<br/><br/>Many fantasy wargames place in your command of a huge army divided into tactical units or just a handful of models acting independently of one another. StrongSword places you at the head of a mob of ferocious frothing fighters, be that a large or small mob of them!<br/><br/>The style of play is quite straightforward, but the real challenge is working out how to use the simple rules to command your warriors in battle as effectively as possible. This is because, although all of your models act independently from one another, your whole force is guided by the single tactic or &lsquo;Battle Stance&rsquo; you set each turn.<br/><br/>Your Battle Stance is a simple order that&rsquo;s either shouted by leaders over the tumult of battle, indicated by flag waving, horn blowing, or similar battlefield communication. It tells each of your warriors how to act this turn &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;ll be ordered to be defensive, or aggressive, stand back to catch their breath, or go completely nutty and charge at the nearest living enemy.<br/><br/>The key focus of commanding your warband in this arena of mob warfare is that you must choose the single Battle Stance that strengthens to your current situation &ndash; you can&rsquo;t go giving differing, complex orders to different warriors under your command because you&rsquo;re too busy fighting and simply don&rsquo;t have that luxury of time. Instead, shout your commands as loudly as you&rsquo;re able to and let your warriors do their best!<br/><br/>Combat and morale is kept pretty simple, as are the spells you can cast. This means that the game is driven by your Battle Stance choices, which presents players with the feeling of really commanding a smallish group of warriors on a low-tech battlefield.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Italia 1918 - A Farewell to Arms is an operational wargame which simulates the fierce fighting which pitted the troops of the Entente (Italy, France, Great-Britain and USA) against those of the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany) during the period between the Battle of Caporetto (Oct 1917) and the Villa Giusti Armistice (Nov 1918).<br/><br/>Two A1 maps, printed front and back, are included. The &ldquo;global&rdquo; one covers the terrain between the Adige River and Trieste, to allow the players to simulate the whole campaign from Caporetto onwards. The &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map, with enlarged hexes, covers the terrain from Adige to the Adriatic sea in order to concentrate on the main combat zone after the Italian retreat: the Piave River, the Monte Grappa Massif, the Asiago Plateau and the Trento area &amp; for the second one the zone of the Austro-German offensive on the Isonzo that has been immortalised under the name of the battle of Caporetto.<br/><br/>The 2 &frac12; countersheets include a complete OB for all the belligerents, from tenacious Italian &ldquo;Alpini&rdquo; to the redoutable German &ldquo;Alpenkorps&rdquo;, along with Austrian &ldquo;Kaiserj&auml;ger&rdquo;, Hungarian &ldquo;Honv&eacute;d&rdquo; divisions or French &ldquo;Chasseurs des Alpes&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Basic rules allow the players to tackle 6 variously sized scenarios, from 1 to 6 hours of play, using either a part of the board, or the map in its entirety. 5 of the scenarios are designed to be played on the &lsquo;zoom&rsquo; map, in order to take maximum advantage of the improved play experience provided by the larger hexes.<br/> In chronological order, the scenarios are:<br/><br/>        &ldquo;Thunder at Caporetto&rdquo; (4 turns/ portion of the &ldquo;global&rdquo; map) covers the offensive of von Below&rsquo;s XIV. Armee, which caused the collapse of the Italian IIa Armata and set in motion the retreat to the Piave.   <br/>        &ldquo;1st Piave: the stopping battle&rdquo; (3 turns / all of the &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map) simulates the last attacks launched jointly by AH and German units, before the Germans were withdrawn to the Western Front. These assaults were only contained by the fierce resistance of the Italian army on the Monte Grappa-Piave line, the last obstacle before the Venetian plain.   <br/>        &ldquo;Radetzky: Conrad&rsquo;s last gamble&rdquo; (1 turn/ half of the &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map) is a 1 turn scenario covering the offensive launched in the Asiago region in June 1918 by the former Imperial Chief of Staff Conrad von H&ouml;tzendorf, an offensive that was stopped by the joint efforts of Italian, French and British troops. This is the game&rsquo;s introductory scenario.  <br/>        &ldquo;Albrecht: Boroevic&rsquo;s missed opportunity&rdquo; (3 turns/ half of the &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map) simulates the offensive launched by Army Group Boroevic on the Piave at the same time as &ldquo;Radetzky&rdquo;.  <br/>       &ldquo;2nd Piave: The Battle of the Solstice&rdquo; combines &ldquo;Albrecht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Radetzky&rdquo; in a big 4 turn long scenario using the whole of the &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map. <br/>       &ldquo;3rd Piave: Revenge at Vittorio&rdquo; (4 turns/ whole &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; map) simulates the final Entente offensive which is now known as Battle of Vittorio-Veneto.<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>Advanced rules allow the players to simulate the whole campaign; they introduce the reconstruction of destroyed units, the management of strategic reserves and the use of random events cards (50 for each side) with various effects and evocative titles such as &ldquo;Rommel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hemingway&rdquo; or &ldquo;I ragazzi del 99&rdquo; (&ldquo;The boys of 99&rdquo;), for example.<br/> The campaign game is played on the &ldquo;global&rdquo; map, beginning with the Caporetto offensive and lasts 23 to 36 turns.<br/><br/><br/>Optional rules will allow players to explore several &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; possibilities.<br/> For those who do not know the system, the basic rules of Somme 1918 can be consulted while waiting for the online rules of Italia 1918, which will be similar but with some adaptations and novelties.<br/> &bull; Boxed game<br/>&bull; 2 A1 double-sided maps<br/>&bull; 1 A1 single-sided map<br/>&bull; 700 counters<br/>&bull; Rules booklet in english<br/>&bull; 24 pages campaign rules booklet in english<br/>&bull; 1 set of 100 event cards<br/>&bull; 2 A3 double-sided player aids [ Allied screen, Central powers screen ]<br/>&bull; 3 A4 single-sided player aids [ Strategic reserves for both sides &amp; other tracks ]<br/>&bull; 4 A4 double-sided player aids [ Scenario setups ]<br/>&bull; 2 A4 single-sided player aids [ Reinforcements &amp; Terrains ]<br/>&bull; 4 dice<br/><br/>(from Nuts Publishing website)<br/><br/>",

Weapons used in an attempt)<br/>Conspirator (Plot Card. Key Personnel involved)<br/>Venue (Plot Card. Exact Building or Location the Fuhrer is currently in)<br/>Locale (Plot Card. City or Region the Fuhrer is currently in) <br/>Save (Events that Prevent an assassination)<br/>Action (Events with Special effects)<br/><br/>To set-up the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards. <br/> Players take turns with each turn having 5 phases: <br/>1.  Fate Phase<br/>-   Draw 1 card from the deck and put it in your hand. <br/>2.  Plot Phase <br/>-   You may put 1 or more plot cards into play face up in front of you. <br/>-   A Complete Plot consists of 1 of each of the 4 different types of Plot Cards:  Method, Conspirator, Venue, Locale. <br/>3.  Foil Phase <br/>-   Any opponent may play (discard) 1 or more save cards. <br/>A save card causes the target indicated plot card to be discarded.  You may immediately play a plot card from your hand to replace the card eliminated by the save card. <br/>4.  Kill Phase<br/>-   If you have complete plot in play, roll 1 die for each of the 4 plot cards. (This is called the assassination attempt). <br/>For each odd number you roll, discard 1 plot card.  If all the rolls are even, the attempt is a success, you have killed Hitler, and you win the game.  <br/>5.  End Phase <br/>-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>If Hitler is not killed after the players have gone through the deck twice then Hitler survives, the German Resistance is crushed, and all the players lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a roll-and-move game reminiscent of Careers, but focused on finding a perfect balance among eight Values: Affection; Respect; Skill; Enlightenment; Influence; Wealth; Well-being; and Responsibility. The rules include a Leader's Guide for using the game in classrooms.<br/><br/>The board consists of an outer loop of 32 spaces and eight inward loops of 7 spaces each, one loop for each of the Values. When landing or passing by the entry to a loop, a player may choose to enter that loop.<br/><br/>Inner and outer tracks both have blue &quot;Enhancement&quot; and red &quot;Deprivation&quot; spaces, with the outer ring half and half, and the inner loops all 5:2 positive. The outer loop also has spaces where players take either &quot;Circumstance&quot; cards or &quot;Cruel, Cruel World&quot; cards, as well as Transaction Post spaces where players can trade points with each other. Both sets of cards have good and bad outcomes, and most result in &quot;universal&quot; point gains or losses, where the player may choose which value to change.<br/><br/>Each player has a thick scoreboard with pegs that all start at zero for each Value. The pegs move +/-1 for blue and red spaces on the outer ring, and +/-2 in the loops. The winner is the first player to achieve a balanced life by having the pegs in all eight values on his board line up vertically on the plus side of the scoreboard (all at +1, all at +2 or all at +3).<br/><br/>",

Players initially receive a random pack of cards that contains a character card and a set of four specific cards. One of them will be the Detective (saboteur) and the others will be Smugglers. In at most 6 rounds, players must then exchange their cards, in order to complete a set of five cards their character needs. They also can buy new ones from the central pile. The goal of the Smugglers is that some of them collects their 5 needed cards. The number of players that need to reach this goal varies by the number of participants. The objective of the Detective is to prevent this number of opponents from fulfilling their goals, for example by holding cards they need or by pushing foward unnecessary cards. In addition, the Detective may terminate the game earlier by stopping the match at any time when calling out and arresting  the player he believes to be the character Al Kane.<br/><br/>",

Larger scales can be used just as easily, from 10mm and 15mm, up to 1/72 scale.<br/><br/>These rules are based on the real-life accounts of actual combatants, largely from the books The Bear Went over the Mountain and The Other Side of the Mountain. Care has been taken to make the game feel like a Soviet-Afghan wargame; The Soviets may be able to take lots of tanks and helicopters, but when the enemy is ambushing from hidden positions on high ground, the tanks wont be able to target them and the helicopters wont even know where they are. Tanks will need to back off from areas of high ground in order to get a shot and helicopters will have to spot the hidden ambushers, or rely on information from the ground in order to work out where the Dushman (Enemy) are.<br/><br/>In the end this game is all about asymmetrical warfare and providing the feel and tactics of the period. The game naturally encourages real-life tactics and unit organizations (although example soviet organizations are also provided) and each faction has its own unique tactical choices and challenges to overcome.<br/><br/>Rules are provided for Infantry (both regular squads and specialist teams like spotters and heavy weapon teams), vehicles (from the humble transport truck to the various BTRs, BMPs, BMD and heavier armor of the soviets.) and helicopters. Vehicle and anti-vehicle rules have been streamlined to be as simple as possible and allow the focus to be on infantry. Rules for suppression, morale and infantry quality are all part of the package. Helicopters and vehicles can transport troops and helicopters can land and take off in-game, or be called in by spotters, provided there are enemy targets around...<br/><br/>Games take anywhere from an hour and a half to 2 hours for larger games and a variety of markers are provided with the rules for ease of play. A 6' X 4' or 4' X 4' table is recommended.<br/><br/>",

Black has the option to make a regular chess move, or take a card.<br/><br/>Take a card and let the fun begin.<br/><br/>With every turn, the players have an option to make a regulation chess move or take a card. If the King is in check, the player cannot take a card and must use the turn, to move the King to safety. A player can use any of the cards, he or she currently possesses, to aid in the King&rsquo;s safety.<br/><br/>The Castle-Mate cards are designed to appeal to Chess Players of any age and skill. The level of sophistication is really determined by the skill of the players. However, Castle-Mate adds an unpredictable element to the game: &ldquo;Luck of the Draw&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Selection of a particular card, at any given moment, can dramatically alter the outcome of the game. As in the regular game, Check-mate wins. Resignations, Stalemates and Draws are applicable, as stated by World Chess Federation rules. You can also win by drawing speciﬁc cards at the right moment.<br/><br/>",

We have all seen these cute creatures in the wild and our backyards, yet few know much about them. Finally, for the first time a board game has been created to simulate the life of a typical tree squirrel from nest born, to adulthood, and ultimately parenthood.<br/><br/>Full of humanizing and amusing nuances, both children and adults will enjoy many hours of fun and entertainment. With cleverly designed game rules, it also helps kids develop important social, math and negotiation skills that will benefit both their personal and professional lives for years to come.<br/><br/>The general objective of the game is to gather a certain number of food pieces (i.e. acorns, strawberries and pumpkins), as well as obtain five tail rings signifying squirrel life milestone achievements. The first squirrel/player to accomplish this wins.<br/>The minimum number of food pieces that needs to be acquired are:<br/><br/>     10 acorns <br/>     10 strawberries <br/>     10 pumpkins <br/><br/><br/>The milestone achievements that are represented by five tail rings are:<br/><br/>     2 nests (2 green tail rings)<br/>     2 litters of babies (2 pink tail rings)<br/>     1 hospital trip (1 yellow tail ring)<br/><br/><br/>Generally there is no special order of events except that your squirrel must have at least one nest before having babies. The yellow tail ring signifies that you made at least one hospital trip and proof that you received a rabies vaccination.<br/><br/>The food pieces for our Classic Version are made of cardboard, and for our Deluxe Version PVC injection molded.<br/><br/>",

The Slalom is a two-legged race where the fastest time on aggregate is the winner and the second leg is run in reverse order to the first.<br/><br/>Start of the Game<br/><br/>Shuffle the move and start cards and take the top start card and then 14 move cards. Any number from 0 to 9 of these 14 move cards may be discarded by playing them face downwards and incurring a small penalty of additions to the time of 0.01 secs for each card discarded. This decision to discard (or not)a number of move cards can only be made before the start and from the initial 14 cards dealt. The further  move cards which will be required may be taken from the top of the pack at anytime but all cards taken add one second each to the time whether played or not.<br/><br/>The run commences by playing one of the move cards and so as the first bend is a left hand turn just 2 spaces from the start then a black 2 followed by any black card will make the first turn a perfect one.<br/><br/>The time display board should be maintained after each move allowing for standard course time (marked on the race board), start-move-error-skill cards and the last decimal place is determined by the value of the move card last played.<br/><br/>After reaching the final turn line a player may cross the finishing line by playing any red card of value 2 or greater or a red 1 move card followed by any card.<br/><br/>Finish<br/><br/>After crossing the finishing line a check should be made of all cards in play to confirm the display time.<br/><br/>",

You've got seven time jumps to complete as many missions as possible, but watch out for paradoxes; if two or more Sarahs meet in the same time zone, everything about them will change in an instant and all your plans could go up in smoke.<br/><br/>In Sarah's Singularity, players select an assortment of time periods from prehistoric Pangea to ComicCon 2012 and establish a set of missions for each period. Stranded companions from far-ranging times are scattered among the chosen periods and each player gets a &quot;Sarah Card&quot; with special powers. Finally, players choose two secret objective cards for hidden endgame scoring and a Chronologist is selected from the gathered players.<br/><br/>Each round, Future Sarah visits a time period to strand another companion and the players simultaneously and secretly select a time period to jump to where they hope to solve a mission by matching icons on the mission card with icons on the stranded companion cards and the icons on their own hand of helpful companions. Typically, when the selected periods are revealed, they're resolved in chronological order. However, if two or more Sarahs (including the Future Sarah) land in the same time period, they paradox! Those player immediately turn in their Sarah Cards and get a new one at random, losing the special powers they may have planned to use to help solve the mission. The Chronologist then decides the order in which the paradoxing players gets to take their turns. The paradoxing player who goes last gets to be the new Chronologist.<br/><br/>Players claim solved missions as victory points. They also gain bonus points and a wild icon token for rescuing a stranded companion and hidden endgame points through their secret objective cards. After seven rounds, the points are tallied and a winner is announced.<br/><br/>",

It plays like a miniatures game, but it needs only a minimum of table space and can fit perfectly in your pocket. You assume the role of a Guild Master, scrambling to stake your claim on the valuable ore deposits of Agawan Island. You must build up your base, recruit your troops, and smash down your opponent's base before he does the same to you. This fast-paced strategy game distills concepts from miniatures games, collectible card games, and real-time strategy games into a quick and portable card game.<br/><br/>Battle for Agawan's streamlined game system is a card game that has no shuffling and a tactical combat game that has no board, no rulers, and no dice rolling. Instead, players can freely select cards from their own customized army pool of twenty Base and Character cards. Base cards build up your rate of production while Character cards are used for engaging in combat. Special Character abilities and stats, combined with a deterministic support-based combat system, encourage mixed forces and dynamic counterplay. Battle for Agawan uses neither grid-based maps nor measurement-based movement, instead abstracting the field of battle into four simple rows. This minimalism allows for extremely quick setup and portability while preserving the core tactical elements of movement, range, and positioning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's webpage:<br/><br/>Combat Leader: Poland 1939 is the newest release in the Combat Leader game series, covering the Polish campaign on September, 1939, with German and Polish troops.<br/><br/>The game comes with two maps (#9 and #10, rural and suburban terrain), two counter sheets (J &amp; K, which must be cut apart), two identical Reference Cards, and a 24-page rules booklet.  The rules contain all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, along with five scenarios.  This game sees the entry of the Poles into the system, and special rules cover the use of the 18-man Polish squad, with their characteristic weaponry (Kb wz.98a rifles, Browning wz. 1928 BAR LMG, etc.) and organization. The German SS also are introduced into the system (a full SS squad is included), with special rules governing their use on the battlefield. Overall, three German squads, two Polish squads--plus plenty of extra men to create different formations--are included.<br/><br/>The core rules have been expanded to include several options originally appearing in the Combat Leader: Expansion Module.  These rules are now  considered standard, and there is no need to buy that module.<br/><br/>Combat Leader: Poland is a complete, stand alone game. The core rules of the game system remain the same, plus additional optional rules have been included. So, Combat Leader: Poland 1939 provides you with not only a new nationality and the SS, but the most up-to-date edition of the series.  It is compatible with all other Combat Leader games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Combat Patrol: World War II is a set of rules for WWII miniatures skirmish game involving two or more players. Combat Patrol is an exciting set of rules that allows players to focus on the game instead of the rules.<br/><br/>Combat Patrol is a unique card-based miniatures game.  The unique Double Random Activation mechanism provides a streamlined method for activating units that provides the friction and drama of card-based systems with none of the drawbacks.<br/><br/>More importantly, Combat Patrol uses a card-based combat resolution mechanism that is exciting and simple while eliminating unsightly chart cards cluttering your beautiful gaming table.<br/><br/>In developing Combat Patrol(TM) I developed the G.A.M.E.R.(TM) &ldquo;engine.&rdquo;  Key features of the engine are:<br/><br/>&bull;The Double Random Activation(TM) mechanism provides the unpredictability and drama of card-based activation without the drawbacks. This activation mechanism was originally developed for Battles by GASLIGHT and was refined during the development of Look, Sarge, No Charts titles.  The mechanism uses cards for activation but ensures that multiple players are acting at the same time.<br/>&bull;No big yellow or pink chart cards cluttering up your beautiful gaming tables.  Each player needs one or two 3&Prime;x5&Prime; cards with the information about his units, including their weapons and equipment.   Other than those, there are no chart cards.  The back of these unit records includes the modifiers for hand-to-hand combat and terrain effects on movement.  After a game or two, players rarely need to refer to these, so two unit records can be taped back to back for even less clutter.<br/>&bull;Combat resolution is resolved by flipping cards.  Players read different sections of the cards in the Action Deck depending on what they are trying to do:  shooting, resolving hits, &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; to penetrate enemy vehicles, hand-to-hand combat, movement, and morale.  In development, I took a series of charts and then broke them apart to fit on an Action Deck of 50 cards.  Flipping a card is essentially the same as rolling a die and looking up the result on a table.  The difference is that you don&rsquo;t have to do all that table look up.  Flip a card and determine whether you got a hit.  If so, flip the next card to see which target figure was hit, how severely, and whether he is protected by cover.<br/>&bull;Cover is represented explicitly.  Instead of cover providing a negative modifier to hit, if you get a hit, when you flip the next card in the Action Deck, you look for cover icons.  If the target figure is in the type of cover indicated on the card, instead of being wounded or incapacitate he ducks back behind cover and is stunned.  While the use of cover as a to-hit modifier and the process in Combat Patrol(TM) can be mathematically equivalent, there is something intuitively appealing to knowing that the window sill deflected that round that would have otherwise hit your figure.  In play tests, this explicit representation of cover has made players make better use of cover while maneuvering their squads.<br/>&bull;Messy &ldquo;opportunity fire&rdquo; rules are replaced by a simple reaction mechanism.<br/>&bull;Somewhat randomized movement speeds based on the Guts level of the unit or its leader.<br/>&bull;The G.A.M.E.R.(TM) engine name is an acronym for the attributes which describe figures in Combat Patrol(TM): Guts (morale), Accuracy (shooting), Melee (hand-to-hand combat), Endurance (how many wounds a figure can take), and Reaction.  The game master can &ldquo;sculpt&rdquo; a unit to fit a historical scenario.<br/>&bull;Playable on multiple levels of resolution.  At the lowest level, all the figures in a unit have the same attributes.  At the highest level, each figure can have different attributes.  The levels of resolution can be mixed so that the Commando unit has more detail than the installation security personnel.  This allows games that have a historical feel as well as those with a more cinematic feel.<br/>&bull;Rules for replacements of personnel and equipment between scenarios enable players to represent mini-campaigns.<br/>&bull;Ground scale is 1 inch = 5 yards.  This is a good compromise ground scale between extreme range being 12 inches and the games resembling Agincourt and ranges that are in scale with the figures where short range covers the entire table.<br/>&bull;The basic rules are just eight pages -- and that includes several pictorial examples of firing and grenade resolution that fill almost a full page themselves!<br/><br/>Activation:<br/>  Combat Patrol(TM): WWII uses the Double Random(TM) Activation mechanism.  In Combat Patrol(TM), forces are divided into teams, which are typically half a squad.  At the beginning of each turn, players roll a six-sided die for each team.  This is referred to as the unit's command die.  Then cards are drawn from an Activation Deck.  The Activation Deck has cards numbers 1 to 6 in red, 1 to 6 in black, and a reshuffle card.  The cards are drawn from the Activation Deck.  When a card is drawn, all teams whose command die matches the drawn card activate.  In this way, many teams are activating at the same time, speeding up game play.  When all teams have gone, the next card is drawn.  When the reshuffle card is drawn, the turn ends.  The command dice are rerolled, and the Activation Deck is reshuffled.<br/><br/>Combat Resolution:<br/>  Combat resolution uses decks of cards, called Action Decks.

The Invader is the latest development of a long line of very efficient helicopter family that has been of great service to the Motherland. The SSU uses by far the largest number of helicopter, to transport troops, destroy vehicles and even other aircraft. The Invader combines the best of two functions: it transports a small group of Spetsnaz into battle and then stays on target to provide fire support.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This fun and social game accommodates any number of players, mixing elements of role-playing, sci-fi, and tabletop strategy. Each player designs a &ldquo;freejumper&rdquo; &ndash; a small, privately-owned multi-purpose, self-aware spaceship.<br/><br/>The players then have &ldquo;adventures&rdquo; as they search for valuable cargoes to beg borrow or steal, alien artifacts, wrecks to salvage, or get hired as mercenaries in a variety of roles. Like a role-playing character, your ship can &ldquo;learn&rdquo; and grow if your adventures are successful. You can purchase new software and systems for it, upgrade weapons and defenses, and perhaps eventually sell it and buy a larger and better ship altogether.<br/><br/>Along the way you will fight a variety of battles. Sometimes all of the players cooperate against a single threat. Sometimes the players divide into teams trying to complete tasks. And sometimes there is a free-for-all, as every freejumper is trying to get home with the most loot and goodies.<br/><br/>Each ship is controlled with a single small &ldquo;interface&rdquo; no bigger than a poker card, and a hand of &ldquo;system cards&rdquo; that represent the ship&rsquo;s various capabilities. Gameplay consists of playing cards to do various sorts of moves, attacks, and defenses, all the while trying to load up as much cargo as you can and get away without too much damage. A typical game lasts about one hour.<br/><br/>",

In 651 Aidan died - and the struggle for his succession begins.<br/><br/>In the game Lindisfarne 2 - 4 players try to become the new abbot of the monastery Lindisfarne. To this end, they have to win not only the support of their fellow-monks, but must also gain the favor of the king in order to expel the fellow-competitors.<br/>At the same time, the players plan their actions and the order in which they are executed. Pray, read the mass for a nobleman, support the expansion of the monastery, or let another monk work for you - with each of the actions the players get closer to their goal. It may also be helpful to slander the other players or hinder them in other ways.<br/><br/>In principle, each player has the same actions - but the acquisition and playing of cards results in additional possibilities.<br/>Lindisfarne is a game that combines a high degree of interaction and tactical consideration, and is therefore aimed at players, who play regularly.<br/><br/>",

Capture 3 of the opponents tiles<br/>OR,<br/>2. Move a triangle tile into a highlighted space on the opponents board edge<br/><br/>However, neither of these conditions are easy to achieve, as each turn a player may only move specific tiles as designated by the tokens drawn from their bag. In addition to this, the active player each turn will have the option to strategically 'swap' a token with the opposing player, changing the number of each type of token in both players bags, thus shifting the odds of being able to move certain tiles. AOX is a game of strategy, patience and balance.<br/><br/>Made entirely from laser-cut wood, AOX has a traditional and classy appearance. The gameplay and concept of AOX is very simple, though the level of strategic depth is great.<br/><br/>",

That's exactly what you do in Squeeze. In this two player card game you can either win if you max out one business niche (stuff, production, marketing) or if you prevent your opponent from doing this.<br/>                                                                                           With Squeeze you get:<br/>-Fast and arousing two player card game.<br/>-Simple rules but you need a sharp eye to master it.<br/>-A perfect lunch-break game, invites to an immediate revanche.<br/>-Family friendly and easy to carry (small cardbox)<br/><br/>After every quarter of the year (quick card duels) you have the opportunity to get business cards from the market with which you upgrade your business. How many depends on how much more lemonade you sold this quarter than your opponent. A business unit which has the most upgrades in the game - and that's what makes the game interesting - gives you a certain advantage.<br/><br/>But pay attention, not every business card can immediately upgrade your company. If you still sell your lemonade for 50 cents in the neighborhood you probably will not need the lemon squeezer ultra 9000 yet. If there is nothing in your interest you can let yourself cash out and use the money on later markets. It is quite important to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing because before you know it he &quot;strikes&quot; all your niches and wins the game. If the legal way doesn't work you can also get the black &quot;illegal cards&quot; from the market to gain mad advantages.<br/><br/>Squeeze is the kind of game you want to play in every lunch break. It takes around 10 minutes and invites to an immediate revanche. It is perfectly made for two players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Home of the Brave is a sociopolitical board game emphasizing the complexity of the world of modern U.S. politics. It's a 2-5 players tabletop game in which players will compete for influence, advance their professional position and gain powerful supporters. Driven by a story presented in a 18-page novella, the game creates a rich landscape where politics, media, social activism, business and criminal world mix. Home of the Brave is full of negotiation, blackmail, alliances and scandals.<br/><br/>The game takes place in rounds. Each round (except the first) starts with revealing a voting card (events) and voting for one of its two possible results. Then the players take turns doing actions (play a card, earn profit from previously played cards, advance on the path of bravery, etc.). When everyone has finished doing actions and has passed, the round ends - players draw new cards and reveal a new voting card. The primary player action is to play a card. Each character has their own deck of cards representing their typical behavior, acquaintances, and strengths. Each card has a cost (in resources) to play it, which is printed on the card. Skillful resource management and optimal card play is the key to victory in Home of the Brave.<br/><br/>A basic type of resource in the game is supporter cubes. They symbolize allies, voters, subordinates, or favors owed to a character. There are four types: Republicans, Democrats, Activists and Criminals.<br/><br/>Additional resource types are dollars and bravery points.<br/><br/>Players keep their own resources hidden behind screens so that opponents cannot see them. A player pays the cost of playing a card by paying the required resources from behind their screen to the bank. A player cannot play a given card if they do not have all the required resources.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to gain 4 (or more) stars before one&rsquo;s opponents. 2 stars can be gained by career advancement along the path of bravery, but each character also has many other ways to earn stars, mostly through their personal goal cards. Players will often have to prioritize between their career and private life.<br/><br/>",

When it&rsquo;s your turn, you can either throw a card of the same type or of the same color on the discard pile.<br/><br/>This sounds a little bit like UNO to you? Maybe you&rsquo;re right: But unlike UNO or any other game we know, every single card you throw to the pile is an &lsquo;Evil Action Card.&rsquo; And that is just where the real fun begins.<br/><br/>The &lsquo;Evil Action Cards&rsquo; are really, really evil: They hit hard and may change the whole game, and even effect yourself. This is fun and frustrating at the same time.<br/><br/>You can shield the action cards or even mirror them to other players.<br/><br/>Some cards can even be combined cleverly to be even more wicked. This is where the game gets a tactical flavor.<br/><br/>Some cards require immediate action. Be fast to strike. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll lose.<br/><br/>In addition to the hand cards, each player gets a set of three sharp weapon cards: sword, bomb and knife.

Their mission? Rescue the scientists and safely escort them back to the space shuttle.<br/><br/>The game uses a modular board and a random spawn system for the aliens so that no two games are the same. The dice based combat system utilizing rating and strength will force the player to make tactical and strategic decisions throughout the game. An experience system is used so that as the battle rages on, soldiers will learn and be able to modify results later in the game.<br/><br/>To win the game, successfully escort at least one of the scientists back to the space shuttle. If at any point all of the scientists or all of the soldiers are killed, then the game is over.<br/><br/>Pod People from Another Planet!<br/><br/>The human race realized long ago that in order to survive, it must leave its planet and populate the galaxy. The humans of the time understood that Earth wouldn&rsquo;t be around forever, and it would become uninhabitable long before it ceases to exist.<br/><br/>It had been nearly 800 years since the first branches of humanity reached for the stars. In that time, the human race had become fragmented as colonies were established along the way. One such fragment was scouting a new planet that long range scanners indicated would be suitable for colonization. Protocol dictates that identified planets must be scouted by research teams before any attempt at colonizing is initiated.<br/><br/>Research teams consist of various scientists who determine whether or not a planet is suitable for long term colonization and soldiers who protect the scientists from unknown danger. The soldiers have an important job, because scientists are valuable. Without the scientists, the expeditions to colonize new worlds would be halted, and training new scientists is a difficult task.<br/><br/>Research of this particular planet, coded P-37 while still being scouted, was promising. P-37 appeared to meet all the requirements to initiate the terraforming stage of colonization. One of these requirements being that the planet could not be already inhabited by conscious life.<br/><br/>While nearing the completion of the research stage of colonization, something went wrong &ndash; terribly wrong. Reports of ambush started to arrive from research teams around the planet. One by one, the teams were being wiped out.<br/><br/>Scientists began to identify the attacks as psionic in nature, having encountered other alien life forms over the past 800 years with similar abilities. Utilizing this knowledge, some scientists were able to barricade themselves behind a psionic force field while the brave soldiers guarding them sacrificed their lives to buy the scientists the time to complete the fortification.<br/><br/>The scientists knew the force field would only last a week &ndash; maybe two. They also knew their own value. Rescue teams would be coming for them, and when they were rescued, they planned to bring with them valuable information. They focused their research on the unknown aliens.<br/><br/>What they discovered was both fascinating and horrifying. The aliens, whom the scientists started to refer to as Pod People due to the pods they emerged from, were not themselves conscious beings. There was indeed a consciousness on P-37, but the scientists failed to identify it in their previous research. The consciousness was the planet itself. The Pod People were being spawned by the planet as an extension of its own consciousness in order to protect itself.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Your team of elite soldiers and others like it have been ordered to carry out rescue missions to bring these scientists home. You have been briefed on the knowledge related by the scientists on the surface and fitted with gear to help you fight the Pod People. You will land your space shuttle near the location of one of the barricades, locate the scientists, and escort them safely back to the shuttle in order to bring them home.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 'Barbers!', you and a partner face the Sunday rush as new barbers - giving customers all the cuts and shaves they need while preventing the pesky old barber of the neighborhood from stealing customers from right under your nose!<br/><br/>'Barbers!' is a dice-drafting, action selection game for 1 or 2 players. You and your partner play barbers, running a hair salon. There are three chairs in your salon, and a queue outside your shop!<br/><br/>Each chair is represented by a card, which has spaces to place cubes. The spaces designate the services for haircuts, sides and shaves. A deck of cards represents the customers. Each customer is unique, requiring different services - for example, a customer may need a haircut and side trim, another might need only a shave. Each of these service requirements are denoted by haircut, sides and shave icons on the customer cards. For the customer in a chair, you render these services by placing cubes on the cube placement spaces on the chair the customer is in. Each turn, if the chairs are unoccupied, a customer from the queue moves into a chair, and the queue is refilled to 3 customers from the customers deck.<br/><br/>In the 2-player game, each player alternates taking turns. On their turn, a player rolls three dice, chooses one of the dice and takes an action associated with the dice score. These actions let you render the three different types of services i.e. hair, sides or shave. The second player then chooses one of the remaining two dice, and takes the associated action. The third die is for the Old Barber action - he is the shrewd old barber from the neighborhood. His actions almost always are meant to steal customers from you. He has many tricks up his sleeve for that - from offering free tea and coffee to chatting up customers to eventually lure them away from your salon! The players can counter him by taking 'Customer Preservation Actions' instead of the service actions - these can be buying tea for the customers themselves or by taking the help of a local goon to keep the Old Barber at bay! The players need to plan their actions carefully lest the die left for the Old Barber lets him steal a high- value customer!<br/><br/>Players score points by &lsquo;completing customers&rsquo; i.e. by rendering all the required services. The customers claimed by the Old Barber through his actions earns him points. Sometimes, the players may need to work together to complete a customer to free up the chairs and move the queue forward - else the Old Barber may steal them!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins! If the Old Barber has most points, he wins.<br/><br/>In the solo game, the Old Barber challenges you to a &lsquo;hair-off&rsquo; or a hair-cutting duel in your own shop - and he plays as the second player. The rules remain the same with some slight changes.<br/><br/>Barbers! was created for the 2017 Mint Tin Design Contest, where it stood 7th in Best Overall Design category from 37 entries, and 2nd in Best Theme!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gank is what a MOBA video game looks like when you convert it for the tabletop with euro-design. You don't push around a hundred miniatures on a map with a hundred grid spaces. You don't see dozens of trooper miniatures scattered across the battlefield on the various lanes.<br/><br/>What you do see, are still the iconic 3 lanes that each leads to both your base and your opponent's. But these are very simplified and there are only 7 spaces on each of these lanes, which really act more as tracks. There are no actual soldier miniatures, but there is a frontline marker that represents the point at which each lane is being contested.<br/><br/>It is deceptively simple! You just play down 1 of 5 Heroes (each hero taking unique roles - Carry, DPS, Utility, Tank, Support) from your hand, pick action cards from a pyramid that represent what the hero does that turn, and finally cast skills and spells from that hero. It is then your opponent's turn. Rinse and repeat until either one of the lanes has all towers destroyed and gets overrun by the opposing side, or one of the teams' morale drops to zero from having too many hero deaths, or a team manages to collect all Celestium crystals first and win immediately.<br/><br/>To ensure this is the RIGHT game for you, do not go into it thinking that it is that simple or that it's a casual gateway game. Gank is intended for gamers who are already in the hobby for some time. This is a pretty HEAVY game in every sense of the word, and you have to watch for multiple things like which action cards NOT to take so the opponent does not have options opened up for them, what cards to deny them by picking those yourself (even if you don't really need them) and even looking for big combos between heroes!<br/><br/>As for Hero miniatures, you have an option to make your game even more beautiful and get 3D representatives of your Heroes, or you can simply choose to use the more affordable alternative where Heroes are just cards in your hand. In the event you have the luxury of the premium miniatures, they are no mere decorations. You will use the miniatures heavily during the game as representatives of the Heroes being played out, their sequence and order etc.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the full action of the battle is represented by a pyramid-shaped layout of cards that you and your opponents take turns to pick cards from - starting from the bottom row. There are 4 types of cards, namely Farming, Attacking, Pushing and Treasure cards. Depending on the role of the Hero played forth, you will also pick cards with different rulesets. For example, the Tank can only take 1 card but does not take any damage from Farming cards (which others normally do). The Carry allows you to take 1 card, and then 1 more directly above it (this makes your Carry the most powerful role since it can access the higher tier cards faster) or the Utility Hero which takes any 2 cards in the same row, as long as they are different types. Sometimes on the cards, there are Celestium crystals to be collected, or materials to be farmed (usually from Farming cards) where you can later combine with Item Recipes to create powerful equipment for your Heroes. Gold and Mana are also acquired from these very action cards.<br/><br/>Each Hero you play generally has 2 skills, one of which requires mana to perform. There is a 3rd 'Ultimate' skill that unlocks for them when they level up (there's only 2 levels in the game, so each Hero can only level up once)<br/><br/>The game is played in Rounds, with each ending when the top card on the pyramid is taken. At the end of each round, there is a Planning phase. Players will spend their Gold to manipulate the battlefield. Because buying of strategy cards are secretive, players will inevitably experience exciting mind games. Will they buy card A? Should you buy card B to prepare for a counter?<br/><br/>This game also features a 4 player mode of 2v2 where each player controls 4 heroes instead of 5, making it 8 heroes per team instead of the usual 5. The card pool is also larger by 5 cards per round, but all else stays the same and Gold, Materials and Crystals are shared in a team.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a far off world of Swords and Sorcery the cyclopean Tower of Ravingspire looms over a mystic battlefield. Mighty warriors of the realm, known as Reavers, sojourn to this desolate valley to battle for dominance in an annual combat known as the Reaverquest. These warriors must fight with all their skill and cunning, as the seeping magic of the Tower may alter the very battlefield they fight on at a moment&rsquo;s notice!<br/><br/>Reaverquest is a fast-paced card battle game of brawling and swordplay set in the Sword and Sorcery world of Ravingspire. For 2-3 Players.<br/><br/>Reaverquest consists of 30 Fight cards, 10 Rage cards, 9 Battlefield cards, and 3 Reaver Hero cards. Each Player chooses a specific Reaver to represent them in the combat, and uses that Hero card to track their health. Six of the ten Rage cards are randomly chosen and dealt into the deck of Fight cards, making the Rage dynamics of each game slightly different. The Battlefield cards are set aside as a separate deck near the gameplay area.<br/><br/>Each Player is dealt a hand of six cards from a communal Fight deck that contains various values of Attack, Riposte, and Deflect cards, all with values ranging from 1-10. The deck also contains six of the ten Rage cards, which have various effects in battle. This hand is then used to combat your opponent, with the goal of reducing your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. Health is known as Vigor, and is tracked by rotating your Hero card so your current value is facing you.<br/><br/>Each time a Player plays an ATTACK card a new Battle begins, and their opponent may DEFLECT the damage (partially blocking the Attack or sending the excess damage toward another Player), RIPOSTE the damage (partially blocking the Attack or returning the excess damage back toward the Attacker), or they may use one of the rare RAGE cards that have various effects. Ripostes may be countered back and forth until one of the Reavers takes damage, at which time that Battle ends.<br/><br/>Initiative for each Battle (including the decision of which Attack card to play and who to send it toward) goes to the Player who did not play the last card in the previous Battle. Sometimes it can be more advantageous to take damage from the current Battle rather than block it so as to claim Initiative for the next Battle!<br/><br/>If a defender ever uses a DEFLECT card to cause the value of the Battle to equal exactly zero, then they have performed a Perfect Parry. This kind of combat prowess so near the otherworldly Tower of Ravingspire causes a dimensional shift in the Battlefield. That defender draws a Battlefield card and benefits from the Perfect Parry effect listed in yellow on the card, which have various effects such as healing or drawing extra Fight cards. They then place that Battlefield card next to the gameplay area and all Players are now subject to the changes to the game listed in white on the card until that Battlefield is replaced. Where previously they may have been fighting in the Reaver Valley, where all Attack cards gain +1 value, suddenly they may find themselves battling within the Thief&rsquo;s Maze, where any Deflect cards may be played as Ripostes!<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of Rounds. A Round ends when no Player can play an Attack card, or one Player takes full damage from an Attack without defending in any way. When a Round ends any remaining cards in the Players&rsquo; hands are discarded, as are any persistent Rage card effects on their Reaver. A new hand of cards is dealt to each Player and a new Round begins. The Dealer for the new Round rotates counterclockwise, and the Player to the Dealer&rsquo;s left has Initiative at the beginning of the new Round.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of Reaverquest is to reduce your opponents&rsquo; Vigor to zero, forcing them to submit to your rule and allowing you to claim the title of Vorpal Reaver.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You and the other reformationists will meddle with each others' affairs, all the while aiming for victory by trying to achieve the as many meaningful results as you can, building your way towards the Reformation.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, create the action board by placing 12 tiles together in a ring. Each player will receive 5 cooperators and 1 disc. Each player's disc will be placed randomly on a tile on the action board.<br/><br/>The Luther player starts the game. The active player moves their disc to a tile of their choice that is 1-6 tiles ahead of their current location, moving clockwise.<br/><br/>If there are other players' discs stacked on top of your disc, keep those discs stacked on top as you move yours. If there are other players' discs below yours, leave those behind. If there is already other players' discs on your destination, stack your disc on top of the others.<br/><br/>After moving their disc, the active player must place 1 or 2 cooperators in their hand on the destination tile. Each tile has 3 cooperator spaces on which to place a cooperator. The active player can only place their cooperators on empty cooperator spaces on the destination tile.<br/><br/>During this time, if there is a cooperator placed on all of the cooperator spaces on that tile, an action will be performed. The player with the most cooperators on that tile will perform the action and is called the action player. The action player is not necessarily the active player.<br/><br/>There are 2 different actions printed on each tile. The action player is allowed to perform both of these actions 1 at a time in the order that they desire. They are also allowed to perform either of the actions or neither of the actions.<br/><br/>Each player who had a cooperator on the tile for which the action was performed can declare Hallelujah and receive 1 blessing counter each. The action player does not receive a blessing counter through Hallelujah.<br/><br/>If an action and Hallelujah were performed, all cooperators on the tile will be removed from the cooperator spaces and placed in the center of the game board. If neither was performed, the cooperators will be left on the tile. Either way, the next player becomes the active player.<br/><br/>However, players that do not own any cooperators can no longer become an active player in this round and will have their turn skipped. Also, if there are no players with a cooperator, and nobody can become an active player, the round ends right then.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, each player can return up to 3 of their own cooperators back to their hand. They can also return as many of their own cooperators placed on tiles as they please.<br/><br/>6 rounds are played in total. At the end of the 6th round, each player performs 1 action of their choice. Once everybody has performed their final action, the game ends, and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Two players, Black and White, alternate placing stones on the intersections of the grid until one player connects his two sides of the board and wins the game.<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/>A player wins when he forms a chain of his own stones which connect his two edges of the board. The chain can be connected orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>On a normal turn, a player places one stone of his own color on an empty intersection of the board. The stone must have orthogonal access to both of that player's board edges. That is, it must be possible to trace a route from that intersection to each of the player's own board edges without moving diagonally or passing through an opposite-colored stone.<br/><br/>If at the beginning of a player's turn any of his stones do not have access to both of that player's board edges, he must pick up all such stones and redeploy them. The stone(s) may be placed on any empty intersection(s) of the board where they have access. He does this instead of his normal placement.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Build your supply chain and your brand to become the leader in supply chain agility, but watch out: your competitors will do everything they can to stop you!<br/><br/>Emergent is a game about supply chain network strategy with game theory elements. The goal of Emergent is to build a network of Distribution Centers (DCs) to make the most money by satisfying customer demand by selling products from your DCs to nearby cities. The game ends after round 4, and the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>Each Round, all players use a strategic planning board to purchase distribution centers, stock them with inventory and invest in marketing. This is done secretly until all players are ready. At this point, each strategy is revealed and players execute the strategy by placing their distribution centers, marketing chips, and inventory onto the main board. The demand is then revealed for each city on the board.<br/><br/>Players are able to fulfill demand to each city based on their whether they are the market leader, closest shipper, or the only available inventory. Players then receive revenue and pay costs and the round ends.<br/><br/>Players continue playing for 4 rounds. The player with the most money by the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Emergent simulates strategic supply chain decisions that lead companies to real success in the marketplace. It punishes timid play and over-zealous strategies, leading people to react carefully to the strategies of competing companies.<br/><br/>",

It soon equipped all of the French fighter squadrons, served as a top British fighter for a year, and was even copied by the Germans! The &ldquo;sesquiplane&rdquo; design (a &ldquo;half&rdquo; lower wing) gave excellent climb and visibility, but was a weakness in stressful maneuvers. A favorite of aces, the Nieuport 17 was produced in France, Italy, and Russia and used by all Allied armies until late 1917.<br/><br/>Nieuport 17 (Baracca)<br/>Francesco Baracca was Italy&rsquo;s top ace of World War I, with 34 kills, several of them in this Nieuport 17. His &ldquo;prancing horse&rdquo; symbol was later adopted by Ferrari.<br/><br/>Nieuport 17 (Charles Nungesser)<br/>The flamboyant pilot, preferred Nieuports, even after his squadron switched to SPADs. He survived World War I as France&rsquo;s #3 scoring ace.<br/><br/>Nieuport 17 (Thaw/Lufbery)<br/>American volunteers and French officers fought side&ndash;by&ndash;side in the &ldquo;Escadrille Lafayette.&rdquo; Cards for two of them, Raoul Lufbery and Bill Thaw, are featured in this model.<br/><br/>",

Harness the power of your character's native element and use your native abilities to wreak havoc on your opponents!<br/><br/>Your Shield is comprised of three 'Lanes'. If any one of these Lanes is left unoccupied, you Adventurer will become vulnerable to direct hits. Keep them covered to stay alive. Some Adventurers start with only one Shield layer of element cards. Others start at the maximum of three Shield layers of element cards.<br/><br/>The Element deck is comprised of thirteen Elements, all with strengths and vices (relative to other Elements). Use these elements to form your Shield, and to strike other players' Shields. A pair of elements will allow you to use your Adventurer's Ability. If the pair is a native element of your Adventurer, then you may use your Adventurer's Native Ability. You may also double strike with a pair of element cards. You may also deflect strikes by discarding one of your native element cards.<br/><br/>Standard play has one player play as Death against the other three players. Death has four cards in their starting hand and two actions per turn while the other players have three cards in their starting hand and one action per turn. As players are eliminated, the other players playing against Death level up, first to utilize a 4-card hand and next to take two actions per turn. The last player standing wins the game and may become Death in the following game, if they wish to. A 2-player game has both players starting with the same 4-card hand and two action turn.<br/><br/>",

His paranoia has grown worse over the years and he is building an army of robots to subjugate the good citizens of Paradise City.<br/><br/>Only the people can stop the mad king, but they need inspiration to do so.

Or you can play to the Undead and crank your amps up to eleven! Your fans become your followers, whom you can then lead in the revolution against King Richard and his robot army.<br/><br/>Monster Rock can be played by up to five music fans, competitively or cooperatively.

Warfare is extremely limited and somewhat restricted, as it was historically.<br/><br/>During a turn a player collects resources from their territories, play cards, and pays their armies. Every card grants an amount of activation points which are used for activating armies, building new colonies, adding population to colonies, and raising new armies and fleets.<br/><br/>If a player controls 10 city-state areas, he automatically wins.<br/>Otherwise at the end of the game (when the last card is drawn from the deck) every city-state area, colony, and resource point are accounted.

Set the remaining cards between all players, face down, as the game deck. Directly beside the deck shall be a singular discard pile. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.<br/><br/>For every turn, the player draws up to 6 cards (the hand limit) and plays 1 card face-up into his or her personal &quot;food stash&quot; (a double decker set of 10 card slots) on the playing surface. If the player has more than one of the same food in-hand, he or she may play any or all of them during a single turn- the only way to play multiple cards in a turn. Cards may not be picked up from the discard pile.<br/><br/>When a card is played, if an opponent has the food item in his or her stash, that player must discard 1 of them. For example, if a player puts the &quot;Pizza&quot; card into his or her stash, any opponent who has that card must discard it.<br/><br/>If the game deck exhausts at any point, shuffle and reuse the discard pile. Play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>The first player to create a full food stash of 10 cards, in total, wins!<br/><br/>",

It is a turn-based game for two players (or teams) which continues until one side has completely destroyed the forces of the other (or otherwise completed an objective as set out in a given scenario). This book is intended to provide the basic rules for land-based armored combat. It also provides building instructions and game stats for many of the most commonly used armored vehicles of WWII.<br/><br/>Future expansions of the Micro Brick Battle system will include aerial combat, additional armored vehicles, and Campaign Modules for specific historic battles. We also plan to host Micro Brick Battle tournaments at events around the country starting in mid-2017. This will coincide with the release of our companion card game Bricks of War, now in development process.<br/><br/>Aside from the basic game rules, the bulk of this book is devoted to building instructions for the basic game piece models. This includes a short section with tips for acquiring the necessary LEGO pieces and building tips to help you complete your models. The composition of your Micro Brick Battle armies are completely up to you; whether you want to recreate historic battles or build an armored juggernaut of your own design. Brickmania will be releasing various game piece mini kits which will be compatible with the Micro Brick Battle system. These will have the added bonus of including the corresponding Bricks of War card, which will be necessary for use in the official tournament play.<br/><br/>This book includes instructions to build game piece models for 44 different armored vehicle from WWII.<br/><br/>This book includes instructions for building the following armored vehicles:<br/><br/>France:<br/>Renault Ft-17<br/>Renault R35<br/>Char B1 Bis<br/>Sumoa S35<br/>Sumoa S40 (SPG)<br/><br/>Japan:<br/>Type 95<br/>Type 97<br/>Type 4 Ho-Ro (SPG)<br/><br/>Germany:<br/>Panzer II<br/>Panzer II Luchs<br/>Panzer III<br/>Panzer IV<br/>Panzer 38(t)<br/>Tiger I<br/>Panther<br/>StuG III<br/>Wespe (SPG)<br/><br/>Great Britain:<br/>M3 Grant<br/>Churchill<br/>Firefly<br/>Matilda II<br/>Valentine<br/>Cromwell<br/>Archer<br/>Sexton (SPG)<br/><br/>Italy:<br/>Carro Armato L3/35<br/>Carro Armato P40<br/>Semovente da 90/53 (SPG)<br/>Semovente da 75/18 (SPG)<br/>Semovente da 105/25 (SPG)<br/><br/>Soviet Union<br/>BT-7<br/>T-34/76<br/>KV-1<br/>Su-76 (SPG)<br/>Su-152 (SPG)<br/>Kv-2 (SPG)<br/><br/>United States<br/>M3 Stuart<br/>M5 Stuart<br/>M3 Lee<br/>M4 Sherman<br/>M26 Pershing<br/>M10 Wolverine<br/>M18 Hellcat<br/>M7 Priest<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Utility is a card game played with small, square cards. Each player starts with a utility plant card, a house card, and a plain road card connecting the two. The utility plant and the house each have three utilities coming from them: gas, water, and electricity. The goal of the game is to be the first player to use utility tile cards (which each have segments of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires) to connect each of the utilities from the utility plant to the house.<br/><br/>Each utility card has a unique combination of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires, so players must use spatial organization skills, puzzle solving ability, and strategic planning to ensure completion of their system before their opponent.<br/><br/>The game is generally played with 2 players, but it can be played solo if desired. With two copies of the game, up to 4 players can play.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Setup: Each player begins with a utility plant card and a house card, connected by a plain road. The remaining cards are shuffled and placed face down in a stack.<br/> Objective: The goal of the game is to either be the first player to connect all three utilities (gas, water, and electricity) from their utility plant to their house OR to have fewer tiles placed than the opponent when the deck runs out of cards.<br/> Gameplay: Three cards are drawn off the top of the deck and placed face up in front of the deck. Players take turns choosing one of these cards and either adding it to their utilities OR replacing a previously-played card. When replacing cards, the card replaced becomes one of the three cards in front of the deck. When playing a new card, a card off the top of the deck is drawn to become one of the face-up cards in front of the deck. Cards may be placed adjacent to any card in play. Cards with roads can (but are not required to) be played on top of the starting road card.<br/><br/>Connecting Utilities: Utilities do not have to align when placing a new card. In order to win, there must be a complete path from the utility plant to the house for all three utilities, and branches/alternative paths may remain unfinished. Water and gas align at the edges of the cards, and electricity aligns at the corners.<br/><br/>Ending the game: The game ends when one player connects all three utilities from the utility plant to the house (that player is the winner) or when the last face-down card is drawn from the deck, in which case players count their utility cards and the player who has fewer cards in play wins.<br/><br/>",

Hiding in the crowds, the hitman must work to find the opportune time to hit the Target. The hitman has an arsenal of guns, bombs, and poison to attempt to get the target, but one false move and it is game over!<br/><br/>The game is setup by laying out 25 cards in a 5x5 grid that makes the town. The Target starts at a random location, but he moves throughout the night. With proper intel and planning, the hitman looks to get the upper hand and strike the Target at the right moment. But even with the Target right under his nose, if the hitman strikes at the wrong time the heat can be on him in an instant.<br/><br/>The hitman only gets so many turns, until the Target will escape to the Helipad. During that time period, the Alert Level gets higher causing the cops and crooks to move further attempting to find and corner the hitman.<br/><br/>Die Hitman plays in less than 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Die Hitman contains:<br/>25 Location cards<br/>19 Target cards<br/>5 Tool cards<br/>2 Player Aides<br/>Dice and counters.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the plantations, swamps, and cities, rumours abound of grotesque rituals, hooded figures, and bizarre creatures. Most terrifying of all, however, are the whispers of ancient magic - unspeakable arcane rituals and occult powers that can lead those who wield them towards mystical supremacy... or reduce them to gibbering wrecks.<br/><br/>This new supplement for Dracula's America: Shadows of the West introduces two new factions: the corrupt cultists of the Church of Dagon and the Salem Sisterhood, occult practitioners whose history dates back to the early Colonies. New stealth rules allow for all manner of sneaky and underhanded tactics, while expanded rules for arcane powers offer glory but could cost you your sanity. Alongside these are a host of new scenarios, Hired Guns, monsters, skills, and gear to challenge or assist those who dare venture into the Deep South of Dracula's America.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;After centuries of never-ending wars, the dark magic of Faer has taken hold of the lands of Euthia. One of the most powerful mages, the mighty Rasgaroth, had succumbed to this darkness. He was leeching away the energy of all living things wherever he appeared. As his power grew, Euthia was in danger of being engulfed by this evil. The mages of the order of Vis forged a secret union to deter this looming threat. After many years of studying ancient tomes of forbidden knowledge, they eventually found a way to awaken mighty dragons, control them and with their help to defeat Rasgaroth and his minions. The mages were successful - Rasgaroth was torn to pieces by dragons and his fortress, Arakius, was reduced to ashes. The wars were over. But some of these mages thrived for even greater power and tried to use the mighty dragons for goals of their own. However, their magic was not powerful enough to control the dragons forever. Dragons eventually broke free of their masters control and ripped them apart. The order of Vis was brought to an end. The retribution of the dragons was about to begin...&quot;<br/><br/>Legends of Euthia is a strategic competitive role-playing game set in a medieval fantasy world. The land of Euthia is threatened by powerful dragons who, with powerful elementals, destroy one village after another and the dragons themselves seek to destroy the last hope - the Church of St. Michael. Become one of the four heroes: the priestess of light, &Aacute;el; the unstoppable warrior, Dral; the cunning and wild rogue, Keleia; or the fire mage Maeldur. Protect the remaining villages, the church and kill all three dragons. As one of these heroes, you will have unique abilities and various strategies. Explore Euthia and fight dangerous monsters controlled by other players who try to kill you with various monster cards. Get loot and rewards from victorious battles and you mine resources at specific places on the map. With these resources and loot, you can buy equipment and new skills from the markets. During the game all heroes gain reputation for fighting dragons, monsters or elementals, for liberating various places of trade and locations with rare resources, but also for conquering and gemstone mining. The winner is the player with the most reputations points.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Players choose whether they want to play the basic game or the champions version for more of a challenge. Each player selects a hero and prepares the specific hero board. Then the other boards are prepared; the game board where reputation points and rounds are counted; the trade board with specific market offers and the combat board with monster cards and elemental cards. After that the starting tile with the church is placed in the middle of the playing area (where the heroes start their adventure). Other tiles are sorted by chapters; separate chapters are shuffled and then sorted into the correct chapter order. Each player rolls two dice, and the one with the highest amount begins the game.<br/><br/>Course of the game:<br/>Players take turns in a clockwise direction. Each turn, a player can use action tokens to carry out different strategies. They try to get as many reputation points, golden coins and other accessories (monster ability cards, potions and Gaars, used for re-rolling) as possible by using these tokens. By gaining reputation, heroes unlock new abilities which can be learned by paying gold coins. Heroes can also buy new equipment and heal wounds inflicted in combat. In mountains, lakes and caves, heroes can mine rare raw resources to get more gold and reputation points. During specific turns, elemental monsters begin their invasion of Euthia and must be destroyed by the heroes to protect places of trade and the portals of Euthia. If the elementals are not killed by a certain round, the place is destroyed and reduced to a common piece of land (mountains, lakes, caves). During a dragon attack, all heroes are teleported back to the church, healed and then encounter the dragon. They do not help each other during the attack but try to inflict as much damage to the dragon individually, because when the dragon is eventually slain, the reputation points are distributed to heroes according to the damage caused. The hero dealing the most damage also gets a special reward.<br/><br/><br/>    Movement &ndash; Movement is carried out on the map by using action tokens, equipped boots, jewelry, special abilities or portals. The combat action token can be used for a combat action or 3 movement points, the trade action token can also be additionally used as 2 movement points, and the mining action token can be also used as a one movement point. Moving to an adjacent map tile costs one movement point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Map exploration - new map tiles are placed on the board when a hero moves to an edge of the explored area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Fighting monsters - by entering a monster map tile the player must use a combat action. The encountered monster is controlled by the player sitting on the right or a different player can take over the monster by playing a monster ability card - Mind control or Magical mind control. It is not possible to run from combat and the first player to attack is the player controlling the monster. He or she rolls 2 dice and determines the attack strength according to the monster cards and monster ability cards used. The dice can be re-rolled using Gaars which come in a limited amount for both heroes and monsters. Next, the player controlling the hero chooses an ability they want to use to attack, rolls 2 dice and determines the attack power or eventually multiple abilities can be combined. These phases repeat until either the hero or the monster dies. After slaying a monster, the hero is rewarded with reputation points, corresponding number of monster ability cards and loot from the map tile. If a hero dies the player controlling the hero gives their token to the player who controlled the monster. For this token, the monster-controlling player gains 2 reputation points and the hero-controlling player loses 2 reputation points at the end of the game. The slain hero is revived in the church and is given 4 Gaar tokens by the priests, a specific number of monster ability cards depending on the turn they were killed in and then they can get back in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Trade - by entering a tile with one of the three places of trade and using the trade action token, a hero can spend any gold coins they have to get equipment, healing, new abilities, potions and Gaars. It is also possible to sell items or, just once per encounter, to refresh all things being offered by the vendor. Each place offers different things to buy. If a hero liberates a place of trade from enemies, they are paid one gold coin by other heroes using this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mining - A hero can use the mining action on places designated for the action (mountains, lakes, caves) to get a piece of raw resource which can be traded for gold and reputation points. Each hero can mine each tile only once per game. If you perform the mining action on a tile occupied by a different hero, you pay one gold coin to each hero who has their hero token on the tile. Then you also place your hero token on that tile.<br/><br/><br/>Milestones:<br/>You do not have to start a new game from the first round over and over again. You can decide to start your new game from a milestone. Setup the regular game with few modifications. Start the game from a different map tile chapter, you have some reputation points right from the start (meaning some hero abilities are unlocked) and gold that can be traded for items and vendor services even before the game starts.<br/><br/>You can also agree that the game will be concluded sooner than the 24th round.<br/><br/>Game for champions:<br/>The champions version is prepared in the same way as the regular game, but the game board, the trade board and the hero boards must be turned with the goblet-icon up. Additionally, quest cards are used in the champions version. The course of the game is the same as in the regular game with the exception that no events take place, apart from the fight with the dragon Brasath in the 21st round.<br/><br/>Compared to the regular game, there are numbers in the gold coin symbol next to the picture of the trade points on the trade board for the champions version. During their Trade action, a player may place their hero token on this tile to claim it if they spend the amount stated. Some hero boards already contain basic equipment.<br/><br/>Unlike the regular game, there are quests in the champions version. If a player is successful in completing these quests they are rewarded with reputation and gold. The quest cards are divided into three levels.<br/><br/>Ending the game:<br/>The game ends in a predetermined round or if players do not defend the church against one of the dragons. At the end of the game, reputation points are awarded for claimed locations on the map, the loot and the hero tokens that the players got by killing other heroes when controlling monsters. The player with the highest number of reputation points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Transform a standard deck of playing cards into an immersive game of two-player baseball in Hardball Shuffle.<br/><br/>Both players draw rosters of ten cards from the deck. Each card represents a ballplayer on the team, with the ballplayer's relative skill determined by the value of the card. Select one card from each roster as the pitcher, and fashion the rest into a batting order.<br/><br/>As the game begins, batters secure a hit if their card is worth more than that of the pitcher. The bigger the differential, the more bases a batter achieves. Conversely, if the batter's card value is lower than the pitcher, they are out. The standard rules of baseball apply, with three outs to a half inning and the victor is the player with more runs at game end.<br/><br/>Understanding several wrinkles is key to a winning strategy. From the batting team's perspective, a batter automatically strikes out no matter the batting card's value if they share the pitcher's suit. On the other hand, batters become incrementally more powerful if they share the same suit as any teammates already on base. And base runners sharing the same value as the batter automatically steal a base.<br/><br/>For their part, the fielding team must adjust for the fact that their pitcher's card is limited to a maximum value of 10, even if it is a face card. Furthermore, pitchers become fatigued over time, with a pitching card's effective value declining by one for every inning pitched. To mitigate this, a new pitcher may be selected out of a player's batting lineup between innings, with that hole in the order replaced from the minor leagues (drawn from the deck).<br/><br/>Lest the innings start to blur together, a team's lineup is far from static. Each player demotes a batter to the minor leagues at the end of every inning, selecting from among a handful of minor league call-ups to fill the void. It is never too late for a last-minute comeback!<br/><br/>",

After each round players can disrupt their opponents future flight plans by rolling dice to activate Stealin Steve the squirrel and Patch the pit-bull.<br/><br/>Stealin Steve takes a resource from the location and any bird present, hording them in his nest. Patch blocks locations preventing birds from buying habitats or gathering resources. Birdies beware your opponents will soon be able to do the same to you when it is their turn to roll the dice.

Weapon Teams like the AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher, NSV heavy machine gun, 'fagot' anti-tank missile and mortars are also covered.<br/><br/>Rules for vehicles cover the BTR-80, BMP-1 / BMP-2, ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 2K22 Tunguska, T-72 / T-80 and MT-LB.<br/><br/>While the basis of this game is kept simple (No markers or tokens needed!), extended rules are provided for players to introduce more detail.

        "description": "The game can be crudely described as Monopoly meets Scrabble. The premise is based on property development, but tile placement and scoring is similar to Scrabble.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of tiles, set up on a tile stand. Each player in turn has the opportunity of placing tiles on the board alongside and tiles already on the board. Each tile placed on the board automatically makes a row (or &quot;street&quot;) longer. At the very least a new street consisting of two tiles is formed when a new tile is laid.<br/><br/>Whenever a player so manages to lengthen a street by placing a new tile on the board, he scores the new total arithmetical value of the street, for as far as it extends in a straight unbroken line. Each successive tile added on to a given street will score more and more as the street increases in length and value.<br/><br/>Tiles must be matched to the board by color and number as a general rule, but there are a number of &quot;joker&quot; tiles that do not conform to this.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player achieves 1000 (2 player), 800 (3 player) or 650 points (4 player).<br/><br/>",

It features elements of hand/resource management, take-that, variable player powers plus randomization which ensures it cannot be played the same way twice.<br/><br/>Players must work by shipping goods and trading with each other to earn enough money to buy the supplies they need to reach each location.<br/><br/>Once a player has the necessary supplies and holds one of the 28 map locations, they can move to the investigate phase.<br/><br/>Each location is always a mystery. There could be someone in hiding, holding a set of blueprints, or a shady character you will have to deal with. It may also contain a mystery crate with unknown contents..<br/><br/>Mystery crates however are padlocked, and can only be opened with a skeleton key. They may contain missing components of the Time Machine or unusual artifacts which will convey positive or negative effects onto the player, or everyone else.<br/><br/>At one of the locations, Professor Ravenwood has been locked away. When he is found, the identity of the mole can be revealed, which is one of the players chosen secretly at random at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>With their cover blown, that player now becomes a Saboteur, receiving a unique deck of instruction cards, and whose mission is to subvert the search and recover as many of the missing blueprints and components before the others.<br/><br/>Players share the win or loss against the Saboteur, however each is also out for their share of the reward, so the person who contributes the most to the search will gain the victory points and be declared the winner.<br/><br/>If the Saboteur wins, all is lost. Professor Ravenwood's Time Machine must not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RallyBird Baseball (also known as RallyByrd Baseball) is a 1-hour board game that Peter Gelman designed to emphasize quick turns, easy of play, yet meaningful baseball decisions for both offense and defense.<br/><br/>Here's the general idea of play: Offense chooses a tactic from the set of At Bat cards and places it face down. Then Defense arranged the 6 Glove tiles in their zones on the board. Offense reveals the card, showing the tactic and what zone or zones it tests. Offense rolls 2 six-sided dice and compares the sum of the dice to the sum of the relevant Glove zones. The dice result is either less than, equal to, or more than the sum of the Glove zones. The players apply the At Bat card's  result to the batter and base runners.<br/><br/>The game board is 18-inches square. The tiles, made of laser-cut pressboard, are 2-inches square. These tiles include Defense's Glove tiles, Inning tiles to keep time, and Run tiles for keeping score. The 17 At Bat cards are poker sized. There are 4 red and 4 blue large wooden meeple tokens, and 2 yellow Out tokens as well.<br/><br/>The Rally Bird itself, also a tile, is a popular and recommended optional rule that gives the 9th inning underdog an extra chance... extra chances continue if the underdog succeeds, as long as they succeed. In baseball terms, it's a rally. If Home follows Visitor as a 9th inning underdog, both sides will have the opportunity to find inspiration in the birds who visit the field.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The play surface is suggested as 3' x 3', with at least some indication of terrain.  The game assumes figures will be used to denote participating units.  Ranges are given in inches and play assumes the use of a tape measure.  Resolution requires a D6 and a D8.  The game rules primarily deal with fire and movement (as you would expect).  The default starting situation finds two opposing teams (&quot;posse&quot;) of six fighters each.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds; during each round each participant takes a turn.  Turns are executed in specified order and effects take place immediately.  Units utilize a simple facing mechanic and gain benefits depending on type.  Some complicating rules (e.g., &quot;town folk&quot;) are optional.  The rules are presented as a single, color PDF document - included are the rules, optional rules, and twelve scenarios (eleven are standard westerns; one is a weird western (zombies).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Three symptom (green) cards are laid out in the center of the playing area face-up. The players agree on a famous real or fictional person who fits the &quot;patient profile&quot;.<br/><br/>Players scan over the flower cards and turn over 1, 2, or 3 cards that their eyes land on first. Each player turns over his or her own cards. Read the separate cards and pick one that relates to the symptom or symptoms, explaining to the other players how this addresses the symptom. Each player in turn plays one flower card that best addresses the symptom or symptoms, explaining how this applies. Players scan over the remaining cards in front of them and pick those they wish to turn over. Repeat these steps until all the cards that each player wants to introduce have been played.<br/><br/>Discuss which of the flower essence cards introduced into play by the players best fit the symptoms. Refer to the Flower Essence Repertory as needed. There may be more than one right answer. The goal is to agree on up to 5 essences for the perfect blend to fit the patient's symptoms.<br/><br/>Items required<br/><br/>&bull; One deck of Affirm a Flower affirmation cards (published by FES)<br/><br/>&bull; One deck of Green Apple cards from the game Apples to Apples&reg;<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Example of play:  If Marilyn Monroe is considered to be the &quot;patient&quot;, the following might happen when the flower cards are examined.

I am this Shining Star.&quot; The second player played &quot;Dogwood&quot; which says &quot;My body is healed by flowing grace. I release what has become hardened. This gentle purity fills body and soul. I feel the blessing of grace-filled life.&quot; It was determined that either flower card would help address the life challenges of Marilyn Monroe, and both players were considered to have right answers.<br/><br/>There are also solitaire and advanced versions of this game.<br/><br/>",

Attacking units have an &quot;accuracy&quot; value which must beat the defender's &quot;hitability&quot; value - in which case, hits are automatic.  Damage is randomly rolled.

        "description": "Out of Line: Nature Calls is a leg-crossing game of Russian roulette.  A stand-alone expansion of our Out of Line series, players race to the front of a line of portable toilets at an outdoor concert.  The deck is full of cards to help you cheat your way to the front, but you never can tell when nature might strike.  The further you get into the deck the more desperate the race becomes because the clock is always ticking on a full bladder.<br/><br/>To win, you simply have to be the first one to get to a portable toilet without having any accidents along the way.  Nature could call at any moment and no one may make it to the front of the line, so use all the tricks up your sleeves to cheat your way to the front.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:<br/>1. Roll a dice and move that line up <br/>2. Draw a card and hope nature doesn&rsquo;t strike<br/>3. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)<br/><br/>Player cards allow you to do things like:<br/>&bull; Move a player to the end of a line<br/>&bull; Force a player out of line<br/>&bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line<br/>&bull; Add people to the end of a line<br/>&bull; Temporarily close down a portable toilet<br/>&bull; Stop another player from playing a card<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fighter In Sight is an aerial-based game for two players or more, which recounts the WW2 battles.<br/><br/>Minimum length: 45 minutes (Playing can take longer, depending on scenario size and number of players) At the controls of your fighter planes, will you dare you to fight the fearsome Messerschmitt 109E over England, or the famous Japanese Zeros over the Pacific Ocean ? Will you succeed this battle ? Or will you have to escape the flaming wreck ? Fighter In Sight, with its historical scenarios, will allow you to relive this all over again. The game proposes a fresh approach of aerial combat. It will allow you to make mass struggle by involving many squadrons. Fighter In Sight was created with rules that will become more difficult as you play more scenarios. For example, when playing the first scenario you will learn how to use the speedometer. When playing the second one, you will also learn about the fuel management, and so on. The progressive rules have been prepared to address families as well as experienced players. It offers a simple, fast, realistic and easy to assimilate gameplay. It is possible to increase the realism and the difficulty level with additional parameters. Documenting and researching about historical background and technical facts has been an important part of the creation of Fighter in Sight so that the game would respect as much as possible the spirit of air combat, and still remain easy to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lore:<br/>In an alternate 19th century world created by artist Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, machines have been built to serve as soldiers. Fires burn in their heads, keeping their engines running and they survive a hail of bullets. Princess Feodora has taken control of London, which has now been turned into Clockwork City.<br/><br/>Machines were given more and more autonomy and control - punchcards passed between soldiers and seers. Now, the machines seem to have developed some sort of consciousness and no-one has heard from Feodora in years.<br/><br/>In Edinburgh, re-engineering has gone awry and a new set of machines has arisen, wanting nothing less than the decimation of every potential problem in the land - including humans!<br/><br/>Clockwork City is being invaded, this is the moment for the human captives of Clockwork City to escape.<br/><br/>Welded Iron allows players to either play as the Imperial machines defending their tyranny over Clockwork City, or as human heroes who strive to escape.<br/><br/>The Imperials want to keep the humans as slaves and keep their infrastructure intact. The humans want to avoid casualties and use the chaos to evacuate the city. In the end, everyone might survive but this is just the start of the war.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Welded Iron is a tower defense yet competitive game of an uneasy asymmetric alliance between one player: the imperial machine overlords and the other human factions. The imperial machines will use iron and steel resources to build and maintain infrastructure, while also ensuring area control over regions where humans work and live. Each player will have asymmetric powers to reflect the differences in strengths and objectives. For instance, The imperials will have powers which help to quickly build up defense infrastructure from the invading machines of the North, while also utilizing passive human &quot;resources&quot; to help in those goals. The human factions will have formed an alliance with one another after the grueling human wars in a bid to overthrow their imperial overlords. Their objectives are at odds with the imperials, as they must extract and rescue as many humans in clockwork city, and beyond to win, yet also defending the city from invasion.<br/><br/>The game utilities randomly allocated hex tiles with positions in which towers are built for defense and attack, with regions to place electricity to power these up. The hex tiles also contain unknown bonus resources, with higher more valuable resources closer to the invading camps of the north. The imperial and human factions must work together to defeat an AI controlled invasion force or face annihilation, while also working towards their own objectives to win.<br/><br/>Designed by acclaimed medium-heavy weight designer David Turczi, Welded Iron will please those looking for a new fresh take on tower defense games, with many miniatures available.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s time to get drunk! Drinkill is a drinking board game that will make each game become a night you&rsquo;ll surely remember, and a day you&rsquo;d rather forget.<br/>How do you win? The only objective is to make it to the end. The first player that arrives to the &ldquo;Vomit Here&rdquo; space at the end of the board is the winner.<br/>How do you lose? If you&rsquo;re not the first player that arrives in the last space. You can also lose if you refuse to do a challenge but also refuse to take a shot. You can always surrender and admit defeat. <br/>The Drinkill game consists of 10 different characters. Each character has a special ability that can be used only once in every game. Before the game starts, each player chooses a character and draws 3 item cards from the deck. All players roll a pair of dice &ndash; the player with the higher number goes first and the other turns go clockwise.<br/>On each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice and advances the number of spaces the dice say &ndash; when landing on a space &ndash; the player must do what the space indicates.<br/>If it&rsquo;s your turn, you can activate any card in your hand. If it&rsquo;s not your turn, you can activate any card that is marked with a star.<br/><br/><br/>What type of cards can you draw in this game?<br/>Item cards: Items can be used to give the user an advantage in the game. Attack your opponents or delay them, defend yourself from other opponents and many other functions to make you win the race.<br/><br/>Challenge cards: Challenges are the core of the Drinkill game. When a player lands on challenge space he has to draw a card from the deck and decide whether to complete the challenge or to take a shot.<br/><br/>STD cards: STD cards are challenge cards that the player can hold in his hand like item cards and use them against other opponents.<br/><br/>Each player can hold up to 5 item cards at any given time and any amount of STD cards. Challenge cards are immediately discarded. Item and STD cards are discarded after use.<br/><br/><br/>The Drinkill board spaces and what you have to do when you land on each of them:<br/>1.    Burning shot &ndash; Take a shot.<br/>2.    Totem &ndash; Draw an item card from the deck.<br/>3.    Challenge &ndash; Draw a challenge card from the deck. You can decide to do the challenge or take a shot instead.<br/>4.    STD &ndash; Draw an STD card from the deck.<br/>5.    Pub &ndash; Choose another player to take a shot with, take a picture and upload it.<br/>6.    Hospital &ndash; You&rsquo;re stuck there and lose your next turn.<br/>7.    Arrow space &ndash; Go forward/backward depending on the number on the arrow space.<br/>8.    Golden coin &ndash; If you have the &ldquo;Capitalist Pig&rdquo; item card and you land on this space you can choose as many opponents as you want and discard all of their item cards.<br/><br/><br/>Invite your friends, race them to the end and do a lot of stupid challenges while you&rsquo;re getting drunk. Use cards combos and collaborate with other players to delay the leading opponent.<br/><br/>Do you think you&rsquo;re hardcore? Do you want to make your friends wash the dishes? Do you want to make someone drink all the leftovers of the party? Do you want to kiss a beautiful girl but you&rsquo;re the ugliest dude around? Now you can.<br/><br/>",

We've provided new pieces for a brigade armed with Werndl breechloaders (Ferdinand Poschacher von Poschach's &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; of I Corps) so you can try it out in the Jicin scenarios.<br/><br/>As part of Austria's desperate attempts to re-arm, the Imperial-Royal Army acquired another new technology: the Gatling gun. The Viennese firm of Paget purchased a license and began production, but the guns did not reach the troops until years after the war had ended. Once again, we have new pieces to equip I and X Corps so you can mow down the Prussians at Jicin and Trautenau.<br/><br/>We went the route of weirdness and fun for Chickamauga&amp;Chattanooga.

        "description": "EverWyrd is a Dungeon crawling adventure roleplaying game where you become the hero(es) in a constantly changing world. Using map cards randomly drawn from the deck, you and your friends will create worlds of adventure, peril, and battle; more importantly, you will collect and horde wonderous treasures while questing your way across the land and towards legendary status.<br/><br/>The 2020 update will include all-new, original artwork, different playable races, new cards, and an entirely new format. We will also have all creatures and example heroes as 2D print &amp; play miniatures.<br/><br/>The world of EverWyrd had its origins with the Elves and Dwarves who forged a balance of work and life that allowed them to live in peace and harmony. The elves took the surface domains of Ral and Friijlant, while the dwarves toiled in the caverns and tunnels beneath Ashland Heights and Eryn. In order to survive, both learned the ways of the other, but only as a means to provide for each other. Thus, for thousands of years did they live in peace together; dwarves forging weapons and minting precious metals, the elves hunting, farming, and encouraging life to sustain and prosper above. <br/>All this would change with men. Seeking a better life - an easier life perhaps - man moved north, across the marshes from the land of Ibros, to live amongst the elves and dwarves. Both peoples were curious about men. Those creatures were notoriously greedy and often cruel to one another. Could they learn to live in peace as the elves and dwarves had done?<br/>۝   ۝   ۝<br/>Each side believing in their cause, each side using powerful magic that would corrupt the lands in which they fought. Their wars would drive the elves from the land of EverWyrd, with the exception of a small band who would become the Sidhe, the last of the elves born with magical abilities and skill to them. The Sidhe built a stronghold in Calus, deep in the forest at the base of great mountains and shunned the human race.<br/>The dwarves, who had made their home in the tunnels and caves underground found their homes collapsing from the heaving of the corruptions of magic. They tried in vain to fight against the power of the Warlocks, but they could not resist them. In the end, the dwarves died out or found safety in the more remote lands of EverWyrd, fearing their numbers would never recoup their loss. The dwarves, like the elves, would never be inclined to share with the human race again. From their icy tunnels in the Frigid Peaks, the dwarves watched man destroy itself.<br/>As the armies of men clashed, great warriors, powerful magic-users, and assassins from the shadow rose and fell in great numbers. Such it was that the humans destroyed themselves. Those who fought were killed however possible, and those who did not die ceased to fight. After years of carnage, so few were left that they finally agreed to end their battles. Practicing the dark power of NecoMagia was outlawed, save for a select few who studied relentlessly and proved their value to the councils. Wyrd, being the purest form of magic became revered and the power behind the thrones of EverWyrd would forevermore be that of the powerful witches and wizards that thrived. <br/>None recognized the damage they had done to the world itself. The tunnels and underground caves, the murky underworld of EverWyrd, had been forever transformed. Creatures that had never before existed now thrived in the corrupted magic left behind by the great war, and they became a threat to the people and other races that now sought to live their life on the surface of EverWyrd.<br/>۝   ۝   ۝<br/>Thus, does your story take place, a thousand years after that first group of men reached for a better life, only to find their future generations destroying everything they believed in. As man stretched its wings to discover the art of magic and use magic, so too did they actively destroy their own world. What lies beneath the ground for which thousands walk? Are you brave enough to find out? What other things might you learn if you delve into the reasons behind the thrones of EverWyrd? What magic, power, and riches might you discover if you&rsquo;re brave enough to dare?<br/><br/>",

This game follows the theory proposed by Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, who wrote that it was the Soviet declaration of war, and not the atomic bomb, what finally led the Japanese to surrender. August Storm plays with the what-if possibility that the Japanese government delayed for a few weeks the decision to surrender because the military believed that they could successfully defend the Kuril and Hokkaido with the resources at hand, and because the Soviets lacked the experience and equipment needed for launching such a complex operation as an amphibious landing. In fact, the dismal performance of the Soviet amphibious attack against Shumshu Island seemed to confirm the idea that they could resist a Soviet amphibious invasion.<br/><br/>Command Magazine Japan #142 in August 2018.<br/><br/>",

When the Angel of Death spread a devastating plague along the Silk Roads into China the physicians must work together to eliminate the disease or die themselves.<br/><br/>One player is the Angel of Death placing disease disks on the intersections on a 8 x 8 squared board. As he spreads disease the rest of the players move the physicians and battle to contain it and even destroy it completely.<br/><br/>Players take turns to move any physician diagonally except the one moved on the last turn. Move next to the disease to eliminate it, but with another physician close by to protect you. If you are not prepared to sacrifice some of the physicians lives, you cannot eliminate much of the disease. If the physician jumps over a disease, it is eliminated from the board and the game. Physicians may continue jumping as long as<br/>they can eliminate disease.<br/><br/>The Angel of Death places more disease at the end of each physician player&rsquo;s turn. A physician, surrounded by diseases, four in the middle of the board, two on the side of the board, or one in a corner, is killed and removed from the game.<br/><br/>The game is over when either:<br/><br/>&bull; When there is no disease left to place.<br/>&bull; All the physicians have been killed.<br/>&bull; There is no disease on the board.<br/><br/>Total the numbers on the physicians, that is their score.

        "description": "Portal of Life is the final gamebook in the Midnight Legion trilogy. However, it can be played as a stand alone or following book 2, The World Reborn, and book 1, Operation Deep Sleep.<br/><br/>The Midnight Legion: Portal of Life is an interactive story where you decide what happens next. Solve puzzles, recover lost memories, and utilize combat, stealth, or sixth sense and diplomacy. It is a highly advanced, color illustrated gamebook   with  control over your character and world. An interactive story is combined with combat, strategy, puzzles, diplomacy, stealth and role playing elements. Collect information, knowledge, and goods from the world around you to advance your character.<br/><br/>The world that has replaced it is alien and savage, but filled with wondrous new life. In the last remaining Midnight Legion base a computer controls technology that can destroy it or help it to thrive. If you&rsquo;re strong enough you can defeat the agent who betrayed your mission. If you&rsquo;re clever and skilled enough you can solve the base&rsquo;s puzzles and outwit its traps. But even then you will still need to confront the sentient, possibly deranged computer itself. What it can tell you depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice to regain the memories you have lost.<br/><br/>",

The Judge chooses a starting word and places it face up in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Players now choose one card from their hand to pair with the Judge's card.<br/><br/>You may combine your card with the Judge's in any order you wish. For example, if the Judge's card was Swallow, the card 'Dutch' could be used to make the phrase 'Dutch Swallow' or 'Swallow Dutch'.<br/><br/>Once a player has announced what their chosen phrase is, they may provide their own twisted definition.<br/><br/>Profanity is as dirty as you decide to make it, however due to the adult nature of the content, we recommend that Profanity is played by guys and girls who are 17+ years of age.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The XLVIII PzK Enhancement package builds on the detail of the game system. Those who own the original games will recognize some of the counters in this package as those from the Maintenance, Logistics, and Air Enhancements. They have been bundled together similar to the ones from the IISS PzK Enhancement package.<br/><br/>Each game now includes the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements which mean you don&rsquo;t need to buy this package in order to have detailed command and fire support operations if you want them.<br/><br/>The specific elements for Maintenance include the chart and track which determine at what level and how long it takes to repair a vehicular unit, and vehicle recovery units which are used to drag the wrecks back to where they need to be in order to have maintenance performed.<br/>As for Logistics there are supply convoys and supply points.  This enhancement is only necessary for those wanting a more detailed picture of how long an organization can last without proper supply.  If you&rsquo;re not playing a game that lasts more than 3 battle days it is not going to manifest its importance.<br/>And lastly the Air enhancement that is likely the most enjoyable aspect of the package.  It allows you to explore the air campaign in a completely different light. If you have a team you can make an air commander and that job alone will be lots of fun.<br/><br/>XLVIII Enhancement comes with (in Full Color):<br/><br/>        Air Operations Charts<br/>        Logistics Charts<br/>        Maintenance Charts<br/>        600 Unit Counters and Markers<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

According to villagers, these are guarded by a creature of the night, a big werewolf. You should look for coins and be alert for threats, get objects to advance in the search and hopefully catch the werewolf ... If he does not catch you first.<br/><br/>About the game:<br/>It is a card game in the style of &quot;Memory Game&quot; for 1 to 4 players.<br/>The main objective is to find the 6 Gold coins that will be hidden among the game's deck.<br/>Along the same we will be stalked by the Werewolf, the protector of the coins that will try to eliminate you, to avoid it we must find 4 objects: Wolf Trap, Rope, Shotgun and Cartridges.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>Four cards are placed in a row and face down, one after another in 3 columns, thus completing some 12 cards (4x3). For each turn, the player must turn (reveal) 2 cards from among these 12. If the 2 cards we reveal are not from the same object, we place these cards face down in the same place. Otherwise, if these 2 cards are of the same object, we can obtain one of those cards and the other is placed in the discard deck; that is, we now have that object in our inventory to use. Once this situation has happened, we must replace the two cards that we took from the playing field (the 12 cards) with another 2 cards that we are going to draw from the game deck; there always have to be 12 cards on the table. Once the turn is over, we repeat revealing another 2 cards and so on until we get all the coins or be eliminated by the wolves. When we reveal 1 coin, it becomes part of our inventory and we start a new shift, that is, it is not necessary to reveal 2 coins to obtain it. In the same way we must replace 1 card to take its place in the field of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first Crook to get into a specified number of Prisons.  But it&rsquo;s not as easy as you might think!  To get into Prison, you have to get arrested by a Policeman and then sentenced by a Judge.  To get arrested, be on a Crime Square at the same time as a Policeman.   When arrested, you will be sent to THE CELLS, ready for trial by the next Judge who comes round the Circuit.<br/><br/>If you are found Guilty, you will generally be sent to Prison.  But which one you&rsquo;re sent to depends on the Crime and the Judge who tries you.  You stay in Prison until you have served your sentence and get to Released! or Remission, or you escape, or are let out because of something another player does.  Sometimes, of course, you are found Not Guilty, or are put on Probation, or sent for Re-Trial (probably by a different Judge).<br/><br/>Actions by other players can upset your careful plans, though.

They plan on doing future extensions. The extensions will have their own Spirit, ghost, zombie, etc.  With their own separate back-stories. SUMMONED is a party card game that contains a full back-story that puts the players into the game themselves. All players will start with a set of Curse Cards that players will use throughout the whole game. These cards contain Dares that the &ldquo;Victims&rdquo; (non-active players) can choose to complete or pass on. Each Curse Card is worth a point, so the Victims choices of taking and successfully completing a card will effect if the Victim earns or losses points. Players will take turns being a Demon, which is the active player of the game. Victims are the inactive players that are vulnerable to the Demon. Who can give one Victim Player a Curse Card at any moment. SUMMONED also features a Curse Ability Extension deck.  Curse Ability Cards are &ldquo;Special Cards&rdquo;; these cards are worth &frac12; point. Curse Ability Cards have benefits on them, which will help the Demon or Victim player. But these cards will be bad news for the apposing player. SUMMONED pulls together different types of game play, that creates a party card game that everyone will have a blast playing. Player can play this game sitting down, while you are out and about or as a live action RPG.<br/><br/>How can you play this game as a live action RPG? Well-SUMMONED &ldquo;The Devil Inside&rdquo; provides characters. The Demon and Victims, who will take turns turning each other into Demons by giving them a Curse. This Curse has a back-story. That starts out with a drunken friend who decided to wander off into a friend&rsquo;s house. They find an Ouija board with etched words written on it. While they try to read these words they accidentally summons a Devil. The Devil was not a fan of being awoken, so he gave the drunken friend a curse that starts turning them into a Demon. To make things worse the only way to get rid of this curse is to get another person to perform actions from cards. Those were provided to the friend by the Devil himself. Players are able to bring their Demon characters to life while they are the active player. Being the active player you will use your Cards to pick off your Victims one by one. Trying to reduce the number of cards they have in their hand. Victim players in turn, will try their best to successfully complete these actions on the cards. Earning them more points.<br/><br/>SUMMONED &ldquo;The Devil Inside&rdquo; is for ages 21+, with approximately 60-90 mins of game play. Players can choose to continue their game for longer if wanted. SUMMONED &ldquo;The Devil Inside&rdquo; has  Curse Cards with a rule book containing; the story, rules and game play instructions. SUMMONED &ldquo;The Devil Inside&rdquo; has one extension pack (so far) that will be available, containing  Curse Ability Cards.<br/><br/>",

And as each and every average troll server, you must do your best to satisfy clients, and hope to earn generous tips, or even profit from some particular favors. Because your clients are strange people.... I mean, are they actually people? Anyway, choose your client wisely, and serve it at the good speed, to not be doubled, or worse, have your plate spilled out on the floor. Whatever, a warthog nicknamed the Troll waits to guzzle all unclaimed dishes, and he's doing it so well that the inn is called after him: welcome to Troll Inn!<br/><br/>Each turn, you serve a client, trying to gain the best tips, make their values evolve, and take benefits of their favors. At the end of a turn, the Troll tosses out some remnants, most of the time on the clients, making them leave the inn. Once only 3 clients or less remain in the tavern, doors close and it's time to count your pay. The richest server wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>素数大富豪 (Sosuu Daifugo) (Prime Daifugo) is a climbing card game which uses a standard deck of playing cards. Players take turns raising the number by playing a prime number with cards in their hand.<br/><br/>This game uses 54 standard playing cards with two jokers included. Suit doesn't matter in this game. Shuffle the deck and deal 11 cards to each player.<br/><br/>The leader plays any prime number (see below). Then in clockwise order, players may play greater prime numbers with the same number of cards as the leader. The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round.<br/><br/>To play a prime number, take a certain number (or any number if you are the leader) of cards from your hand and arrange their order to indicate a number. If the number is prime, your play is valid. Consider Ace as 1, and 10, J, Q, and K as two-digit numbers (10, 11, 12, and 13 respectively). For example, you may play 3 and J in two ways, 311 and 113 (both are prime numbers), but you may play 3 and 5 as 53 only, because 35 is not a prime number. There's a penalty when you play an invalid (non-prime) number.<br/><br/>You win the game when you get rid of all cards from your hand.<br/><br/>大富豪と素数の素敵な出会い！<br/>普通の大富豪とは一味違ったゲームです。<br/>トランプで遊べるので気軽に楽しんでみてください。<br/><br/>【ルール概要】<br/>各プレイヤー11枚のカードが配られた状態でゲームが始まります。<br/>大富豪と同じように、プレイヤーがカードをプレイする時、親が出した枚数と同じ枚数で、かつ前のプレイヤーが出した数字よりも大きい数字をプレイする必要があります。手札を全て出し切ったプレイヤーが勝利です。<br/>通常の大富豪と違う点、それは「プレイするカードが素数でなくてはならない」ということです。<br/>複数枚のカードをプレイする場合はその数字を並べたものが、プレイした数字となります。例えば 3 と 7 をプレイすると決めた場合。<br/>1枚目を3、2枚目を5とすれば「35」になり<br/>1枚目を5、2枚目を3とすれば「53」になります。<br/>この場合35は素数ではないので、53としてプレイすることになります。<br/><br/>その他細かいルールもあるので詳しくは説明書を見てください。<br/>（2018年10月現在、英語版の説明書は作成中です）<br/><br/>",

Vampires can also convert members of their herd into vampire minions. Vampires score points for building a powerful vampire army (preferably all from the same family) and having an ample blood supply.<br/><br/>Great Old Ones use dreams to lure citizens into their cults. Once&nbsp;citizens become&nbsp;priests,&nbsp;they can lure their family members into their cults, drain the dreams of cultists, or sacrifice themselves to themselves to Great Old Ones. Great Old Ones score points for recruiting priests from all 5 families and having big cults!<br/><br/>Werecat Version : Easiest to learn. Fun and light.<br/>Vampire Version : Trickier than Werecat, but has the deepest strategy of the three versions.<br/>Great Old One Version : Somewhere in between the other 2 versions.  <br/>​<br/>Backstory:<br/>It is New England, around the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp;Mysticism and the occult are all the rage among&nbsp;<br/>the trendy upper crust of society. The countless seances and spiritual meetings awoke something dark and sinister and ancient. Madness and misfortune swept through the city, as those dark and ancient things they woke tightened their grip on the city.<br/><br/>The local people, in their wisdom, blamed the madness on toxoplasmosis from cat poop. All cats were banished harshly from the city. A few werecats living nearby found out about the terrible mistreatment of their fellow feline friends and have come to the city looking for some payback....and tasty meals!<br/><br/>Vampires who have &quot;lived&quot; unnoticed in the city for nearly 2 centuries have decided that the time is right to take control of their city...before something else does!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaiju Stadium is a two-player strategy game about giant monsters playing sports. In it, you make use of dice, play cards, and unique kaiju abilities to pull off wild combinations and score points against your opponent.<br/><br/>Each turn, you roll two dice and pick from them to decide what you're going to do with that turn. The dice give you movement options, let you kick the ball, and more, plus you have access to limited-use Play cards that let you do things that aren't on the dice. Beyond that, every kaiju has a pair of unique special abilities: one that modifies how it interacts with the basic rules of the game (e.g. Hyperion can trample through opposing kaiju while moving) and one that happens when they switch onto the field from the sidelines (e.g. Nimbus can steal the ball from a nearby space). You're going to spend each turn making decisions about who to move, who to have on the field, and what to do with your kaiju, trying to solve the ongoing puzzle of &quot;can I score a point this turn or not?&quot;<br/><br/>Get the ball into the opponent's goal to score a point. The game is over when a player can reach three or more points with a two point lead or when either play reaches five points.<br/><br/>Rounds take about 15-30 minutes and the game rarely unfolds the exact same way twice, so the game is meant to be played several times in a row.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MAMAEV KURGAN, STALINGRAD, RUSSIA, 27 September 1942: Acknowledging the damage done to his army in assaulting the southern and central sections of the city, General von Paulus had systematically reconfigured his forces for a fresh assault. Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.<br/><br/>This is the Advanced Tobruk System treatment of this bloody battle which includes a large-hex map on heavy cardstock panels, new overhead (OVR) infantry and light weapons counters and the usual set of scenarios, Battlefield Walkaround document and AFV cards.<br/>Ownership of ATS Rules, playaids, system markers and a &quot;standard&quot; Russian/German sheet of AFV counters are required to make use of this product.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bite-Me combines an epic battle of survival between Humans, Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies with hilarious quirky artwork, cheesy puns, and strategy for the ultimate card game.<br/><br/>Turn other players into Vampires, Zombies, or Werewolves and then kill them. Slay one of each type of Monster and you win! Watch Out, others will be attacking you. Don&rsquo;t get bitten or you turn into a Monster and start biting others. Plot your strategy to use magical objects, spells, and weapons to battle Monsters, defend yourself, or become human again.<br/><br/>There are six types of cards in the Bite-Me Deck. (Infection, Attack, Protection, Regeneration, Strength, and Movement cards). Many cards are specific to a species (Human, Vampire, Werewolf, Zombie). You can try to turn other players into a monster with an infection card. Use attack cards to try and kill another players. You can protect yourself from an infection or an attack with the right protection card. Turn back to Human or regain a life with right regeneration card.  Make yourself stronger or others weaker with Strength cards. Change direction or skip players with Movement cards.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game as a Human. Each player will probably change species several times during a game. When a player attacks another with an attack card, it is a battle to survive. Think of the old card game war. If you are attacked with a level 1 attack card, you can fight back with a higher level attack card. This goes on until a player wins or a protection card is played. If you do not have a higher level attack or protection card, you die and your opponent get credit for killing your type of monster. Strength cards can add +1 to your cards or can lower your opponent&rsquo;s cards for one turn. The other type of battle in Bite-Me is called an Alpha Battle. This happens each time more than one player becomes the same monster type. IE when a second person is turned into a Vampire. The victor is the Alpha and takes a card from the loser. They both continue with +1 and -1 cards until they turn into another species. Kill each monster type and be human or be the last surviving player and you WIN!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hextra uses the Double-seven binary-coding hexdominoes by Nestorgames, that includes 36 tiles (with numbers from 0 to 7) composed of two adjacent hexagons. Instead of the standard &lsquo;pips&rsquo;, this set uses a special concentric binary representation. A central pip equals 1, a small circle equals 2 and a big circle equals 4.<br/><br/>Hextra is an upgrade on Dominoes for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Shuffle the tiles facing down and deal all them evenly among the players. Each player places her tiles standing up before her so the other layers can&rsquo;t see them (as in Dominoes).<br/><br/>The player with the double seven starts by placing any tile in the middle of the playing surface.<br/><br/>From now on, starting with the second player, players take turns in order placing a tile on the board so that at least one of its values matches an adjacent one already played. The tile can be adjacent to more than one placed tile. Consider the imaginary hexagonal grid as always.<br/><br/>If each of the symbols of the newly placed tile match with adjacent symbols of different tiles, the player gets an extra turn. As a result of this, the player might achieve a chain of extra turns.<br/> Notice that if both symbols of the new tile match with the same symbol of a played tile, no extra turn is awarded.<br/><br/>But if they match different hexagons (even if both symbols are the same) the player gets the extra turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player gets rid of all her tiles, thus becoming the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Created in cooperation with the Italian Basketball League (FIP).<br/><br/>The game tried to reproduce the tactics and the actions of a real basketball game.<br/><br/>It is played on board of 72 rectangular cells, 36 each midfield, regulating the position of the players on the court. There are 4 distinct zones on the board:<br/>1 - Inside<br/>2- close shot<br/>3 - long shot<br/>4 - midfield<br/>In each cell only 1 player of the same team can be placed and in the 'inside' area, only friendly player can be placed, simulating the 3 seconds rule.<br/><br/>Players have 3 attributes, Defence, Attack and Rebound. DF and AF have 4 values, from 1 to 4 growing, RF is from 1 to 10 with the higher the better.<br/><br/>You can play typical defense tactics like in real basketball, and movement of player is asynchronous with the one of the ball.<br/><br/>The game has been developed and published in 1981, so it is obviously feeling the age.<br/><br/>The player are simple cardboard figures on a plastic base, as well as the ball. There are no basket or any other element in 3D apart of the players themselves.<br/><br/>It remarks more on the fidelity to the rules and the game more than the look.<br/><br/>It can be played in 2 players, normally and a game typically lasts from 40 to 60'.<br/><br/>The game is not language dependent for the set, but the rules are only in Italian.<br/><br/>",

You can move one step across normal terrain, pay two points to move through mountains, or you can move as far as you want along a river for free. When you add a card it has to be on a space next to your pawn and any rivers must line up. You get points equal to the number on the card (1, 2, or 3, with higher point cards being more complicated) for every edge that perfectly matches what you put it against. If no edges match you can still play the card but it's worth negative points equal to its face value. If you can't play a card at all, you have to discard one face down, which is worth triple negative points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once during the game you must play a castle. This costs ten points, but at the end of the game you get points for the card under your castle and the four neighboring cards. Castles must be built at least two cards apart, so building in the right place can also deny other players points. When moving, castles and pawns both allow you charge tolls for anyone passing through, which is the best way to get a point advantage over other players.<br/><br/>Explore the countryside, build your castle in the right place, and see if you can become the richest Lord of Shinano.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

On the way you may meet helpful guides and mischievous fellow-travelers.  With some luck you may find enough treasure and magical tools to enable you to find the home of your dreams and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>This game is played entirely in the hand, so there is no need for a table.  You can play it anywhere.  If you are interrupted, you can put it in your pocket and take it up later.<br/><br/>Set Up<br/><br/>Remove the four Jacks from a deck of playing cards and shuffle the rest of the deck, including the two Jokers.  Arrange the Jacks face up in the order Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, with Spades in the back and Hearts in the front.  Place the rest of the deck face down on top of the Jacks.   The Jacks will act as counters to keep track of how many times you&rsquo;ve gone through the deck; when they show up, put the first one behind the other three and continue playing.  When you reach the Jack of Spades you have gone through the deck four times and have finished the game. The Jacks also hold your items for you.<br/><br/>Interpretation of the cards<br/><br/>The four suits represent four kinds of landscapes.  Hearts are oceans, lakes, and rivers.  Diamonds are plains, fields, moors, and prairies.  Clubs are forests.  Spades are mountains.<br/><br/>The values of the cards represent various treasures, tools, items, landscapes, and people.   The &ldquo;view&rdquo; is the name for the four cards that are fanned face upward in your hand.  They are not only the cards you can view, but they also represent the things you can see as you look around you.<br/><br/>Some of the cards represent first a location, and then, under the right circumstances, an item that you find at that location.<br/><br/>Goal<br/><br/>Travel though various landscapes, collecting treasure and magical tools.  Eventually use the tools to find the home of your dreams and live happily ever after.  If you find your home, you have won the game.    But once the Jack of Spades appears, you have finished your journey, whether or not you have met your goal.<br/><br/>Terms<br/><br/>View:  the top four cards fanned out face up on top of the deck.  In some situations there may be more cards in your view.<br/><br/>Discard:  place a card face down at the back of the deck.<br/><br/>Store:  place a card face up behind the face-up Jack of the same suit<br/>&emsp;<br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Hold the deck face down in your hand, with the Jacks face up in the back.  Turn over the top four cards and fan them so you can see them all.  These cards form your current view.  If in the course of play your view becomes less than four cards, replace them with cards from the front of the deck.<br/><br/>You may discard any card from the view at any time.   At any time you may look to see what cards you have stored behind the Jacks.  They will be easy to find because they will be face up together, while the rest of the deck will be face down.<br/><br/>A complete description of the rules will be found in the files section.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

An aspiring restaurant entrepreneur must make wise decisions to manage day-to-day operations and keep loyal customers happy, while always innovating to draw new customers through the door. But beware, competition is fierce as other restaurateurs are also looking to build their own reputations and secure their own loyal customers.<br/><br/>In Dining Dynasties, each player must work to draw in business, find loyal customers and create exciting new dishes! Players manage all aspects of their restaurant in a fast paced competition with their rivals to offer the finest cuisine and carve out a share of the ever changing customer base. To do this, players must build and maintain a hand of cards to create a unique business plan of options. Players may focus on marketing to advertise for new customers and seek out unique sales opportunities, improve the mood of the restaurant by building a professional staff and improving restaurant d&eacute;cor, or a combination of all. Yet another option is to invest in the menu and seek to claim the title of finest cuisine among the competitors! A unique meta-game within each game round has players strategically playing menu cards to vie for the title of finest cuisine, which may provide an immediate valuable customer bonus.<br/><br/>Dining Dynasties also allows players to increase the restaurant size. Do you want a small gourmet bistro or a huge dining establishment? The options are yours to choose, with each new room tile providing new worker placement opportunities to further your restaurant goals. But be cautious, expanding at the wrong time can take a toll on your available cash.<br/><br/>Over the course of nine rounds, players strive to build the most valuable restaurant by earning reputation, increasing sales and building infrastructure. The player who chooses the most effective business plan, and best mitigates the ups and downs of the market, will emerge the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ACQUISITIONS<br/><br/>ACQUISITIONS is a game inspired by the ideas of Sid Sackson. It is a game that is predicated upon building a Kingdom of wealth. Long ago, in distant times, Kingdoms were sometimes won and lost by mighty armies. Battles were waged to gain the lands and treasures held within the Kingdom under siege. Yet always behind these mighty armies were the Kings and Queens with their vaults of gold, silver, and bronze. Wealth has always driven the ownership of land. Kingdoms were always built on wealth.<br/><br/>The game of ACQUISITIONS allows players to wheel, deal, and plan their way to building the largest Kingdom of wealth. The only &quot;luck&quot; in the game of ACQUISITIONS is the luck of the draw for the Destination Cards. Beyond that, it is up to the player to purchase, trade, and strategically maneuver to become the King or Queen of the largest cache of Commodity Coins.<br/><br/>The basic concept of the game of ACQUISITIONS is that the players create and grow Kingdoms by playing the Destination Cards in their hand and placing buildings on the board. The Destination Cards available to the player are provided strictly by the luck of the draw. The skill in the game of Acquisitions, to generate a large amount of Commodity Coins, comes from the ability to obtain Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that will grow or even in the Kingdoms that are taken over by larger Kingdoms. The obtaining of Kingdom Cards is generally made in Kingdoms based on the players&rsquo; capability to grow those Kingdoms with their cards on hand. However, players can increase their Commodity Coins by obtaining Kingdom Cards in Kingdoms that grow from the other players building placements.<br/><br/>The main objective of Acquisitions is to become the player with the most Commodity Coins at the end of the game. This is achieved by obtaining Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that are growing, for a long term venture, while at the same time shrewdly investing in smaller Kingdoms that can be sacrificed in takeovers, for a short term outlay, all of which gains Commodity Coins through Royalty Compensations. The more Commodity Coins that can be generated in short term outlays, the more they can be invested into long term ventures. You can not reach the pinnacle of the game of ACQUISITIONS just by becoming the King or Queen of the largest Kingdom. The player who wants to become the wealthiest King or Queen must produce that perfect mix of active cash flow through takeovers and uncanny investment in Kingdoms that will grow. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of wealth because every game is different.<br/><br/>The Game of ACQUISITIONS will keep the players focused because one purchase, one trade, one placement of a building can be the difference between win or lose.<br/><br/>Acquire a Kingdom of Wealth<br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But within the project GIPF it makes even more sophisticated with its pieces, the TAMSK potentials, GIPF: You bring them into the GIPF game, but do not yet know whether you can use them or not. They can be beaten or neutralized, yes, it may even be that you can not use them at all. But as long as they are on the board, they pose a threat to the opponent. You will be amazed how a TAMSK potential affects your strategy and that of your opponent.<br/><br/>Apparently this new (2019) product contains 6 TAMSK potentials. The base game TAMSK includes 6 TAMSK potentials. The first GIPF expansion GIPF Project Set 1 (from 2001) contains 12 TAMSK potentials, so this new product seems intended to let TAMSK owners have the recommended full set of 12 TAMSK potentials without having to buy the earlier expansion with 12 of them.<br/><br/>",

These points can be achieved by military (pitched battles), political points (owning all the faction colors in your camp) and economical points (having three or more cards from the same faction in your camp). There is assault and raids against the adversary camp to slow down their economical engine.<br/><br/>The game is heavily based in wargame concepts in a very light way, but historically accurate. You will see light and heavy troops, infantry, cavalry, missile troops, terrain bonuses, etc. Cores da Guerra is divided in Campaigns. Each campaign is subdivided into three phases: A preparation phase in which players buy cards in the Market, set down cards in the area called camp, use abilities, assault or raid adversary camp, etc. When all players pass in their turn, the combat phase begins. Finally there is the renovation phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2-6 player card game that satirizes corporate greed and white-collar criminals. Can be played in teams of 2 as well.<br/><br/>As a crooked CEO of a phony multi-national corporation, your mission in Fraud is to collect and bank Asset and Liability Cards in your Offshore Account, play Fraud Cards to attack your opponents, use Defense Cards to fend off attacks and avoid collecting Indictments. Once a player receives their 2nd indictment, they have to do the &quot;Perp Walk&quot; around the table while other players heckle them.  The player who first banks $150 million ($150M) in Assets in their Offshore Account before receiving their 3rd indictment - wins the game.<br/><br/>Each card features unique, hand-drawn caricatures and art by Rick Parker.  Rick&rsquo;s probably best known as the artist of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head Comic Book, and was on the staff at Marvel Comics for many years. Rick was the perfect man for job - supremely talented comic artist, and a really shady character.<br/><br/>Each player selects a CEO business card as their identity and gets a score pad to keep track of banked Assets and Liabilities in their Offshore Account ($150M wins the game) and indictments (3 strikes and you&rsquo;re out).<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player.  The remaining cards are placed face down in the Draw pile.  Played cards are discarded into a Discard pile, which can be shuffled and reused when the Draw pile gets low.<br/><br/>In any given turn, a player has 1 of 5 options: <br/><br/>     Bank an Asset Card in their Offshore Account.<br/>     Securitize Liability Cards and if successful, bank those as assets in their Offshore Account on the following turn.<br/>     Attack another player with a Fraud Card and if successful, bank 1 Asset Card from you opponent while opponent also gets 1 indictment. Attacks are defended with Defense Cards.<br/>     Discard an unwanted card and draw back to 6.<br/>     Audit another player &ndash; each player can do this only once per game.<br/><br/><br/>Fraud has been thoroughly play-tested, improved and refined over 10 years from initial beta launch in 2010 until this final game release. Fraud uses some of the similar game mechanics of Mille Bornes, the attacking, defending style card game that is listed in the GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame.  Fraud is fun, simple to learn, and takes only 30 minutes to play.   The game combines strategy and luck and satirizes corporate greed and white-collar crime.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Activated SDs can have various types of weapon and special abilities. These are then physically launched from your RIG. <br/>- Five different RIGs (buildable spaceship models) can be customized by mounting the parts the way players want and the ships can also be mixed to build a totally new RIG.<br/>- Configure your RIG by installing various types of Platforms into your RIG's Modules and construct your deck according to the installed Platform Systems.<br/>- Earn points during battle to eventually be accepted into the Guild. As you earn Battle Points, you'll gain benefits in the Battlespace to aid you on your way to Victory.<br/><br/>Victory conditions: <br/>The game ends when a player's RIG is destroyed or after the turn where a player's deck runs out. <br/>- The player with the surviving RIG wins the game.<br/>- If both players survived when the game ends, the player with the most armor wins the game.<br/>- If the armor amounts are equal when the game ends, the Junior Guild Member wins the game.<br/>- If both players are Junior Guild Members when the game ends, the players must place their RIGs 2 Proximity card lengths apart and load 1 SD each.

The game is meant to appeal to just about anyone from any background, and can be used as an ice breaker or as a tool to get people to open up.<br/><br/>TOP TALE is a deck of cards where each card has a topic on it. Along with each topic, there's a caption that is meant to spark ideas for responses to the topic, or in many cases the caption is just meant to get a chuckle out of the players to help lighten to mood. Topics are things like, &quot;Your Worst Day at School&quot;, where each person is expected to recount their worst day at school story. The game has some hidden strategies, where it's not always about what stories are told, but sometimes how entertaining they are when told.<br/><br/>At the end of each round of game play, each player votes for their favorite response without voting on their own, and the person with the most votes wins the round. If there's a tie, then you have a tiebreaker round between those that tied, responding to a new topic card. The game continues until you hit a predetermined number of cards, or you all call it quits.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sabotage was designed and illegally distributed by a group of Danish resistance fighters during the German occupation of Denmark which lasted from 1940-45. It simulates an actual act of sabotage that took place against a transformer station at the Scandia Locomotive Factory in Randers on 6 July, 1943. Erik Hagen, a medical practitioner who was also active in the resistance underground, is said to have sold the game to his patients and donated the money to illegal activities and operations. He was shot and killed on 6 June, 1944, while returning from a sabotage mission against the Globus Factory in Glostrup.<br/><br/>The game pits 1-2 saboteurs against 1-2 factory guards, and challenges the saboteurs to blow up as many machines and buildings as they can before they are either caught, killed, or manage to escape. The saboteurs will have to acquire the necessary equipment, such as crowbars, guns, and explosives, on the black market before entering the factory grounds and setting the charges. The factory guards, on the other hand, are trying to discover the saboteurs and raise the alarm. Once raised, the saboteurs only have a few turns to complete their operations and escape the factory grounds before the police arrives and arrests them.<br/><br/>The game board and pieces are printed on a single sheet of paper which players are instructed to mount on cardboard and cut out. Movement is controlled by the throw of a single 6-sided die, as are the gun fights which may occur if the guards discover the saboteurs. Considering the relative simplicity of the game, the simulational approach of the design sometimes makes for complicated situations which are only partly covered by the accompanying rules sheet. This also means that there are no hard and fast criteria for winning or losing. Rather, the game presents itself as a training simulation meant to inspire further acts of sabotage against the German occupying force.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Zont! is a co-op storytelling game of adventure that fosters creative thinking and teamwork.<br/><br/>To begin, each player chooses a role (Captain, Scientist, Explorer, Security, Diplomat or Engineer). Memory tiles that depict a color (Emotion) and a word are turned over and spread out in the center of the table. A Story Plot is chosen at random, this is the goal the team was trying to accomplish on their mission and indicates a specific word found on the Memory tiles.<br/><br/>On their turn a Player reveals two Memory tiles. If two matching colors are found that Player begins a &quot;Complete Memory&quot; using the Emotion indicated by the color and the two different words on the tiles. Each other player then contributes by &quot;Adding To&quot; the memory from the viewpoint of their role on the team. After all players have had a chance to &quot;Add To&quot; the memory, the pair of tiles are placed on the Memory Track at a point determined by the team.<br/><br/>After 8 Complete Memories (linked from Start of Story to End of Story) are found you will have pieced together your trip to Zont and have a unique story only your team could have had.<br/><br/>Winning or Losing is optional. To Win the players must find and work the Story Plot term into the story and individual players are awarded points on their participation. But for younger or more casual play the journey itself is just as rewarding.<br/><br/>We hope you had a wonderful time on Zont!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Confederate Generals Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn operated separate commands in northern Mississippi, late in 1862. Union troops, in a disjointed attack, struck Price near Iuka. Price withdrew, while at that same time Van Dorn made a move toward Federal held Bolivar, but then backed off. Van Dorn eventually gained command of Confederate forces in the area and united with Price. Van Dorn believed a quick move to take Corinth was the best way to proceed. US forces under General William Rosecrans were fortified in Corinth however, and the assault, though with some initial success, was costly to the Confederates. Van Dorn then withdrew to Holly Springs.<br/><br/>But there were other options available to the southerners. Forcing Union forces to abandon Corinth by outmaneuvering them and blocking their supply routes was one alternative. Striking towards the important bases of Bolivar and Jackson was another option. Or attempting to take Memphis was a possibility. Then again, what if things had gone differently, and the US had been defeated at Corinth. The possibilities are now yours to explore...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This group of powerful sorcerers named Chilo&eacute; as &quot;La Recta Provincia&quot; (The Straight Province) which was made up of seven districts and under the control of an all-powerful King.<br/>After the King's death the most influential wizards dispute the reign of &quot;La Recta Provincia&quot;.

Every player stars with only one die to acquire influence cubes (Economic, political or magical), you will use your cards to play those influence cubes on districts. When you meet the influence requirements to take control of a district you will also acquire its special die which will grant the controller with new powers (more influence, cards and other abilities) to continue taking control of other districts.<br/><br/>The initial die will also move the &quot;Trauco&quot;, an automata character that will help the active player to acquire more influence, but can also shift the control of a district where both players have met the influence requirements.<br/><br/>",

A second player can take over as Minotaur in a two-player match.<br/><br/>On each turn select a labyrinth section from the Builders Board, and a location to build it atop a grid of randomly arranged land tiles. Your choices impact what labyrinth sections you have available on your next turn, and the direction and distance that Minotaur moves. Different types of labyrinth sections are blessed by different Greek gods, giving Daedalus an edge if used at the right time.<br/><br/>Earn points for building along rivers, lose points for building on vineyards, and don't let the Minotaur reach you or the exit before you finish! Earning and placing pillars will help slow Minotaur's progress and earn extra points.<br/><br/>In a two-player game Daedalus has less influence on Minotaur's movement, which is now controlled by the second player. Minotaur can topple and carry away pillars built by Daedalus, and steal labyrinth sections before they are set in place in order to build temples.

Nearby choristers can immediately pick up his chanting, increasing the effect.<br/><br/>On an individual level, the Choir of Nightmares is composed of rather weak units, but they strengthen and support their allies thanks to their blasphemous prayers.<br/><br/>Well used, their effects can change the tide of a battle, yet the choirmaster needs protection &ndash; without him, it&rsquo;s impossible to chant. It&rsquo;s best not to lose the chorists too fast either if you&rsquo;d like to keep the reach and effectiveness of the prayers.<br/><br/>This product is accompanied by a digital booklet, downloadable from the Devil Pig Games website, containing the rules to play with the Choir of Nightmares as well as one scenario.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Put kroz Jugoslaviju game titel translation from both Slovak and Croatian languages - &quot;The way through Yugoslavia&quot;.<br/><br/>A mid 1930s Yugoslavian pan-Slavic board-game published in Ljubljana, Slovenia, circa 1935 by a famous illustrator and painter Mirko &Scaron;ubic (1900-1976).<br/><br/>Mirko &Scaron;ubic was born in a Slovenian family of artists and architects. He studied art in Munich under Franz von Stuck and Karl J. Becker &ndash; Gundhal, in Prague under Vlaho Bukovac, Jakub Obrovsk&yacute; and Vojtech Hynais, and in Dresden under Ferdinand Dorsch in Max Feldbauer. Before the WW II he was active as illustrator and painter. In his later life he became one of the most famous restorers and conservators of Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>The game shows the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the late 1935 and traveling through the most important stops of the country, should increase the pan-Slavic feeling. All the stops on the board are described in the inner side of the box. The instructions end with a rhyme of a Slovene, Croat and Serb always being brothers.<br/><br/>The maps shows the most famous building of Yugoslavia. As most of them are older buildings, Ljubljana is shown with the modern Art Deco building &ldquo;Nebotičnik&rdquo; (Skyscaper), the tallest building on the Balkans at the time, finished by 1933. Nebotičnik was the first reinforced concrete building in Europa.<br/><br/>The architect of Nebotičnik, Vladimir &Scaron;ubic, was a brother of the illustrator of this game, Mirko &Scaron;ubic.<br/><br/>The map can be dated after the opening of Nebotičnik in 1933 and before 1939, when two regions (banovine) of 9 in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, merged into one. The 8 regions existed until 1941, at the beginning of the WW II.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Retro Hero is the first of many games for the Retro Gamer Device. Players start by randomly selecting 5 level cards (this is your cartridge) and inserting them into their Retro Gamer Device. Each level has a predetermined number of turns so players must try and make the best with the options they're presented.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect points while navigating across levels, moving with the help of shapes chosen from the options rolled on your adventure dice. Points are mainly collected by covering as many empty spaces as possible (venture points); defeating creatures scattered across the levels; and using a key to open the lock. There are also several other ways of accumulating points such as Treasure Cards and Side Quests.<br/><br/>Items found in a level are collected when covered, adding to your player board or wallet. When covering creatures, players attack by drawing cubes from a bag. Successful attacks earn you points while taking hits will cost you health. Players can press their luck to earn maximum points but risk dying in the process.  If a player does run out of health during an attack, they lose a point as consequence but are revived on their next turn, continuing from where they left off.<br/><br/>The Treasure Cards that are collected are added to the limited slots on your player board to help you along the way. Their content ranges between Spells, Companions, and Special Items.<br/><br/>Bombs are a vital part of the game as they enable players to take shortcuts and sometimes access items that are otherwise unavailble. If a player wishes to cover a brick with their chosen shape, they will need to spend a bomb. Bombs (like all items) are either collected or purchased.<br/><br/>Retro Hero is a truly unique dungeon crawling experience with up to 40 levels to choose from and 11 different shapes to dictate your every move. The player with the most points becomes the Ultimate Retro Hero!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

I want you to take your men and find out what it&rsquo;s all about. You and your soldiers of the Papuan Infantry Battalion land on the Island of R&rsquo;lyeh off the New Guinea coast, little knowing what horrors and mind destroying terrors awaited you. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn&hellip;. <br/><br/>Your WWII Australian soldiers face the Japanese and the unknown. Some of the Hostiles are the scattered remnants of a Japanese force that is starving, diseased, and possibly going insane. Some of the hostiles are &ldquo;Shadows&rdquo; &ndash; these may be human or not, the player will only know at the end. The last of the hostiles are &ldquo;Finds&rdquo; that may give a clue to what is happening. Find enough clues, eliminate enough Shadows and the tales of R&rsquo;lyeh may be explained in rational terms even if horrible. Fail and no amount of human firepower will defeat the Ancient Old Ones.<br/><br/>Warfighter WWII - Z Expansion - #51 R'yleh adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions!

        "description": "Object of the game: To capture the most pebbles.<br/><br/>Starting: Cards are shuffled and each player draws three cards. A card is drawn from the pile and placed in the middle face up. This will be the card that the first player builds on. Group chooses who will go first and players take turns going clockwise. Figure 1 below shows an example of a card being played on from the deck. Noticed that a pebble is placed on two overlapping red squares.<br/><br/>Cards: There are 80 cards made up of three colored squares per card. Cards are placed on top of each other so that at least one of the three squares on the card lays on top of another square of a card with the same color.  Red squares can only go on top of red squares, blue squares can only go on top of blue squares, etc. More than one square can go on top of other squares if the squares laid on top of other squares matches the same color. If a player is unable to lay a card on top of another card then they are skipped to the next player. Figure 2 below shows how a card can be placed on top of two other cards.<br/><br/>Cards must also be able to match colors when adjacent sides are touching other adjacent sides. Figure 3 shows an examples of a card that is not acceptable because the yellow square does not match the red square.<br/><br/>Pebbles: Players draw from the pile of black pebbles when placing a pebble on a square. Only black pebbles are played on cards, white and red pebbles are used to reduce the number of black pebbles needed in a game. Black pebbles have a value of one point. Every time a player collects 5 black pebbles they turn them into the pile to replenish it and take one white pebble which is worth the 5 black pebbles. A red pebble is worth 10 black pebbles.<br/><br/>Pebble Placement: Where ever a card square overlaps another card square a pebble is placed on that square. Up to three pebbles can be placed in one turn if a card is placed that overlaps three squares of the same colors. Figure 4 shows an example of one card being placed on top of three other squares. Three black pebbles are placed on top of each square that matches.<br/><br/>Capturing Pebbles: Capturing is done by jumping pebbles. A pebble can jump another pebble as long as there is a space (square from a card) to jump into over a pebble. Pebbles can jump in any direction. Multiple jumps can be made in one turn as long as there is a pebble next to another pebble and a space to space to jump into. Figure 5 shows an example of jumps that can be made in one turn. There are other combinations to jumping than what is shown in Figure 5.<br/><br/>End of Game: The game ends when all the cards are used up from the deck and the player&rsquo;s hands. Who ever has the most points in their pile wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kampen om Stavanger is a card game where players are politicians trying to get political issues approved. First player to gain issues worth 10 swords is the winner. Each player starts with four political issue cards and one support card.<br/><br/>The game consists of 48 political issues cards worth 1-3 swords, and 21 support cards. The political issues come in four colors; red (collective issues), blue (market issues), green (environmental isues) and yellow (value issues). Each issue card comes with a price market at the top; in trying to get a political issue approved, the player has to sacrifice a number of red, blue, green and/or yellow cards from her hand.<br/><br/>In addition, the support cards represent different organisations who can give your proposal a supporting boost; media, taxi drivers, environmentalists, pub owners, the bishop etc. Support cards has a support value and a blocking value. Support cards can substitute a number of sacrificed issue cards.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, the player takes two actions, and chooses from<br/><br/>i) Draw three issue cards <br/>ii) Look at opponent's hand and steal one issue <br/>iii) Discard two issue cards and draw one support card <br/>iv) Propose an issue and sacrifice the right number of cards (possibly with support).<br/><br/>In order to stop one player's proposal/issue, the other players can block it by<br/><br/>- collectively sacrificing the same number of issue cards sacrified by the proposer (support can replace issues, using the blocking value) AND <br/>- using at least the same number of support cards.<br/><br/>Stavanger is the fourth largest city in Norway, and three vertical viking swords standing in stone is a commonly used city symbol. The first edition was printed in a total of 100 copies, as part of mayor candidate Eirik Faret Sakariassens (SV) campaign for municipal office in 2019.<br/><br/>The game can be purchased at thegamecrafter.com (Norwegian language only).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player who does this first wins the hand and scores minus fifty; all other players earn penalty points according to the value of cards remaining in their hand.<br/><br/>In each round the players reduce the value of the cards held in their hands by laying on the table those cards that fit the requirement of his/her own level which consists of Sets and Runs.<br/><br/><br/>     A Set consists of three or four cards, all different colored<br/>     A Run consists of three or more cards in sequence, all same colored <br/>     The 13th card can be used in the middle when making Runs (eg: 12-13-1)<br/><br/><br/>There are 60 cards in one deck, and two decks are used in a 3 or 5-player game, three decks for more players:<br/><br/>     52 numbered cards: each valued from 1 to 13, in four different colors. <br/>     two Wild cards<br/>     one Skip card<br/>     one -1 card<br/>     two x2 cards<br/>     one +3 card <br/>     one ? card<br/><br/><br/>The Deal<br/><br/>The first player (dealer) shuffles the deck and before dealing, the next player &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; the deck, the dealer then deals 13 cards to the next player, and 12 cards to the rest of the players, the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the Draw Deck, the player with the 13 cards in hand discards one card from his/her hand to start a Discard Pile, then the game continues counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>On each turn, a player:<br/><br/>     Draws either the face-up top card of the Discard Pile or one card from the deck.<br/>     May lay down their completed round-appropriate collection of Sets and Runs.<br/>     May play off other players who have laid down once they have laid down themselves.<br/>     May discard one card from their hand onto the discard pile. When a player discards a card that could have been played off on their own or another player's laid cards is a &quot;Ramo&quot;. Only players that are LAID DOWN may call out Ramo. The FIRST player to call Ramo must take the discarded one card to make a new Set or Run, or expand any laid down cards in the game even if it&rsquo;s not his/her turn. The regular counter-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for Ramo if the player who calls Ramo is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues counter-clockwise from the player who calls Ramo. If multiple players call Ramo for a discarded card, priority for the discard goes to the player who calls out Ramo first. <br/><br/><br/>Play continues, in alternating turns, until one player goes out, or has no cards left in their hand. A player goes out when he successfully discards the only remaining card in hand, marking the conclusion of the step for all players.<br/><br/>It is customary to announce other players when there is only one card left in your hand.

The other players are the advisors, who must decipher the challenges on the advisor cards, then tell the hacker how to break into the different modules. The advisors can look at the cards, but not the Hackathon console. The hacker can look at the console, but not the cards.<br/><br/>There are eight advisor cards, and each card has a series of puzzles and brainteasers on it. The advisor cards are divided among the advisors at random. The advisors must complete the challenges on the cards, and then will get a set of instructions to read out loud to the hacker. Since the hacker cannot see the card with his or her own eyes, the hacker must rely solely on verbal instructions from the rest of the squad as to which buttons to press and which switches to turn to open the console.<br/><br/>The console has a timer on it, and the team must break through successfully before the alarm goes off. Players can set the timer to whatever amount of time they&rsquo;d like, with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 20 minutes.<br/><br/>If the team is able to decode all the modules successfully in the set time, the team wins.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the idiom was the prophecy<br/>unclear and therefore difficult to interpret.<br/>The King therefore gave magician Ilidor the order to speak a spell wards of protection to the Village to protect the kingdom from possible dangers.<br/>Dorntal was a small village where everyone knew each other. There was a nice market around the playhouse with delicacies from the entire kingdom. Down by the river lived the fishermen, carpenters, blacksmith and several other artisans. During the day, people in the village went to work and in the evening they met at the inn to dine and play together. The fire crackled in the fireplace of the tavern and the people told each other Candlelight stories, genuine and invented, exciting and funny. And everyone listened. It was a nice feeling to be a part of this village community<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this inner and outer peace did not last long.<br/><br/>Due to a failed magic experiment Ilidors in the black tower, this protective magic weakened. The magician Illidor could do nothing more. He turned away from Dorntal and left the black tower at dawn the next day. A note on the wooden door with the words &quot;Portals, Chaos, II-260, Save Yourselves !!!&quot; was the only one what he left behind. What did Ilidor want to say with that? Had Illidor been able to decode the prophecy? Would the protective magic completely collapse in the second age in 260?<br/>Even the dwarfs, elves, and other races now spoke in fear of the imminent end.<br/><br/>In For the Kingdom, players assume the role of one of the backward houses in the village of Dorntal. By inserting the individual workers, different actions are played out. The mining of raw materials, the procurement of money, the improvement of the workers or the hiring of Heroes are dedicated solely to defending Dorntal and protecting the kingdom. In Farek's Forge, magnificent items can be forged to fight within and outside Dorntal. Face different Quests. Some Quests can be done alone, but others can be done together. The player with the most points wins. However, if the village is damaged / loses morality too much, you lose the game together. But beware: Humans, Orcs, Dragons or Goblins lurk dangerously around Dorntal. The sun sinks on the horizon with increasing speed, so hurry up! It is time: for the people, for the king, FOR THE KINGDOM!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It has been developed in collaboration between Mario Fischel, Ph.D., a former senior economist at the World Bank, and Krishan Puvvada, Project Lead, Education at Financial Times. Road To Riches has been successfully tested with students in the UK.<br/><br/>Road To Riches is not only a fun and challenging game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a full-fledged &lsquo;Managing Money 101&rsquo; course!  Our program also includes quick and easy-to-digest instructional videos, a guidebook on personal finance, and lesson plans for classroom use.  Together, they form a crash course in personal finance that turns newcomers into masters, helping them win the game and at life!<br/><br/>Players start out with $100,000 cash, roll the dice, and proceed around the board. Spaces on the board correspond to different life events such as getting paid a salary, going on vacation, or picking from the three decks of cards that sit at the center of the board. The three decks of cards are: news flashes, knowledge cards, and wild cards. Newsflashes provide a news story, and players must buy and sell investments accordingly in order to win or lose money. Users may accept advice from other players for a shared win or loss in the investment. Knowledge cards are multiple choice cards that teach users key finance information that will be used in the game and life. Wild cards are life events that will cause the loser to win or lose money depending on whether or not they own the right assets. To win, a user must double their money.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For the setup, on the exterior of the board, just outside of each of its six sides, equal and alternating strings of the two colors (one black string, one white string) are placed.  These exterior stones are known as the &quot;exo-stones.&quot;<br/><br/>On each turn, a player places a single stone of his/her own color into any empty cell; once placed, stones never move. Play continues until the board is full or both players pass, at which point the game is scored. Any group of own-color stones has a score equal to the number of &quot;exo-stones&quot; that it contains.  The owner of the highest scoring group wins.<br/><br/>If there is a tie for highest scoring group, then the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups are compared; the owner of the highest scoring group among the remaining groups wins. If these groups are also tied, then the process is repeated (that is, the tied groups are set aside and the remaining groups compared) until a winner results.  (It is impossible for group scores to be tied &ldquo;all the way down.&rdquo;)<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Pie Rule&rdquo; applies:  After Player 1 plays the first stone to the board, Player 2 can decide whether to play his/her own color to the board, or alternatively, switch colors with Player 1.  (The purpose of this rule is to offset the first player advantage: if Player 1 plays too strong of an opening move, then a rational Player 2 will decide to switch colors and make the just-played stone his/her opening move.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then he compares his result with the three revealed monster cards in the monster zone. He sets aside suitable dice and tries to get a suitable combination with a total of three attempts of rolling. If he succeeds, he has chased away the corresponding monster, takes the appropriate monster card with the printed victory points and places them in front of him. If a blue crystal is shown on the monster card, the player takes an additional crystal from the supply. This is worth additional victory points. If the player does not manage to roll a suitable combination, he has the opportunity to use his superpower to possibly chase away a monster. If this is not possible or if the player does not want this, he must draw a minus card from the minus card pile. A new monster is revealed and the next player takes his turn.<br/><br/>The game ends IMMEDIATELY when one of the following conditions occur:<br/><br/>     A player has chased away his seventh monster<br/>     A player has received his third blue crystal<br/>     The minus card pile has been used up<br/><br/><br/>",

Additionally, it alerts players to the importance of news and alternative news in constructing the reality that impacts companies.<br/><br/>Four Chairmen fight for control over 24 companies and 20 executive team members, while navigating 141 satirical news events that create risks and opportunities for companies.

        "description": "Paris, 1893<br/><br/>You have been summoned to the deathbed of Jean-Martin Charcot, the self-proclaimed godfather of neurology.  At first, you assume he wants to apologize for plagiarizing your paper about the taxonomy of eyelid tremors, but his intentions are much more grandiose and devious.<br/><br/>Charcot has hand-picked you to face off against Europe&rsquo;s most illustrious scientific minds in a battle of medical dexterity. Your opponents are as powerful as they are socially awkward, master diagnosticians who wield reflex hammers as if they were extensions of their very limbs.  You have always done well on standardized tests, but this will be the greatest challenge of your distinguished career.<br/><br/>With the eyes of world upon you, you will take turns examining patients with symptoms like weakness, numbness, and eye movement abnormalities. Find the source of these problems, and you will emerge triumphant from this Colosseum of neurological ailments.<br/><br/>Will you be the first to master the nervous system, find the most lesions, and become Charcot&rsquo;s heir-apparent? Only then will you earn the greatest honor in the history of medicine: to have all future neurologic diseases bear your name.<br/><br/>The Lesion: Charcot&rsquo;s Tournament is a strategy game based on real human neuroanatomy. Players map neurologic electrical pathways that sense the environment and tell our bodies what to do. Earn points by finding lesions where two or more pathways overlap. Earn even more points by finding a lesion in every part of a pathway.<br/><br/>",

The series rules use a hack of the tried and true NLB mechanics in order to simulate what as, at the time, the largest campaign since Leipzig. 1859 occupies an interesting place in military history, post Crimean war, tactics had barely improved much beyond their Napoleonic forefathers. Cavalry had been rendered nearly useless in terms of shock, and artillery began to dominate the battlefield even more so than it already did.<br/><br/>1859 also is notable as it features one of the last successful campaigns of Napoleon III and the French Second Empire. The French martial philosophy of Le Systeme D&rsquo; (loosely translated to &lsquo;Muddling Through&rsquo;) which doomed them to failure in 1870 against Prussia, propelled them to victory against a much lesser opponent in Austria. Fresh off their victory in the Crimea, France and Piedmont were considered two of the finest armies in the world.<br/><br/>&quot;For Liberty &amp; Lombardy: 1859&quot; includes 4 stand-alone wargames on the major battles of the campaign.<br/><br/>",

By round each player is required to use 5 of them. 3 of movement and 2 of attack.<br/>In each round one card will be played per turn. It does not matter the order or the Mecha with which you use it.

Each one must take again 3 movement cards and 2 attack cards. And start the new round.<br/>Every 3 rounds there is an energy cycle. Before starting the fourth round (if there is still no winner) the tower's energy levels and Mechas still alive returns to their original value.<br/><br/>Each Mecha has its own characteristics. Health, Energy, Special Skill, Attack Power.

        "description": "Spell and steel clash for fame and freedom! Battle your friends to be the last one standing!<br/><br/>Welcome to Arena: Grand Champions, a turn-based strategy brawler that can be played by up to four people. Become one of four different gladiators, each with unique abilities and play styles, and fight against both your friends and the challenges of the Arena to be the last one standing and become the next Grand Champion.<br/><br/>Game-play<br/>Once the players have chosen their Gladiator and their starting point, the contest begins! How the game plays out largely depends on the choices of each player. Players will make alliances, betray trusts, run, fight, and die for the glory of the arena! If a round passes without any violence to satiate the crowd the crowd will demand blood! To keep the people happy, cheering, and gambling, the arena master can activate various traps and unleash vicious beasts to keep the contenders on their toes. Each gladiator has specific maneuvers and actions that make them uniquely dangerous. Will you pick off some goblins from a distance with the Assassin, bend the minds of your foes with the Enchantress, deflect incoming attacks with the Soldier, or charge head first into a Minotaur with the raging Barbarian? No matter what happens, you must do whatever it takes to be the last one standing and win it all!<br/><br/>How-To-Play<br/>The players will all pick their gladiator of choice and place them in a starting area. Each gladiator has a set of free abilities including movement, defense, recovery, and basic attacks. In addition, each gladiator has 3-4 special &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; they can perform at the cost of maneuver points and a short cool-down. Every turn, a gladiator can take up to two basic actions or a basic action and a Maneuver. Game-play begins with just the gladiators going up against each other in turn-based combat. Play continues in a circle until a full round goes by and no player takes damage. At this point, a random event card is activated that can activate traps, summon monsters, or drop potions on the field. These events can greatly alter the field of play and players must adapt their play style to survive or finish off their opponents. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing on the arena floor. A big game-play mechanic in the game is the freedom of the players to make their own choices as to how to succeed. Players can team up with each other to tackle a bigger threat, stay on the move to avoid damage, betray the same allies they made earlier, and much more.<br/><br/>Arcade Mode<br/>Challenge yourself with a single player game mode where you face down every threat in the game from goblins to spike traps to other gladiators (and sometimes a combination). Test your endurance with each round being more difficult than the last and make choices along the way that could help or hurt you in this challenging twist on the traditional game-play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Emboldened by competitive gardening, your neighbourhood develops a new obsession:domestic fowl. You want to gather the most valuable flock, but your research has been, well, paltry. The market is unpredictable. Will it be chickens, turkeys or roosters that gives the greatest return? Discover how much each bird is worth, while building your collection. Who will win the<br/>feathered crown and who will end up with egg on her face?<br/><br/>Each player acquires animals, with the aim of gathering a prize flock. However, the value of each animal type is hidden and can only be discovered by looking at information on the rule cards and animal cards. A player may always look at the rule card or<br/>animal card in front of her. To look at the other cards, players must use the actions to swap rule cards or animal cards with those in the middle or pay another player to take a peek at her rule card or animal card. Players are allowed to write information down as they discover it. The player with the<br/>most valuable brood at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Attention must therefore be given, and the most detailed plans prepared, for every reasonable exigency of the overall operation.&rdquo; &ndash;Excerpt from the syllabus for Soviet officer training at the Frunze Academy.<br/><br/>&ldquo;There are no impossible tasks.&rdquo; &ndash;Motto of the Soviet 106th Desant Division.<br/><br/>An attack on NATO&rsquo;s air and naval installations near Reykjavik, Iceland was assumed should war between the alliance and the Soviet Union break out. The airfield at Keflavik played a crucial role in Operation Reforger which would rush vital resupplies and reinforcements from the US and Canada to Western Europe. The naval installation near there monitored the underwater SOSUS line that monitored Soviet submarines in the North Sea and North Atlantic. However, most US and other NATO military leaders assumed a Soviet attack would be in the form of air attacks by long range bombers with cruise missiles and conventional bombs. However, an airborne and amphibious assault could not be ruled out. This designer has made some assumptions in crafting this game:<br/><br/><br/>     The Soviet High Command mobilized a reinforced regimental-sized (331st Regiment of the 106th Desant Division as well as Spetnatz commandoes) airborne and amphibious assault that would be launched at the very outbreak of the war.<br/>     The Soviet assault seek to inflict as much damage as possible on the NATO military installations in and around Reykjavik and Keflavik, as well as gathering any intelligence materials discovered during the raid.<br/>     Evacuation and even the survival of the raiders would be secondary to the successful elimination of the NATO installations.<br/><br/><br/>The game lasts up to 12 turns. Each turn represents six hours of time. A hex is about 6 kilometers across. Combat units are companies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Irregular Wars: Conflict at the World&rsquo;s End provides a fun and easy, fast-play, set of rules for engagements on the fringe of the European world &ndash; Ireland, the Americas, the East Indies and the vast steppes of Central Asia. The lands discovered by European explorers seeking easy access to the trading wealth of the Indies exposed untold avenues for expansion. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw successive waves of self-aggrandising traders, raiders, conquerors and colonists leave Europe for new lands beyond the sea. Some pursued the freedom to practice persecuted religions or the opportunity to convert the heathens, others sought raw resources in the form of gold, furs or exotic spices or plants, like nutmeg or tobacco. The game is designed for engagements between two forces of from 500 to 2,500 fighting men per side. Each player represents a leading conquistador, noble, governor, daimyo, chief, cacique or petty monarch. These leaders are given the umbrella title of &lsquo;lords&rsquo;. The key to success in Irregular Wars is the lord&rsquo;s ability to harness the enthusiasm of volunteer or militia soldiers which, together with the effective use of terrain, counts for more than sheer numbers alone. The uncertain nature of army recruitment and variable level of centralised command and control make the rules ideal for small scale, localised and asymmetrical warfare. The game could quite easily be expanded to cover earlier or later conflicts anywhere in the world prior to the establishment of reliable and professional armies. This second edition of Irregular Wars continues the fun and fast approach of the original rules. More background information and explanations are provided and the phase sequence has been streamlined. Additional changes throughout the rules make the randomised aspects of the game more realistic&hellip; in a random sort of way. This edition includes army lists for 48 different sixteenth and seventeenth century armies belonging to the major European colonial powers and the indigenous populations of Ireland, the Americas, East Indies and Eurasian Steppe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game also illustrates the struggle between European powers standing to lose influence or territory after ending of World War I that affected position of both Poland and Germany during the Posnanian War.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of commanders of Polish insurrectionists and build both military and political forces to achieve three strategic objectives of their choice building up an uprising campaign. At the same time each player also commands the German forces and harrasses the opponents in order to slow down progress of their campaign or successfully prevent them from realizing the campaign by eliminating their insurrectionists forces.<br/><br/>The game does not start at certain point in time during the Posnanian War. The timeline strongly depends on types of objectives that players pick up for their campaigns. Decks are built around campaigns composed of carefully selected objectives combined with units, commanders, maneuvers, influences and events supporting reaching of those objectives. Effective decks are balanced with cards representing German forces slowing opponent's campaign progress down and cards that prevent player's campaign progress from being slowed down.<br/><br/>The first player to achieve all the objectives of his / her campaign wins the game and is always ranked first. The player whose insurgent units have been eliminated loses the game and is always ranked last. In case of three players game the rank is based on campaign progress and strength of insurrectionists forces led by the players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Santisima Trinidad (officially named Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad) was a Spanish first-rate ship of the line. This number of guns increased over the years. At launch in 1769, she had 112 guns, though this number gradually increased. between 1795 and 1796 she was upgraded to 130 guns, and in 1802 this number was increased to 140. Following this last rebuild, she was the heaviest armed ship in the world, bearing more guns than any other ship in the Age of Sail. Effectively, however, the fourth gundecks guns were comparatively small.<br/><br/>This armament was not without its problems. The weight of the additional weaponry rendered her a particularly poor at sail, leading to the ultimately rejected suggestion that she be restricted to the defence of the Bay of Cadiz. She remains notable as one of the very few 4-decked ships ever built.<br/><br/>In the game:<br/>The vast bulk of the Santisima Trinidad is alluded to with its special rules in Black Seas - she is only ever able to make a single change of direction during her activation. She also requires a successful skill test to be able to travel at full sails.<br/><br/>The trade-off for this deficiency is an arsenal that dwarfs any other ship in the game. Any vessel unfortunate enough to be caught in the broadside is sure to be shredded. You'll want to capitalize on this as best you can, unleashing your initial broadside (which conveys additional bonuses) at the optimal moment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A small warship with a perfect balance of speed, armament and resilience that made it one of the perfect vessels for single-ship action and privateering against merchant ships. It usually had one main gun deck as well as the guns positioned on the top decks. These were categorised as either 5th or 6th rate within the British Rating System, dependent on the number of guns they mounted.<br/><br/>The 5th rates were the archetypal frigates of the period. Used for single-ship actions and privateering, they could make their crews very rich as a result of the share of the prize money for any captured ship. A frigate was a desirable posting for a Royal Navy officer as they often saw action, so glory and promotion were more likely in addition to monetary benefits.<br/><br/>Frigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; Indeed, even in the midst of a fleet engagement, it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first... Wargamers take note!<br/><br/>Brig<br/><br/>A two-masted square-rigged vessel, with between 10 and 18 cannons, frequently used in combat actions by various navies. Ships with less than 20 cannons were considered Unrated. These were not really meant to participate in large battles &ndash; that was the domain of the ships of the line. However, they were the vessels of choice for privateers and still played a valuable role during larger battles, relaying orders and messages in a similar fashion to the 6th rates.<br/><br/>The Frigates &amp; Brigs Flotilla box contains all you need to get these vessels to the tabletop. These are suitable for navies of any nation. The kit includes a bobbin for rigging your vessels, detailed sails and pennants for every nation, as well as all the gaming materials for using the vessels in your games of Black Seas.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At this point, players add up their score.<br/><br/>This Game is played with Blinks Widget.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The French Navy has a history of highs and lows, both in terms of successes in battle and in the number and quality of its ships. In the mid-1700s, after the defeats of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the French Navy was at a nadir. However, due to the efforts of Louis XV and later Louis XVI, France rebuilt and reinforced its fleets with well-designed and well-built ships.<br/><br/>Why sail the French Navy?<br/><br/>Though French gunnery and training had formally equalled that of its Spanish and British counterparts prior to the French revolution, those events severely weakened the French Navy. High ranking officers had been removed or even guillotined, and inexperienced crewmen through necessity had been promoted.<br/><br/>French ships, however, were generally well built, and quick. This is reflected in the national special rules for the French Navy. They are able to purchase both the 'sturdy' and 'streamlined' upgrades for a discounted cost. French crews were also trained to shoot high, in order to capture enemy ships rather than destroy them. As such, they do not suffer the same penalties to hit when aiming high as the other navies do.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By the late 1700s, Great Britain had established itself as the most prominent and powerful navy of the time. This was mostly due to the discipline and commitment of its sailors, and the quality of the training for its leadership positions. The only way to rise through the ranks of the Royal Navy was to prove your mettle in action and bypassing gruelling exams. This was coupled with a very well managed gunnery programme that trained the men to shoot rapidly and accurately.<br/><br/>Why sail the Royal Navy?<br/><br/>The Royal Navy's national special rules demonstrate the power of a Royal Navy fleet. Indeed, they'll have a great bearing on how you select the components of your fleet. The quality of the Royal Navy's training is represented by their 'Drilled' special rule, which confers a bonus to shooting, and the 'Admiralty' rule confers an extra level of reliability to each of your ships.<br/><br/>As such you may find yourself fielding a smaller number of ships than other fleets, though you'll be able to deck these ships out with upgrades. Each will have a staying power and reliability both in sailing power and in unleashing their weaponry. The Royal Navy is poised to dominate the Black Seas.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The rules are easy to learn and still keep the flavor of the genre.<br/><br/>There are full rules for building your gang of humans, robots, and mutants, and sending them on campaigns. The book includes rules for mutations and creatures that stalk the Wastelands.<br/><br/>What separates Wasteland Warriors from most tabletop miniature games on the marker is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved.<br/><br/>For Wasteland Warriors we wanted the play to be fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair to it. For that reason, record keeping is kept to a bare minimum.<br/><br/>In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 miniatures without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Now, you can dig out all your old miniatures gathering dust and have a game set in the Wastelands of the future.<br/><br/>Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game.

NavTac: Coronel &amp; Falklands deals with early war battles with several historical and hypothetical scenarios, including, naturally, the Battle of Coronel, and the Battle of the Falklands in late 1914.<br/><br/>NavTac: Coronel &amp; Falklands is a 66-page illustrated book, which includes full rules (standard, optional, and advanced), facsimile ship counters, game tables, eight scenarios, and historical commentary.   You may use your own naval miniatures to play, or the ship counters provided.  Ships from Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey are included. Instructions are written with 1/3000 scale in mind, but provision is made for converting effortlessly to other popular scales.<br/><br/>The game is based on Fletcher Pratt's classic system, but uses tables and dice rolls instead of range estimation for fire combat.  The system is further enhanced by new procedures for ranging fire, critical hits, shell splashes, weather, ammunition rules, and many other small additions which, when used together, increases authenticity with little affect on playability.<br/><br/>To see sample pages of the book, click on the icon below left.  These pages will give you a good look at what is included in the book.  The design goal of NavTac is to provide a game high in playability, and high in authenticity covering the World War I era.<br/><br/>NavTac: Coronel &amp; Falklands includes ships, standard, optional, and advanced rules, several scenarios, all in a handsome book format (full-bleed, black &amp; white, 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; size), including illustrations and ship counter facsimiles that you can scan and print on your own.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disappointed by generic rules for the mid to late 19th century &quot;It's Getting a Bit Chile&quot; was written to cover the War of the Pacific 1879-1884, between Chile and an Alliance of Peru &amp; Bolivia. The War is also known as &quot;The 10 Cent War&quot; or &quot;The Saltpetre War&quot; as it was fought over taxation and mining rights in the Atacama Desert.  Although not well known in Europe the War had long term effects in South America and its peace treaties were only finally implemented at the end of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The armies of both sides had learned a lot from the Franco Prussian War and were equipped with fairly modern weapons and European style equipment and uniforms. Their attempts to mirror European tactics were met with varying degrees of success as they came to terms with fighting with breech loading rifles and machine guns. The armies were small by the standards of European Wars or the American Civil War, making it a War that is reasonably easy to assemble forces for and refight on a tabletop.<br/><br/>The War is well served by excellent quality, readily available books in English (including an Osprey), and figure ranges in 10mm, 15mm and 28mm. The armies are colourful with an interesting array of uniforms. The Bolivians even had a cuirassier regiment! If you can't wait and want to read more of the background, the Wikipedia pages are very good.<br/><br/>The rules were written to be played on a squared grid, but also contain adaptations to play conventionally with measured distances. The mechanisms are original but simple to learn and make use of a Disorder mechanism rather than figure removal, so all of your figures stay on the table for longer. Because of the use of the grid the rules are suitable for figures in all scales and basing. Infantry regiments, for example, are made up of 4 bases. It is unimportant how many figures are on each base, - you could even represent units with 4 figures and play on a large chess board if you are short of space.<br/><br/>The rules include a short history of the war, a uniform guide, sample orbats, Regimental flags you can scan and use and unique characteristics for many of the well known commanders of the War. There's also a Bibliography and a list of manufacturers with suitable figures from 6mm to 28mm.<br/><br/>A bit obscure, perhaps? Well, it's the perfect opportunity to stand out in a crowd and do something truly different.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The scale is 1 nautical mile to 10cm. The rules incorporate weather, spotting and minefields.<br/><br/>The rules have been enhanced with the introduction of Crew Quality and the use of Contact Markers to replicate the initial uncertainty of where the enemy forces might be.<br/><br/>A simple gunnery system requires a roll to hit with each gun, and an innovative damage system takes account of the range and penetration by specifying the dice that are rolled for damage. Torpedo and Mine attacks are resolved using similar mechanisms, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system.<br/><br/>In line with the intention of the rules to provide a simple system, armour has been standardised for each type of vessel and guns have been grouped by calibre into 9 classes. A detailed differentiation between the performance of ships and guns is not used. Not all guns can engage all vessels, and the largest guns have a minimum range.<br/><br/>A ship data list is provided covering the significant vessels of 10 nations in this period with over 130 vessels. A simple conversion system allows you to quickly put together the ship data you need for ships that do not appear in the data tables.<br/><br/>Pre-prepared ship data records are provided for the vessels that took part at the Battle of Tsushima.<br/><br/><br/>     Current Edition 2.0 (PDF and POD)<br/>     Recommended scale 1/1200 TO 1/6000<br/>     Complexity: 5/10<br/>     Level of detail: 4/10<br/>     Dice required: D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Ranges have grown immensely since World War II, where most tank combat was under 700 meters. Avigdor Kahalani famously engaged the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War at 3000 meters, and ranges stretched out even further in the Gulf War as computer-assisted fire control came into combat. Artillery support has become ever more mobile and fast reacting, with radar-assisted counter-battery fire. Air support is more nimble, too, especially once laser-guided munitions become commonplace.<br/><br/>Core concepts are the alternating player turn, detection, and defensive fire during the active player&rsquo;s movement, and cohesion.<br/><br/>Included in this title:<br/><br/>     Complete Rule System, including vehicle and equipment charts covering 1945 to the present day.<br/>     Combat Tables<br/>     Game Counters and Artillery Templates<br/>     Sample historical scenarios<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Balance of Power are a set of horse and musket rules that allow players to fight battles with multiple corps per side in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is 15 minutes, <br/>     each infantry unit approx 1000 men, <br/>     each cavalry unit approx 500 and <br/>     each artillery unit 12 guns. <br/><br/><br/>The rules emphasise easy to play game mechanics at the unit level so that a large number of units can be fielded.<br/><br/>Corps and army level morale as well as command and control rules mean that players are concentrating on what their major formations are doing as opposed to the finer details of what each individual unit is up to. Units themselves are defined by their troop quality giving them a &lsquo;combat value&rsquo; that is used to calculate the effects of their fire, melee and how much punishment they can take before they break and flee.<br/><br/>Balance of Power allows players to fight battles from the French Revolution through to the 1870&rsquo;s. They keep the detail and enjoyment of fighting with lots of units on table by making the actual game mechanics of combat and firing simple enough so that there is little or no need to refer to charts and tables. Players will find that historical tactics, bombardment, support, reserves and combined arms all go towards achieving victory.<br/><br/>The base game rules are quickly learned and a few players a side can cope with the largest battles. This allows battles to be fought through to a conclusion which makes them ideal for campaign games.<br/><br/>The aim of the rules is to give players time to develop plans, manoeuvre, conduct preparatory bombardments, all of which sees battles unfold in a historical manner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It combines several features seen in similar 18xx games, with several twists to those mechanics added in to produce a free flowing Robber Baron atmosphere. Players have a large bankroll to begin the game, and the money can flow fast to each player, but debts pile up rapidly making long-term survivability the main player challenge along with maximizing train routes. A full range of interesting private companies provides a lot of early game decisions that will shape each players expectations and optimal positions on the large map of France. Limited enhanced cities (Paris, Nice, and multiple B cities and off-board cities) still provide conflict among players for the best starting locations, especially combined with the bonuses provided from the various private companies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WHAT IS ECOLOGIC?<br/>You run an extractive company, and you need to earn a profit from extracting minerals and oil &ndash; that&rsquo;s business! But it is obvious that all big factories are harmful for natural environment. So, you should manage your income wisely: part of the money should be used to protect and restore the environment. Can you have a successful business and be a sustainable user of natural resources? And what is more important &ndash; money or environment? For different players the answer to the question will be different.<br/> Ecologic will help you model various development scenarios where you must balance environmental and economic concerns &ndash; the key factors of development. The game has a &ldquo;cumulative effect&rdquo;: after playing it several times you will start understanding how to achieve sustainable and balanced development. Later you will learn to see several moves ahead and think strategically.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE<br/>Each player (or team) runs a mining company, and the more oil pumps and mineral mines they have on the board, the higher their income. However, every Oil and Mineral Refinery damages the environment and reduces player's Enviro total. There are two indicators in the game: Profits as abstract money and Enviros as the environmental well-being estimation.<br/> In Ecologic the ratio and balance between these strongly influences the final score. The more balanced the two indicators are by the end of the game, the higher the victory score.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS<br/><br/>     The game consists of turns; each turn has four consequent phases: Event, Action, Environment, Income. <br/>     Random Events add unpredictability to the game with each turn.<br/>     All purchases are done via bidding on an auction. The highest bidder gets the goods - just like in real life business!<br/>     Tally up your Profit and Enviro balance every turn, and avoid having to shut down your refineries.<br/><br/><br/>",

Sketchers may NOT ask any questions and must immediately stop sketching as soon as the 2 minute round is up.<br/><br/>When playing with an ODD number of players, teams BET on the sketch they think the judge will choose as the winner. <br/>Players on the WINNING team each earn 2 points, + an additional point if they bet on their own sketch.<br/>Players on losing teams can earn 1 point for the round if they bet on the correct sketch.<br/><br/>When playing with an EVEN number of players, there is no betting, however, WINNING teams will earn 3 points if the card they sketched was rated as a &quot;high-difficulty&quot; card (as indicated by a &quot;+&quot; in the top left corner of the card.) Otherwise, they will earn the standard 2 points.<br/><br/>After each round, players rotate counter-clockwise, causing some players to change roles, and play continues.

For 10mm 1/200th scale models just use the rules as written. If using 15 or 20mm models, I recommend doubling all distances. I realise some of you may have 15mm Team Yankee models, whilst you may play Red Dawn with those models I think you are going to need at least an 8 X 6 board.<br/><br/>Using 1:285th scale models a typical meeting engagement would be 3-4,000 points per side, that will equate to around 10-20 tanks plus another 10+ infantry units (squads) and associated transports, air defence weapons, recce etc.  In total about a battalion sized battlegroup<br/><br/>All of the rule sets I have written have a few things in common. They must be fast to allow a fairly large game to be played within 3 hours. They must be fun. This is a game not a military simulation, compromises will be made where ever necessary to ensure that it remains fun and fast. Lastly it has to at least &lsquo;feel&rsquo; reasonable, I like to get a flavour of the period I am covering.<br/><br/>I have played WW3 games where largely speaking if you can see the target you can hit it, and if you can hit it you can kill it. I personally do not think in the heat of battle it is that easy to hit and kill a main battle tank. That is of course only my opinion, I have never been in the military and WW3 never happened so to some degree all WW3 rule sets are based on someone's opinion, but it is the basis of these rules, you will find even the hardest tank can be killed, though not necessarily easily, and even the least armoured tank has some chance of surviving long enough to achieve something.<br/><br/>I have provided army lists for the major armies defending or threatening Western Europe, I have split the period into 3 time periods, effectively the beginning of the 1980&rsquo;s, the end and of course the middle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are 2 multiplayer modes &ndash; PvP and Coop.<br/><br/>For Single Player mode, the goal is to destroy all enemy CANNONs in play. However, you will lose if your TOWER deck has ZERO card. For each CANNON damage dealt is in the form of putting the top card of the TOWER deck into discard pile. Each CANNON will deal damage based on the total number of AMMOs sharing the same colour as the CANNON. There are 4 different colours based on CMYK Colour and Black(K)can represent any colour.<br/><br/>During the game, the Player will go through 3 phases. <br/>First is the Player's phase whereby he or she is given 3 actions to either: <br/>A) Draw 1 card from TOWER deck <br/>B) Put 1 card from hand into play <br/>C) Discard 2 identical cards from hand to destroy target enemy AMMO. <br/>Player can repeat the same action as long as 3 actions are fulfilled.<br/><br/>Second is the Special Event Phase whereby he or she will roll a 6-sided dice to determine one of the Special event to occur.<br/><br/>Third is the Enemy Phase whereby the Player will count and receive the total number of damage dealt by all the CANNONs in play<br/><br/>Player repeats each phase for multiple rounds until all the enemy CANNONs in play are destroyed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Included with the game are a series of plastic miniatures each representing a unique champion from a Samurai, Pirate Captain, Steam Punk Tinkerer, Elven Ranger, Gladiator, Amazonian Priestess and more. 1-4 players each take control of 1-3 Champions in games that last 30 minutes to an hour.<br/><br/>Combat is determined through rolling battle dice each round with various combat resources (Attack, Defense and Movement).  Players can spend those resources to perform a unique ability, or store up to two of those resources in order to be able to perform more powerful abilities in the following round.  Supported by item cards to buff your champions or debuff your enemies, Fray's combat system allows for fast paced, tactical game play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In 1808, Sweden invaded Norway with the aim of capturing what was then a province in Denmark. In 1814, Sweden invaded again, this time encouraged by the Treaty of Kiel, which had given them control of Norway on account of Denmark being on the losing side of the war. Norway, in the meantime, had declared independence and written their own constitution. The result of the ensuing battles were a stalemate, but Norway, exhausted by warfare and starvation, had to accept a personal union with the King of Sweden as the Head of State.<br/><br/>The game is a low-complexity wargame, with units representing companies of infantry, batteries of artillery and squadrons of dragoons and cavalry. The game map covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Halden to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo) and Trondheim, the Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grand Battles Napoleon is a set of rules for recreating Napoleonic battles with model soldiers.<br/><br/>Players can play GBN using any scale from 6mm all the way up to 28mm miniatures and there are guidelines for gaming in the various scales. <br/>Units represent infantry regiments, cavalry regiments, artillery batteries and skirmish battalions and screens.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of army or corps commanders. Each player usually commanding around four to five divisions, with each division composed of between two to seven units. Thus the average size of a game is a corps + assets depending on which nation you are using.<br/><br/>The game is driven by two important, and to my mind exciting mechanisms, command initiative and response. Both these mechanisms make the game completely interactive at all times, inspired by Koenig Krieg.<br/><br/>Grand Battles Napoleon is definitely not a you-go-I-go game. It is very important that players understand the function of initiative in this set of rules as it governs most of the actions that occur during a turn. Actions are not sequential, neither are they simultaneous. Instead commanders test initiative several times during the turn. The player who wins the initiative test may activate one of his divisions or force his opponent to activate one of their divisions instead. Both players roll for initiative round after round until all units on both sides have had a chance to act. In this way each player is kept &ldquo;in the game&rdquo; at all times, with each general tied to their initiative, command ability and the important decision to strike now or force their opponent to act instead!<br/><br/>The second exciting mechanism is response. Response is divided between command response and unit response. Commanders need to perform response tests if they wish to perform sweeping grand tactical orders, maintain command control should they find themselves outside command range of their corps, wing or army general or to steady the troops from becoming demoralised as casualties in the division mount.<br/><br/>Unit response allows your troops to act out of turn and react to movement within their zone of control or when being charged. So that even within the other player&rsquo;s activation the non acting player is never really out of the game.<br/><br/>You will be will be able to re-fight historical battles, or  play any one of 10 points based missions from Grand Battles Napoleon and Legion d&rsquo;honneur supplement. Legion d'Honneur are our free campaign and Big Bash rules, suitable for running tournaments, big multi-day games and linked campaigns.<br/><br/>Units act via operations. The types and amount of operations a unit may perform are defined by the type of unit, is it cavalry, infantry, skirmishers, the units national character, i.e. does the infantry prefer fighting in lines or column, and the quality of the troops, are they guards or militia?<br/><br/>So in the immortal words of Marshal Gebhard von Bl&uuml;cher, &quot;Raise the flag high my brave lads. Forwards to victory!&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take turns placing your own colour pieces on any free hex on the board. When you have three in a row you can crown any one of the three into a king by placing a piece on top of another, a mechanic inspired by the abstract boardgame LOT. The other two pieces of the original line of three must be removed from the board but can be played again. Once you have crowned the piece, if it is adjacent to an opponents king and you can jump over that king into a free space behind you can then remove the opponents king. This is the only occasion a piece can move on the board after being placed. A newly crowned piece can only jump another King. A single piece cannot be jumped. Return the jumped pieces to your opponent. Continue playing until a player has managed to reach a winning position of creating three Kings In A Row (KIAR) or until a player runs out of pieces. In that scenario the first player who cannot make a move due to not having any pieces left loses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Close Fire &amp; European Order are wargames rules originally designed to re-create battles of the early 18th C in Europe with miniature figures. <br/>Many of the rule mechanisms have been developed from Andy Callan&rsquo;s American War of Independence rules- Loose Files and American Scramble, which were originally published in Wargames Illustrated no. 1.  <br/>This version is an adaptation which takes the rules back in time to the era of &lsquo;pike and shot.&rsquo; The main focus of the 17th Century adaptation is the time of the Thirty Years War and the English Civil Wars (1620-1660). It also covers the early wars of Louis XIV of France up to the end of the 1600s.<br/><br/>The historical period covered by Close Fire XVII is one of transition from medieval to early-modern warfare marked by the increasing ascendancy of infantry and the transition from pike to shot.<br/><br/>At the heart of the rule mechanisms is the concept of Disorder Points (DPs). These were invented by Andy Callan for his American War of Independence rules and have proven to be an enduring and elegant way of reflecting the variable state of morale and combat effectiveness. A unit will incur DPs for manoeuvre, receiving fire, close combat and morale, and they will loose them by halting to redress ranks or through the intervention of a leader. The system is easy to use, does not require any paper work and dispenses with the need for lots of morale checks.<br/><br/>&mdash;extracted description from the rules introduction<br/><br/>",

It works like an historical gamebook that explores the Middle East during the heyday of the Crusades, between 1097 and 1291.<br/><br/>Become a crusader lord from Europe or the Holy Land, the commander of a Templar patrol or a group of leper knights, or an Italian pirate/merchant prince! Or perhaps you'd rather be the chief of a band of Assassins, a charismatic preacher of pilgrims, the boss of a marauder band, a Muslim emir, an African mercenary captain, the Lady of a castle defending her people, a Mongol commander, or a Byzantine or Armenian officer! This expansion brings them all to life.<br/><br/>The Crusader States were the product of the First Crusade, and became a unique meeting point for people and military forces from all over Europe and the Middle East, but also as far afield as Asia and East Asia. Since these groups not only fought against, but also often with each other, it is possible to create assorted warbands or multiplayer games.<br/><br/>This expansion includes historical information, new upgrades (from Greek fire to holy and magical characters and items), and twelve factions with unique features and special abilities from all groups that fought in and around the Crusader States. It also comprises scenarios that re-enact stories from medieval sources by Western, Byzantine, Armenian and Muslim authors. They have been selected in order to represent highlights in the story of the Crusader States and their neighbours, from the siege of Antioch in 1097-98 to the fall of Acre and the final execution of the Holy Land in 1291.<br/><br/>-Description from cover<br/><br/>",

It is a world where the weak are crushed and the strong survive, where those who are bigger and more powerful bully those who are weaker and more vulnerable. It is a world at war, with armies clashing violently on the fields of battle. A great general is needed to lead these armies, and that general is you!<br/><br/>Chronicles of Blood is a game where you, the reader, takes on the role of an army commander in the world of Arax. It is your job to fight lead your troops to glory, destroying the enemy and either saving or conquering the world, depending on the army you choose.<br/><br/>Arax is a dark and dangerous world and a time of reckoning is approaching. The ancient empires of men, dwarfs and elves are crumbling, beset on all sides by the dark hordes of the orcs, goblins, demons and the undead.<br/><br/>The once magnificent elven forests, at one time beautiful, green and lush, are now withering and dying, the magically-crafted towers and wondrous tree-cities that lie within broken and shattered. Only the elven talent at manipulating mana, the magical force that permeates Arax, has stopped their race from being wiped out.<br/><br/>The dwarven fortresses built high in the mountains of Arax are now overrun with goblins, who burrowed up through the earth and attacked from within the otherwise impenetrable fortress walls. One by one the fortresses fall and, although the dwarven courage and skill with weapons is legendary, even they find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of goblins pouring in to their homes.<br/><br/>And humanity find themselves sorely pressed on all sides, their cities and towns constantly raided and besieged. The barbaric orc tribes march down from the north, pillaging everything in their path. The necromantic legions from the southern desert kingdoms shamble forward, unrelenting in their march towards the human lands. Some humans even turn against their own, worshipping demonic powers in secret and plotting the downfall of their race from within.<br/><br/>The final battles that will decide the fate of Arax are fast approaching. Soldiers line up on opposite sides of the battlefield, ready to lay down their lives in service to their commander. Will you lead your troops to ultimate victory, or will you fail in your leadership and suffer humiliating, crushing defeat?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To the untrained eye, the onset of a Harlequin masque is a riotous confusion of sound, colour and violence that to the refined Aeldari senses reveals clear patterns. Every moment is orchestrated, every Player knows implicitly how and when their comrades will strike.

        "description": "Warcaster: Neo-Mechanika is a high-speed hobby miniatures game for two players who each take on the role of a powerful Warcaster in command of a formidable battle force. Players assemble and customize a force of 20&ndash;30 models and fight a scenario-driven battle using dice and cards to control their mighty units and to cast epic cyphers. The game is played using an alternating-activation turn sequence with a round tracker that governs scoring opportunities and the duration of ongoing effects. Players take turns activating units one at a time and using their rack of cyphers, reality-warping spells that can be used to enhance their troops and warjacks or to devastate their opponent&rsquo;s forces.<br/><br/>While the Warcaster is not physically present on the battlefield, their presence is always felt. A Warcaster coordinates and supports their forces from a sophisticated command and control center called a rack, located aboard a massive battle carrier that transports the Warcaster&rsquo;s troops and warjacks. In the game, the rack is represented by a deck of cards&mdash;the spell-like cyphers&mdash;that players customize prior to the game based on the powers and abilities they wish to wield as a Warcaster.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each game has a certain number of turns that are broken down in four phases; Initiative, Activation, Recovery and End of Turn.<br/>Activation uses Funk dice and can be successful (you can do a full action (move, fight, skill)), unsuccessful (you can move cautiously), or a fumble (you lose the initiative). <br/>Street-fighting can be chaotic as citizens, cops and Event Cards can disrupt even the best laid plan. <br/>In a one-off game you have a set amount of money to recruit gang-members and buy weaponry. In campaigns you fight to gain turf that will give funds that helps you recruit new gang members.

The deck consists of 36 cards representing six Brazilian endangered animal species in six different colours with one to six animals per card.  As cards are displayed on the table, children need to associate cards by animal, colour or quantity in order to take as many cards as possible. When the deck runs out, the child with the biggest card collection wins the match. It is important that the child announce his/her move saying &quot;gimme-gimme the panther&quot;, to take all panther cards; &quot;gimme-gimme the blues&quot;, to take all blue cards; or &quot;gimme-gimme the fours&quot; to take all cards with four animals.<br/>As the child grows, new rules add complexity to the game, making it more tactical, as the child receives objective cards. In that case, cards matching the objectives will give him/her extra points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Logical Curling is an abstract game that simulates the game of Curling. Players roll and reroll dice, to try and obtain specific patterns, similar to poker hands, which determine the movement of stones. The higher scoring patterns give players access to more powerful and flexible trajectories - but there are rules that prevent the game from becoming a luck fest.<br/><br/>The stones have to enter the board and slide according to specific, somewhat limited curved trajectories, and they can bump and dislodge other stones already on the board. So, when deciding which dice to reroll, players have to take into consideration not only the numbers they already have, but also the current board state, and what trajectories might become available with those numbers.<br/><br/>The player or team that manages to get their stones closest to the target, and bump the opponent's stones away, scores for the round. The player or team with the highest score after 6, 8 or 10 rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>The game can also be played with a standard deck of cards instead of dice. According to the designer, this variant is more difficult, but also more subtle and interesting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After a brief, but bloody struggle, the beachheads were secured, and the land campaign could begin. The Allied troops would face bitter fighting in the hedgerows of Normandy for the next month before Operation Cobra, the operation to break out from the Normandy beachhead, began. The battle for Normandy would go on for more than two months, with Allied troops pushing south and east into France. It would see counterattacks by the Germans at Mortain, and the closing of the Falaise pocket. It would include the liberation of Paris, and the German retreat across the Seine. At the end of August, the Commonwealth troops in the north would plan to move through the Low Countries, while the Americans attempted to push to the Rhine through Lorraine. The end of the war was growing nearer.<br/><br/>This book presents ten exciting and balanced historical battles for Command Decision covering the fighting in the American sector from June to September 1944. <br/>These scenarios come complete with historical summaries, detailed maps, and carefully-researched orders of battle. <br/>Also included is an overview history of the campaign, as well as complete data charts for the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

They generally fought at night and using radar and radiotelephone, coupled with RAF and fleet air arm support and even secret information from intercepts they fought the Kriegsmarine to a standstill and by 1944, with hugely superior numbers and technological advantage truly ruled any waters which they chose to dominate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He knew that his excellent fleet could not risk significant battles with the Royal Navy, it was a one-shot weapon. The lighter units, particularly the U Boats, did most of the real work on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>The German Navy was only raised in 1871, with a brief to concentrate on the North Sea and Baltic Coasts. Perhaps because of its youth, the Kriegsmarine was quick to appreciate the power of the humble torpedo that could cripple or kill a vessel worth millions of marks. They were thus also keen to develop the promise of the torpedo boat, cheap, potentially deadly and of great use in restricted waters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When performing an ranged attack, she can choose 1 ranged boost - yes, only one - but she will double its effect.

        "description": "Soldiers of Rome is a full battle game, utilizing units of between 8-20 models (cavalry is 4-8 models), in either small fast moving Raids, Field Battles (the standard line-up and fight) or Siege Assaults (one sides gets a fortress to defend, the other attacks it).<br/><br/>It is card-driven, using an action card deck (which will come with the rulebook), to give orders to each of your army's 'Battles'. A 'Battle' is a sub-division of the army, a third of it, either the left, centre or right Battle. These can all act together on the same action card.<br/>The way action cards and Battles interact is governed by your overall Battle Plan, which is a pre-chosen plan of attack (or sometimes defence), which dictates which cards your Battles get for this engagement. These set cards are then added to with random drawn ones, so each game gets an entertaining level of unpredictability, and the cards will never allow a game to be played the same way twice - even if you you used the same forces, over the same terrain, with the same battle plans, the game would still play-out differently.<br/><br/>Picking a force is from one of the three army lists in the game, Roman Legions, Barbarians and Parthians, in a familiar way, except the scenario being played adds restrictions to this. So, Raiding forces look very different to fortress garrison forces or those deployed for a field battle. Each army can be further characterised by its Stratagum, helping, along with the action cards, to bring the character of the army to the fore. Siege Train equipment, ruses and tactics are also available, but only in Siege Assault games.<br/><br/>The rules aren't scale specific, they will be playable at all scales, because the players pick the ground scale and measurements based on their miniatures collection and table-size.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the distributor<br/><br/>",

TimeWarp Warriors is a fighting game for 2 players.<br/><br/>Take control of a Warrior who has been thrust into the TimeStream and play out the final moments of the battle where just two warriors remain.<br/><br/>With victory on the horizon, take on the challenge of being the first to win two rounds. Deal fatal damage to your opponent or push them off the edge of the TimeStream to achieve victory.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player will select a Warrior. Each Warrior has their own play style, deck of cards, and unique shaped meeples. The shape of your Warrior's meeples not only resemble your character but are designed to affect your rolls and land in certain orientations more-so than others.<br/><br/>The balance between defense and attack is key, meeples you don't use to attack carry onto your opponents turn and are used for defense. Leaning into attack may leave you vulnerable defensively but go too heavy on defense and miss out on prime chances to deal damage.<br/><br/>Combo your actions together and unlock Warp Cards to boost your Warrior&rsquo;s abilities or stockpile them for an extra Warp Meeple down-the-line.<br/><br/>Can&rsquo;t keep up with the onslaught of blows from the opponent? Receive the aid of your future self and gain a Shadow Meeple advantage to help you continue the fight.<br/><br/>Show off your strategic prowess, win two rounds and prove yourself as the true TimeWarp Warrior!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Zirak (a brave and cunning human) has infiltrated this foul ceremony in disguise to discover the spelled subject and then escape from there to break the spell.<br/><br/>Dadaan is a compact and quick deduction-based party game that is played in two phases. In the first phase character cards are secretly dealt; Then only Deev reveals his role; Deev is the moderator of this round and, while other players keep their eyes closed, draws a random card and selects one of the subjects on that. Zirak also checks the selected subject without revealing his identity. Then the group will have 3 minutes to discover the subject by asking yes/no questions from Deev. Meanwhile Zirak should give some subtle clues concealed in his question to other players, while keep her/his identity hidden. <br/>The second phase will begin only if the group has guessed the subject correctly before time runs out. Now -with the help of Deev- Dadds have to identify Zirak.<br/>The winner gets the score indicated on the subject card. <br/>The game will be played for one round more than the number of players, and at the end the player who has the highest point, is the winner.<br/><br/>Dadaan is inspired by Insider by 'Oink Games', but it has several major changes when compared to its predecessor: Theme, Story, Character, Roles, Rules, Scoring, Graphic (Illustration &amp; Packaging).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This book of scenarios for 1918 has been chiefly designed with the Bloody Picnic rules in mind, although the games could be played with other rules. These battles provide variety.<br/><br/>While they all involve an attacker and defender, there is plenty of variation on the theme, ranging from a two battalion trench raid up to a divisional attack supported by tanks as well as terrain which includes mountains and river crossings.<br/><br/>Stormtrooper involves the players all taking the part of the attackers, while The Taking of Montdidier is a mini-campaign which can be played as a board game /scenario generator or just as a board game.<br/><br/>All the games can be played with variations in the nationalities being used. For example, The Green Fields is described using Germans attacking the British.

To this end, army lists for multiple nationalities are provided.<br/><br/>Some of these scenarios are suitable to be played solo.

But since the end of the Cold War the pace has picked up, with new wars breaking out from Latin America to Africa, the Middle East or southern Asia. One way of understanding these struggles is to play them out on the tabletop. By taking ourselves through the decision making process we may learn something about those who fight, and perhaps learn to respect those who risk their lives in defence of our own and other cultures.<br/><br/>Contact! is designed to simulate combat between anything from a couple of people to groups of 100 or more, with armoured vehicles, artillery and the full panoply of war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Equipped with the advanced M-1A6 power suit and taught to take the fight to the Arachnids, Pathfinder platoons can be found in every campaign.<br/><br/>With squads having easy access to specialists and advanced weaponry, the Pathfinders represent the pinnacle of the Mobile Infantry, the elite. Often fighting far behind enemy lines, Pathfinder platoons may even enter Arachnid tunnel networks in an effort to exterminate the aliens from the galaxy.<br/><br/>All troopers of the Mobile Infantry have the respect and gratitude of the civilians and citizens of the Federation. Despite the destruction of Buenos Aires that marked the true beginning of the Arachnid War, Earth remains a peaceful and prosperous place and its inhabitants know they have the Mobile Infantry and Mighty Fleet to thank for that. On colony worlds where clashes with the Arachnids come with alarming regularity, support for the military forces of the Federation tends to be much stronger.<br/><br/>The Pathfinders are a cut above the average trooper, even though few civilians or citizens are aware of their existence. They are the troopers that other troopers respect, the highly trained elite. It is the Pathfinders that reconnoiter important strategic positions behind the Arachnid line. They are the troopers tasked with extracting squads cut off by swarms of warrior bugs or entering bug holes to assassinate a potent brain bug. They are granted the best equipment and training the Federation can provide but in return are expected to complete missions that other forces within the Mobile Infantry would deem suicidal.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>     Army List: A complete army list for Pathfinder platoons, including special rules unique to this elite force.<br/>     Painting Guide: Full color pages jam-packed with examples of Pathfinder armies and different paint schemes.<br/>     New Equipment: Complete rules for the new equipment available only to Pathfinder platoons. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Constellars are key counsels to many generals of the Elemental Kings. These prized advisors are sourced for their flair to visualize a cosmic alignment - a strategic placement of worlds that collectively enables massive generation of magical energy crucial in sustaining a significant army.<br/><br/>TKG ARENA: Cosmic Alignments is a game set up for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Components required for this game:<br/>    <br/>WORLD TILES:    48<br/>OINKS:    13 from each element (Default)<br/>LIFE TOKENS:    33 for each player (Default)<br/><br/>Winning Condition<br/><br/>The first player to achieve a Cosmic Alignment &ndash; which is 3 adjacent occupied world tiles bearing the player&rsquo;s chosen Oinks placed across the playing grid linearly in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal manner wins.<br/><br/>If there are no Cosmic Alignments achieved when the game ends, the player with the most victory points wins. Each player will first total up the number of each type of the elemental insignias on all the world tiles he/she has captured at game end. When the elemental insignia matches the elemental type of the player&rsquo;s Oink, it scores 2 victory points, otherwise each elemental insignia scores 1 victory point for the player. If there is a tie, the player with more occupied world tiles, followed by the number of LIFE tokens in play (on the grid) wins. If there is a further tie, the players may rejoice in their joint victory.<br/><br/>Ending Condition<br/><br/>The game will end immediately when one of the following happens:<br/><br/>1.    A Cosmic Alignment is achieved.<br/>2.    All world tiles in the playing grid are fully occupied (with LIFE tokens and/or Oinks).<br/>3.    A player has captured 5 world tiles.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Players are randomly assigned one of the four elements before taking turns to draw 3 world tiles at one time from a stack of shuffled world tiles to place one of them down towards forming a 4 x 4 layout of 16 tiles with the grid sides facing up. The leftover world tiles not placed are reshuffled to form a new world tile stack ready for the game. The schematic below labels each world tile from A to P to facilitate the explanation. Each player takes 13 Oinks and 33 LIFE tokens representing his/her assigned element as his/her personal supply.<br/><br/>A    B    C    D<br/>E    F    G    H<br/>I    J    K    L<br/>M    N    O    P<br/><br/>Within each World Tile (Grid Side)<br/><br/>Within each world tile, we will see that the space is further divided into positions in a 4 X 4 grid and they are labeled from 1 to 16 as seen by the schematic below:<br/><br/>1    2    3    4<br/>5    6    7    8<br/>9    10    11    12<br/>13    14    15    16<br/><br/>Game Flow<br/><br/>The youngest player starts first in clockwise order. The first player may place one of his/her LIFE tokens from his/her personal supply in any of the 16 spaces from any of the 16 world tiles.<br/><br/>Let us assume that it is placed on the world tile A, position 12. The next player can then only place his/her LIFE token in a world tile which is macroscopically aligned to the position of this last placement in the bigger grid. In this case, it will be world tile L.<br/><br/>This player decides to place it at position 2 in world tile L, which means the following player will have to place his/her LIFE token in world tile B (which is aligned macroscopically to position 2 in any world tile.).<br/><br/>A player must put down one of his/her LIFE tokens if there is space in the world tile directed by the previous player. If he/she is directed to an unoccupied world but all the spaces within are taken up, he/she may put her LIFE token on any unoccupied space in any world tile.<br/><br/>When a player runs out of LIFE tokens to be put down on a directed world tile, he/she must take one of his/her own played LIFE tokens from the rest of the world tiles to carry out this action. LIFE tokens already placed on the directed world tile cannot be chosen for this purpose.<br/><br/>Whenever an alignment of 3 LIFE tokens of any player is linearly placed across the grid within a world tile in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal manner; or all spaces in a world tile are occupied with LIFE tokens and a player holds the majority (in the event of a tie in majority, the player that forms the majority later wins), that player must return all LIFE tokens on it to all players and chooses one of these 2 actions:<br/><br/>1.    Flips the world tile over and places one of his/her Oinks on it to occupy it. This world tile is considered occupied. In a subsequent move, if any player is directed to occupied tiles like this one, he/she may choose to place his/her LIFE token on any world tile.<br/><br/>2.    Takes the world tile into his/her personal supply for victory point purposes and replaces this world tile with another from the world tile stack with the grid side facing up. This world tile is considered captured.<br/><br/>If a player decides that the state of a world tile is occupied rather than captured, it will remain so till the end of the game and vice versa. These two states are not inter-changeable once decided during the game.<br/><br/>The game continues with the last placement directing the next player to the next world tile till the ending condition is met.<br/><br/>",

The volunteers and a small detachment that escaped from Detroit at Frenchtown beat back an earlier attack by Canadian militia and their First Nation American allies.

Your mission is to collect soil samples and upload the analysed data.

During the game you will be regularly draw a card from the explore deck and a single element on the card will determine an outcome or provide event relevant information. Each game has a soil data upload target. During your exploration of the Martian terrain you will have to balance energy use for exploration, drilling for soil samples, uploading data and navigating away from rockslides.<br/><br/>Your mission is limited to three days and when you decide to end the day you can repair and recharge your rover. There are, however, opportunities for energy recharging during the day and a push-your-luck mechanism when considering whether to explore further or stop for the day.<br/><br/>The game ends on day 3 and winning is determined on whether you have met your soil data upload target and made it back to base. If your rover ever has 0% energy across drill, gyroscope and battery power, your rover is powerless on Mars and your mission has failed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Paintbrush, like all great strategy games, uses simple mechanics to create complex situations, all made possible by Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. AI-powered game pieces act as both brush and canvas, and players take turns rearranging the dynamic pieces to spread their color onto as many blank canvasses as they can. Simple mechanics mean the game can be picked up easily, but the strategic depth allows for repeated play and the possibility of mastery.<br/><br/>Paintbrush is a game for 2 to 6 players, played with 6 or more Blinks. A typical game of Paintbrush can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, with larger player counts and more Blinks often leading to longer games. Each player selects a unique Paintbrush color, and take turns moving individual Blinks around the board to spread their color onto blank canvasses. A canvas which has been painted entirely with one color becomes a Paintbrush itself. Once all the Blinks have been converted to Paintbrushes, the game is over, and whichever player has the most Paintbrushes wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt two separate hands, a &ldquo;Scoring Hand&rdquo; that determines if they win or lose, and a &ldquo;Playing Hand,&rdquo; whose cards have abilities that they can use to help improve their Scoring Hands.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players are dealt five-card Scoring Hands, and are competing to have the best hand at the end of each round. But there&rsquo;s one problem: While they start the game knowing what their cards are, that can change. Players are also dealt Playing Hands. During the game they will use abilities on these Playing Hand cards to learn about and change their and others&rsquo; Scoring Hands, to try to give themselves the best Scoring Hand possible.<br/><br/>Scoring Hands are ranked similarly (but not exactly) like poker, because each card has one of six suits and number value (from 1 to 7). The number values are important for scoring. Each card also has an ability based on its suit. When you use an ability, state which card(s) its ability is targeting. All abilities (except for bullets) affect Scoring Hand cards.<br/><br/>Beginning with the starting player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player takes a turn playing one card from their Playing Hand. The round ends when no one has any cards left to play. On your turn, must play a card, unless you&rsquo;ve played a bullet card between your last turn and this one. In that case, you may still play a Playing Hand card, but it is optional. Whoever has the highest Scoring Hand at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set on a golden island you must try to outsmart your opponent in a strategic battle that starts right from the very beginning<br/><br/>The island is set on a 12 x 12 playing field. Each player starts the game with one carrier pad and ten tiles which consist of three different characters. The tiles are also reversible, on one side you have your combat unit and the other side is a number that represents that characters firing range. You can choose either side of the tile to play your battle. Plus there&rsquo;s ten communal obstacle block tiles.<br/><br/>Game play <br/>All characters move around the island in the same manner by the roll of a dice which is numbered 0-5. The number rolled on the dice will determine the amount of moves a character can advance to. You will have the option to move your character forward in a straight line, and the option to change direction to the left or right on each move. To remove your opponents characters from the island, your character has to be facing forward towards your intended target in a direct line, and the shot has to be an exact hit matching your characters fire range. An exciting part of the game is the fact that your carrier pad, not only carries your reinforcements but it can also, move along the edge of the island. Now your characters will be able to be launched onto the island from a different position.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>The action starts as soon as you start setting up for the battle ahead.<br/>First take turns in placing one obstacle block at a time onto the island until all ten tiles are on the island, during the battle these can be used for defence or can be activated for attack. Carry on taking turns until you have placed any five of your ten characters onto the island, at this stage you will be keeping a close eye on what your opponent is up to. Your remaining five characters will be placed onto your carrier pad of which is located just off the edge of the island, this is where your reinforcements are located during the battle.<br/><br/>PLAY YOUR TURN<br/>After the setup play will now continue by the roll of the dice. <br/>This is where the action gets real on your turn you will have the option to remove any intended target, providing a direct hit has been established. This action can be done before you move your character and after and as many times as you wish. All movement is determined by the roll of the dice, after which many options will be available to you; move to attack, elude attack, blocking your enemy from movement, activating obstacle blocks, risk taking, launching reinforcements and moving your carrier pad. On your turn you must all ways make your play using the entire number shown on the dice. Failure to do this will result in you losing a character so play well and try not to get yourself trapped. When your happy with all your actions played, you will now pass play over to your opponent who in turn will play their turn.<br/><br/>Carry on taking turns until a player wins by removing all ten of his opponent's characters to become the new ruler.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

While traveling through empty space in Cryonic Torpor, the PIN Drive responsible for Quantum Pinning your vessel to a point in time, allowing near instantaneous travel across light years, has failed. As a failsafe the ship has deactivated your Torpor, meaning you are slowly waking up with only moments to fix the drive and renew your Torpor before the low levels of life support on the ship  can no longer keep you conscious. You must Repair the Drive while manufacturing enough Refrigerant to renew Torpor, all while providing yourself with enough Oxygen and Nutrient to keep moving until you succeed.<br/><br/>Torpor is a single-player roll-and-write in which a player will assign up to five dice to various tasks on their board. Dice must be assigned to both Survival categories (Oxygen and Nutrient) every turn, and may also be assigned to buy Upgrades (such as an additional health or dice) and Repairs, which are needed to win the game. If you can repair both Refrigerant and Drive before running out of Health, you have won the game!<br/><br/>While rolling the dice you may reroll any dice in matching pairs, triples, etc. This provides strategy as you attempt to obtain the dice you will need each turn, and an element of risk as you may decide to reroll &quot;good&quot; dice in order to obtain the pairs you need to reroll &quot;bad&quot; dice. There is also strategy in deciding where to assign your dice, and when to intentionally take damage and work on repairs instead.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arty Mouse: Drawing game was developed to help pre-school children learn colours and shapes. There are two ways to play - an easier and more advanced mode.<br/><br/>In the Basic game mode, every child gets their own wipe-clean board. Then a card with a drawing is chosen. The goal of the game is to be the first one to draw the same drawing with the same colours.<br/><br/>On their turn, a child reveals a card with a shape that determines the shape they can draw. They have to choose a colour and draw all the shapes in this colour exactly as on the card. The winner is the child who completes their drawing first.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game mode, a die determines the colour that the child has to use to draw a shape. But if the colour does not match the original, they get fewer points. They have to decide whether to pass a turn and wait for the perfect opportunity or to get at least some points before someone else finishes their drawing first.<br/><br/>The rules include additional variants for a cooperative and free drawing gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

What most people don't know is that, in order to realize a particular wish, you need cunning and strategy. You will have to capture the right comets to make your dreams come true. But be careful: if you chase love you will hardly realize the desire for richness, the same its true for those who chase fame, at the expense of virtue... Plan your moves carefully, and avoid the traps of your opponent: who first realizes two wishes... wins the game!<br/><br/>Comete is a language-independent, highly thematic strategy game, which hides a fascinating and delicate depth of play.<br/><br/>Comete is a &quot;perfect strategy&quot; game, where all the information is known to all players and the resources available for each player are identical: your choices will make the difference. But it's not an abstract game, shooting stars are elusive and unpredictable, and so they are in the game. No one can know what will be the next fallen star to appear in the sky, even less when the comet you need will appear. Moreover, they exist as in the past comets harbingers of feast or famine and often it will be up to the player to decide how to unravel the celestial message.<br/><br/>To capture a comet you will have to &laquo;attract&raquo; it to you by matching its colours. You have several &laquo;wish fragments&raquo; (acrylic gems) to play each turn, which you must tactically place by line of the celestial horizon: if a comet passing next to them has the same colours, you have captured it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Which attached units do you want to add and how much additional ammo do you want to take. These come at a cost of a time/VP deduction. <br/>Flip a chit and obey the instructions, chits allow platoons or groups to be activated, as well as passing of time, mortar actions, minefields and wire activations, random events etc. When one of your platoons is activated you give the platoon one of four orders, Hold, Advance, Assault or Recce. These orders allow your sections to make an action. As well as the usual combat,  movement and morale test other actions include spotting and special commanders actions such as the off map 3&quot; mortar and sending a runner to replenish ammo. Certain orders will make the chosen actions easier to execute and more successful. A Hold order for example will not allow a move action, although a regroup action is possible. A Recce order will allow you to spot easier and not to be spotted by the enemy as easily but will not allow you to enter into combat.<br/><br/>After the action phase has been completed for your platoon, a paragraph check is made. This will allow you to spot enemy units, buildings, bridges, be aware of any terrain modifiers within the hex. The level of awareness is attached to the actions and orders of your platoon. If you go charging around the map with an Assault order, don't be surprised to run into mines and wire and making the enemy aware of your position without spotting them in return as well as having less command over these units.<br/><br/>The VPs are directly connected to the number of turns it takes to complete the game. But do not get complacent as you are never sure what lies ahead until you have read that last paragraph.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grab your family, friends and get ready for a shoe-throwing good time! Inspired by popular memes like #growingupblack, #growinguplatino, #growingupasian, and of course grandmothers and mothers of every culture, we bring you Angry Moms. It's a crazy fun game that involves some strategy, a little luck and an uncanny ability to dodge getting hit with house shoes, beach sandals, and chanclas.<br/><br/>How to play: Put the slippers on the table and deal 7 cards to each player. Set the deck on the table face-down to be the draw pile, and turn over the top card to start the discard pile. Take turns putting matching chore cards down on the discard pile. You can match on chore or color. Special action cards match every color. When an Angry Mom card is played, anyone can grab a slipper and throw it at someone else; the person hit has to pick up 5 cards from the draw pile. The first person with no cards left in their hand is the winner; or you can play until only one person is left.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Open Seas is a pen and paper solo sandbox game. Controlling a captain and a first mate, navigate an endless archipelago filled with dangerous creatures, hidden treasures, and bustling cities. How you manage to survive dangers on land and at sea while paying expenses and maintaining morale will be up to you: explore, trade, fish, hunt for treasure, complete quests, upgrade your ship, build a base, and gain new abilities as your characters level up. But time is not on your side: many quests need to be completed quickly, treasure hunts may yield nothing if you linger, businesses may close down, and an ever-growing evil presence makes all challenges more difficult with each passing day.<br/><br/>To play the game, you need to print or reproduce a Characters sheet, a Locations sheet, and a Navigation sheet found at the end of the rule book (you may need additional copies of the last two). You also need a 10-sided die or two (to roll a d100), a pen, a pencil, and an eraser.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The mere mention of his name is enough to give even the most hardened criminals pause.<br/><br/>Dredd has been appointed a temporary member of the Council of Five on several occasions. However, he is only truly content when patrolling the streets dispensing the law directly and his well-known dislike of bureaucracy keeps him well away from the Hall of Justice.<br/><br/>If it is true that a man can be measured by the quality of his enemies then Dredd will take some beating. Over the years, he has clashed with mad Chief Judges, transdimensional denizens of Deadworld, super agents of the Sov Bloc, necromancers and powerful mutant pre-cogs. Yet it&rsquo;s probably safe to say that from Dredd&rsquo;s perspective bringing one of these individuals to justice is no more important than the prosecution of a citizen for littering or a juve for spraying graffiti on a wall.

Unfortunately, like so many of his colleagues, he had an unhealthy obsession with Judge Dredd. Not only had the venerable Judge been instrumental in exposing the worst excesses of the SJS under Judge Cal, he also represented the one thing that the SJS could simply not process: an incorruptible Judge.<br/><br/>For several years, Gerhart pursued a vendetta against Dredd to uncover some transgression, no matter how small. While investigating the death of a Tek Judge, he unsuccessfully tried to force Dredd to admit having a guilty conscience about the 350 million citizens who fell to the Chaos Virus, a bio‐weapon unleashed by Sov agents in revenge for Dredd destroying East‐Meg One.<br/><br/>Ultimately Gerhart&rsquo;s obsession with Dredd would cost him dearly. He saved Dredd&rsquo;s life by taking the impact of a missile meant for his nemesis. He simply could not let Dredd die before guilt was fully proven.

Because play is simultaneous, it doesn't matter if there is a single dealer, or if the job is shared between players.<br/><br/>Players play six hands, each consisting of several rounds.  On each round, players will play one card and (usually) pick up one card from the center of the table.  The played cards are collected into a tableau, which is a sequence of cards that is worth points at the end of the hand.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score after six hands wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Number cards are worth their face value, but only if they are larger than all cards played before them.<br/>     Face cards are worth five points each, and they do not follow the same ordering rules as number cards.  They can be anywhere.<br/>     If your last card follows the ordering rules it scores double, unless you were the last player, in which case it scores normally.<br/>     Cards in your hand are worth negative points, unless they are duplicated in your hand, in which case they are worth zero.<br/><br/><br/>The best you can typically score is 35 points, with three 5-point cards, one 6, and a doubled 7, as well as a zero point hand.  This is called a Showboat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saturday Legends is the followup game to the highly successful Friday Night Legends. This time, you coach the greatest college football teams of all time against each other based on their actual stats.<br/><br/>The core of the SL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.<br/><br/>The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your college gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them. SL's elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets. Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple score pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. SL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of college football.<br/><br/>The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their college football team universe.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of two phases: the Planning Phase and the Execution Phase.<br/><br/>During the Planning Phase, the player recruits and uses Key Leaders from the KGB, GRU, and the Army to mobilize tactical units for 8 specific targets, collect intelligence, perform special tasks, and conduct rehearsals. Random events and player activities may affect the level of operational support from the Power Ministries, the alert level of the Afghan defenders, and the intelligence available on each target.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the Planning Phase, the player starts the Execution Phase. During this phase, the player completes 8 tactical missions with the assigned Key Leaders and tactical units in sequential order on point-2-point maps. A unique version of chit-activation determines initiative to ensure a fluid combat system. The player has at their disposal KGB spetsnaz, GRU special troops, and Airborne (VDV) infantry and armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>Victory points are measured by the views of Politburo, General Staff, GRU, KGB, the Afghan Government, the Afghan people, the United States, and the international community on the operation's outcome.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Riot Quest chaos continues with the new Wintertime Wasteland starter box! After plundering and looting all they could find in the more civilized corners of the Iron Kingdoms, the heroes (and villains) of Riot Quest are headed to the strange, frozen north in search of more treasure.<br/><br/>This starter is fully compatible with all previous Riot Quest releases and kicks off a brand new block of post-apocalyptic, winter-themed models and expansions for the game. Wintertime Wasteland introduces new Arena maps, new Bounty and Treasure decks, and loads of new beautifully sculpted Hero models.<br/><br/>The Wintertime Wasteland also introduces exciting new game mechanics, like ultra-powerful Legendary Riot Gear and Tag-Team Heroes (that's two Heroes combining their efforts to work as single game piece in your Crew).<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re new to Riot Quest, Wintertime Wasteland is a perfect starting point to take the icy plunge into the loot-questing lifestyle. And if you&rsquo;re a veteran scavenger with a seasoned Crew, Wintertime Wasteland is ripe with new blood to add to your Bench.<br/><br/>So, get your fightin&rsquo; pants on! It&rsquo;s time to gear up, wreck face, and get paid!<br/><br/>In Riot Quest, players assemble a crew of 5&ndash;10 Heroes and an equal number of Riot Gear cards to compete with up to three other players in a chaotic battle to score treasure and rack up victory points in an Arena.<br/><br/>Each round, players alternate taking turns by activating one of their Heroes to perform various actions, such as running around the Arena, attacking Enemies, or raiding Treasure Chests. A player has a limited pool of Action Dice to spend each round, with at least one die being spent for each action a Hero performs.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, Treasure Chests will randomly appear around the Arena, which a Hero can raid to gain valuable Loot. Loot is spent to purchase the Riot Gear a player selected at the beginning of the game. This Riot Gear upgrades that player&rsquo;s Heroes.<br/><br/>Bounty cards represent the goals each player is attempting to achieve in order to score Victory Points and ultimately win the game. These Bounty cards might require a player&rsquo;s Hero to do a certain amount of damage to an Enemy during their turn, to interact with a specific token that was put into play by the Bounty card via a rig action, or any number of other possible goals. Every time a player meets the goals of a Bounty card, that player claims that card and its associated Victory Point value.<br/><br/>Claiming Bounty cards isn&rsquo;t the only way a player can score Victory Points. By attacking and knocking out Enemies, a player can claim Scrap cards, which are also worth Victory Points.<br/><br/>As Treasure Chests are raided, Bounty cards are claimed, and Heroes are knocked out, they are constantly being replaced at the start of each turn. This means the Arena is a dynamic battlefield with constantly evolving conditions and situations. To achieve victory in Riot Quest, a player needs the right tools at the right time, the cunning and foresight to react to the chaos of the Arena, and a little bit of luck.<br/><br/>-description from kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayTo start, Black places a black stone on an empty point. From then on, starting with White, the players take turns. On your turn, you must perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Drop: Select a 2x2 area including one or more empty points, such that no other 2x2 areas include all those empty points as well as at least another empty point. Then place a stone of your color on each empty point in the selected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Flip: Replace the two enemy stones in a crosscut with stones of your color. A crosscut is a 2x2 area of the board containing two diagonally adjacent black stones and two diagonally adjacent white stones.<br/><br/><br/>You win by completing a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariants<br/>     Pie: To start, Black places between one and four black stones on different points of a 2x2 area of the board. The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Checkered: The game starts with the board fully covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the two possible checkered setups may be used. If the pie rule is used, Black starts by replacing one or two white stones in a single crosscut with black stones. Otherwise, Black starts by replacing any white stone with a black stone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     2x2 checkered: Same as checkered, but the initial checkered pattern is made of 2x2 blocks of same-color stones.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Unlike Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Hamilton, Aaron Burr came from American royalty &mdash; a founding father descended from the original puritanical stock that arrived in Plymouth. His father was the second president of Princeton. His grandfather was Jonathan Edwards, the philosopher-theologian who wrote &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; perhaps the most important American literary work of its time.<br/><br/>So in 1776, if you were going to identify any of the Founders who would later stand trial for treason to his country, Aaron Burr would be the least likely &mdash; yet Burr's journey as an enormous talent born under a dark star is now well known. Less well understood is that when he shot Alexander Hamilton in the early morning hours of July 11, 1804, it would set in motion a chain of events much more bizarre than anything depicted on Broadway.<br/><br/>Aaron Burr never stood trial for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His trial was for treason, three years later, at the insistence of the Thomas Jefferson, the man Burr had narrowly lost to in the contested election of 1800. An embittered and politically ruined Burr seemed to have developed a scheme to separate the new Louisiana Purchase territories from the United States and declare himself king over the new entity. When Jefferson learned of the plot, he ordered Burr's arrest and publicly declared him guilty of treason.<br/><br/>United States v. Aaron Burr: The Treason Trial of America's Third Vice President, a card-driven game for two players, recreates the treason trial of Aaron Burr in Richmond in 1807. But by accident of recent judicial reforms, Thomas Jefferson's detested cousin, Chief Justice John Marshall, would be riding circuit and would preside over the case. The resulting legal contest would read like a list of who's who of America's Founding Fathers.<br/><br/>United States vs. Aaron Burr is a fast-playing card-driven game in which players seek to use events, evidence, and witnesses of Burr's activities to convince a jury to return a guilty verdict &mdash; or if playing for the defense, persuade at least one juror to find Aaron Burr not guilty. Each round, players have the opportunity to question witnesses, persuade jurors, and make points of law to the Chief Justice which will aid them in their cause. The game highlights all the events and participants surrounding one of the most important trials in American Constitutional Law &mdash; setting the precedent that the President of the United States is NOT immune from legal court orders, a precedent very much cited by the Supreme Court today.<br/><br/>So try your hand as a great litigator in a great trial. Perhaps you will even find yourself smiling more and talking less!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "カッパたん (Kappa tan) is a Japanese game with water.<br/><br/>In Japanese folklore, there is a Yokai called Kappa. Kappa is small humanoid that lives in rivers and waterways. The top of its head is formed like a crown or a dish, and the Kappa must keep water in it to stay healthy. If the Kappa spills or dries out, it suffers and dies.<br/><br/>In this game, the Kappa is an inverted paper cut with the base cut into the crown. Players take turns to add water to the crown using straws. A player dips the straw into a glass of water, puts their finger on the open end, and draws the straw out. Then they put the straw to the crown and release the water. The next player does the same and so forth.<br/><br/>Gradually the crown fills, until only surface tension is holding the water in. Eventually, a player adds enough water to break the surface and the water spills, and that player loses.<br/><br/>The crown design means that it takes a surprising amount of water to break. Players start taking up less and less water, and the other players mock their lack of nerve.<br/><br/>The game was originally hand-made and as well as a full sized Kappa, the game also has a mini Kappa for a quicker result. The game can be played by young children and adults alike.<br/><br/>In 2019, a professional version was made by itten, Kappa Bros!.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

To categorize it, Chlorination is a strategic, card-based board game that consists of a number of competitions. During the game, you&rsquo;ll need to choose your actions carefully. You&rsquo;ll also need to plan your economy and most importantly you&rsquo;ll need to practice enough to win the competitions throughout the game. The recommended age is from 12 years old and the game is for 2-5 players.<br/><br/>The game consists of eight competitions in total, two in each swimstyle; backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle. Before and between every competition, every player get five actions. The actions can be found on the game board and you can either work to earn coins, you'll need coins to pay competition fees and for other things. But you can also practice using skill cards. Whenever you work you earn a certain number of coins and skill cards depending on where you choose to work. Whenever you practice you move your cube on the score table the number that skill card shows. The player with the highest skill level in the the swimstyle of a competition wins and the player with the most medals wins the game in the end. A gold, a silver and a bronze medal are handed out every competition.<br/><br/>Watch the tutorial to learn more about the game of Chloriantion.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The winner becomes the leader of the Elite Bot Army. The Age of the Human is over, the Age of the Bot begins! Go Droid!<br/><br/>In Alpha Steel, players control futuristic bots on the planet of Ibun. The goal is to defeat all other bots and remain the last player standing, inside the arena.<br/><br/>Everyone starts outside the arena with 1 rookie bot, 70,000 Azol (Azol- the currency in the game), 10 energy tokens, and 2 power cards. Each player starts with a rookie bot but can purchase a master bot during the game. On your turn, you will roll both dice.<br/><br/>From each dice you can: gain energy or 30,000 azol or attack other players&rsquo; bots. If you roll the same on both dice, you get double! For each attack you roll, your bot deals damage to other bots. The amount of damage you cause is written on your bot card. If you&rsquo;re inside the arena, you attack everyone else. But if you&rsquo;re outside the arena, you will only attack whoever is inside.<br/><br/>At the start, everyone is outside and the first player to roll an attack, enters the arena. All the other bots suffer damage. If you wish to leave the arena, you must wait till someone attacks you. Then, you pay the damage and exit. The player who had attacked you, must enter the arena.<br/><br/>If you stay in the arena for one whole round, you get 30,000 Azol after your dice roll. When you are inside, you can never gain health.<br/><br/>Power cards give your bots special strengths. you can play only one power card on your turn and must give it up after use. Some power cards can be played anytime. At no point can you have more than 2 power cards with you. Each power card has cost price and a profit or loss percentage mentioned in them. So, when you sell a card you do so either at a profit or a loss. All power cards sell at 50% loss, while all rookie bots sell at 50% profit. You can buy only one power card or a bot at the end of your turn. But, if you are inside the arena, you can buy a power card or bot anytime. If another player attacks you and you cannot pay Azol, you can sell your power card to get azol, otherwise you are eliminated. If you ever run out of energy tokens, you are eliminated!<br/><br/>When only two players remain in the game, it is the final duel. Both their bots enter the arena. You cannot buy any power cards or bots. you also cannot get energy or azol from dice.However, you can use the power cards you already have. The duel continues till a player is eliminated.<br/><br/>A round of play:<br/>Your turn begins by rolling both dice. Then, you can play your power card. Other players cannot play a power card unless it is a play anytime card. Now, resolve the dice roll. remember if you are inside, you attack everyone. if you are outside, you only attack the person inside. Next, you can buy a power card or a bot. the player inside can buy anytime, other players can buy only on their turn. If the player inside wants to exit, they must do it now. If they exit, you must enter the arena. A player cannot exit if you did not roll an attack. Your turn ends.<br/><br/>Alpha Steel is a strategy based board game that is perfect for all ages. Whether it&rsquo;s game night with friends, weekends with family or to combine the power of learning and play for kids, the board game provides an awesome experience for all. Enjoy as you use your robot&rsquo;s special powers and tactics to vanquish other bots and lead the entire bot army.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Naval War is a Tabletop Naval Miniatures Game designed to be played on a table-sized battle area with World War Two ship miniatures. The rules and any gaming aids needed for play are free and available for download on the site. The game is not tied to a specific miniatures line and is suited for many different game scales (1:1800 - 1:6000)<br/><br/>Naval War is a game, not a simulation. The aim of the game is to recreate the feeling and immersion you get when reading the battle reports of famous sea battle like the Battle of the Coral Sea or the battle of the Java Sea. The focus lies on the action and on the ships on the table, so a lot of the technical details have been worked into easy to read datacards and quick game mechanics.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the game is your fleet's Command Station which is used to issue order to your fleet and activate the different squadrons of ships, planes and subs. Let your fleet perform actions like maneuvering, attacking and launching carrier aircraft but also special Command station actions that will allow your fleet to perform above and beyond the call of duty: Perform evasive maneuvers as a response to enemy fire or appeal to the British sense of duty to keep your ship in the fight when others would have broken off. Try to place that one critical hit or lay down smoke to shield your carriers from enemy fire.<br/><br/>You are however not the only hero in this game; your opponent may (and will) try to disrupt your actions which may result in your attempt at flank speed backfiring because of an engine malfunction! This dynamic, in combination with the activation-based game sequence makes sure both players stay continually involved in the game. It also allows the players to have just that little bit of extra influence on Lady Luck. Underlying all this are solid game mechanics for modeling surface combat, air attacks and submarine actions with a balance between simplicity, gaming comfort and realistic outcomes.<br/><br/>Naval War is a so-called &lsquo;living rule-set&rsquo; so any suggestions, feedback and additions are taken very seriously resulting in regular updates and expansions. Crowd-sourcing is also one of the strategies employed to generate content, so if you got this special ship, scenario, campaign or other contribution to the system, join the community and make it part of the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In each of the four rounds, you sail to up to four islands and take one resource (decided by which port you sail to, by drawing a line onto the map). After each round, you return to your ship and deliver the treasure. <br/>However, the lines you draw may not cross each other, so you will have to plan ahead carefully. Also, ports on each island are numbered I to III, and you cannot go to the same number or to a different port on the same island twice in a row. For each resource you grab you get points. The goal is to score as many points as possible during the four rounds.<br/><br/>In the multiplayer game, players keep their maps hidden. They take turns being the captain and announcing the number of the port everyone has to sail to.<br/><br/>Players can use one of the maps included in the game, or draw their own at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>",
