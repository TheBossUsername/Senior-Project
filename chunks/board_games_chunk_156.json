As he worked on his next novel (which would eventually become Cat&rsquo;s Cradle) he needed to supplement his income with other endeavors.<br/><br/>One of those efforts was an original board game called GHQ (General Headquarters). He designed it throughout 1956 and attempted to sell it to game companies, an effort that was ultimately unsuccessful. His notes on the game were filed away and Vonnegut&rsquo;s GHQ was lost to us.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>GHQ is a fast and strategic two player battle game. Played on a standard 8x8 checkerboard, players command infantry, armored vehicles, artillery, and the powerful airborne regiment, maneuvering to capture the opposing Headquarters. Can you skillfully use real-world combined arms tactics and call<br/>on reinforcements at the right time to turn the tide of battle?<br/><br/>This first edition of GHQ features deluxe wooden pieces and a 24 page commentary booklet, showing Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s actual design notes to give insight into his creative process.<br/><br/>",

The winner will gain ultimate control! But beware: the enemy warriors are not the only threat you face. The island itself, with its explosive eruptions and treacherous grounds, is just as dangerous.<br/><br/>In this fun strategy game, you play cards to move your warriors to strategic positions on the board; you then roll the Doom Dice to manipulate the island itself. As the Island gets smaller and smaller, you must do all you can to keep as many of your warriors alive: Create majorities on tiles, push enemy warriors off the island and stay clear of the explosions.

Instead of focusing on the obscene (Cards Against Humanity) or generic (Apples to Apples), it focuses on themes relevant to the players. For example, if playing with your Dungeons and Dragons group the deck may include cards referencing notable events from your campaigns.<br/><br/>The game is played as follows (from game booklet): At the beginning of each round, each player draws until they have 10 White Cards. A player is selected as the first Card Commander and plays a Red Card. They read the question or phrase on the card with authority and demand other players submit their most entertaining (&amp; appropriate) White Card. Each other player submits a White Card, face down, to the Card Commander. After shuffling the other players' submitted cards, the Card Commander reads each possible Red-White card pairing to the group. The Card Commander then decides whose White Card is most entertaining (&amp; appropriate) and that player gets one point. The next round, a different Card Commander is selected to dispense more Mandatory Fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this competitive story-building game, players will be playing as &quot;Creeps&quot; and will create deliciously horrible stories and send bad people to their well deserved demises.<br/><br/>The game is played with Story cards and suspense cards to build stories for villain cards. Story cards work together to form a chain that tells a story for each villain in three acts. Suspense cards are the fuel that makes the story work!<br/><br/>On your turn, you will have the choice to either &quot;Creep&quot; or &quot;Show&quot;!<br/><br/>When you &quot;Creep&quot; you may first discard any number of Story cards in your hand you no longer want and then draw back up to 7. Then you must play a Suspense card (valued -2,1,2,or 3) face down to any villain's stack so other player's won't know what you played!<br/><br/>When you &quot;Show&quot; you may play a story card from your hand to a villain's story chain. These will have various effects from earning points, looking at suspense already there, and adding suspense cards of your own!<br/><br/>Occasionally, these story cards will have a branching path on them, where you can choose both how the story goes and make a guess at how much suspense this villain has accumulated. If the suspense is equal to or more than your choice you'll earn some points and adjust the suspense stack in some way before the next turn.<br/><br/>When a villain is in act 3 of their story, you could instead use the &quot;Show&quot; action to play an available ending card in an high/low outcome to potentially score big points! If you also happen to have the most suspense on the Villain and you get the higher outcome where the villain meets their end, you'll also score the villain card!<br/><br/>HOWEVER, if you play an ending and get the lower outcome and the villain escapes, other devious players with suspense on that villain will score a few points instead and no one will score the villain card! Hopefully, they at least learned their lesson!<br/><br/>When you reach the bottom of the villain deck, you'll face a major villain which will be worth more points than the normal villain and far more deserving of the vile twists and turns you have in store for them!<br/><br/>BUT BE WARNED! If a major villain escapes, the player who attempted to end their story cannot win the game!<br/><br/>The game ends when the major villain's story does.<br/><br/>No matter your strategy, use your suspense cards wisely and try not to let any of the villains escape the fates they've worked so hard to earn...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",
