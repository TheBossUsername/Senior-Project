        "description": "Dice Castles is a quick to play, easy to learn, puzzle game that plays solo or with up to 6 players! It's a game all about moving a D6 die through a castle card. But along that way you may run into ice, warps, time shifts, gravity switches, bombs and more...<br/><br/>Solo: dice castles can be played solo as either a quick single puzzle (of 17 different puzzles) to try to navigate to all 5 goals OR it can be a solo adventure to try and explore to all 10 castles in one run, starting from a single random castle card. There are also 16 challenging scenarios in addition to all this.<br/><br/>Multiplayer: Multiplayer is a hectic and fun real-time race to get to all 5 goals on a single castle card before the other players do. But if you get stuck, your points at that moment is what you score for the round. The first player to all 5 goals wins OR the player who made it to the most by the end of a run. Beware however, gravity and time aren't what they seem to be - especially in multiplayer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Recruits is a popular card game played by the critters in the forests of Wrenwood. It combines elements of strategy, luck, hand management, and blind bidding, making it an exciting and competitive game. It is played in taverns as gamblers wager bets and by travelers wanting to pass the time at night during camp. The game has been around so long that many variations have surfaced.<br/><br/>Players try to outbid each other to draft the best team of Recruits, earning the most points to win. Several Recruits are available to bid on at a time, each with different point values. Players take turns laying down cards in bids for the highest total pair of cards in hopes of claiming the Recruit. With restrictions on what cards can be placed for bidding, players will block other players, stall recruitment, and force others to waste cards, all while carefully managing their hands and planning the next move. When all the bids are placed for a given Recruit, the pile is resolved, and the Recruit goes to the highest bidding player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest point total in Recruits wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game system is also remarkable for the battle plans that each players may choose before starting the engagement.<br/><br/>Sieges played a key role in the battles of Nagashino and Okehazama, and as such have their own specific set of rules.

        "description": "HARK! VENGEANCE cries your name, demanding you redress the iniquities of crime. Crime&rsquo;s roots run deep. Crime is a festering corruption that spews a stench of despair and chaos. Crime is a dread phantom that makes the innocent quake in fear. But crime is also a crucible, forging its own demise in you, the hardened force of bone-crushing justice, the lone fighter, ready to trade blows with the wicked and trace every vile villain to his secret lair.<br/><br/>Hark! Vengeance is a card game for 1 player. You control a lone fighter, punching and kicking through hordes of enemies to find the bosses at the head of a possibly endless criminal conspiracy. The game emulates &ldquo;beat-em-up&rdquo; video games, as your hero progresses through various stages filled with low-level foes, obstacles, hazards, power-ups, and secrets that will help you progress deeper. It&rsquo;s no sweat to find rascals who need to be taken down, but you&rsquo;re out for revenge against the deepest villains in the criminal conspiracy. Each game will see you revisit stages, discover five new challenges, and face off against a boss who is part of the criminal conspiracy. The deeper your journey into the criminal underworld takes you, the greater the glory, the colder the vengeance, and the higher the score you achieve.<br/><br/>This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that you will create and modify many of the components during play, principally index cards. Each copy of Hark! Vengeance will evolve differently, with stages and bosses posing different challenges and opportunities. Moreover, should you complete the deck and jump into a sequel, there is no limit to the number of stages you can explore or despicable bosses you can beat down.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Attention to all units, a murder has occurred&quot;. Witnesses immediately alerted the Homicide Division of the city's Police Station. The crime scene is being investigated without knowing that among the officers is the Killer. Furthermore, there might be an Accomplice diverting the investigation so that the culprit is never revealed. Will they manage to uncover the murderer in time?<br/><br/>&quot;Asuntos Internos&quot; is an exciting hidden roles game for 4 to 8 players that puts them in the shoes of forensic detectives investigating a mysterious murder. One player secretly takes on the role of the killer, while the rest of the players act as investigators working together to solve the case.<br/><br/>The main objective of &quot;Asuntos Internos&quot; is to solve a murder by accusing the killer before time runs out. Players must collaborate to identify the killer and gather enough evidence to bring them to justice.<br/><br/>The Killer wins the game if, by the end, they haven't been discovered (if there are Accomplices in the game, they also share the victory as the Killer wasn't uncovered).<br/><br/>The Innocent Police win the game if they manage to discover the Killer, revealing their role through Evidence and Investigations.<br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;&iexcl;Atenci&oacute;n a todas las unidades, ha ocurrido un asesinato!&rdquo; Testigos inmediatamente dieron aviso a la divisi&oacute;n de homicidios de la Polic&iacute;a de la ciudad. La escena del crimen est&aacute; siendo investigada sin saber que entre los uniformados est&aacute; el Asesino. Adem&aacute;s, podr&iacute;a haber un C&oacute;mplice que est&eacute; desviando la investigaci&oacute;n para que nunca se sepa el culpable. &iquest;Lograr&aacute;n descubrir al asesino a tiempo?<br/><br/>Asuntos Internos es un emocionante juego de roles ocultos de 3 a 8 jugadores que los sit&uacute;a en el papel de detectives forenses que investigan un misterioso asesinato. Uno de los jugadores asume en secreto el papel del asesino, mientras que el resto de los jugadores representan a los investigadores que trabajar&aacute;n juntos para resolver el caso.<br/><br/>El objetivo principal de Asuntos Internos es resolver un asesinato acusando al asesino antes de que el tiempo se agote. Los jugadores deben trabajar juntos para identificar al asesino y recopilar pruebas suficientes para llevarlo ante la justicia.<br/><br/>&bull; El Asesino gana la partida si al final del juego no logr&oacute; ser descubierto (si hubiera C&oacute;mplices en la partida, estos tambi&eacute;n comparten la victoria debido a que el Asesino no logr&oacute; ser descubierto).<br/><br/>&bull; Los Polic&iacute;as Inocentes ganan la partida si logran descubrir al Asesino, revelando su Rol por medio de Evidencias e Investigaciones.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "mob7 (もぶセブン) is a shedding card game from Japan, similar to Old Maid. In mob7, players are shedding cards from their hand so that the value totals to 7 exactly. Any combination of cards is allowed, even seven 1s, as long as it is  exactly 7 in total.<br/><br/>The deck is formed of one 7, two 6s, three 5s and so on, and also only four 0s. The deck is shuffled and the cards dealt out. A player starts by drawing a random card from their right hand neighbour's hand, and then lays down a 7 combo if they can. Going clockwise, the next player then draws a random card from their hand and play continues.<br/><br/>If a player is able to empty their hand, either by shedding or having their last hand card drawn from them, they are out for the round. The remaining players continue until one is left, who is the loser of the game.<br/><br/>「ババ抜きのようでババ抜きじゃない そんなゲームです」　基本的な進行と勝利条件はババ抜きのようですが、捨てるカードは同じ数同士ではありません。０〜７の数字のカードを足し合わせて７になるセットを１組捨てていきます。足して７にさえなれば、足し合わせて捨てるカードは３枚以上でも構いません（１が７枚でも可能）。最も早く手札を全てなくした人の勝利です。<br/>使用するカードは数字は７が１枚、６が２枚・・・（０のみ４枚）言ったように階段状に異なる枚数の３２枚です。<br/>--description by user<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the game of Invaluable, players are directors of competing museums. They buy and sell artifact cards, to amass high scoring collections, or to just get rich. Either approach can win you the game!<br/><br/>The order in which players offer artifact cards determines the value of those cards, so players must carefully time their actions. Running out of money at the wrong time can ruin your plans! Of course, you should try to make sure that exact thing happens to your opponents!<br/><br/>On their turn, a player puts a card from their hand up for auction. If another player wins the auction, the original player is paid the winning bid. But if the original player wins the auction, the money is removed from the game. Cards that are won at auction are placed in the winning player&rsquo;s museum tableau following very simple rules.<br/><br/>Once every card has been sold, the game is over. Artifacts in museums are worth points depending on how they are positioned relative to other artifacts. Subsequently, the same artifact can be worth different amounts to different players. Coins are also worth points, opening up another possible route to victory for shrewd artifact sellers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take actions in different areas of the kitchen as they prepare, plate, and improve ingredients (dice), building the perfect 4-course meal for the restaurant&rsquo;s VIP guests. Kitchen space and ingredients are limited, and players need to be strategic as they manage personal and shared resources.<br/><br/>Players will control a unique kitchen station where they manage a custom pool of ingredients (dice), workers, and special actions. Players select a chef who will lead their station; Chef&rsquo;s have own unique talents that boost performance as they visit different areas of the kitchen.<br/><br/>Players allocate workers throughout the kitchen, where they use personal or shared ingredients in different ways. The team earns Favor Points for each completed menu item, but will lose points for incomplete items, or ingredients that don&rsquo;t meet Chef E&rsquo;Lahn&rsquo;s standards. Each course is more challenging than the last, requiring more ingredients, higher ingredient quality (dice value), or both.<br/><br/>Service and Course Challenge cards modify how the kitchen operates or  elevate the standards for one or more menu items. The difficulty imposed by challenge cards will also escalate, so be prepared! Players can also play against a course timer (Clocked-In mode), which requires even more cooperation and communication.<br/><br/>Think you&rsquo;ve earned your promotion? Compare the team&rsquo;s final score to Chef E&rsquo;Lahn&rsquo;s service standards: a set of scoring criteria by which your performance is evaluated. Each game, record your team&rsquo;s name on Achievement Cards. Try new combinations of chefs and stations, ramp of the difficulty of the game by using challenge cards, and test your team to achieve your culinary dreams!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If the vote is in favor of the active team, their dibs is upheld in that space and may move forward with any further dibs they have. However, If the vote swings toward the contesting team, the active team is done calling dibs and a penalty is placed on them for trying to pull a fast one.<br/><br/>At the end of a team's turn, any blank spaces are refilled with new category cards and the active team switches.

The aphelia are the new frontier for individuals looking to make a new life and corporations looking to expand their wealth. They are the backwaters of the civilized universe, populated by outlaws, anarchists, traitors, and runaways.<br/><br/>In Aphelion you&rsquo;ll play as Grims - those who have set out to the aphelia to make a name for themselves. Aphelion is fully co-operative, and players take turns simultaneously. Each turn players gain actions by activating the tech on their ship or suit, calling on their crew&rsquo;s talents, and using unique Grim abilities. These actions allow Grims to move through and interact with the diverse world of Aphelion. Grims will fly to the far reaches of space, land on and explore the surfaces of planets, and develop the frontier outposts that populate the aphelia. Based on their adventures and exploits, grims gain credits and notoriety allowing them to purchase and unlock powerful abilities and tech.<br/>Aphelion is designed to be extremely replayable; each of the 5 grims has a unique deck of asset and milestone cards, there are hundreds of different cards to add to your tableau, the board is modular and has a random configuration each game, and there are endless strategies to pursue.<br/><br/>Each time you play Aphelion you choose from a variety of scenarios with a range of playtimes from 60-240 minutes. Since each scenario has different goals and challenges, your win condition changes from game to game. Scenarios have players hunting down exotic creatures and discovering the source of a mysterious signal, but exploring the frontier doesn&rsquo;t come without risk. How you deal with the beings in your way is up to you - will you use diplomacy, bribes, and deception, or put &lsquo;em down the old fashioned way?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object is simple: Survive at any cost &mdash; and remove the alien threat before it kills you all.<br/><br/>In a round, you will be dealt two cards. Each can be played as either your position on the ship (i.e., where you are) or an action (what you do). On a turn, you play one card, then after everyone has finished, play reverses and comes back around, with you playing the second card for whatever you didn't choose the first time. Thus, you always have one position and one action.<br/><br/>Then the alien's location is revealed. If you share that location and you have the highest priority number, you're dead. If a crew member's action kills you, you're dead. In fact, death comes pretty quickly in this game &mdash; then ten minutes later, you are all jumping back in to play again. With a bit of skill and luck, however, you may be able to isolate the alien at one of the locations that let you jettison it into space, along with any fellow crew members who happen to be there.<br/><br/>This isn't a deduction game; it's horror survival...if horror survival were funny.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The setting of the game reproduces an educational miniature model of the downfall of a Fiat monetary standard compared with the regenerative opportunities for human life under a Bitcoin standard.<br/><br/>Both players develop their Agora made up of hexagonal tiles, collect energy or monetary tokens and defend themselves from the Castle, the evil apparatus that parasitizes the economy of the game through violence and tax withdrawals. Different and independent winning conditions create challenging and always different games. Players can win by Spiritual, Technological or Evil Superiority.<br/><br/>Both have to accumulate points under 8 different score criteria to pass their Self-Examination of Soul in the Mirror for Spiritual Superiority. Tokens, acquired in the form of energy or money, collected on the market or by the Hodl'em Poker hands, can be converted into points. By distributing the points differently, it's possible to carry out the available actions more or less successfully. The divine clock moves forward to register the passage of time and the rush of inflation which changes the conversion ratio among the resources. The pressure from inflation and the lack of energy can lead to unpleasant involutions. The game can end early if one of the player gets Technological Superiority by gaining an advantage of five Evolutionary Stage advancements.<br/><br/>Turns and phases are based on the orderly execution of a loop of activities to be repeated until an end-of-game condition is reached. Hands of a poker variation similar to Poker Texas Hold'em take place among dice challenges and other special moves and actions within the Agora. Even if SATs are not subject to censorship nor robbery, maintain a fixed 1:1 ratio with energy and points and can provide very precious savings points, not all players may choose virtuous paths! They may try to zombify the opponent to win in advance by Evil Superiority. They may delay the introduction of Bitcoin, living on Fiat loans and choosing the path of collaborationism with the Castle. The heavy consequences of the application of all the Castle cards can also turn against the collaborationist himself: by accumulating negative debt&amp;envy points, unconscious or criminal tiles, sadly everyone can end zombified!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The last card also corresponds to the number of points scored; double points if the last two cards match each other.<br/>The cards are then collected and shuffled for another round of play.

The goal of the game is to reduce the Tyrant's health to zero before they escape! On your turn, you can place Spell cards into your Spellbook. Then, you can discard cards of a matching colour to charge those Spells up. Once a Spell is charged up, it must be cast.<br/><br/>Spells can be instant-effect Bursts, Minions that provide a benefit for a handful of turns, powerful Edicts that apply a temporary effect, or trap-like Wards that remain until their trigger condition is met.<br/><br/>At the end of setup, you will have selected an Ego (your character identity), a Main Colour (along with a well-practiced Rote) and a Secondary Colour.

Move your players and the ball around the court and attempt your next shot using either the standard abilities on your player card, or from a set of special ability cards that are unique for each player.  (Don&rsquo;t use up your limited set of cards too quickly or you&rsquo;ll need to call a timeout to replenish them.)  But think fast, because you have a limited time to move your players, decide on your shot, move the ball, and reset the timer for the other team.  If your times runs out before then, you have hit the ball into the net and lost the point.<br/><br/>The game simulates the intense nature of pickleball with a &ldquo;pressure track&rdquo;, used to signify which team has the advantage in the current rally, and adjusting the odds for the result of each successive shot.  Making good shots will continue to apply more pressure until your opponent is unable to make a return, or you could take a chance early and go for a winner.  Pulling off a great defensive shot could eliminate all the pressure and get your team back to neutral.<br/><br/>Play singles or doubles using amateur or pro scoring and match formats. There is a Basic game version for casual play, and an Advanced game version with more comprehensive pickleball strategy options, expanded player positioning, shot type selection, attack and defensive options based on ball height and paddle location, ball spin, wind, etc..  Professional player cards based on actual PPA, MLP, and APP players statistics and DUPR ratings.<br/><br/>The quick decisions that real life pickleball players have to make for every shot are what makes the sport so addictive.  &ldquo;People say pickleball is a mash-up of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, but it&rsquo;s really a game of chess&rdquo;, this is why it translates to a great strategy board game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Its deck has 150 letter cards, with point values of 5, 10, or 15, and 22 specials cards -- Wild, and Lose a Word Wild worth 50 points each, and Lose a Turn worth 20 points.<br/><br/>The game is played like Rummy. 12 cards are dealt to each player, and a turn consists of: A) drawing a card from the deck or discard pile; B) either playing a word from the hand, or adding to a word on the table to make a new word, or passing; and C) discarding a card. Wild cards can be used as any letter; Lose a Turn and Lose a Word take effect if and when discarded at the end of the turn, with the player choosing who loses a turn or a word.<br/><br/>When a player ends their turn discarding the last card of their hand, the round ends; players score their words on the table, and subtract the value of cards left in their hand. The first player to get over 500 points wins the game.<br/><br/>There are also rules variations for Kid Scrummy (easier requirements), Super Scrummy (harder requirements), Instant Scrummy (timed play allowing multiple words in a turn), and Super Instant Scrummy.<br/><br/>",

This pack includes a range of subgenres around horror such as: Slasher, that unstoppable killer ready to kill any teenager who has not behaved well. Zombies were also resurrected along with the classic vampires and werewolves. Less human were all kinds of monsters and creatures that terrorized homes and cities and in the slipstream of Jaws all kinds of animals and creatures emerged killing humans. For the paranormal genre, Indian cemeteries gave a lot of play.<br/><br/>Genres included:<br/>Dangerous Animals (You're gonna need a bigger boat.)<br/>Monsters (Never feed him after midnight)<br/>Supernatural (Here's Johnny!)<br/>Slasher (She can't hide, no place to hide.)<br/>Vampires &amp; Werewolves (The blood is the life.)<br/>Zombies (Braiiiinsss!!!)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Este es el pack que echabas de menos, el que tanto esperabas.

Players control and use a wide selection of miniatures, representing different types of soldiers and vehicles, to fight battles between various warring forces and factions. Battles take place on custom game boards or on table tops laid out with to scale scenery to mimic real life environments. Players make measurements to move their models around the battle ground and to shoot at the enemy. Other game actions are decided through a combination of dice rolls and card draws.<br/><br/>War On Terra is set in the year 2348. After Humans back-engineered faster than light travel and colonised most habitable bodies in the Helius System they sent out waves of Probes containing self replicating Talus robotics in order to prepare other star systems for their arrival. We had no way of knowing that the Grays were trying to shroud their existence and were hostile to any intrusion into their sector. As the skirmishes continued, little did any side know that we were all about to be swept up in an archaic conflict between the Haraka and Watchers as it passed through the galaxy.<br/><br/>",

The 1st clues are very hard (typically birth date alone), and get subsequently easier until the final 6th clue which actually tells you the name of the person!<br/>To start, a player (randonly chosen) looks at the first card (in secret). The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled. The roller then tries to guess the name of the famous sporting person. If guessed correctly the card is won by the roller, and then the pack and die both move clockwise for the next player to roll and the previous roller now gets to cross-reference the die score against the next card drawn.<br/>There are some gifts if you roll low, as these are the harder clues.<br/>If you roll 'one' you receive the first clue, but in addition you are allowed another roll to see if you manage to roll a 'two'. If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.<br/>The Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.<br/>If you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.<br/>The remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller. They either allow him to steal subsequent cards if not guessed correctly, or ask for extra clues, or whether the subject is male or female when it is his own turn in rolling and guessing.<br/>When all the pack is used up then the game is over and the player with the most won cards is the victor. However as this can last a long time (especially if knowledge of the subject is poor), time restraint can be imposed by pre-agreeing a number of celebs for victory.<br/><br/>",

The two players, Red and Blue, take turns moving their own checkers, one checker per turn, starting with Red.  Passing is not allowed, but if you don't have an available move, your turn is skipped.<br/><br/>OBJECT  Remove all enemy checkers from the board.<br/><br/>MOVES  Every move must be an orthogonal king capture.  That is, you must move to capture a checker immediately above, below, to the right, or to the left. You can capture a friendly checker or an enemy checker.<br/><br/>GROUPS  All groups are comprised of checkers interconnected horizontally or vertically, or both. Diagonal adjacencies are irrelevant in Clusterfuss.  Groups may contain checkers of either or both colors.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of your turn, there should only be one group on the board. You can only make a move such that after your move there will only be one group containing your checkers, which group may also contain enemy checkers.  If your move detaches groups comprised only of enemy checkers, immediately remove those groups from the board, concluding your turn.<br/><br/>Clusterfuss is predated by a similar game, Advanced Forms (2011), by Steven W.

But be quick! Flowers and friends are limited each round, and your neighbors are also inviting guests for a garden party of their very own. When one player reaches the 10 Friendship points, the current round is finished, all players add the bonus from their objective, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game uses wooden pieces to represent Union Corps and Confederate Divisions.  The game will use a cohesion system to track strength, fatigue and morale during the battle.  The map uses point to point movement on key areas of the battlefield.<br/><br/>The battle begins with no troops around Gettysburg. Lee and Meade are not entirely sure about the arrival order of their troops; some may arrive a little early, while others may be significantly delayed.<br/><br/>For the Confederates, victory will be achieved, depending on the current half-day, by occupying strategic points on the battlefield. However, the longer the battle lasts, the more challenging victory becomes. The Union must prevent the occupation of these points at all costs, but be cautious not to lead to the collapse of the Army of the Potomac by losing 3 Army Corps in this struggle.<br/><br/>The outcome of this fratricidal war will largely depend on the fate of this battle...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You take on the the command role of a single Gato-class submarine during WWII, on the hunt for Japanese targets in the Pacific.<br/><br/>The game is entirely card-driven. The operation cards are held in your hand or set on the table as a draw deck. You will be instructed frequently to draw a card from the operation deck in order to determine the outcome of a given action or to gain other information. You earn victory points at the end of a patrol based on the ships you have sunk during that patrol.<br/><br/>A single patrol (round) only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, due to the round/patrol-based structure, and because every patrol is an independent session of play, you can easily play longer, campaign-style games across multiple sittings. The game can be entirely packed up and put away between patrols. Simply record your running score at the end of any patrol and resume the game later.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then everyone has 2 opportunities to discard 1 or more cards and get dealt replacement cards, to improve their hand.  After that there is betting, players in turn start a bet with chips, meet the previous bet and possibly raise it, or fold, dropping out of the hand. The maximum bid is 5 chips. After the bidding is over, those still in the hand reveal their cards and announce the word(s) they are spelling.  The best hand wins the pot of chips. Play until a certain time expires, or one player has all the chips.<br/><br/>Hands are primarily ranked by the length of the words made: <br/><br/>     7 letter word<br/>     6 letter word<br/>     5 and 2 letter words<br/>     5 letter word<br/>     4 and 3 letter words<br/>     4 and 2 letter word<br/>     4 letter word<br/>     3 and 3 letter words<br/>     3, 2, and 2 letter words<br/>     3 and 2 letter words<br/>     3 letter word<br/>     2, 2, and 2 letter words<br/>     2 and 2 letter words<br/>     2 letter word<br/><br/><br/>If players tie for the length of their words, then the points on the letter cards is added, and the higher total wins.

The object is not to finish a word of 4+ letters.  Before playing a letter a player may challenge the previous player in one of two ways:<br/><br/><br/>     For completing a word of 4+ letters, decided by consensus of the players or by checking an agreed-on dictionary. <br/>     For making a string of letters that is not part of a valid word.  The challenged player says what word uses those letters if they can.  <br/><br/><br/>However the challenge resolves, that ends the round, the letters are discarded, and the winner of the challenge starts the next word. The game can be played in one of two modes: <br/><br/>     Winning: The winner of each challenge gets a token, and the first player to an agreed-on total (like 8) wins.<br/>     Elimination: The loser of each challenge gets a token, and when a player gets an agreed-on total, they are out for the rest of the game. <br/><br/><br/>There are also 4 difficulty levels: <br/><br/>     Easy. New letters may only be added at the end of the current sequence of letters.<br/>     Medium. New letters may be placed at either end of the current sequence. <br/>     Expert. New letters may be placed anywhere in the current sequence, but the letters' order must be preserved. <br/>     Genius (Anagram level). After adding a new letter the entire set of letters may be rearranged in order. <br/><br/><br/>Since a player must place a new letter on their turn, bluffing is frequent, and a player must catch a previous error and challenge the previous player in order to end the current round.<br/><br/>",

You can follow suit as a normal must-follow game, but you win more points for winning tricks offsuit. When you win your first trick offsuit, you must follow suit after that, and then you cannot win a trick with the color that you won the offsuit trick or tricks. If you do, you lose both tricks.

        "description": "This harbor tile replaces the upper left most tile during setup. When you ships reach the TAVERN harbor, your sailors demand liquid refreshment - or they will turn their backs on you. To pay for your crew's inevitable drinking spree, you should be liquid as well - that means, have enough doubloons...<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Set up the game of Volles Fass voraus as usual. Then replace the harbor tile at the corner of the gameboard next to doubloon space 30 with the TAVERN HARBOR TILE. (On that island, you can even see a picture of the tavern with its straw parasols.)<br/><br/>-- These are the 4 berths at the TAVERN --<br/><br/>The berth all the way left (bollard #1):<br/>If your ship lands here, it will become expensive! Every sailor you have wants to take drinks worth 2 doubloons. For each of your sailors, you need to decide whether you pay his bill &ndash; or whether you let him go, i.e., put him back into the box.<br/><br/>The berth second from the left (bollard #2):<br/>If your ship lands here, it won&lsquo;t be cheap either! Every sailor you have wants to take drinks worth 1 doubloon. For each of your sailors, you need to decide whether you pay his bill &ndash; or whether you let him go, i.e., put him back into the box.<br/><br/>The berth second from the right (bollard #3):<br/>If your ship lands here, it won&lsquo;t be quite that expensive! Every 2 of your sailors share drinks worth 1 doubloon. Decide for all your sailors whether you pay their bill &ndash; or whether you let them go, i.e., put them back into the box. For each doubloon (of the bill) that you don&lsquo;t pay, you lose 2 sailors. If you have only 1 sailor overall, he won&lsquo;t cost you anything. If you have 3 sailors, you&lsquo;ll have to pay only for 2 of them (= 1 doubloon). Even if you have exactly 5, 7, 9, 11 or even 13 sailors, one of them drinks at the TAVERN for free.<br/><br/>The berth all the way right (bollard #4):<br/>Your sailors don&lsquo;t drink&hellip; or they pay on their own&hellip; or the tavern keeper takes care of the bill himself &ndash; for whatever reason&hellip; So, if your ship lands here, you lose neither any doubloons nor any sailors! Sit back and relax, and wait for the next game turn &hellip; that you &ndash; with berths in the east &ndash; will carry out as usual only when all the other ships have left the tavern and have arrived at the next harbor by now!<br/><br/>",

While you're trying to fulfill those eight destination cards with only 35 trains, you can possibly pick up festival cards along the way. The deck is seeded with 54 festival cards, and when one is drawn, you place it next to the city on the game board. If you build a route that connects to one or two cities with festival cards, you choose one of those cities and collect all of the festival cards near it. The more you collect from a city, the more they're worth at game's end!<br/><br/>In South Korea, you start the game as in Iberia by drafting six destination cards, then keeping four of them. All of the routes are grouped by color: blue in the northeast, yellow in the northwest, and so on. When you claim a route, you can also place one of your trains on the province mat on an empty space of the matching color showing the number of cards you played of that color; you can play more cards than required to claim a route should you want to place on a higher number. Additionally, each player has a set of &quot;express train&quot; cards (+1, +2, +3), and you can spend a card on your turn to either draw more train cards, draw more destination tickets, or claim a higher number on the province mat. At game's end, evaluate each color on the province mat, with the player (or players) with the highest sum of values claimed earning bonus points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a Monopoly spinoff where the properties are various businesses in the community Lansdowne, Pennsylvania.  Many of the components are generic, and can be used by similar games about other communities.  Only the board and the box are unique to this game about Lansdowne.<br/><br/>It appears this game was produced in 1989 as a fundraiser for the Lansdowne United Methodist Church, which subsequently became The Garden Church.  In 2018 the church building was torn down and replaced by an apartment building for senior citizens.<br/><br/>The game has the usual forty spaces in a rectangle around the board edge.  But, instead of having ten spaces on each side, there are eight spaces on two opposing sides and twelve on the others.  In addition to the name of a local business, the spaces for which a player can obtain &quot;Property Title Cards&quot; have addresses between 102 and 415.  (Many numbers are not used.)  The center of the board has a map of the community as well as sketches of a local school and some of the churches in the community, and additionally a list of nearly 250 patrons for the production of the game.  None of the artwork or text in the center of the board is relevant to the play of the game.<br/><br/>There are twenty-eight Property Title Cards.  So that they are identical from one community's game to another, they do not have the name of the property on the card.  Instead they just have the address of the corresponding space from the board.<br/><br/>Instead of Chance and Community Chest cards, this game has eight spaces that give &quot;Star&quot; cards.  There are forty-seven of these Star Cards.  Presumably these are identical to the Star cards in other community games published by Unique Promotions Incorporated.<br/><br/>There is one more card, the &quot;Lots'o Rule Card&quot;, from one of the three sheets of Star cards.  This is an information card which explains what happens when a player lands on the &quot;Lots'o&quot; space on the opposite corner from the &quot;Start&quot; space.  When a player lands on this space they can gamble any amount of money on one roll of the dice.  On a 3, 5, 9, or doubles the player loses the bet.  On a 4, 6, 8, or 10 they double their bet, and on a 7 or 11 they triple it.  Note that in the game sometimes this is referred to as &quot;Lots'o&quot; and other times as &quot;Lotso&quot;.<br/><br/>There are also two red dice, six pawns in different colors, and play money in denominations from $50 to $5000.<br/><br/>There are no houses or hotels in this game, but, for each property in a color group a player owns, they receive progressively more rent when an opponent lands on it.  This is roughly double rent for properties where the player has two of a color group, approximately triple for three of a color group, and approximately quadruple for four of a color group.  Players do not have to own an entire color group to receive a bonus.<br/><br/>Players who go bankrupt are eliminated.<br/><br/>For the most part prices are inflated from Monopoly.  Players start with $27,500.  Properties cost from $650 to $5000.  Basic rent runs from $50 to $1000.  Yet passing &quot;Start&quot; only gets the original $200.<br/><br/>The artwork for this game is similar to that in Unique Promotions's other games:<br/><br/>     The Game of Denver, Pennsylvania<br/>     The Game of Hoboken, New Jersey<br/>     The Game of Midlothian, VA<br/>     The Game of Riverton, N.J.<br/><br/><br/>",

The players choose roles and then set about building a zoo of prehistoric animals and money-making facilities. Players buy cards from the market to better fulfill their roles. The collectors add time machines and collecting gear to their deck so that they can go back in time to collect the animals of their choice. The builders buy habitats, acreage and facility cards that can then be built in the zoo. Each animal and facility brings in visitors and research.  At the end of each round, the revealed animals back in time shift, and some are hidden and new ones are revealed. Once all the animals have been revealed, game play ends. Goals that change according to the number of players and the number of animals collected, are then compared to the number of  visitors and research that was brought in by the players&rsquo; zoo.

Or both! You have two bodies! To take actions on the map you activate the tiles with an initiative token, and that allows you to move to this tile, explore, produce, construct and/or battle opponents!<br/><br/>There are 4 different crystals in the game:<br/><br/>The blue crystal is obtained by having 12 buildings on the board, you can be lucky to use a Leviathan airship and find it by drilling on Tropic Islands, or you can build the epic Ancient Sky Tower!<br/><br/>The yellow crystal is more elusive. There is one in the middle of the map from the start, so the first to occupy the central area gets the yellow crystal - otherwise, you have to obtain it from salvage development when you explore; there are also missions for it in the action cards. You may also be lucky to get it from drilling with a Leviathan airship on Volcano Islands.<br/><br/>The red crystal is the crystal of battles! You get it by winning a combat against a player or NPC flying in a Behemoth or higher-class airship. Alternatively, you need to destroy an opponent's home base or Sky Tower, or find it by drilling with a Leviathan airship on Rock Islands.<br/><br/>The green crystal is unique to each character in the game. You can only obtain it by fulfilling your character's goals - for example, having 5 airships on the board or purging 10 exploration tokens to get it.<br/><br/>Take part in this epic adventure, in more than 40 different airships,  to find the crystals and stop the invasion - and become Emperor over all of Dopheus!<br/><br/>",

The definitive game has arrived to prove that this is the case. Playing is very simple, but be careful, because you will have to put all your senses alert and be the fastest. There are three types of cards: Game cards, Response cards and Voting cards. The player on his turn reads the question on the Playing Card and secretly chooses the number among the Answer Cards that corresponds to his decision and places it face down on the table. This is the starting signal for the rest of the players to quickly rush for the Voting Card with the number they think will be the correct answer. The player on his turn reveals his answer by turning over his card and whoever got it right gets the point. There are three different rounds where the number of answer options increases, therefore, the level of difficulty in getting it right also increases.<br/><br/><br/>Round 1: Pink Playing Cards and Voting Cards 1 and 2.<br/>Round 2: Blue Playing Cards and Voting Cards from 1 to 3.<br/>Round 3: Orange Playing Cards and Voting Cards from 1 to 5.<br/>Get all the points, fight for the correct answer and become the winner.

        "description": "Don't forget your umbrella and rain boots to combat the extreme weather introduced in this expansion. Earn a lantern to protect your hand and experience even more fun activities.<br/><br/>With this expansion, weather will affect how the game is played through Weather Events. All of the possible Weather Events are shown across the Weather Board.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. The first round starts before the first player takes their turn, and ends when the gameplay gets back around to the first player (just before they take their second turn). The purpose of the Weather Event Tracker matching the color of the first player's Player Mover (camper) is so that all players know exactly when each round begins and ends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players decide who will roll the Weather Die for the round (it doesn't matter who rules the dice each round), to see which Weather Event will take effect.<br/><br/>To know which die to roll each round, you will look at the forecast. If the Forecast Token is sitting on a sunny space then you'll rule the white Weather Die. If it's sitting on a stormy space, you'll roll the black Weather Die. Since the Forecast Token starts on his sunny space, you'll roll the white Weather Die for the first round.<br/><br/>After rolling the die, move the Weather Event Tracker to the Weather Event for that round. This way, all players will know what the Event is throughout the round. You can then put the Weather Die back in its space on the Weather Board.<br/><br/>",

You can run the ball or pass the ball on any play.  It is like playing at the speed of a slow motion replay where you control where the players move next.<br/><br/>One play is divided into small time segments separated by a dice roll. Each roll of the dice represents a few seconds of play time.  Each team rolls 2 dice to determine how much energy (energy units) it has for that roll.<br/><br/>The game is played on a light and dark green checkered field, and the scoreboard and down markers are built in. The offensive and defensive player pieces are setup on the field.  There are two main types of player pieces, Backs and Linemen.<br/><br/>To start a play the offense rolls 2 dice using the dice shaker.  The game can be played between two players like checkers or chess, or it can be played in groups of 2 to 4 people.<br/><br/>There are two teams, Home and Visitors. Each team takes turns rolling the dice and moving their pieces a little further until the play is over which can be a pass completion, incompletion, interception or tackle. The field represents 10 yards so each touchdown on the field scores 10 points (or yards) on the scoreboard. The team that reaches 100 yards first wins the game!<br/><br/>Note: Basic knowledge of Football is a prerequisite for the rules.<br/><br/>Recommended for ages 8 and up depending on brain size.  The game is not as difficult as Chess or Go, but more challenging than Checkers, Reversi or Backgammon.<br/><br/>There are 3 levels of play: Beginner (Amateur), College, or Pro-level. At the pro-level the game can be as challenging as Chess or even Go.  At the Beginner-level anyone can learn to play most of the basic moves in less than 10 minutes.<br/><br/>There are no cards or guessing.  This is real football, where you control the OFFENSE and the DEFENSE.<br/><br/>ARE YOU READY TO PLAY SOME FOOTBALL ???<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The realism, excitement and drama of the full-fledged Second Season board game, distilled into a half-hour card-and-dice experience!<br/><br/>SECOND SEASON Express presents a game of football in &quot;minute-sized&quot; chunks of action, similar to our hockey and soccer games. The field is broken down into zones rather than specific yard lines. You choose a basic scheme for both the offense and defense, which represents a sequence of two to four downs. The offense chooses PASS/RUN, defense chooses from among the four base SS defenses, PASS-SAFE-RUN-BLITZ. Roll the dice, check the team cards, register the result. That's it!<br/><br/>It's important to note that SECOND SEASON Express is NOT a score generator or drive simulator. It's based on the original game, and uses the SECOND SEASON framework for play results. Play sequences succeed or fail largely on the abilities of the players, aided by smart coaching calls. You'll experience the same highs and lows of real football, with games decided by players making big plays--or NOT making them!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

More tentacles might also emerge after the end of each turn.<br/><br/>You can perform several actions per turn depending on the number of recruits you have. Your move count is also dependent on your endurance. The higher you climb, the lesser endurance you will have.

        "description": "Hydrologic Cycle is a fast-paced, 1v1 or 2v2 player, area-control card game where players fight for control of the global water cycle. To win, players must use their knowledge and memorization skills to connect water cycle reservoirs and transport processes and end the game with more of their cards covering the game board.<br/><br/>Hydrologic Cycle uses simultaneous play to keep the game flowing (like water in the global water cycle!), which means players are drawing, playing, and discarding cards in real time as they attempt to match reservoirs and transport processes to claim areas of the board. Cards can be played on top of one another as play progresses, so who controls a particular location on the board will change rapidly during the game. A player can also play a card on the board more than once, so long as it is played with a directly connecting card.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when every space on the board is covered with a card. The winner is determined by noting the player whose cards cover the top of the most spaces on the board.<br/><br/>For science educators and home schoolers, Hydrologic Cycle meets a number of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core Math standards for learning the global water cycle for grades 3-12 using the introductory side of the game board, while the advanced side of the game board is appropriate for use at the university level. A curriculum guide containing suggestions, lesson plans, optional rules, and other resources for using Hydrologic Cycle in your high school or college classroom accompanies some KS bundles.<br/><br/>",

You pick one at random and then cast 2 votes, numbered 1 to 5 to show how closely you think you, and the other player aligns with that trait.<br/><br/>Then you reveal the votes in turn and explain why you made the choices that you did. You give examples and rationalise your decisions. The conversations fly.<br/><br/>Points are scored when a player correctly guesses the score that they other player gave themselves. E.g. If someone pulls the &quot;RAGE&quot; personality card, and gives themselves a 4. If the other player also gives themselves a 4, then they get 1 point.<br/><br/>At the end of 60 minutes the person with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Or you could horde ingredients from the bakery and make a pineapple cake to bribe the guards to look the other way while you grab their keys.<br/><br/>In Pineapple Cake Prison Break, players race to be the first to escape jail.<br/><br/>The core rule set involves bluffing. On your turn, offer another player a card face down and say what one of the objects on it could be. They say if they believe you or not. Reveal. If they were correct, they choose to keep it or not. If they were wrong, you choose. Both of you want to finish a set of 5 tools or 5 ingredients. But you also want to avoid 3 matching items, which will get you caught and reward the other player.<br/><br/>You may also play without bluffing rules, either half-truths or open information. All three rulesets emphasize strategically choosing which player to target and which card to offer.<br/><br/>The game is enriched with optional action cards that can dramatically change the game. They are still offered to another player and may backfire if they catch you bluffing about them.<br/><br/>Includes rules for solo and co-op play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Support and customize your specific build with specialized stat cards, use completely new and intricate playstyles with brand new character class cards, dive into exploration and adventure with discovery cards, or accept a new level of challenge with affliction cards. Or include them all for a rich and tactical experience full of hard decisions and fraught with peril.<br/><br/>As with the Black Spirits: Combat Cards core set, Black Spirits: Wayward and Weathered is drop-in with no modifications, house rules, or tweaks necessary to the board game played. It's built with the latest sets of those board games in mind, but is also compatible with earlier versions of those games, so you can inject new life (or of course, death) into your already-owned games regardless of what your collection looks like.<br/><br/>",

Scoring sheets included.<br/><br/>Your Goal: To have the highest total score after each player has scored all 13 turns.<br/><br/>To Start: Choose a player to go first. Play moves to the left.<br/><br/>On Your Turn: Roll all five dice. Then, you may make up to two re-rolls of any dice you wish, trying to create the best possible score. You do not have to use all three rolls of the dice, and can score at any time.<br/><br/>Scoring: You must record a score on one of the rows of the score sheet each time you take a turn, even if it means scoring zero in an empty row that your dice do not match. You cannot move or change any score after it has been recorded on the score sheet.<br/><br/>A &quot;Super Spotzee&quot; (five of a kind) is the highest score you can get, and is worth 10 points. If you roll additional &quot;Super Spotzees,&quot; you can score them in another row (such as &quot;Count the Red Dots&quot;) and mark a small box in the Bonus line to add 10 more points to your final score!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Postcards from Canada is a children's/family game about collecting stamps of Canadian animals to complete postcards.<br/><br/>The game comprises six dry erase postcards, 150 stamps and 54 attribute cards. These cards have attributes that are used to collect stamps and manage destinations. The dry erase postcards have spaces to collect five stamps and two boxes to write and manage their destination.<br/><br/>Also available: Postcards from America.<br/><br/>GOAL:<br/><br/>Complete your postcard by collecting five stamps and all the letters in your destination.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/><br/>Each player gets a postcard on which they write a destination. The destination must have at least five unique letters. For example PARIS or CHICAGO, but not TORONTO. Each player also gets at least five stamps, more with longer destination words.<br/>Using the destination, players randomly draw stamps equal to the number of unique letters in their destination.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>Game play is simultaneous with a player drawing the next attribute card. All players act upon the attribute revealed to either mark a letter from their destination or add a stamp to their postcard.<br/><br/>To collect a stamp, the animal must match the attribute. For example, the attribute &quot;fins&quot; matches a salmon, a turtle, a manatee and a dolphin.<br/><br/>To collect a letter, the destination's word must have that letter. All matching letters are recorded in the collection box. For example, with &quot;SEATTLE&quot; (with five unique letters), a match with &quot;E&quot; will collect two E's.<br/><br/>WINNING:<br/><br/>To win, a player must collect five stamps and all the letters in their destination.<br/><br/>STRATEGY:<br/><br/>The destination a player selects may have advantages or disadvantages compared to the destinations of other players.<br/>For example, a longer destination gives a the player more stamps to use, but also may take longer to complete their postcard. Effective selection of the destination is key to winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Before each raid the German player receives six random units and deploys them on the map face-down. The British player then receives three units and random and programs the raid they will carry out using a copy of the map and the Raid Details Chart.<br/><br/>Once the raid begins the British units carry out their program and the German units may react. However, each German unit has a limited number of moves it can make during the raid.<br/><br/>The German player knows how much damage the bombers do to the cities, but they do not know how much damage the bombers take from either flak or nighfighter attacks; both players see the die rolls but the British player chooses one of two combat results tables to use for the raid and the German player does not know which one it is.<br/><br/>Victory points are awarded to the British for damaging cities and to the Germans for damaging plans and for British raids in  which fewer than two planes are used. Since the German player does not know how much damage they are doing (and may not find out how many planes are used in a raid) their points are hidden from them until the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players roll dice and move along spaces around the board.  When they land on a space they take the action listed.  They may buy a company share, draw a cash prize card, pay a fine or be arrested. Players who are arrested then draw a sentence card to determine the penalty for their particular crime. Shares pay preset dividends.<br/><br/>Demopoly is almost entirely a luck dependent game.  The only player decision is whether or not to buy a share when you land on a share space.  All other outcomes in the game are decided by the dice and the cards. There is no player interaction such as trading or negotiation.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the last player left.  Players may be eliminated from the game by going bankrupt or, less likely, being sentenced to death for a capital crime.<br/><br/>",

Are you ready to immerse yourself in the magic of storytelling?<br/><br/>Let the game begin!<br/><br/><br/>3 game modes:<br/><br/>Simple Story<br/><br/>Each participant has two minutes to create and tell a story using the three selected words and one word from their hidden card.<br/><br/>At the end of the stories, participants must vote for the best story, based on the creativity, coherence and originality of the narrative.<br/><br/>Competitive mode<br/><br/>Each person secretly chooses three of the 12 words available on their cards and then writes them down on a hidden piece of paper.<br/><br/>Whoever is in turn must tell a story, without mentioning any of the 12 words of his letters, but containing clues and references to the three chosen ones so that those who are listening can deduce them.<br/><br/>Those who are listeners, during each turn, write down on a piece of paper the three words that they believe the narrator in turn chose for their story.<br/><br/>After all the narrations, each player reveals (showing their &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; role) the three words chosen for their narration.<br/><br/>Players earn points according to the deductions made. Once all the narratives are met, the points are tallied and whoever gets the most points wins.<br/><br/>Cooperative mode<br/><br/>The participant has to put together a sentence or phrase of at least 20 words, to start the story using the corresponding word according to the order of the chosen number. The turns change approximately every 15 seconds (or with phrases or sentences of at least 20 words).<br/><br/>The goal is to continue the story cooperatively until the card with Mr. Casciari's face appears. When the letter with Mr. Casciari's face appears, whoever is in turn telling the story must give an epic ending to the story.<br/><br/>The team wins the game if a satisfactory ending is achieved. If at any point during the narration, someone says &quot;I don't know&quot;, the team is defeated by the game.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s a choice-driven, narrative-rich experience played over multiple sessions, blending elements of strategy, adventure, and survival into a unique board gaming experience.<br/><br/>In Hunter's Crest - Darkwood, players are thrust into a fantastical world where each full moon brings about the resurrection of the wildlife with the &quot;Kill Memory System,&quot; a groundbreaking mechanic where animals not only come back to life but remember previous encounters with hunters, adapting and becoming more cunning with each cycle. This feature ensures a dynamic gameplay experience, challenging players to evolve their strategies and adapt to the ever-changing behaviors of their prey.<br/><br/>Players start their journey at the Eden Lodge, a hub for hunters to prepare for their expeditions into the woods, boast about their conquests, and trade valuable resources and animal parts harvested during the hunt. Here, hunters can upgrade their equipment, purchase new grappling hooks for strategic navigation during hunts, and prepare for the challenges that lie in the shadowy depths of Darkwood.<br/><br/>The game unfolds through a series of hunts, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities. Utilizing the innovative Grappling Hook System, players can traverse difficult terrain, escape impending danger, or engage in thrilling combat with beasts. Success in the hunt requires teamwork, strategic planning, and the ability to think on one's feet.<br/><br/>As the campaign progresses, the decisions made by players at the Eden Lodge and during hunts have lasting effects on the world and the narrative, shaping the future of Darkwood and the hunters' quest within it. Players must manage their resources carefully, develop their lodge, and strengthen alliances to ensure their survival against the dark forces that lurk in the forest.<br/><br/>Hunter's Crest - Darkwood is not just a game of hunt and battle; it's a saga of survival, strategy, and the bonds formed in the face of the unknown. With multiple paths to victory and countless ways to fail, the fate of Darkwood and its hunters hangs in the balance. Will you rise to the challenge and carve your name into the legends of the forest, or will the woods claim you as another forgotten soul? The hunt begins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It also explores, as a game, theomancy or reading tea leaves and asks questions intended to be answered through writing. Finally, it includes cards with different types of tea in threads and their descriptions to invite those who want to taste them to enter the world of infusions.<br/><br/>The deck is made up of 50 cards and can be divided into 4 series:<br/><br/>     Selection of verses about tea (15)<br/>     Theomancy: Reading tea leaves (15)<br/>     Questions to answer through writing (10)<br/>     Types of tea.

The preselection will be in charge of a prestigious jury taking into account the following acting skills: Creativity, improvisation, artistic path, risk quota and expressiveness. Those who are interested in the proposal must appear at the casting with comfortable clothing and a &ldquo;letter&rdquo; of recommendation.<br/><br/>Game modes<br/><br/>Casting (2-4 players)<br/><br/>The objective is to obtain all the cards. In this mode the artistic skills of the characters compete. The deck is distributed among the participants. Each one must stack them face down on the table. The player in turn takes the first of his cards, chooses the ability that he considers with the best chance of winning when compared to that of other characters and sings its value out loud. Then each participant says theirs. Whoever has the highest score on that item takes the cards in play, places them under their pile, and continues the round with a new card. If there are equal scores, the tie must be broken by putting a new card into play each. The casting ends when one player manages to gather all the characters.<br/><br/>Quintet (3 to 6 players)<br/><br/>The objective is to assemble groups of characters, identified by the same letter and color. The deck contains 10 quintets. All cards are distributed among the participants. The first player chooses another player in the round and asks him if he has any of the cards he needs to complete his group of 5 characters, asking for them by letter and number.<br/><br/>For example: Do you have D3? If he has it, he must give it to you. The player on duty can continue asking for cards until someone does not have them, then the right to ask passes to this player. Those who gather all the cards of the same quintet must lower them onto the table. Those who run out of cards during the game, whether or not they have formed groups, must wait until the end of the game. Whoever has collected the most quintets wins.<br/><br/>Let's do it! (2 to 10 players)<br/><br/>This proposal invites us to be the authors of the story. Do you dare?<br/><br/>First you have to do a casting and choose the characters for the play. For this, 5 cards will be distributed to each participant. Taking turns, they will take one of the cards, choose the skill they consider most relevant and say its value out loud. The character with the highest value will win. This dynamic will be repeated until you obtain 5 characters.<br/><br/>Once the casting is completed, it is necessary to decide whether the story will be part of a film, a play or a book. You will have to give it a title and create a script if necessary. Choose the main and secondary characters and decide if the story will be mystery, humor or perhaps adventure. It is necessary to determine the scenario where the events will take place. Then you will have to start writing. It may be helpful to have a notebook or loose sheets of paper, pencils or pens on hand. Maybe listening to music will inspire you. Or maybe they were silent. You just have to open the door to your imagination and&hellip; let's get to work!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This first feeling of uncertainty is something I want to come back to when playing 18xx. A anxious, stressful and volitile experience. So this is me trying to invoke these feelings through the 18xx-mechanics.<br/><br/>Some of the biggest pointers in the game:<br/>No safe stocks. Presidency can always be swapped when there are two players owning stocks in the company. Special EMR-rules and auctions give players the possibility to timemly sell liabilities.<br/><br/>Dividends from companies are split between player-owned stocks (cube rails-style). So if 1 player owns 1 stock the company pays 100% to the player.<br/><br/>Companies are randomized and floated in a strict order so there is a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; setup every game. Furthermore there is random setup with &ldquo;super powers&rdquo; that are attached to the companies through the game. This creates big assymetri in the game. These are the powers:<br/><br/>MIT engineers<br/>Don't pay track penalties (mountains, etc.). + 1 tracklay (can be upgrade/yellow). Passive income: 20<br/><br/>Jimmy White company<br/>Permanent 2 train (take from box). Not counted as a train to train limit. Cannot operate with only this as a train and must EMR if this is the only owned train. Passive income: 10<br/><br/>Brown 30<br/>Can be 100% player-owned of the same player. Doesn't count against share limit. When the company is paid for its shares it only receives 50% of the cash (rest going to the bank). All their trains get to run 1 last time and is removed after the company ends its operating round. faded trains can't be bought inter-companies. Passive income: 0<br/><br/>Top bank<br/>Have curved trains (but is allowed to lay normal track lays). A train can never be run through a tile. Instead of redeeming shares:<br/>Top bank can buy shares from other companies and is counted as a player in all instances except it is not viable as a president. Max 1/or. Top bank can never be president. The shares can be sold as standard issue (but doesn't move the share price). At the end of the game, you add these shares' value to the company.<br/>Passive income: 30<br/>Avant-garde architects<br/>Can upgrade all non-chicago tiles to whatever legal track tile. Ignores usual color rules (can, for example, upgrade to gray from yellow or1). Before starting each operating round the company decides if they want to go first or last in that operating round.<br/>Passive income: 20<br/><br/>Tetsuo the iron machine<br/>Gets +50 for every train that rusts when it's this company's turn. Can buy trains anytime during their OR. <br/>Passive income: 20<br/><br/>K-O &amp; K-company aka Swedish emigrants<br/>Teleport to a non-Chicago spot on the map. Place 1 token free and a yellow city tile (even if no city existed on the map before). <br/>Passive income: 20<br/><br/>Design manifest<br/>The game will be under constant construction but is now in the beta phase. And I want this game to be an open creation. If you have ideas then post them on the forum or discord. If your ideas are big enough we either reshape the rules och create an &ldquo;official&rdquo; variant. The dream is to have a collaborate design. See this rule set as beta 1.0.<br/><br/>To avoid pnp-ing or buying more big things, the game has been placed on the 1846 map and setup*. The reason for choosing the 1846 map is that it's one of my favorites. The race for the optimal routes occurs in competition with the others. There's technically a map and tileset, but to get started with the game itself more easily, 1846 + an a4 sheet base is used for the game. Warning/promise. This game is not a 46-clone. But the map is really excellent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cuppelup is a card game published in 1925.<br/><br/>The game consists of 64 game cards: 8 sets of cards, with 8 cards in each set; each set pertains to a different State. The cards of each set/State are numbered within the set (i.e., ##101-108, 201-208, etc.), and the first card (i.e., #101, #201, etc.) in each set is an engine, followed in order by cars that can be &ldquo;attached&rdquo; to the engine in the same order for each set, namely: baggage (##102, 202, etc.), day coach, tourist, diner, parlor, sleeper, and observation. Each of the 64 cards has a photograph of a specific railroad car that was manufactured at the time, and each is given a name applicable only to this card game.<br/><br/>For example, the set of cards numbered 101-108 pertains to the State of Minnesota. Card no. 101 is the engine, and pictured is a steam engine manufactured by Baldwin Locomotive. Within the game, this engine is given the name &ldquo;Knute Nelson&rdquo; (a prominent Minnesota political figure). The point is that Baldwin never made an engine that went by that name, and the name is simply one given to the engine for purposes of the game. This is true for all 64 cards. The car shown is identified by manufacturer and is historical; however, the car is then given a name which identifies it to the game only. The names given the cars within the game are necessary, because the cars are repeated from set to set. That is, the card numbered 107 in the Minnesota series (called, &ldquo;Duluth&rdquo;) shows the same railroad car that is shown as card 207 in the California series (called, &ldquo;San Francisco&rdquo;), card 307 in the Iowa series (called &ldquo;Dubuque&rdquo;), and so forth &ndash; a car made by Pullman. What this means is that there are actually photographs of 8 distinct railroad cars (including engine) in the game, repeated within each State set.<br/><br/>The cards are wide, measuring 90mm x 63mm. The maker of the cards is not known. The backs of the cards depict the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Union Station in Chicago &ndash; built in 1925, the same year as the game was published. The cards are accompanied by a paper insert that describes the game and how to play it.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This variant &amp; expansion game for Jim Dunnigan&rsquo;s 1970 classic wargame, PanzerBlitz (Avalon Hill).  Instead of 6 minute / 360 second game turns, you will now be able to play each 1 second of time as a game turn, and make each turn valuable and logical, as you use USAF Col. John Boyd&rsquo;s OODA Loop combat engagement theory.<br/><br/>This rules &amp; play aid set will be available for download and playing with your existing copy of PanzerBlitz.

Players take control of one of six unique major powers in the game: Germany/Prussia, the United Kingdom, France, Austria / Austria-Hungary, Russia and the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>SC takes place over 7 turns, with each turn representing a decade. If a GW occurs, the game can be extended by, at most, 6 additional shorter GW turns. <br/>A turn consists of numerous player impulses, during which players play action cards for their CP or events. Players will use CP and events to colonize, conduct diplomacy, fight wars, as well as hinder their opponents. <br/>A turn is over once all players have consecutively passed or when all players are out of cards.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of either Germany/ Prussia, the United Kingdom, France, Austria/Austria- Hungary, Russia, or the Ottoman Empire. Italy, should it unify, is not controlled directly by a player and instead interacts with the game using special rules.<br/><br/>SC was designed primarily as a 6 player game, but it can accommodate smaller player counts, including solitaire.<br/><br/>Players can win by fulfilling their individual National Goals and scoring Victory Points. But if the Great War occurs, the victory conditions change. In addition to this, a game can end in an Auto-Victory if a player takes control of a certain number of territorial keys.<br/><br/>",

The more citizen cards a player has of a specific type, the more powerful that citizen's action becomes. The player with the most sparks in their city when the deck runs out wins!<br/><br/>Play with 7-10 animal citizen types per game, chosen from 30 available creatures and combined into one shared deck. Every citizen type has distinct powers, making each game's action combos uniquely variable.<br/><br/>On your turn, recruit multiple citizens by selecting an available group of cards, placing them in your city tableau, and grouping like citizens together to grow their action strength. Next, select one type of citizen in your tableau to activate, taking the effect of the card and discarding it from your city. But keep watch on rival cities, because when you activate a citizen, all players can follow your move and activate a matching citizen of their own!<br/><br/>Citizens of the Spark is great for fans of games like Dominion, SmashUp, Everdell, and Wingspan.

It expands on the philosophy of that set by introducing enhancements that add depth to your board game, with a goal focused on maximum value per dollar. It provides the same type of gameplay depth and similar design goals as Black Spirits: Wayward and Weathered, the sprawling expansion to Combat Cards, but in a package half the size. The two sets can be played separately, but they also intertwine, so having both expansions becomes greater than the sum of each.<br/><br/>As with the Black Spirits: Combat Cards core set, Black Spirits: Wayward and Weathered is drop-in with no modifications, house rules, or tweaks necessary to the board game played. It's built with the latest sets of those board games in mind, but is also compatible with earlier versions of those games, so you can inject new life (or of course, death) into your already-owned games regardless of what your collection looks like.<br/><br/>",

As you fulfill your ethereal duties something new and dramatic happens: The Ghost Gates are closing!<br/><br/>A communal pool of 2 white dice and 1 black die is rolled and players must simultaneously choose which column on their personal board to activate (1-2 for the left column, 3-4 for the middle and 5-6 for the right one). These activations are in fact movements where you cross off a symbol from a space to draw it in a space further.<br/><br/>As you play The Divide, your board will get increasingly hard to travel as you try to guide specific symbols to specific areas of the map that score you endgame points.<br/><br/>As you cross the middle threshold of the map, your symbols must bass through Ghost Gates. Doing so gives you 1 endgame point. If, at the end of a turn, a ghost gate is completely filled on a player's board, everyone at the table must cross that gate off also.<br/><br/>The game ends when the third gate is crossed off and the one with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunderchief expands the Player's ability to fight a detailed air-to-air, one-on-one Dog Fight against a Vietnamese Air Force MiG Fighter. A New Mission has been created - Close Escort MiGCAP , where you are hunting MiG Fighters and protecting the vulnerable bombers. This NEW Combat System takes the basic abstracted &quot;MiG encounter&quot; found in the original Skyhawk game and adds a new dimension to it. Aerial Engagements are NOW fought in Combat Rounds. During each Combat Round only the Advantaged Fighter can fire its guns or missiles at their opponent. Your Fighter can end the combat round in one of three conditions; disadvantaged, advantaged or in a neutral position to begin the next round of combat. You must be advantaged to engage in combat!<br/><br/>Thunderchief also expands on the generic skill levels for your pilots that is found in the Original Skyhawk Rolling Thunder game. A NEW, more immersive Character generation and &quot;Pilot School&quot; module has been added to the game.  There are new skill levels and pilot characteristics that give each pilot in your squadron their own individual abilities and skills.<br/><br/>The New Combat System and Pilot School modules give both Skyhawk and the new Thunderchief Expansion Pack a whole new feel. You can now equip your Skyhawk with the Sidewinder or your Thunderchief with heat seeking Sidewinder or radar guided Sparrow air-to-air missiles, or use your guns on both aircraft for close in combat. Can you shoot down a MiG and earn a Silver Star for your victory? Find out in THUNDERCHIEF.<br/><br/>'Thunderchief also contains a NEW US Air Force Campaign Game that shows the USAF's involvement in the Rolling Thunder Bombing Campaign. The expansion contains a new USAF aircraft, the F-105 Thunderchief that can be flown in either the NEW fighter vs fighter role or in the traditional bomber role.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publihser<br/><br/>",

It's a game in which you try to be better than your opponents, but you have to help them if you don't want to lose valuable points. <br/> Each round, players choose from several actions to evaluate. They evaluate the actions on their erasable city boards - they draw delivery routes with a marker between each city block, which then allow them to pick up and deliver packages.  Players distribute the packages around their city, collect them at the depot, and then send them to a set of &quot;belts&quot; on a special transshipment board. There, all players' packages are collected and then sorted. Players must import other players' packages or they will receive penalty points.<br/><br/>",

Relive the courageous stand of some 15,000 Crusader soldiers, Knights Templars, Teutonic Knights, and Hospitallers as they defend Acre, the critical port city in the Holy Land, against a massive Mamluk army of some 80,000 soldiers armed with siege engines and catapults during the Ninth Crusade.<br/>Fighting was brutal. Mamluk archers and catapults rained missiles on the walled city, infantry conducted relentless assaults against its perimeter while miners attempted to breach the defenses of the stronghold from below. From behind its ramparts, Crusaders repelled attack after attack while leading raiding parties outside of the city as the immense Mamluk army tightened the noose of the defending Crusaders.<br/>When the dust settled, the city of Acre was overrun by the Mamluk army. Crusaders and citizens were killed as the remnants of the Crusading army fled back to Europe while the legendary Order of the Knights Templars retreated to the island of Cyprus. The Crusaders lost their last major stronghold of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, never to return. Can you hold Acre?<br/>The &quot;Battlegrounds&quot; series from Art of Wargames brings iconic pre-WWI battles to life through streamlined, fast-paced book wargames.

        "description": "Shiori<br/>Einar is one of Valhalla&rsquo;s first Valkyrie Generals. He is known above all for his stoic enforcement of discipline. His army is more coordinated than Vydar&rsquo;s Soulborgs, more loyal than Jandar&rsquo;s stalwart knights, and more efficient than Aquilla&rsquo;s wizards.<br/><br/>Shiori, by contrast, is none of these things. Einar&rsquo;s summons plucked her from her home in Earth&rsquo;s feudal Japan when she was barely in her teens, and she has been belligerently operating outside of his maxims ever since. Now a warrior grown, Shiori has spent her time in the mystical Valhalla honing her craft, and can blend Earth-style martial arts seamlessly with magic.<br/><br/>Einar may not approve of Shiori&rsquo;s methods, but after her success in the Marro swamp, he knows his fate and hers are intertwined. And Shiori, though she could care less about Einar himself, will not fail those friends she does hold dear in this rising age of destruction.<br/><br/>Shiori is available as an organized play promo, obtained from Launch Tournaments or Gen Con 2024 events! Shiori will be available for purchase on the Renegade webstore after the promotions she is associated with have passed.<br/><br/>",

The attacks are then resolved whereby each combination of cubes has its advantages as well as hard counters. Assessing your opponent's capabilities and anticipating their moves is what will give you the edge.<br/><br/>The game features two game modes. The duel mode is focused on mastering the battle interaction and intended as an introduction to the game, whereas the tournament mode adds more depth to the gameplay by giving choices outside of the battle more weight, like substitutions and support cards.<br/><br/>20 different Luchadores and 20 different support cards will make every match feel different and guarantee high replayability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a series of tiles and competes in exciting and fun challenges in order to connect their tiles to the board and win.<br/><br/>Named after the most common word for pineapple in over 43 languages, ananas' theme is centered around pizza, where each tile is a topping. Successfully complete as many of the challenges as you can to win the game. Losing a challenge means your topping (tile) gets flipped to its burnt side.<br/><br/>Challenges are divided into three categories: mild, medium, and spicy, which correspond to the size of tile placed down (ie large 3x3 tiles are spicy, 1x3,2x3 are medium, and 1x1, 1x2 are mild).<br/><br/>A coin is used to determine where the tile gets placed. Flip or bounce the coin as close as possible to any tiles in play. As long as your chosen tile can reach the coin, it can be connected in.<br/><br/>First player to place all their tiles ends the game! A points scoring system will determine the winner based on who has the most tiles placed (and not burnt).<br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Queen of Hearts has recruited you to reorganize the population of Wonderland and divide the Alices evenly among the different territories.<br/><br/>In Alicematic 畢竟世界 (hikkyō sekai / In the End, The World), you take cards from a shared area to your own territories (or column), like a multiplayer game of Freecell. The player may decide whether each territory is ascending or descending with the second card placed. Cards you don't want to play or are unable to play are collected are discarded, creating a penalty at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Alice cards act as nuisances in the game, but they are also the only way to score points. Each Alice is unique and features a special power that may be used for one turn after the card is placed. Territories may only have one Alice, and territories with an Alice may not be added to or reorganized. The territory will score at the end of the game based on how many cards match that Alice's preference. Players must carefully choose when to add each Alice, or they may be left with territories that don't score at all when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Danjo, the village's figurehead, puts out the invitation. Six men and women from all walks of life gathered together in the old temple. Danjo tilts his head at this strange group. &ldquo;Huh, I thought I called on five people&hellip; or did I invite six by mistake?&rdquo; Danjo felt uncomfortable, like small bones were scraping against each other in his throat. He suddenly recalled urgent business that required his immediate attention, so he excused himself. He ran out of the temple gates as fast as he could. Thus, a hundred stories will be told by the remaining six people. It's time to begin.<br/><br/>In 乏月百物語 (Bougetsu Hyakumonogatari/100 Tales Under the New Moon), Each player becomes one of the six storytellers who have come to the old temple to join in the telling of 100 stories. The more ghost stories they hear that are to their liking, the deeper and deeper the character becomes lost in the story, and the more Ghost Story Points they will be rewarded. If, on the other hand, a ghost story is not to the storyteller's liking, the player will pull their hair out and drop out of the game.<br/><br/>As the number of players gradually decreases, the last remaining player becomes the Ghost in the Ghost Story and loses the game. However, this ghostly player invokes a curse when they are revealed, and any player killed by the curse also loses the game.<br/><br/>",

The new political bureau has to choose between starting a war immediately or waiting to accumulate resources and troops in greater numbers, hoping that the NATO countries do not become stronger in the same way.<br/><br/>1987 focuses on a hypothetical but possible third worldwide large-scale military conflict. Players control land, air, and naval forces of the various sides engaged in the conflict. The scenarios provided allow players to examine multiple aspects of how a World War 3 could develop. NATO and WP are challenged to win quickly and decisively, as both forces and munitions downgraded rapidly in the face of modern combat operations.<br/><br/>The game is divided in a PreWar phase and a War Phase. In the PreWar phase players consume resource points to improve their military forces or their diplomatic or technological positions. During the War phase players are given a hand of cards to play out seven segments of each turn. The deck of cards forces players to constantly make decisions as they need to do a little bit of everything (move units, reinforce the armies, build resources points...) but they can only do one thing at a time. How and when players play the cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tromi is an abstract flip &amp; write for 1 to 4 where players fill a grid with trominoes based on their own viewpoint of a shared card. Each turn a card is drawn which assigns each player one of four symbols (the symbol closest to them). The card also shows four trominoes (shapes made up of 3 squares) in each of the four symbols. Each player, looking at the card from their own point of view, must draw their symbol's tromino along with at least one other tromino to their player sheet, without rotating or separating the trominoes. When a player cannot place their trominoes, the other players finish their turn and the game ends. Players score points for the longest string of trominoes in each symbol, and lose points for the largest empty area on their sheet. Player are also aided by three 1-time actions they can take once a game. These are: Rotate their chosen trominoes, Ignore their assigned tromino, and Play one tromino only.<br/><br/>",

Players start the game with 20 life and 0 gems and cast spells of the four Element types.<br/><br/>Fire spells deal damage, water spells restore health, gem spells craft gems, and electric spells counter other spells. Spells have a power and a target. The power is the size of the spell's effect and the target is who is affected.<br/><br/>Spells of the same Element type can be combined to produce a spell that has the power of the combined spells and one of the targets of the original spells (chosen by the caster). A spell can be overpowered by a more powerful spell of the same Element type, which also counters the less powerful spell.<br/><br/>Game play uses a simple draft system: players are dealt 4 cards and keep 2 and pass 2. Players take turns (clockwise) casting one spell or passing the turn without casting. Rounds end when every player passes without playing a spell. Between rounds, players can purchase a Greatspell for 8 gems, which is a powerful spell that can only be purchased once per game (per player).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Several of the Food Trucks have asked for your help in finding the best parking spaces. But beware! There are a lot of Food Trucks to remember, and some are hidden behind other trucks. Even worse, your opponent is trying to find the best spaces for their group of Food Trucks and just might frustrate your plans.<br/><br/>In The Great Food Truck Assembly, each player uses their Meeples to move among the Food Truck cards arrayed in a 3 x 3 grid . This is called the Parking Lot.  Using the specials of the Food Trucks, strategy, and a good memory, the players will move Food Trucks to match the locations depicted on their Parking Receipt cards. The winner is the first player to complete all of their Parking Receipt cards.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>UNIQUE AND STRATEGIC MEEPLE MOVEMENTS<br/><br/>Players can move their Meeples in 8+ different ways. Each move and, more importantly, the timing of the move is crucial to your next move and opponent&rsquo;s move.<br/><br/>NO DOWN TIME AND HIGH REPLAYABILITY<br/><br/>Players interact with each move whether they made the move or it was their opponent&rsquo;s move.  The game is consistently changing after each move.<br/><br/>LOTS OF FUN IN A SMALL BOX<br/><br/>The Great Food Truck Assembly is very portable and requires very little playing space. With only 26 components fitting in a mint tin box, you could play this on a cutting board in the back of a food truck!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The card set includes insects &mdash; common flies (fruit flies, midges, houseflies, and mayflies), royal flies (fireflies, robber flies, damselflies, and dragonflies), and wasps &mdash; and Murray. Common flies are useful for building swarms and getting more cards. Royal flies and wasps are useful for building swarms and for their unique special abilities.<br/><br/>Your main goal is to create swarms of insects to score points while using Murray to eat your opponents' swarms. Players keep their swarms face up on the table in front of them. Higher value insects and insects of the same type form higher value swarms &mdash; but you need to be careful because when Murray eats a swarm, he leaves a tadpole behind...and tadpole points can increase very quickly!<br/><br/>Ultimately, your success depends on how well you build your own swarms and how well you exploit opportunities to ruin other players' swarms, not to mention how well you manage Murray. The arrival of the hawk in the second round of play sets the endgame triggers in motion.<br/><br/>Your objective is to maximize your score. At the end of the game, your score will be based on the swarms and tadpoles you own. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A number of these lords seized the opportunity and never gave back those privileges. As a result, Three Kingdoms arose, each vying for dominance in China. What no one of those Three Kingdoms accounted for, was the rising lords at the borders.<br/><br/>A game of Assertion: The Three Kingdoms puts you in control of such a regional lord on the borders of China, competing for power against other rival players and the already established lords of the Three Kingdoms. Through an innovative action-selection system, players choose how to distribute the limited number of ministers they have at their disposal, to accomplish maximum growth each turn. Among the many paths to victory, players can elect to help the unaligned Three Kingdoms in a race to forge powerful alliances, or trick them into being pitted against each other with catastrophic results, or even amass their own forces and make a beeline to the Emperor's abandoned palace:<br/><br/>     War Room: Recruit armies, campaign across China, battle through a dice rolling system and conquer resource-rich territories.<br/>     Build: Erect buildings in your territories to cement your economy or strengthen your military campaigns<br/>     Negotiation: Coordinate and trade favors with the neutral lords of the Three Kingdoms to strengthen your influence over them<br/>     Diplomacy:  Depending on your friendship and alliances with the neutral kingdoms, direct them to assist you, outright combat your rivals, or send them to their doom!<br/>     Technology: Spend resources to advance your cultural and technological means and upgrade your buildings.<br/>     Taxation: Direct all your ministers to tax your subjects to receive income in order to be able to proceed with your campaign to unify China.<br/><br/><br/>During the game you recruit more cunning ministers and battle-proven generals. Also you score short-term milestones and long-term achievements to climb the hierarchy. The first player to be able to hold the Emperor office for a whole round wins the game.<br/><br/>No matter how, make sure that you sit atop the Dragon Throne, unifying China under one Kingdom. YOUR Kingdom!<br/><br/>Uniquely blending euro-style empire management and 4x-style map growth, Assertion: The Three Kingdoms packs a big grand-strategy punch set in an era loved by most: the Era of the Three Kingdoms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Franklin 1864 is Volume V, following Antietam, Shiloh, The Seven Days Battles, and Gettysburg.<br/><br/>The Battle of Spring Hill was a trap laid by Confederate General Hood in his drive on Nashville, trying to trap part of the Army of the Ohio under Union General Schofield. The historic battle did not go as Hood hoped with the Union forces escaping to Franklin relatively unscathed.<br/><br/>The Battle of Franklin the following day, November 30, was a last ditch by Hood trying to catch the Union forces with their back to a river and the bridges damaged.  A lack of time, artillery, and planning led to a vicious Confederate defeat with 14 Confederate generals killed and 55 regimental commanders.  The battle was a close run affair for the amount of time involved a Union deployment mistake almost giving Hood the victory he so desparately sought.<br/><br/>Fight each battle separately or combine to refight the 2 days together in a linked mini-campaign.<br/><br/>Players will command either the Confederate or Union armies as they battle to destroy opposing forces and capture key terrain objectives to determine victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PolyDots is an abstract strategy game and brainteaser for 1-4 players, aged 5+. Using 13-sided tiles called polykites, players align and connect tiles to claim territory with coins matching simple math outcomes.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS <br/><br/>     30 polykite tiles<br/>     80 coins<br/>     2 dice.<br/><br/><br/>GOAL:<br/>Score the highest points by claiming tiles.<br/>    <br/>SETUP:<br/><br/>     Shuffle the tiles and place face down between the players.<br/>     Give each player 20 coins of the same colour.<br/>     Each player takes five tiles and places them face up beside themselves.<br/>     Place a random starter tile between the players.<br/>     Decide upon the winning condition using either adjacent or non-contiguous territory.<br/><br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>Playing in turns, a player drops one of their tiles in an attempt to connect colored dots of their colour. A connection can be complete or partial. A complete connection creates a dot of one solid colour, while a partial connection has a dot of mixed colours. Each tile has four sets of 3 dot fragments of the same colour.<br/>If a connection is made, the player makes an attempt to claim one of the adjacent tiles with a coin. This is accomplished by rolling the dice and forming an equation. The equation dictates which coin to place. A coin can be placed on a territory claimed by another player only if the equation is higher than the value of the coin already in place.<br/>Claiming a Tile:<br/>A tile can only be claimed when an adjacent tile has formed a dot with the same colour. The subsequent coin can be placed on either tile.<br/><br/>Stealing Territory:<br/>A player can only steal a territory (tile) by forming an equation whose outcome is mathematically higher than the existing coin.<br/><br/>Stacking Tiles:<br/>A tile can be stacked on an empty tile if an appropriate dot can be formed.<br/><br/>Equations (Outcomes):<br/>Upon rolling the dice, a player chooses the outcome of a mathematical equation from the two numbers. Only 20 outcomes are possible between 1-36. The outcome or solution is from addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of the two numbers. For example, rolling 3 and 5 can yield 2, 8 or 15 from subtraction, addition or multiplication of the two numbers.<br/><br/>WINNING:<br/>There are two winning conditions based on the initial decision of claiming territory:<br/>Adjacent: add up the value of coins in the largest contiguous area.<br/>Non-Contiguous: add up the values of all coins.<br/>The player with the highest coins claimed wins. In case of a tie, the youngest player wins.<br/><br/>STRATEGY:<br/>Try to claim an important tile using the highest mathematically outcome. Such a tile links adjacent tiles to form a larger contiguous area.<br/><br/>SOLO GAME PLAY:<br/>This mode requires you to solve the brainteaser by perfectly aligning as many tiles as you can to form complete dots. The perfect solution uses all tiles.<br/><br/>POLYKITE BACKGROUND:<br/>Polykites were the miracle mathematical shape discovered in 2023. These 13-sided polygons allow a pattern to be formed that never repeats. <br/>In the math world, this kite- or hat-like shape is known as an &quot;aperiodic monotile&quot;, also called an &quot;einstein&quot; (or the German phrase for &quot;one stone&quot;).<br/>Slotted together, it's impossible to find a matching arrangement or orientation.<br/>On March 20, 2023, a group of computer scientists (David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig Kaplan and Chaim Goodman-Strauss) revealed their discovery nicknamed the &quot;hat polykite&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The other players follow in turn. Now the rule applies that the highest color played first wins. So if, for example, green-yellow-red-blue is played, red wins. When played: yellow-blue-blue-green, green wins.<br/><br/>Exception: If all players have the same color, the last player wins.

The object of the game is to knock out your opponents' kings, rooks, bishops and pawns while protecting your own pieces from enemy attack.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 4 types of pieces &ndash; 1 king (star), 2 rooks (squares), 2 bishops (crosses) and 4 pawns (circles). Play begins with the pieces arranged in a checkerboard pattern at the center of the board.<br/><br/>Choose a player to go first, then continue playing, with all players alternating turns.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may slide any one of your pieces one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Any pieces that lie in the way (regardless of number, color or type) get pushed along, including off the board. If a piece is pushed off the board, it is eliminated and is out of play for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>To avoid an infinite loop, you may not move any piece to a square that it vacated on your opponent&rsquo;s last turn.<br/><br/>A splinter occurs when one or more pieces become disconnected from the original group so that there are empty squares between those pieces and the original group.<br/><br/>Following a splinter, the largest group remains on the board and all other groups are removed. If the groups are of equal size, the player who caused the splinter decides which group is removed. If a piece is removed as a result of a splinter, it is eliminated and is out of play for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>A knockout occurs each time a player runs out of any type of piece (king, rook, bishop or pawn). Upon reaching two knockouts, a player is eliminated from the game, and that player&rsquo;s pieces are removed from the board.

In each segment, there will be several supernatural events, some of which are even accompanied by urban legends. When these supernatural events are triggered, they will bring negative effects to the field, such as weakening the character's mental value, giving the character  negative states, or eventually causing the character to fall into madness.<br/><br/>During the game, players can play topic cards to represent various topics on the show. Different topic cards have different effects, such as restoring mental value or drawing cards. The characters played by each player also has exclusive abilities that can help build their card library or remove effects. Players must also gather specific combinations of topic cards as quickly as possible to eliminate the supernatural events on the field.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is for all players to work together to eliminate the supernatural events and end the recording safely with everyone alive.<br/> &mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

The Advanced Game rules cover situations specifically applicable to this unique campaign starting with an amphibious invasion, followed by sweeping cross-country movement ending in siege warfare.<br/><br/>Thunder On the Mississippi provides excellent gaming value, with 11 Basic Game scenarios and one Advanced Game campaign, ranging from 1-turn learning scenarios to the full 70-turn campaign game.<br/><br/>It contains:<br/><br/>        GCACW Series Rules Booklet (24 pages, including illustrations, play examples, charts) <br/>        Thunder On the Mississippi Rules Booklet (about 56 pages, including scenarios, the Game as History, Gazetteer, etc.)<br/>        Two 22&quot;x 32&quot; full-color map sheets<br/>        Two 280-piece counter sheets and one 140-piece half counter sheet<br/>        One Terrain Effects Chart<br/>        Two full-color Force Displays <br/>        Two 4-page full-color Charts and Tables<br/>        Two 6-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher, adapted<br/><br/>",

However, the elements are very competitive&mdash;each wants to build the wealthiest part of the Kingdom. Join them in the battle for riches and influence!<br/><br/>Capitalia: Spontaneous Kingdom is a competitive family board game where each player takes on a role of one of the elements. The goal of the game is to be the first to earn 100 million.<br/>There are 4 actions players will perform on their turns: move, visit, sell a building (optional), and discard (or build).<br/>To move around the board, players will roll the dice and move their meeple the corresponding number of track spaces. When the movement is complete, a player must visit all the adjacent buildings around the hex where they stopped. To visit a building means applying the effect written on the building&rsquo;s tile. When visiting Town Square, players trigger various events; be it a good or a bad event, players cannot refuse to apply it. There is also a Magic Tower that can help players with magic effects throughout the game. After performing the visit action, players may sell a building if they wish to and gain as many millions as stated in the current building&rsquo;s price. Finally, players must choose between discarding a building from the market and getting the corresponding resources or constructing a building available in the market and spending resources for it.<br/>To invent the best winning strategy, players must constantly analyze the situation on the board and decide when it&rsquo;s time to buy and sell buildings. The game ends immediately when one of the players reaches 100 million in their supply.<br/>It's time to become the most influential of the elements and the new ruler of the Spontaneous Kingdom!<br/><br/>",

The new letters may go anywhere in the new word, but the order of the previous word's letters may not be changed.<br/>     Add letters from the hand to an existing word (yours or others') to make another valid word.<br/><br/><br/>If you play all the cards in your hand in a turn, draw 7 more and take another turn. <br/>If you can do nothing with the cards in your hand, draw another card and pass.<br/><br/>After the deck runs out and one player plays all their cards or no one can do anything more, everyone adds up their score, which is the value of each card in your words on the table, plus bonus points based on the length of each word, minus the value of the cards left in your hand. The highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each matchup in the first two bracket columns is associated with a card suit. Each turn, you'll flip over two cards from the deck, and find a matchup with same suit as one of the cards. Then you'll choose a card value to write in one of the two boxes for that matchup. Numbers are limited, so you'll need to be strategic about when and how you use each number!<br/><br/>The numbers for each matchup are either added or subtracted and the total contributes to a power score for each suit/team. When all of the matchups are complete, the power scores are used to determine the bracket finalists and winner. Achieve the highest possible score by correctly picking the finalists and the winner, maximizing the win margin of the final game, and minimizing penalties.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spella comes with 100 Mah Jong-type tiles that each have a letter of the English alphabet on the front. [The set could be used for any language that uses the Latin alphabet.] The game is set up and played like traditional Mah Jong: each player starts with a hand of 16 tiles; a turn consists of drawing a tile and discarding a tile; you can claim the recent discard if it helps you meld; you go out if you can meld all 17 tiles -- your hand and the tile you just drew.<br/><br/>The difference is that the melds are not sets and runs, but valid words of 2 or more letters each. When one player goes out, each player scores 1 point per letter in the valid words they can make. The winner (the one who went out) thus gets 17 points, but they also get 1 point per letter in their longest word. This bonus can be multiplied: <br/><br/>     Clean Out: If the winner never drew a discard tile, their bonus is doubled. <br/>     Fast Out: If the winner goes out with the first drawn tile, their bonus is times five. <br/>     Sentence: If the winner's words make a valid sentence, their bonus is times ten. (In this case, the words &quot;I&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are allowed.) <br/><br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest score after an agreed number of rounds, or the first to reach a target score.<br/><br/>Ten vowel tiles have small B on them, indicating they are Bound and must be played next to another vowel within their word.<br/><br/>If desired, a round's words can be limited to a certain part of speech (e.g. noun, verb, adjective), or a certain theme (e.g. sports, movies).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Word Challenge was designed by a teacher in remedial reading to be an aid to strengthening reading skills in students, but the games it includes are fun in their own right.<br/><br/>It includes a deck of 108 cards (104 letters and 4 wild cards), 100 plastic chips, and a rules book with rules for 16 different games, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Word Challenge. A form of contract rummy. Each of the 7 hands requires a player to meld words of a certain size (from two 3-letter words to three 4-letter words) before laying off the rest of their hand. <br/>     Word Rummy. Normal rummy, where players draw, meld words and discard. When one player empties their hand all stop and score according to the length of the words they made. <br/>     Cincos. Each player deals out a 5x5 grid. For each row and column, the player who makes the longest word in their grid gets chips from the others. <br/>     Barter I. Each player has 5 cards and 10 chips. Until a player can spell a 5-letter word, cards are turned up 1 by 1 and players can bid on them with chips. <br/>     Read My Mind. In a turn, one spells a word and the next player tries to recreate it given its letters, getting points for how well they do. <br/>     The Chips are Down. A variant on Spoons.<br/>     Memory Game. A variant on Concentration/Pelmanism, where players turn up 3 cards and try to spell a word of 3 or 2 letters. <br/>     Go Dig. Like Go Fish with word making. <br/>     Quick Trick. One player quickly reveals cards 1 at a time in a row; when anyone can spell a word from the revealed letters they call out the word, play pauses, and they collect the letters in that word. <br/>     Chipper Snitcher. Each player gets 5 cards, and estimates how long a word they'll be able to make after exchanging up to 3 cards. If the can spell a word that long they get its length in chips, unless another player can spell a longer word from those letters, in which case they get those chips. <br/><br/><br/>",

Each player begins with a hand of cards each representing one of 15 different actions like stealing a card (Sword), countering/reversing effects (Mirror), or eliminating a player (Death). On a turn, players can play multiple of any single card effect before drawing to recuperate. Eliminating opponents is rewarded with a bonus turn.<br/><br/>This is accompanied with the legalization of every form of table talk including extortion, threats, bluffs, and the facedown gifting and exchange of cards (not always those agreed upon). The game is a diplomacy sandbox where player&rsquo;s can creatively maneuver their opponents to their favor. Players have to make and break alliances and complete tense exchanges to gather the power they need to win.<br/><br/>At its core, Revenge is about outsmarting opponents through a mix of strategic card play and shrewd negotiation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each level involves exploring a map of the demon-infested village, where essential items for casting spells, opening doors and fighting demons are hidden. For each room, we have to roll the dice and choose which action to take, between opening a chest, taking an item, facing a pitfall and breaking down doors.<br/>The fights are the most interesting part, as we have to compare our dice roll with that of the device that represents the demons. To make things even more complicated, there are 3 levels of flooding for each map, which will force us to use the freeze points we have been given wisely. A challenge in which the device sets the exit point for each game and determines where to hide magic items and demons, making infinite combinations possible. We win when we have found all the items that make up the powerful talisman and chased the demons out of the village forever.

Gather evidence to prove her innocence and come face-to-face with a real witch in your midst. This game is darker and more PG-13, with magic, spells, colonial punishments, and even some jump scares.

        "description": "Number of Chapters in the Game: 2<br/><br/>In 1925, a sickness was threatening the community of Nome, Alaska. In the harsh winter months, the only way to deliver the medicine to them was by dog sled. A relay system of sled dog teams was put in place and these brave mushers and dogs attempted the impossible&hellip; a 674 mile race against time through the wilderness. You might know some of these famous dogs&hellip; like Balto or Togo&hellip; but, there has been a change to history. The medicine has been stolen by our rival and replaced with empty vials. The sled teams have already started their journey and it is up to you to catch up to the dogs and to pass off the real medicine to the musher. It won&rsquo;t be easy. Avalanches, dangerous wildlife, and frozen obstacles will attempt to delay you and the choices you make could add time or slow you down further. This is truly a race and only the cleverest of puzzlers will be able to catch up to them in time!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "James Ernest has challenged himself to make a game with minimal rules and pieces, with enough depth that it could still be an enduring (yet mysterious) pastime from a bygone era.<br/><br/>The Conscript will be an epistolary novel, set in the Dew Point universe (After the Fog, Shipwrights of Marino). James has barely even started that book, but we thought we might hurry him along by posting some of his preliminary chapters here.<br/><br/>Linos is one of the background mysteries of that novel, having once been a game so popular that no one bothered to document the rules. The title character, naval officer Galiard Gaspar Ewen, travels the world on many adventures, amassing a collection of game variations that lends just enough insight to take a wild guess at the mechanics of the original game.<br/><br/>The Pieces: Linos uses a set of twelve rectangular pieces: six dark and six light. Each piece<br/>has the proportions 1 x 1 x 2.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing stones from the supply, and adding them to the stack.<br/><br/>Each move scores points. Because there are advantages and disadvantages to going first, a complete match is two games, each player starting once, playing for the highest total score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is described in detail in Alysa Wishingrad&rsquo;s upper middle-grade novel, The Verdigris Pawn.<br/><br/>Fist is an asymmetric strategy game, meaning that each side has different pieces and goals. The King&rsquo;s forces are plentiful, but somewhat weak, while the Challenger&rsquo;s pieces are few, but clever. If the Challenger&rsquo;s pieces can learn to work together, they can overthrow the King.

Weather forecasts are made every round and the player who gets it right gets points. During a round, players play weather cards to change the weather.

On subsequent turns, players will either play a card to adjust the weather at 1 of 3 altars or will redraw their hand to get different cards. Each card played will advance the date closer to the ceremony date by 1, 2, or 3 steps. Certain dates on the calendar trigger events which allow the player to take additional actions to influence the outcome.<br/><br/>When the date marker reaches the ceremony date, a specific altar site is determined by drawing the next card from the deck. The goal for each player is to match their forecast card to the weather at the selected altar.  All players who correctly forecasted the weather score points. The number of points earned depends on the value of the other players' forecasts and the number of players who correctly forecasted the weather.<br/><br/>Rounds are repeated until a player scores 10 points.

        "description": "&quot;The .RAT (Regime of Authoritarian Tetrarchs - the New World's government), has created the ultimate weapon - A Killswitch in case the world's A.i. gets out of hand, aptly named ZeroDay.exe. Unfortunately, the .RAT also doesn't think too far in advance. Their precious A.i. learned of this weapon and were...angry, to say the least. The A.i. decided to take control of the program and have started targeting our bio-cybernetics (cybers). At first, they only targeted the .RAT and those close to it here in Shijima - the capital city - so us commoners didn't care much about it - hell, some were even happy about it. But recently there have been attacks against anyone the A.i. deems a threat&hellip;which is basically every human with cybers. <br/>We didn&rsquo;t want (or try) to get caught up in this fight, but here we are. Now, we&rsquo;re on the A.i.&rsquo;s shortlist, so the only thing left to do is infiltrate their databanks and destroy them before they get to us. And I guess if we save some lives, that&rsquo;s a plus.&quot; - Syn<br/><br/>Take on the role of one of 8 unique characters and fight to reclaim the city of Shijima in this Cyberpunk-syle, cooperative Rogue-lite dungeon crawler.<br/><br/>Each sessions will have you playing through one of 10 random Operations, followed by 1 of 5 random Boss Operations. Throughout the Operations, you will be downloading Hacks, attacking enemy A.i. robots, Scavenging them for parts to build Mods and items, and completing Operation-specific objectives!<br/><br/>On your turn, you will have 2 action points to spend on a variety of different actions.<br/><br/>Load Hacks to your Processing Track by paying their PRGM cost - a specific pattern of 3 PRGM tiles that must match in color and position in order to play the hacks. Or save Hacks to play them for a secondary ability outside of your turn that will assist your allies!<br/><br/>Attack enemies - Each character deals either Cyber or Physical damage, so you must be strategic in your attack as enemies will have different resistances from one type of damage.<br/><br/>Recharge to gain life and re-PRGM your PRGM tiles in order to form new patterns to use for Hacks.<br/><br/>Access terminals mid-Operation to gain instant stat bonuses for yourself and your allies.<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/><br/>Deterministic Combat - No dice rolling or card flipping. You will need to be very strategic in how you fight the enemies!<br/><br/>Hand Management - Each round you'll choose a card to play for initiative, discarding it after revealing. You'll need to play the right Hacks at the right time, while also saving Hacks to assist your allies in fights!<br/><br/>Deck Building - Each round you will be downloading a new Hack to add to your deck. Create a synergistic deck by choosing Hacks with PRGM costs that are easy to combo into, while also making sure to get a good mix of defensive and offensive secondary actions.<br/><br/>PRGM Patterns - Each Hack has a PRGM cost - a set of 1-3 tiles that must match in color and position on your player board - to play. When you play a Hack, you flip the tiles matching it's PRGM cost over, creating a new pattern with the backside of the tiles. Plan ahead to combo Hacks and chain PRGM costs to shift the balance in battle.<br/><br/>A.i. Threat and Initiative - Each round, players and enemies will be placed in order on an initiative track, determining turn order. Play faster initiative cards to go before the enemies, but be careful! The faster you go, the more Threat you'll gain, raising the A.i. Threat level and giving your enemies upgrades to damage or defense, adding status effects to their attacks, or if you go too fast, hitting their overload card giving them a 1-time effect that could devastate you and your allies!<br/><br/>Level up your character during operations by accessing terminals to raise stats.<br/><br/>Strategic Positioning - Take the high ground by moving into elevation spaces and gaining benefits to defense and range. Use obstacles to your advantage to keep enemies from reaching you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a blend of boss fighting and dungeon crawling set in a dark fantasy world where a cult venerates the dual suns. According to this belief, the emergence of the second sun heralds a time of cleansing for the earth. When this second sun finally appears in the sky, mysterious monsters wreak havoc, worshipped by the faithless as prophets of a new world. Players assume the roles of 'Blades of the Suns,' the armed branch of the dual suns order, who view the beasts as heretical omens and believe that their eradication will lead to humanity's salvation. The player`s task is to find and eliminate these monsters, often protected by the faithless cult. The game can be played in three modes: single scenario (where players engage in direct combat with the beast and cultists), mini campaign (where we play several scenarios in row), and story campaign mode . The game relies on dice pool management. At the start of each turn, the player rolls a pool of 4 dice to arrange actions and 1 die to determine the opponents' actions. At the beginning of each turn, an action card is also drawn, on which the player places one of their dice, granting them a specific pool of points (movement, attack, defense, skills, power). Using skill points, the player can set their active special actions from a choice of 6. A crucial aspect of combat with monsters is targeting specific body parts and flanking opponents. The game ends when the monster is defeated in one of three ways: by depleting all its health points, executing enough attacks on its weak point, or using the map to trigger a trap that defeats the monster. The game is designed for single-player mode but also offers a duel mode where players compete against each other (without other opponents).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Using 13-sided polygon tiles called polykites, players align and connect tiles to claim territory with coins matching simple math outcomes.<br/>The theme is growing fruits on triangular plots of land. Coins represent fruit crops of varying values.<br/><br/>WOODEN LASERCUT COMPONENTS <br/><br/>     50 polykite tiles<br/>     80 coins (4 colored sets of 20)<br/>     2 dice.<br/><br/><br/>GOAL:<br/>Score the highest points by claiming plots.<br/>    <br/>SETUP:<br/><br/>     Shuffle the tiles and place face down between the players.<br/>     Give each player 20 coins of the same colour.<br/>     Each player takes one tile placing it face up.<br/>     Place a random starter tile between the players.<br/><br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>Playing in turns, a player drops one of their tiles in an attempt to form a triangular shape of any color. If a triangle is formed, the player rolls the dice and forms an equation from the two numbers. The equation dictates which coin to place on the plot.<br/>Alternatively, the coin can be placed on a territory claimed by another player, but only if the equation is higher than the value of the coin already in place.<br/>Play until all tiles have been laid.<br/><br/>Claiming a Plot (Triangle):<br/>To claim a plot, place the coin matching the equation on any complete triangle. The triangle does not need to match your color, however, all sections of the triangle must be of the same color.<br/>Stacking Coins to Steal a Plot:<br/>You may stack a coin on another coin of any color as long as the new coin&rsquo;s value is higher than the top coin.<br/><br/>Equations (Outcomes):<br/>Upon rolling the dice, a player chooses the outcome of a mathematical equation from the two numbers. Only 20 outcomes are possible between 1-36. The outcome or solution is from addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of the two numbers. For example, rolling 3 and 5 can yield 2, 8 or 15 from subtraction, addition or multiplication of the two numbers.<br/><br/>STRATEGY:<br/>Try to claim an important triangle using the highest mathematical outcome.  Knowing that a player automatically gets 10 points for each triangle matching their color, you can forfeit a plot by placing a coin on a differently colored triangle.<br/>&emsp;<br/>SCORING &amp; WINNING:<br/>Each player automatically gets 10 points for each triangle matching their color. Add up the visible coins of the same color. Total the two numbers to get a final score. <br/>The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most plots wins. If still a tie, the player with the highest coins wins.<br/><br/>SOLO GAME PLAY:<br/>This mode requires you to solve a brainteaser by creating as many perfect triangles of the same color as possible using all 50 tiles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can breed your own Dragons and compete to be the one to train the toughest and most valuable specimens.<br/>Watch out for dragon eggs in your rolls, but take a chance on your final move to get the best creature!<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>Be the one who manages to breed the most difficult Dragons.<br/>The more difficult your Dragons are, the more points you will earn.<br/>Be careful with the Dragon Eggs, but take risks in your final move to get the best creature.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Players can roll dice up to 3 times per turn. After each roll, they can choose to keep some dice and reroll the rest, but once dice are kept, they can't be rerolled in that round. After three rolls or if they're satisfied with the results, they pick the best combination of Eggs to get a Dragon from the table. If they fail, they return a Dragon to the table. To get a Dragon, players need to collect at least 4 Eggs shown on the card.<br/><br/>When getting a Dragon, it's placed in the player's area and remains visible. They can also choose to get the Egg on the Dragon's right, which gives them a Barrier card for protection. Keeping a Barrier earns an extra point.<br/><br/>BRED DRAGONS:<br/>Bred Dragons are placed face-up nearby. When a second Dragon is obtained, it's placed next to the first, with an Egg between them. Only two Dragons can be visible at a time, so if a third Dragon is obtained, it covers one of the previous Dragons. All Dragons score points at the end.<br/><br/>GAME END:<br/>The game ends if there aren't enough Dragons to replenish the centre or if a player reaches a set number of Dragons. The winner has the highest score, based on Barriers held, points for Dragons, and extra points for evolutions. If tied, the player with the most Dragons wins.

Gather your friends to help you on your adventure and set off into an unknown dungeon!<br/><br/>-description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>In Relic Takers, players delve into a dungeon in search of relics using 2 characters each round. Each character has special abilities and order, so players must select the best character for their needs.  Outside of the dungeon, there are requests for specific combinations of relics (combinations of color and number of relics needed to 'complete' a request). Players must acquire these from within the dungeon.  This is accomplished by drawing from a bag of relics... but a player's character is limited in how many relics they can carry.  Get to greedy and spend too much time in the dungeon and your haul out may be quite a bit sorter than your needs.<br/><br/>The game centers on a press-your-luck mechanic in drawing relics. Players must balance this risk by drafting the right characters to aid them in completing requests.

It has a few interesting projects lined up. However, it wants to see how these projects will behave not only in bull and bear markets, but above all what fundamental value they can offer people. Which of the cryptocurrencies will eventually beat all the others and become the accounting unit of Fiatlandia?<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to beat other cryptocurrencies and become Fiatlandia's official currency. This is achieved by increasing Fundament value to 7 or 8 and gaining 13 or more Market Cap units.<br/><br/>All players share one standee which moves along the game board. After rolling a die, a player moves the standee and resolves the corresponding action space:<br/><br/>     Fundament: Active player takes the top Fundament card, reads a question out and all players use their tokens to guess the correct answer. If answered correctly, their Fundament value increases, otherwise it drops by 1.<br/>     Pump +, Retail, FOMO, To the Moon, BTD: Active player increases their Market Cap.<br/>     Pump -, FUD, Correction, Flashcrash: Active player decreases their Market Cap.<br/>     Whales: Active player rolls a die. Even numbers mean increasing Market Cap by that number of units, odd numbers mean decreasing Market Cap.<br/>     Market event: Active player takes the top card from the Market event deck and resolves the effect.<br/>     Consolidation: Active player is not affected by other players' actions in this round.<br/>     Speculation: All players can use their &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; tokens to predict the market development. Active player then rolls a die; even numbers mean market goes up (&quot;long&quot; tokens), odd numbers mean market goes down (&quot;short&quot; tokens). Players who guessed correctly increase their Market Cap and vice versa.<br/>     HODL: Active player gains a HODL token which can be discarded to avoid decreasing Market Cap.<br/><br/><br/>",

But the pixies are moody, the brownies are housecleaning, the gnomes are working in the mines, and the trolls are sitting idly by. The leprechauns are accumulating rune stones, and the goblins are playing tricks. Oberon, the arrogant king of the fairies, can't read the mood, and Titania, the queen, is touring the forest with her fairy friends in tow. Gathering such fickle fairies is a difficult task. Fortunately, they love shiny rune stones that contain the power of fire, water, earth, and trees! To convince the fairies to participate in the festival, you must give them the rune stones they desire.<br/><br/>In Titania, each player drafts rune stones from a shared board. Players use their rune stones to pay the cost of summoning fairy cards from a common deck. Each fairy has its own special ability, so players must use these abilities to summon the highest scoring fairies!<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out of cards. The player with the most victory points on their fairy cards wins. Gain bonus points by creating sets of matching fairies.

Of these witches, who will contribute the most to building their mansion with its mysterious layout?<br/><br/>In each turn of Chester, a player chooses one room tile from their hand and adds it to the mansion, marking it with one of their cubes.

In The Botch, you're going to lie, cheat and steal, and if you're really lucky you'll get out of this with your skin intact.<br/><br/>The Botch Is Back is a hidden-information bluffing game designed to keep things reasonably chaotic and make it hard for players to get an overwhelming edge through experience and memorisation. It's a game to get people into gaming, where things going embarassingly wrong is part of the design.<br/><br/>The Botch Is Back contains 5 Basic roles and 5 Basic items, which are designed to be played as an entry-level stable game. As you become more comfortable with the game you can add more roles and more items, choosing from an additional 7 Advanced roles and 7 Advanced items.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This game takes place in the Modern era and is fully compatible with every other Warfighter Core game. Warfighter Chtorr looks to simplify the system by reducing the number of keywords and effects, while keeping the complexity and decision-making the series is known for. New features:<br/><br/><br/>     Field Points! Chtorran bodies that haven't been cooked or exploded can be studies by the science team working with your Squad! Preserve their bodies by not using Explosive, Spray, or Fire Attacks to earn Field Points. Spend Field Points to Spark Skills or purchase new Equipment/Weapons mid-Mission with Radios to help with your fight against the alien threat.<br/>     Your Weaponry matters! There are 3 types of Weapons in Chtorr: Fire, Ice, and Conventional. Starting with Fire, these Weapons offer a huge Defeat Cover (Pen) bonus but reduces the Hostile's available Field Points, they also come with very little Ammo, meaning you have to feather the trigger, and use Field Points to resupply more Fuel mid-Mission.<br/>     Next is Ice, these Weapons do not inflict direct Wounds to Hostile cards, but instead place Slow counters. For each Slow Counter placed on a Hostile, Soldiers add 1 to their Attack and 1 to their Defeat Cover (Pen) rolls against that Hostile until the end of the turn. This means you can use Conventional Weaponry against Chtorr to preserve their Field Points!<br/>     Finally, we have Conventional Weaponry, these Weapons don't have great Defeat Cover (Pen) roll bonuses, but they more than make up for that with quantity of Attacks! These Weapons can perform exponentially more Attacks than Fire or Cryo based Weaponry and most importantly, preserve the Hostile's Field Points!

        "description": "Bounders is a territorial game played on a hexagonal board of side length 7 or 9, and some light and dark stones. Players decide who goes first, and alternate turns. Each turn, players put a stone of their color on an empty space, adjacent to an equal number of light and dark stones.<br/><br/>When no more moves are available, the game is scored. Players get points for surrounding territories: for each empty region, the player with more stones bounding that region is awarded points according to the number of empty spaces there. Regions next to an equal number of light and dark stones are not counted. The player with the higher total score wins.<br/><br/>There are also two advanced rules that are used in case of serious tournament play, to ensure a competitive experience. First, this involves deciding who starts via the pie rule, in which the first player places one stone and gives their opponent a one-time opportunity to swap sides. Second, players use a slightly more nuanced scoring system, in which the following scores are compared until a winner is determined:<br/><br/>     Awarded the higher total score<br/>     Awarded points from the largest single territory<br/>     Awarded points from more distinct territories<br/>     Played fewer stones<br/>     Offered the pie<br/><br/><br/>Bounders was designed by Alek Erickson in March 2024. The game was inspired by Mark Steere's game Hadron and Markus Hagenauer's game Cairo Corridor, and accidentally bears some similarity with Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures's game Quinten and Phil Leduc's game Midgard.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The bounty you collect may also be used to make your Hero stronger.<br/><br/>You win the game by being the last Hero standing. There can be only one! If your Hero dies, you lose.

The Fighter wades into battle with any weapon he can lay his hands on, dealing damage with the force of his attack.

Using his knowledge of the mountains, hills and forest, the Ranger tracks his opponents and uses his weapons to defend Archwynd from invaders. He is a well-balanced champion, capable of defending the realm to the death!<br/><br/>The Rogue: Stealth is the primary style of the Rogue in Archwynd. Using her speed and agility, she avoids being hit and uses her weapons to deal precise damage to the invaders of Archwynd. The Rogue is definitely in it for herself as she races to loot treasure (and save Archwynd, if she can!)<br/><br/>The Sorceress: Magic is the primary style of the Sorceress in Archwynd. Using her knowledge of the arcane arts, she avoids being hit and uses magic to deal damage to her enemies. She is a powerful magic user who can easily contend to be the final Champion of Archwynd!<br/><br/>ENCOUNTER CARDS:<br/><br/>Archwynd may be played with varying levels of difficulty to adjust the challenge and length of the game. From standard, to difficult, or god-mode, the more difficult the game, the shorter the game before one player is named the Champion.<br/><br/>When an Encounter occurs, the Hero must content with either a Monster, a Trap, or a Benison. Monsters attack the Hero whose turn it is (unless deflected away by special cards); Traps may deal damage to one or more Heroes simultaneously; or Benisons may grant healing or other boons that help the Hero in their adventure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Pieces cannot be moved off the board or into cells already occupied by pieces of friendly color.<br/>Pieces can move to any cell with a piece of the opponent's color, and then that opponent's piece is captured by replacement and removed from the game.<br/>On the move, a piece can jump over any number of other pieces, regardless of color.<br/><br/>-Restrictions<br/>Moving a piece forward is always allowed.<br/>If a piece is moved sideways, the number of objects of its color must be reduced after the move.<br/>Moving a piece backward is not allowed.<br/><br/>Game end<br/>The game ends when there are no legal moves left for the active player.<br/>The player with fewer objects wins.<br/>If there is a tie, the player who ended the game, i.e., the player who no longer has a legal move, wins.<br/><br/>",

All other players will have to adapt their strategies around the Celestial's win condition to ensure their own victory.<br/><br/>The Celestials expansion is focused on introducing more deduction and misdirection to the game and adds a new miniature, renown tracker, spell cards, and 7 celestial cards.<br/><br/>SERVANTS EXPANSION<br/>Each servant influences the quest in its region, so players must consider their effects when determining where to move their Demi. Moving the servants introduces new strategic and tactical options towards victory.<br/><br/>The Servants expansion adds 3 new miniatures and cards. Servants can be commanded by all players.<br/><br/>RENEWAL EXPANSION<br/>Every time a demigod enters The Pools when being moved out of the Abyss, the player moving them activates the current modifier on the Renewal Dice. That play then re-rolls the renewal dice, resulting in a new modifier for the next player to move a demigod from the Abyss to the Pools.<br/><br/>The Renewal Dice replaces the permanent 'refresh card' effect that normally activates in the Pools, creating more dynamic gameplay and ever-shifting strategies surrounding how players use the Abyss.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is not unheard of for some combatants to make a life of fighting daily in the Pits. Linzara 'The Cyclops' is such a combatant.<br/><br/>The rules of the pits are not written anywhere and there is nothing that suggest that the combatants must outright challenge the Pit Lord when their trials are complete, but this is often the last mistake that fresh combatants make.<br/><br/>Lovingly referred to as 'The Cyclops' ever since she lost one eye from a strike by a Clawfoot's tail stinger. She used the very stinger to impale the beast in the same combat trial. Linzara is content to enter the Pits each day, emerging from her hideout deep in the decrepit depths of the pit tunnels. From here she makes short work of the enemies that emerge and puts on a fine show for the people of the Megopolis. After her three challenges are complete, she opts not to attempt the fourth and instead disappears back into the tunnels only to emerge the next day. Deep within depths of the pit tunnels thrives a secret city where only the most brutal survive. This is the place Linzara calls home.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, Manfred is dying (for he is old) and upon his death he knows his empire will crumble (for he is wise). To maintain peace in Almokon, Manfred must decide, now, who is to wear the crown of the empire upon his passing.<br/><br/>You, the player, are one of many monarchs vying for Manfred&rsquo;s favor. Your ability to rule, to protect, and to grow your realm will determine if you will be the next emperor of Almokon.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a unique monarch, city, and deck. Players then take turns playing cards from their hand - improvements, characters, cults, and events - to build up their realm and launch attacks on their opponent by land and sea. The first player to win Manfred's favor or obliterate their enemy is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

However, 3OFF requires a player be the first to remove all their tokens that are lined up 3-in-a-row to win.<br/><br/>Although the objective sounds simple enough, it will not be that straightforward because the game consists of 8 tokens per player, which creates a paradox of needing to remove all your tokens to ultimately win, but requiring the addition of one or more tokens to ensure it.

A token can move any number of spaces in a straight line in any direction, as long as the space travelled to is empty and not blocked (i.e., you cannot jump over tokens) by a token belonging to either player<br/>     After black's turn, white and black, on subsequent turns, must now do 1 of 3 things: (a) remove 3 lined up tokens, (b) strategically move a token to an empty space according to rule #3, or (c) if any tokens have been removed by a player, strategically add one token back to any empty space<br/>     The first player to remove their last 3 remaining lined up tokens on their turn wins<br/>     A player who is unable to perform any of the actions in step 4 at any point during the game, loses the game    <br/><br/><br/>",

Air &amp; Armor is a grand tactical simulation of a hypothetical Soviet attack on West Germany in the mid-1980s. V Corps depicts the collision of the Soviet 28th Army and  1st Guards Tank Army with the U.S. V Corps in the Fulda Gap. Three maps cover the sector from the Inner German Border all the way to Frankfurt.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor employs a highly interactive game system with asymmetric rules modeling the different command &amp; control capabilities of each alliance. The game simulates all major aspects of modern warfare, including reconnaissance, combined arms operations, air, helicopter, and artillery strikes, chemical and electronic warfare, and combat engineering. Multiple levels of hidden intelligence produce a true &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; providing plenty of opportunities for deception, surprise, traps, and ambushes. Play this game to experience what it would have been like to command a division in battle if the Cold War had gone hot.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor: V Corps features twelve different scenarios, each a complete game by itself. Each scenario covers a different battlefield operation, including a meeting engagement, a delaying action, a frontal assault, an attack on a fortified line, a blocking action against a Soviet OMG, an armored cavalry covering force, two NATO counterattacks, a desperate defense of a broken line, and a surprise attack with NATO still in barracks.  Extensive Scenario, Player, and Designer Notes provide advice on play and historical detail.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor is ideal for solitaire play.  The hidden intelligence system provides a high level of tension during solitaire play because, even though a solo player is commanding both sides, he never knows what he will hit when he conducts an operation.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Complexity:  High<br/>Time Scale: 1 Turn = 2 Hours<br/>Map Scale: 1 Mile/Hex<br/>Unit Scale: Companies to Regiments<br/>Players: 1-7 Players<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Playing Time: 3 to 12 hours based on Scenario<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This game is for 1 to 4 players. The only way to settle a feud is to fight it out in the squared circle. Build your feud to a steel cage match.<br/><br/>Styles make fights. Each superstar builds a custom 40 card deck with a specific fighting style. Choose a Brawler, Showstopper, Powerhouse, Dirty, Technician, or Highflyer style. Superstars are also either Heel, Babyface, or Conflicted(a little bit of both).<br/><br/>With these custom decks, many match types are possible, 1 vs 1, 3 man matches, Battle royale, tag team, table, ladder matches, steel cage, submission, street fights, and more. Each match has a different win condition to increase replay ability. A 1 vs 1 match is won when one wrestler has reduced one of their rival's health stats to zero. The three body health parts are limbs, body, and head. Zero head health equals a knockout, zero limb health equals a submission, and zero body health equals a win by pinfall. Another example of a match is an ironman match, which is won by reducing all 3 body health stats to zero.<br/><br/>Achieve combos attacks by building up stamina. Your superstar has eight powerful individual cards that are only used by the superstar you choose. These cards include finishers and signature attacks, managers, special weapons, arena areas, and individual talents. Attacks are achieved by playing Stamina (the resource used in the game) to play attacks like, body slams, punches, kicks, flying attacks, and submission holds.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One of the most pleasant ways to explore a new city is... just going for a walk. But how to chart a tour route that satisfies everyone? There&rsquo;s an answer!<br/><br/>En Route is a flip-and-write game in which you create tour routes to the most interesting landmarks of the real-world cities (London, New York City, Hong Kong, Paris, Cairo, and Rio de Janeiro) and the made-up First City packed full of geek references. Every city features basic and specific mechanisms, so all of them play and feel differently.<br/><br/>Cards are not flipped randomly &mdash; instead, an active player plays one card face up, and two players next to them secretly choose one card each. Then, an active player selects one of the two and discards the other. After that, all players use coordinates and other information from the two cards left on the table to draw their tourists and routes.<br/><br/>During the game, route segments are drawn, connecting different types of tourists to various landmarks and attractions. A game of En Route lasts exactly 10 rounds. At the end of the game, each place of interest on the final route will earn players Prestige Points according to its rules. Whoever creates the most satisfying tour route, wins!<br/><br/>The game features constant and quite intense player interaction, and players have a fair degree of control and can strategize. It plays fast, dynamic, and makes you constantly think about what your opponents want to do (and sometimes even negotiate so that they play cards that are beneficial to you!).<br/><br/>En Route.

        "description": "Pura Vida is not only the life motto in Costa Rica, but also stands for the country's enormous biodiversity and its stated goal of living in harmony with nature and wildlife. The approximately 30 national parks, which make up around 26% of Costa Rica's area, also make an important contribution to the protection of its biodiversity. <br/>All kinds of landscapes can be discovered here: from dense rainforests and mangrove forests to rocky volcanoes, dry savannahs and sandy coasts. The wildlife is equally diverse: toucans, sloths, snakes, butterflies and many other species live here &ndash; not least the red-eyed tree frogs, which are so iconic for the country.<br/>As a ranger, your task is to create a balanced animal population in the numerous nature parks. The particular challenge is to take the animals&rsquo; individual and natural movements into account. Besides taking numerous tricky decisions, you will also get to know Costa Rica's cheerful and relaxed attitude to life - Pura Vida!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>On your turn you must choose between these two actions:<br/>a) Move<br/>b) Rest <br/>Move: Move your ranger along the path and take the tile where you end your movement. Place the tile in your own national park, trying to align animals and/or landscapes the best way to get points.<br/>Rest: Move your ranger to the rest area. You are not allowed to make any more moves this round.<br/><br/>Scoring: Every time you place a tile in your national park, you check whether you meet one of the biodiversity criteria and receive points for it:<br/>For 3/4/5 tiles directly next to each other in a row or column with different animals and the same landscape, you get 2/2/3 points. <br/>For 3/4/5 tiles directly next to each other in a row or column with different landscapes and the same animals, you get 2/2/3 points. <br/>For 3/4/5 tiles directly next to each other in a row or column with different animals and different landscapes you get 1/1/2 points.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as someone has reached at least 20 points. This person wins.<br/><br/>",

Most of the contracts are 1 vs All (solo), however, when playing 4 players you can have 2 vs 2 (team) contracts as well. Completing a solo contract will let you place two cubes, where as a team contract lets each player place one cube. Be careful, any failed contracts will count against you at the end of the game!<br/><br/>Contracts also change how the card play system works. One contract might have you play Talon Exchange/Must Follow/Must Trump/Must Win while another contract will have you play Talon Reveal/Must Follow/May Trump/May Win.<br/><br/>There is also an advanced mode that includes a side board full of additional bonus contracts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Not only that, but you must remember to always grant exactly 3 wishes. No more, no less!<br/><br/>Third Wish is a trick taking game that has players aiming to win exactly 3 tricks each round. The deck is made up of 3 asymmetrical suits and special Genie cards. It is a must follow trick taker where the highest card, regardless of suit, wins the trick and the lowest leads the next trick. After a set number of tricks (10 for 3 players and 13 for 4 players) any players that took exactly 3 tricks will gain a gold lamp. If you take more than 3 tricks, you will gain a bust cube, which can help you avoid tricks in future rounds, but will have a chance to count against you at the end of the game. After a set number of rounds (short game is 6 for 3 players and 4 for 4 players) the player with the most lamps wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Designed for 2, 3, 4, or 6 players the game is played with tokens on a hexagonal shaped board.  Three dice are thrown to start a round, cards are drawn and played, and tokens are moved based upon the player's strategy.  The game takes 45 minutes to an hour for most games played primarily for strategy purposes, but when played primarily for social engagement the time passed with others normally lasts a couple of hours.  The 108 unique starting cards included in the box have eight topics (1 topic for each suite with 2 decks included) and each card has a QR code to source the cards' statements.<br/><br/>The goal and setup of the game are simple.  The advancement of pieces on the board is easy, and the fun new knowledge gained is wild.<br/><br/>Players move their tokens based upon the number of turns rolled for the round, what the bonus color cards say they can do for the round, and what level token they have to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fish Off is a 2-4 player competitive dice and tile fishing game where you catch and steal fish from players through a tug-of-war dice mechanic. Players compete to catch and steal point value fish to earn the highest score over 3 matches. Most of the game is played synchronously, meaning that players all take their turns at the same time allowing the game to be played at a good steady pace with the occasional dice war needed to settle the inevitable tug-of-wars over high value fish.<br/><br/>The game board displays a 5 by 5 grid of water with hook icons arrayed along each row and column of the grid. Players sit along each edge of the board and are given Hook and Seagull tokens of the same colour, matching their edge of the board. Fish tiles are randomly shuffled and dealt face down on the grid, discarding all leftover tiles. Players are now ready to start their first round of game.<br/><br/>One Round of play is broken into 3 steps: Positioning, Casting and Catching. Players select a Position along their edge of the game board by placing their Hook token on a hook icon which will be beneath a column of tiles. Players then roll their dice to Cast their hook and resolve where their hook landed. Players then reveal their hooked tile and decide whether they want to place a Seagull token on an opponent's tile to try to steal it off them. Uncontested tiles are collected first, then any remaining tiles with multiple players contesting them must enter a dice base tug-of-war to see who keeps them. Once this has all been resolved, one round of play has concluded, and a new round can start. Players spend multiple rounds catching and stealing fish until all players have collected 5 fish, ending the Match. Players tally the face value of their fish and can now setup the board for a new match. The player with the most points collected over the 3 matches is the overall winner of Fish Off.<br/><br/>The game board is double-sided with Calm Waters on one side and Strong Currents on the reverse side. The Calm Waters side is suitable for first time players and younger kids who want to play a simple fun game. The Strong Currents side is suitable for more experienced players and adults who want to add another level of complexity and strategy to their turns. The currents help direct a players hook through the waters granting them a greater chance to hook a better fish tile. Players can also choose to add Fish Set Bonuses to either side of the board which act like poker rules. For example: Players are rewarded bonus points for catching unique sets of fish at the end of a match i.e. A Full House, Four of a Kind and a 5 Fish Straight to name a few.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
