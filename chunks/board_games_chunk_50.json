The game is played on a board having seven hexagonal areas of the same size, each being subdivided into six equilateral triangles of the same size, and thirty-six tiles of the same size which are shaped to overlie and fill the equilateral triangular areas.<br/><br/>The seven hexagonal areas are arranged such that one is in the center and the others are distributed around it, each having one side contiguous with the side of the centrally located hexagonal area and two sides which are contiguous with two other hexagonal areas. The tiles are formed in six groups, each group having a different distinctive surface marking which can be used for bidding and playing procedures.<br/><br/>",

The small tanks have a moving range up to 6 spaces, while the big ones may move up to 4 spaces. Immediately after moving, the tanks may shot at an enemy tank. Shooting is only permitted straight ahead in the direction of the enemy encampment. The small tanks have a firing range of exactly 3 spaces, the big ones can shoot at tanks that are 3 or 4 spaces ahead. The dark green spaces can't be moved on, but can be shot over. When a tank is hit, it is removed from the game. If a tank neglects to shoot at an enemy, it may be removed by the enemy player. A tank, which has a friendly tank in the space in front of it, is protected from beeing shot at. If a tank reaches the enemy encampment, it reverses it's direction and attacks from the back. This makes a pincer tactic possible. The player who destroys the whole tank force of his opponent wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It was designed to explore the potential of theatre nuclear weapons in hypothetical battles of the early Cold War era.<br/><br/>At its core is a recently de-classified set of rules by Lt. Col. Field found by Bob Cordery in the UK National Archives, and is published with suggested amendments and augmentations for the wargamer by the publisher, John Curry.<br/><br/>It uses a &quot;kriegsspiel&quot; format with a central umpire (controller) to implement the rules and feed relevant information to two sets of players. The umpire is there to provide information and implement the rules, not make his own assessments.<br/><br/>It works with orders given on an hourly basis to units on a 1:50,000 scale map or terrain model. Units are armour, infantry, artillery and engineers in battalion squadron and regimental sized units that operate, broadly, in 2km map squares. Combat resolution is probability driven and focusses on the need for TIME to plan co-ordinated assaults in attack or increase defence strength by preparing and digging in. One of the main purposes of the wargame was to allow officers to experiment with tactical nuclear warfare.<br/><br/>These are playable rules, but also a work of reference about operational warfare between 1940 and 1970.<br/><br/>Obtained from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wargaming.co\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.wargaming.co</a><br/><br/>",

First came The Metric Mile, much played both solo and as a multi-play and postal game. Legends is an 'eye-in-the-sky' game, the user is 'looking down' on the track with no more involvement than rolling the dice, consulting the Charts and keeping the Race Control Sheet up-dated. A few years ago Legends could not have been published, the demand was all for 'involvement' games, where the user's input had a definite effect on the outcome. The Sport of Kings, with its many small decisions all affecting the final outcome, is typical of that genre.<br/><br/>The brief for Legends was for a non-involvement ATG simulation with races playable in 10-12 minutes, accurate as far as any mixed-era simulation can be, providing enough detail and stats. (split and final times) to keep the hard-core replay gamer happy and with a system that needed a minimum of book-keeping. With a simple but effective Track Display, one hundred ATG athletes who will run their races in the way they usually ran them in real life (but with ability to change race 'plans' if you wish) with times geared to 2007 standards, pace-makers, 'fast' and normal tracks, weather effects, race 'quality' effects and fitness levels.<br/><br/>Legends will be an ideal vehicle for solo campaigns, enough 'going on' to keep the interest at a high level, fun to run races, and the chance to run a full season incorporating Grand Prix meetings, Olympics (or World Championships), world-record attempts and with a few minor meetings flung in to keep the mix flexible.<br/><br/>--description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Canal Age and the Industrial Revolution that birthed it produced several new transportation systems, one of which was a circular canal network known as the Cheshire Ring. Narrow boats were pulled around the ring carrying stone, coal, and iron for use in development of the landscape. The boatmen were paid for delivery and paid the expenses of the trip from this amount. One of the largest expenses was tolls, which were set not only on the amount of goods but also the type of goods carried. Clever but unscrupulous boatmen soon learned that by mixing loads they could fool the toll keepers to help reduce their expenses.<br/><br/>Each player owns two narrow boats and use actions to move their cargo from one market to another along the canal. As they move through the toll houses (the signature Stratamax colored dice), the house owner must be paid. It is up to the toll house owner to decide whether to take the toll offered or use an action to inspect the load in case the boatman is trying to rip him off. If caught in a deception, the boat owner pays a fine. However, if the boatman was honorable then the toll house owner gets a penalty for the time and delay caused.<br/><br/>",

Once a monster is complete (has one of each Body Part) it can start using these powers for you to help you achieve your goals. Each monster is worth a certain amount of points. Incomplete monsters (monsters under construction or MUCs) are worth negative points. If a player starts his or her turn with a set amount of points in their army of monsters he or she wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Deciding to rest the Panzer divisions, Hitler entrusted Goering's Luftwaffe with the mission of smashing the British evacuation at Dunkirk. The already thinly stretched RAF had to provide an air umbrella to protect the stream of ships plying the English Channel. Although the British lost the equivalent of six squadrons of fighter aircraft plus a large number of ships sunk or damaged they managed to evacuate over 300,000 Allied soldiers, including the bulk of the BEF.<br/><br/>",

A variety of boards with varying layouts and connections are available. Current boards include Psyche's Board, Tenstones, WaterBird, Pentagram/Mercedes, and Circuit Board.<br/><br/>Players take turns writing &quot;ideas&quot; into vacant spaces on the board. In competitive play, players score points &quot;by claiming links between the idea in their own move and the ideas already in play in those positions on the board connected to it by the lines of the board in question. A link can be any form of association - similarity, opposition, cause-and-effect, metaphor. Fanciful links may be made and enjoyed - or hotly contested.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The HipBone Games are based on the concept of the Glass Bead Game described by Hermann Hesse in his Nobel-winning novel, Magister Ludi.

The top card is turned face-up and placed in a separate discard pile. Decide who will play first. The first player selects the top card from either the draw or discard pile. If the selected card is a Berenstain Bear, the player takes the card and places it in front of him. If the card is a hat or WIND card, the player places it on the discard pile. Play passes to the left with the next player selecting a card from either the draw or discard pile.<br/><br/>As players collect members of the Berenstain Bear family, the may &quot;cap&quot; each character with the appropriate hat. For example, on his first turn a player draws a Brother Bear card. On a later turn he draws Brother Bear's baseball hat. He may then &quot;cap&quot; Brother Bear by placing the hat card on the Brother Bear card. If a player draws a hat but does not have the character that matches it, OR if the character already has his/her hat, the card must be discarded. Note that some cards feature two hats. Players may choose which hat, if any, to use and &quot;cap&quot; the appropriate bear. Once a character is &quot;capped&quot;, the hat may not be removed unless it is blown off by a WIND card (see below).<br/><br/>If a player draws a WIND card, he may blow one hat off any of his opponents' cards. The hat and WIND cards are then placed on the discard pile. A player may not remove a WIND card from the discard pile.<br/><br/>The first player to match all four Berenstain Bear characters with their correct hats wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game was described by the Dutch mancala researcher Alexander Johan de Voogt during an extensive field study in 1998. The board is usually dug in the earth and the players, mostly adult women and men, are often surrounded by a curious crowd of spectators.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Katro is played on a 6x6-board, a very unusual size for a mancala game. Each player owns one half (upper or lower) of the board.<br/><br/>Initially there are two stones in each hole.<br/><br/>You must start your move in the outermost row of your side which has a non-empty hole. Singletons can also be moved.<br/><br/>Moves are multi-lap. As in four-rank Mancala you only move on your side.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, all contents are picked up and are distributed one by one in the following holes by continuing in the same direction.<br/><br/>If the last stone of a lap is dropped into a non-empty hole which is directly opposite to a non-empty hole of your opponent, all the contents of his hole are captured. His stones and the contents of your own hole are then distributed in a new lap starting in the next hole on your side. The following conditions must be met to effect a capture:<br/><br/><br/>     As long as you have a non-empty hole in your innermost row, you may only capture from your innermost row. When your innermost row is empty you capture from your central row, if this row is also empty, you capture from your outermost row. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     You may only capture opponent's stones from his innermost row as long as there are still non-empty holes. If these holes are all empty you may capture stones from your opponent's central row. If this row is also empty you capture opponent's stones from his outermost row. <br/><br/><br/>The game is played in a boustrophedon manner. The direction of play is either (see notation below) abcdefghijklmnopqrfedcbalkj or alkjihgrqponmabcdefgh.<br/><br/>Notation<br/><br/>a b c d e f<br/>l k j i h g<br/>m n o p q r<br/>M N O P Q R<br/>L K J I H G<br/>A B C D E F<br/><br/>Players are not permitted to pass a move.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no move.

        "description": "Kisolo (also called Cisolo in Kasai) is a mancala type game played by the Luba, Lulua and Songye in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Initially there are three seeds (makombo) in each hole.<br/><br/>If a player cannot capture, he starts his turn by emptying one of his holes and then distributes its contents one by one counterclockwise into the following holes. When he can't capture (see below), he makes a new lap by distributing the contents of the hole following the hole in which he dropped the last seed in hand. The move ends when the last hole is followed by an empty one. It is either possible to capture before the actual move starts or during a move.<br/><br/>If, at the beginning of a turn, two inner holes (one from each player) opposite to each other contain seeds, the enemy seeds of the opposite hole and, if there are any, of the enemy hole of the same file behind it are picked up and then distributed counterclockwise on the own side. The first seed must be put into the hole which effected the capture. This kind of capturing is compulsory, but the player is free to decide from which holes he captures when he has more than one choice.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole and the following hole is in the inner row and contains seeds, the contents of the opposite enemy hole in the opponent's inner row are captured and also the seeds in the outer enemy hole just behind it. Again, the captured seeds are distributed on the player's own side, starting in the hole which effected the capture (that is, straight opposite the captured holes).<br/><br/>The player who captures all seeds of his opponent's inner holes is declared winner, no matter how many seeds his opponent still has in his outer row. The game is a draw, if a move doesn't end. Perpetual sowing occurs, for instance, if empty holes alternate with holes containing one seed, when at the beginning of the turn, no two inner holes opposite of each other have seeds.&quot;<br/><br/>",

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Sad%C3%A9qa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Sad%C3%A9qa</a>:<br/><br/>Sad&eacute;qa is the generic name for mancala games known in the southwest of Ethiopia and nearby Sudan.<br/><br/>This particular variant is played by the Jimma who live in western Ethiopia. It was described as Sad&eacute;qa V (Game 84) by Richard Pankhurst, who stated that it used to be a popular pastime at the court of Abba Jifar. While the king had wooden boards called bolo sad&eacute;qa, boys simply dug holes in the ground, and women were not allowed to play the game at all.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board of 2x10=20 holes. Initially each hole contains four seeds.<br/><br/>Seeds (lon) are distributed counter-clockwise, one by one, in a multi-lap fashion into the following holes until the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, a warana (&quot;speared&quot;) or an opponent's hole containing exactly three seeds thus making four (a warana). A move may begun from any hole of your own side, except a warana.<br/><br/>A warana can only be made on the opponent's side and is said to be owned by his creator.<br/><br/>When the last seed falls into a warana that is owned by his opponent, he captures it and another seed of that warana. If the warana was empty, the player captures only one seed. In any case the player makes a bonus move by starting from any hole of his side which is not a warana.<br/><br/>The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, creates a warana or falls into a warana which is owned by the player.<br/><br/>Passing is not permitted as long as there is a legal move.<br/><br/>The game ends when all remaining seeds are in warana, i.e. neither player has a legal move left.<br/><br/>Each player has as many points as he has captured seeds and has seeds in his warana at the end of the game. The player with most points wins.<br/><br/>Strategy:<br/><br/>A warana is an important mean of winning the game - or losing it! Often it is hard to judge whether they help you or your opponent more. Usually, it is good for you to create a warana only if it is located in your opponent's first three holes.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game. From Mancala.Wikia.com:<br/><br/>Adji-boto (&quot;pebble boat&quot;) is a mancala game which is played by the Saramaccans who live on the upper Saramacca river in Suriname. The Saramaccans are a tribe of Bush-Negroes which was formed by escaped slaves. The first field study on the game was conducted by the American ethnologue Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963) in 1928 in the village of Beidotti. The game resembles mancala games known in Benin, West Africa.<br/><br/>The game is used to entertain the dead during the ten-day period preceding burial in the kre wosu, or house of mourning. The play is only carried out during the daylight hours because in the night the yorkas, or ghosts of the dead, would come and play with us and eventually carry away our spirits.<br/><br/>The boards are only carved by old widowed men because this is a serious issue. They are made in two shapes, those having straight tops, and those in which the tops are curved. A village should have both types, so that if a person was fond of one kind of board dies, the people can play for a time on the other and there will be a lessened danger of his ghost coming to play with them. Although the Bush-Negroes are fine wood-carvers the Saramacca boards are of the roughest. This is because of the sacred character of the game which is not one which can be hurried in playing. It must entail some effort and even pain  to bring it to perfection.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Adji-boto is played on a board called adji-bangi (&quot;pebble stool&quot;) that consists of 2x5=10 holes. In addition, each player has a store called boto (&quot;boat&quot;) at his right hand.<br/><br/>Each hole contains 10 stones called adji (&quot;pebbles&quot;) at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, except one stone that remains in the hole, one by one, in consecutive holes in an anti-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>In the first ten moves of the game all of the ten playing holes must be played.<br/><br/>It is only permitted to play a hole which contains at least two stones.<br/><br/>It is not allowed to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.<br/><br/>If the last stone ends (kaba) in a hole which precedes another hole or a continuous chain of holes that contains one, three or five stones (including any sequential combinations), these stones are captured and put into the player's boto. It is possible to capture on either side of the board. The only exception is the opening move in which  nothing is captured. If a Bush-Negro captures he says: &quot;I eat your children!&quot; (Mi nyam yu p'kin kaba!)<br/><br/>The game is finished when both players can't move.<br/><br/>The remaining stones are captured by the player on whose side they are.<br/><br/>The player who has won most stones is declared winner. It is said that  &quot;the loser is killed!&quot; (a kiri mi kaba!).<br/><br/>If both players captured the same number of stones the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sprawl, players buy cards to add to their individual cities. The cards represent city blocks that advantage the players in different ways. Some cards earn players money (which score at the end of every round except the last), some are strictly population (which are only scored at the end of the game) and others are a combination of the two. Price is determined by the rolling of dice, more dice are rolled with every round as the game progresses. The winner is the player with the most populous city at the end of the 5th round of play. The game involves bidding, tile placement and big pay-offs each round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the original Avalanche Press website entry:<br/><br/>When Austria-Hungary dissolved in November 1918, the remnants of her once-proud fleet scattered among the victorious Allies, with most of the warships cut up for scrap within a few years. Had the empire somehow survived the Great War, through diplomatic or military means, she would have entered the crisis of 1939 as a considerable force at sea. <br/>       <br/>Imperial and Royal Navy is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the possibilities of this alternate history. It has everything you expect in a naval game supplement: scenarios, ship data sheets, and playing pieces.<br/><br/>The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by this unlikely fleet. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bomb Alley to enjoy most of the scenarios, and Eastern Fleet, Arctic Convoy and Bismarck to play all of them.<br/><br/>Imperial and Royal Navy was originally sold exclusively via PDF download.  In 2011 a printed edition with die-cut counters was published.  The supplement will be re-implemented in 2014 as SWWAS: The Habsburg Fleet, adding more ships and a set of scenarios aligned with the Second Great War at Sea story arc.<br/><br/>",

This deadly contest is known as a deathmatch.<br/><br/>The most powerful heroes among the mortal races are known as Avatars of War--heroes chosen by the Gods of War themselves.  These Avatars, in addition to being fierce combatants, are able to draw upon the silver of divinity within their souls for the power to expand their already awesome combat abilities.<br/><br/>In Arena DeathMatch, each player controls a band of Avatars of War as they face off on the arena floor in front of a cheering (or jeering) crowd.<br/><br/>The perils of the Arena stand against you: traps, hazards and even savage beasts stand between you and your opponent.  The door to the Arena opens, and the shouting crowd is eager to see their favourite heroes fight to the death.  Will they be cheering your victory...or your death?  There's only one way to find out!<br/><br/>",

We take you to the steppes of the Crimea, the jungles of Ecuador and the heart of Stalingrad. We&rsquo;ve got vehicles of all description waiting for you to shift into gear; from a trio of AVREs to a quartet of ISU-122s to a<br/>lone StuIG 33B to a T-60 conga line. We give you battles between titans, from Assault Engineers fighting Assault Engineers to Dogfighting Air Support. Our scenarios range from tournament-size to super-size.  Like things simple, without all those tanks and guns and things? We&rsquo;ve got you covered! How about a complex challenge you can sink your<br/>Grognard teeth into? Take two, their small! Wanna fight on the Red Barricades map? Done! Did I mention the AVREs? Did I mention the Firefly backing them up? Bam!<br/><br/>Melee Pack II also contains a set of our wildly popular Scenario Cheat Sheets! If you haven&rsquo;t seen one before, a Scenario Cheat Sheet depicts vehicle and gun notes based on the forces involved, the date and any special rules. What you wind up with is a sheet of information specially tailored for each vehicle and gun for that scenario. It saves us a lot of time looking up rules and we hope you&rsquo;ll find them useful also.

Can the 49th<br/>Mountain Corps&rsquo; landsers hold their<br/>line in the steppe until the men of the<br/>10th Romanian Infantry pass through?<br/><br/>November 11, 1942<br/>Stalingrad, Russia:<br/>Operation Hubertus&rsquo; push for the<br/>Volga has been blunted.

This practice, known as Chevauchee, is the inspiration for this game of medieval and Renaissance warfare. Designed for fun and playability, Chevauchee is perfect for novice and veteran gamers alike and offers a basic set of man-to-man combat rules, expanded optional rules, and a special system for simple siege warfare. It can be played with almost any appropriate miniature figures, each of which can use whatever weapons it is armed with and is equipped with whatever armor the model wears, eliminating paperwork and speeding play.  Each turn represents 20 seconds of action.  Essentially, combat is resolved with 3d6 rolls (with modifiers) versus a target number.  There is no set size for a playing area.  Distance is measured in inches.  The game works best with 1/72 scale or 1/35 scale figures.  50 pages.<br/><br/>Table of Contents:<br/><br/>5   Introduction<br/>7   Basic Rules<br/>21  Optional Rules<br/>33  Siege Rules<br/>46  Glossary<br/><br/>",

The short spaces on the board have a special rule: if you mark off a short space and it is separated by an unclaimed short space from another short space you have marked, you get to mark the space in between with your color.  If the space you are claiming is one unclaimed short space away from two of your claimed spaces (in other words, in the middle space), you get to claim both intervening spaces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The collectible cards game from Thailand.<br/><br/>Each player roles to be the God (Deva) and summon their avatar and disciples to fight for your divine power.<br/><br/>The god who lose all his/her faith point will be the loser.<br/><br/>This game has 3 card types: Soldier card, Hero card and Event card.<br/><br/>Its 1st set is Half Blood Deal in 2007.<br/>.....................................................................<br/><br/>Welcome to Devacurse in English, an ongoing English-language guide to Devacurse, Thailand&rsquo;s premier trading card game. Devacurse presents a universe rent asunder by the warfare of rival gods.  Once-calm seas roil with the venom of serpentine nagas, Yaksas leave villages burning in their molten wake, and fearsome Himmapan creatures bellow their fury at the world of men.  Noble heroes, stately Garuda warriors, cunning Monkey lords, and treacherous demons lead their forces into battle in this epic conflict drawn from the lush imagination of Southeast Asian mythology.<br/><br/>Read on to learn about Devacurse&rsquo;s setting, and what this ongoing journal has in store for curious English-speaking gamers.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of Devas, divine entities commanding the elements of earth, wood, fire, metal, water, and wind.  You will need to master them to defeat your opponent, a god just as powerful and determined to rule as you.  Whether you incarnate directly on the battlefield as a hero or bombard your enemy from afar with devastating incantations, you will need wits as well as strength to survive.<br/><br/>Bless your warriors, summon allies, and commit your forces wisely in the ultimate contest of skill and intellect.  In Devacurse there can be no middle ground.<br/><br/>The winner will inherit a universe; the loser, cold oblivion.<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>Devacurse was born from the imagination of Dr. Eiamchan Srithanon and his design team, the 6 Devabrothers:  SrithaNa Eiamchan and Mr. Korn (rules team and card designers), Sarit Chareonpanichkul (art director and trophy model sculptor) and Veerawat Jangpetch (art director), Saranyu (story director and character designer), and Srichai Eiamchan (production).  SrithaNa, Korn, Veerawat, and Saranyu were still studying architecture at King Mongkut&rsquo;s University of Technology Thonburi (KMIT) at the time, and art director Sarit was brought in from outside to complete the team.  Dr. Srithanon and his friends had been avid card gamers for years, but after seeing fellow Thais playing endless Western and Japanese imports, they decided it was time to create a distinctively Thai collectable card game.  Their goal was amibitious - Dr. Eiamchan and his team wanted to create a card game that didn&rsquo;t just feature Thai themes or look Thai, but one whose game mechanics embodied Thai style.  Two years of development and playtesting followed, and in 2007 Devacurse came on the market with an initial base set release, Half Blood Deal.  This was followed in 2008 with the first expansion set, Vengeful Kindred.<br/><br/>Devacurse immediately impressed Thai players with its high production values, elegant design, and lavish artwork, with many comparing its high level of presentation to that of Wizards of the Coast&rsquo;s Magic the Gathering.  Currently Devacurse commissions work from over 30 professional artists in Thailand.  Once players learned the rules, they were impressed again by supple game mechanics that rewarded tactical planning and captured the essence of Thai culture.  Specifically, the game strongly recalls the fantastical world of the Thai Ramayana painted on the walls of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in the Royal Palace complex in Bangkok.  It also subtly incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist prayer and Samsara, the cycle of reincarnation, into the structure of play.<br/><br/>The Devacurse card layout incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist and Hindu cosmology.<br/><br/>Devacurse is a sophisticated and still-evolving piece of genuinely Thai pop culture in a country that is often swamped by Western and Japanese influence, imports, and imitations.  Dr. Srithanon and his team are committed to bringing the legends of their heritage to life in the game, and the results so far have been unique and beguiling.<br/><br/>Devacurse is currently published only in Thai, and has therefore been limited to Thai audiences.  This website aims to open up the world of Devacurse to English-speaking gamers and enthusiasts of Thai culture and Southeast Asian myth.  In the coming weeks and months I will be putting up a complete English translation of the Devacurse rulebook, followed by English translations of all of the current Devacurse cards (Half Blood Deal through Vengeful Kindred).  There will be an in-depth review of the game, and other articles on a variety of subjects (card spotlight, deck design, strategy, back story) will hopefully follow.<br/><br/>If all goes well, determined English speakers should be able to play and enjoy the Thai edition of Devacurse with the information posted on this website, until such a time as Devacurse is published in English.<br/><br/>Enjoy, and welcome to the epic world of Devacurse.<br/>............<br/><br/>more ....<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com</a>  (English)<br/><br/>http:// <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.devacurse.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.devacurse.com</a>  (Thai)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two kingdoms are at war. The side who fights at the right place at the right time will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>phase one: military strategist advices<br/>On each turn, each player rolls his die and secretly looks at it before covering it up with the cup.<br/><br/>phase two: feints and combat<br/>Players then take turns playing cards into one of the 6 areas on the board. Each area can take a maximum of 3 values. Players may pass. If they do so, they cannot play any more card/s for the rest of that turn.<br/><br/>phase three: resolution<br/>After both players are done playing their cards, their strategical strength is determined. An area on the board is in play if the corresponding number is rolled by either player. Any cards played into an in-play area grants the player strategical strength: one times the number of the area for each 1-card played, and two times the number of the area for each 2-card played.<br/><br/>Whoever has the higher strategical strength wins the turn, and gets victory tokens from the opponent's pool. The number of tokens won/lost is equal to one plus the total value of the cards played by the losing player. (So on each turn the possible numbers of victory points won/lost are 1, 2, 3 and 4.)<br/><br/>victory<br/>When one side runs out of victory tokens, he loses. The other player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Transogram's entry in the crossword card game craze of the late 30s.  This is the most unusual one in having &quot;cards&quot; made of thin wood slats (which are somewhat fragile, at least after 70 years).  There are scrabble-like stands to hold them.  The cards each have a letter and value 2-10, except two &quot;Key&quot; wild cards worth 20.<br/><br/>Deal 8 letters to 2-3 players, 6 each for 4-6.  In a turn, a player plays up to 4 letters to the table, making words of 2+ letters; or, discards a letter and draws a new one.  All words except the first must intersect other words, crossword fashion.  The hand ends when a player runs out of cards, at which point each player adds the points left in their hand to their total.  When someone reaches 200, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire version.  Take out the key cards and deal yourself 10 letters.  Build a crossword array from your hand as above; when you are stuck, draw new letters until you can make another word.  Continue until going through the whole deck.  You win if you use up all the letters.<br/><br/>Later versions from the '50's &amp; '60's use plastic tiles, with slight scoring differences, &amp; include rules for different games using the same components.<br/><br/>",

If they can, they lay down a Color Bunch -- either 3 of a kind, or 4 different colors -- discarding one after.  (Presumably you don't discard if you don't lay down.)  The first to empty his hand wins.<br/><br/>Game II: Like Memory/Concentration.  Lay all the cards face down in a rectangle.  In a turn a player exposes 2 cards; if they match he keeps them and turns over 2 more, etc,; if the don't match they go back down and his turn ends.

(And yes, Virginia, there are anal probes.)<br/><br/>Players can choose to play as any of five of the more well-known types of aliens including Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, Nephilim and Elderbarians, with each type receiving a bonus for accomplishing certain types of missions.<br/><br/>Alien Abduction is a hilarious game, that&rsquo;s also educational and fun to play. The victims to be abducted have famous names and any occult or UFO enthusiast will recognize the locations mentioned on the mission tiles and the concepts presented by the Vril chits. It&rsquo;s almost like a UFO trivia game, as well as a fast moving action game.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly and is full of dark humor. I convinced my brother-in-law to play. He doesn&rsquo;t generally care for games and is not a UFO enthusiast, yet before long he was laughing and really enjoying himself. He actually won!<br/><br/>The components include four sheets of colored cardstock mission tiles, one of cardstock Vril chits, a cardstock chit explanation card and a two-page rules pamphlet. Some assembly required. Dice, poster board, and some glue are needed to play.<br/><br/>As an added bonus the game includes the pamphlet, Self-Defense Against Alien Abduction that explains how one might successfully defend against abduction by aliens through the use of various techniques.<br/><br/>",

They also include elements that would be appropriate for running campaigns.<br/><br/>The mechanics appear to be loosely similar to the Fire and Fury gaming system.  The game comes with detailed order of battle information for all the major armies and also includes information on combatants such as Bulgaria, Serbia and the Arab Revolt.<br/><br/>Battles with Brusilov is published as a binder-bound set of loose leaf sheets.

The blocks have doors, windows, decorations, chimneys, stairways, etc, and a building code defines how these can be legally arranged.

        "description": "From the game's introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;HP is a combination of rule changes, additions and army lists to allow the Gå På rules to be used for the first half of the 17th century. The focus is on the Thirty Years War, but it is certainly possible to use them for other conflicts as well. Examples of these include, but are not limited to: the English Civil War and the wars between Sweden and Poland. I have intentionally left the late 17th century out, as I feel this period is better covered by the standard rules.<br/><br/>&quot;My ambition has been to include enough new/changed elements to produce the right &quot;period feel&quot;. The game should not feel like a WSS game with different figures. I have tried to do it as I haven‟t found a set of rules that deal with the 30YW in a way I like, and because I felt that G&aring; P&aring; actually could be used to cover the period - although with some changes needed.<br/><br/>&quot;Because of this I have decided to change some of the unit type names, and create new ones as well. My hope is that this doesn‟t create too much confusion, but instead generates more period feel.<br/><br/>&quot;In the 17th century units tended to use deeper formations. The musketeers had a slower rate of fire and the socket bayonet arrived only towards the end of the period. This means they will have to be protected by pike-armed friends to a much larger degree.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each player represents a trader who deals in four market commodities: tulips (the Netherlands experienced a Tulip bubble during the 1640s), shares in the South Sea Company (a bubble that struck England in 1720), the U.S. stock market of the 1920s (the collapse of which led to the Great Depression), and shares in the &ldquo;Dot Com&rdquo; stocks (which collapsed in the late 1990s). A specially prepared deck of cards represents the vicissitudes of a fickle market.  The goal is to time the market, make the most lucrative investments, and end the game with the most gold.<br/><br/>",

Terrain hexes affect movement but movement points are earned based on the difficulty of the question rather than the movement amount listed on the piece.<br/><br/>The game was included in the 1974 LDS Seminary Manual and the scenarios were intended to be played as students read about the relevant parts of the Book of Mormon in the lessons.<br/><br/>",

The idea of Frazed is simple, and a bit mischevious.<br/>Write a sentence or phrase that someone else would be unable or unwilling to say outloud one time through without stopping, within five seconds of recieving it.<br/><br/>Frazed challenges the players' creativity, vocabulary, acting skills, social inhibitions, concentration, knowledge of their friends and their silliness tolerance all at the same time.<br/><br/>Have you ever wanted to make your friends confess to a crime they didn't committ, make them sing out loud, stammer over the weirdest thing that comes to your mind, act like a fool or simply make the laugh till they are red in the face and crying? Well Here Is Your Chance!<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. The Fraze card which details a type of sentence category along the lines of tongue twisters, compliments, insults, confessions, secrets, gibberish etc and a second deck of cards called Exploits. Exploits are ways in which the sentence should be read, or act as a distraction while trying to read the phrase. Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.<br/><br/>During any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.<br/><br/>The Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.<br/><br/>Points are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.<br/><br/>There is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.<br/><br/>Buy a copy of Frazed Today!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>* fraze Deck (75 cards)<br/>    * exploit Deck (71 cards)<br/>    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)<br/>    * frazed rules Document<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mandua is an asymmetrical abstract strategy game, played on a square board with 25 spaces plus an aditional space at the middle of each side for a total of 29 spaces. One player plays the 4 tigers, the other one the 25 hunters. Tigers are on the board from the beginning and moving one space orthogonally, while hunters are first placed on the board one by one until all hunters are on the board. Then these also move in the same way.<br/>Tigers now can capture hunters by jumping over one hunter and land on a free space behind it or move (not jump!) between two hunters and remove both of them. If a jump opens an occasion for another jump, this is done in the same move, and so on. The tigers are forced to capture as many hunters as possible, and the tigers` player has to tell before his move, how many total hunters he will capture in his move.<br/>The only way hunters can capture tigers is a wrong move by the tigers` player. This is, when the tigers move in a way that they are only capturing less hunters than possible, if made a &quot;perfect&quot; move. The tiger which is doing the &quot;wrong&quot; move, is captured.<br/>Hunters win, if tigers are all captured or immobilized. There are two more special situations, both &quot;stalemates&quot;, but wins for the hunters: 1. If hunters are immobile (Mandua stalemate) or 2. if they are even sacrificed with the effect of immobilizing the remaining hunters. <br/>Tigers win, if all hunters are captured.<br/>This game was invented by two Germans living in Indonesia and is derived from the tactics of ancient Indian tiger-hunting.<br/><br/>",

Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible.<br/><br/>The game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As Soviet entrepreneurs in the game Conversion (Конверсия), players attempt to expand their businesses by exploiting the shifting exchange rate between the Soviet Union and the rest of the world. The basic structure of the game is to mine raw materials, convert them to goods, and then either sell these at home or transport and sell them elsewhere. However there are ways to outsource these steps, such as paying another player to ship goods for you or buying raw materials on the market, and one may find it easier to turn a profit by specializing in a particular area and forming partnerships with other players. You can purchase higher quality machines, fleets and even computers in the outside world, but you'll need American dollars for these instead of rubles.<br/><br/>",

However, direct involvement in the different regions of the world is kept to a minimum.  The two Superpowers are involved in a Proxy War: influencing the world without direct involvement.  Each Superpower will use their political clout to alter the Political Tilt or Political Value of a region.  For instance, the US might have a strong position in the Middle East.  The USSR may choose to reduce the Political Value of that region, making it less attractive to Uncle Sam.  Or the USSR may change the Political Tilt of that region so that it is more favorable to the Soviet Agenda.  By advancing global agendas, the two Superpowers gain or lose favor in a region depending on the local politics.  Through all the politicking, random global events will alter the world political view causing both Superpowers to adjust individual political manipulations in order to achieve global superiority.<br/><br/>",

The game where you must build your evil empire before other demon lords can build theirs.<br/>Kingdoms is a very social game that encourages interaction between players and is best suited for 4 players although 2 players can still have a lot of fun. If you like building up your strength while causing you opponents a lot of trouble then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 1000 gold, 1000 resources and a blueprint of their kingdom which shows the buildings they need to construct in order to win the game. To construct buildings you need money, resources and minions.<br/><br/>The rules of play are simple. Each turn a player draws a card and performs an action such as constructing a building, buying resources from the bank, or sending a cat with fleas into a rival kingdom.<br/><br/>Each turn you are faced with the choice of building up your kingdom or ruining someone else's. Be wary of players forming secret alliances.<br/> However its not all about being mean to each other, the card pool contains a lot of nasty surpises too. Watch out for Demonic health Inspectors, drunken Aunties and your new &lsquo;uncles&rsquo; dropping by, and various unpleasant diseases coming your way.<br/><br/>Then there are your Minions. Everybody needs minions, it&rsquo;s just a pity they are an unpredictable and fickle lot. Minions construct your buildings for you and generally moan a lot of the time. &lsquo;We are bored!&rsquo; they cry so you build them a den of iniquity. They are still not happy. &lsquo;We are lonely!&rsquo; so you build them a House of ill repute. They are never satisfied. Good job you can smite a few now and again to keep them in line<br/><br/>Mess with you opponents plans. Tempt their minions to your kingdom or infect them with a plague or even send in a serial killer to thin the herd.<br/><br/>",

There are rules for arranging marriages, feeding livestock, harvest, and drought.<br/><br/>The Game of Warring Castles -- Played on a modified checkerboard, players control the King, a noble, or a churchman.  The King is more powerful than a single noble or churchman but less powerful than two.  Combat is resolved by dice with the player controlling the most land having an advantage.  Churchmen cannot fight but can lend their land to a noble or king to help resolve the combat.<br/><br/>Medieval Town Game &ndash; Merchants play for protection to lords, who use the money to buy soldiers to fight other lords.<br/><br/>The Game of Industrialization &ndash; Players take on the roles of Mill Owner, Landowner, or laborer.  The Mill Owner tries to lure the laborers from the landowner&rsquo;s farm.<br/><br/>Much of  the book is devoted to instructions for constructing the playing materials which involves cutting and folding construction paper; making these games a suitable project for children in the 10 &ndash; 14 age range who enjoy doing this type of craft work.<br/><br/>",

The leader also gets bonus points if he finishes the race first among his own teammates, more challenging than it sounds. The team with the highest score wins. The heaviest hitters in gaming should find this game enjoyable and challenging along with everybody else that enjoys a good race game. Warning: The slowest rider's are penalized with negative points at the finish so don't forget about those drifting back. I hope to do a small print run at some point and plan on working on a final design within the next year. Race On and on and on!<br/><br/>The release date for Cycle is indefinite.<br/><br/>",

Phaze Spiders bring a new dimension (pun intended!) to the Injurius Games universe. They employ an intense and flexible battle plan, using ranged and melee attacks equally well. Squads of five Spiders take the field against all comers: Humans, Mecks, Orx, and even their own kind.<br/><br/>You control a &quot;clutch&quot; of up to six different types of Spiders. Before each match, you choose which ones will participate, either all the same, all different, or any combination thereof. Each clutch is led by the big &quot;Tlisky,&quot; a formidable fighter, born to command. The other Spiders, called Vorpeeds, participate as needed: Venters are the rank-and-file Spiders, able to spit highly-corrosive acid at a distance; Shockers generate massive electric currents that can take you out with one hit; Bullnoses are the party-crashers, melee specialists that can also make short-ranged plasma attacks; Jammers have evolved a very advanced ranged weapon that ignores most forms of armor; The &quot;Tlisk&quot; is a failed Tlisky, unable to lead and not as tough, but faster.<br/><br/>Spiders are not under any form of Corporate control. They enter the arena looking for two things: freedom, and puppets to control. Freedom they can't have, but puppets - the arena supplies five per enemy team....<br/><br/>The Spider player's goal is the same as with any race: to bring their Clutch up to 50 Battle Honors and win the tournament. Spiders have their own upgrade table, critical hit chart, and Power-Ups, and may spend their Battle Honors to purchase upgrades like any other gladiator team.<br/><br/>You will need a copy of Injurius Games to play Phaze Spiders from the 5th Dimension.<br/><br/>",

All pieces must move and/or capture following the pattern on the board.<br/><br/>Board<br/>The expanded Alquerque board consist of an Alquerque board and a triangular patterned board attached on one of its side. The sheeps or goats can also win the game by occupying every spaces on this triangle.<br/>There are different triangular patterned board designs attached to the Alquerque board, and therefore Komikan has several variants. The standard triangular board has one horizontal line across the breadth of the triangle, and one vertical line along the length of the triangle.<br/><br/>According to Wikipedia, &quot;Komikan may actually be the same game as Adugo.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Units and Events, which usually belong to one or more of the four factions (Germans, Japanese, Americans and Soviets) are used to attack and deal damage to the opponent, have certain beneficial effects on the game or are used to weaken the opponent.

However, after eating one of each of the chocolates, the Duc falls to the floor - dead.<br/><br/>The renowned detective, Sherlock Truffle, is called in to investigate. It appears that one of the chocolatiers may have inadvertantly designed a chocolate that would remind the Duc of less than happy times, and fearing ridicule, poisoned the Duc to save his own reputation.<br/><br/>You have one of each of the chocolates before you (happily poison-free). Your task is to taste each one and refer to the background research of the Duc's life to determine who is the guilty party.<br/><br/>The game includes chocolates (six of each - and all absolutely gorgeous); notes of each chocolatier; a brief history of the Duc; and a CD which includes interviews with each of the chocolatiers.

Koniggratz.  Rather than the five smaller battles in the Frontier Battles installment, this game focuses on one huge battle between the Prussians and Austrians.<br/><br/>This game uses the same system as War of the States: Gettysburg, 1863 and War Of The States: Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga which is similar to the Rome at War and Eagles Of The Empire series as well. In this game, the units are Prussian, Austrian, and Saxon infantry brigades artillery batteries, and cavalry regiments. The pieces are moved around topographic maps of the various battlegrounds. Combat is resolved using by rolling a number of dice equal to the total combat strength of units involved in combat, with hits scored on a result of 6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game from the Ahoy Series by Edmund Vale.  This is a game of Privateers vs. Spanish Galleons.  The Galleons, one carrying the Treasure, are attempting to deliver it to their home port while the Privateers are attempting to capture the gold.  All ships have equal speed, strength and vulnerability.<br/><br/>The game is based around the map, which shows wind direction in each diamond as well as ports, forts (gray areas with letters and gold triangles), calm areas (diamonds containing blue sea serpents), sandbars(yellow diamonds), dry land (gray diamonds), ice flows (icebergs in the diamond) and coral reefs (orange diamonds).  The ships move around the map based on the wind direction and are really only limited to changes in wind direction and decisions to change ship direction.  Chance only comes into play when you move on to a calm area, the teetotum is then used to determine whether the wind comes up.<br/><br/>A ship is given 6 wooden beads at the beginning of the game to represent its strength.  Loss of beads due to difficult maneuvers, combat or running aground can lead to &quot;disablement&quot; which takes away some of the ability to change directions during your turn.  A second disablement (loss of 4 beads) means the ship can only move 1 square a turn.<br/><br/>In Combat Privateers shoot on the N/S/E/W lines (diagonals) and the Galleons shoot NE/NW/SE/SW down the rows.  Each ship can fire up to 2 space away and Combat includes the concept of Leeway, drifting on the tide as combat occurs, leading to some chance as a players ship may run aground or collide with another.  Ships can be boarded and even attacked by the forts shown on the map.<br/><br/>This is a game of maneuver where advanced planning is key and the effects of tide and wind drive the game.<br/><br/>An outstanding example of Naval Miniatures play from the 1930s.<br/><br/>",

It takes critical thinking and an open mind to help this troubled couple. Find out how well your advice is received and how other players handle sex and relationship quandaries.<br/><br/>Directions:<br/>Shuffle the deck and place face down. The first player draws the top card and gives advice to the fictitious couple. If another player wants to challenge the advice given, they may. The other players vote on the best advice and the winner gets the card. Each card is worth one point.<br/><br/>When a player collects five cards a round is complete.

Denied their dream, the Blakists sought to preserve the Star League against the follies of the Houses, but its fanaticism manifested this noble goal as the Jihad: a horrific war that has pitted every faction against each other and even themselves. Against such an anvil, new cutting edge machines of war are marched into the fire. The discovery of an ancient Hegemony Memory Core graphically showcases the desperation of the conflict, as primitive 'Mechs not seen on a battlefield since the dawn of 'Mech production over half a millennia ago once again appear.<br/><br/>Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3075 provides a comprehensive look at the latest machines of war debuting during the Jihad: from 'Mechs to battle armor, Support Vehicles to DropShips and more. In addition, a complete &quot;Age of War&quot; section covers the Terran Hegemony and each of the five Great Houses during the Age of War, including the very first BattleMechs produced by each faction and how such machines are starting to appear once more. Each military vehicle is illustrated in detail, accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, and some of the unit's most famous pilots.<br/><br/>",

No miniatures come with this game!<br/>This way a player may pick any of his miniatures and calculate their point costs referring to the extremely well elaborated and very fine tuned equipment list.<br/>There are rules for about everything that has ever set it's metal or plastic foot on a futuristic war-torn gametable:<br/>Humans, aliens, different kinds of humanoids, tough races, weak races, robots, androids, crafts, cannons, artillery, sabotage, special ammunition, cybernetics - everything you could wish for.<br/>Even the equipment table basically covers everything &quot;out there&quot; - maybe you'll have to substitute sometimes some weapons (like a boltpistol with a common pistol), but you will be able to work with everything that you might find in the hands or at the belt of your miniature.<br/><br/>The rulebook covers the basic rules as well as experts' rules and campaign rules.<br/><br/>Even though Level II is designed for small scale skirmishes with only a couple of individual fighters per side, the rules don't prevent you from playing large scale combats as well. <br/>In that case however players should have only a few different troop types, to keep combat simple.<br/>For example on the one hand you could get about 50 - 100 light weighted fighters for 1000 points, but if you really spice them up, you may field less than 10 tough guys for the same value, too.<br/><br/>Level II uses an unique command system:<br/>The army of a player is divided into several groups (one at least!) consisting of a number of fighters depending on the faction they are fighting for.<br/>Each group gets one command (e.g. &quot;advance&quot;), represented by a chit placed at that group's position. Depending on that command, each fighter of that group may take up to two different actions (mostly moving + something different, like e.g. taking aim).<br/>In order to change that command, certain conditions have to be met (roll versus a certain value with modifiers according to circumstances like e.g. groupleader killed or minimum distance not met) - if the roll fails the command is either changed later or even not at all.<br/>Specialits may act according to their specialities whenever the player sees fit.<br/><br/>Level II plays very realistically: Most weapons kill an unarmoured human with one hit - just as in real life. This way you will have to be very careful with about everything: <br/>How are you going to spend your points?<br/>Where and (even mor important:) how are you going to move your fighters?<br/>This way, Level II is a very tactical skirmish game where the skill and the experience of a player garantee a victory instead of lucky dierolls.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rules excerpt:<br/><br/>OBJECT OF GAME<br/>There are two distinct and different ways to win the game. The first is by getting five of your tokens in a row consecutively. Second way is by capturing ten of your opponent's tokens.<br/><br/>RULES FOR PLAY<br/>One player selects all the tokens of one color. The second player takes all the tokens of the other color. Players choose for first play. The starting player places a token on one of the four circles reading, START. Tokens are not moved from spaces once they are placed on board. Play then alternates between players who then place tokens anywhere on the board. (However, to work out successful patterns of play, do not place your tokens too wide apart. By concentrating your tokens in definite areas, you will be better able to fulfill the objective of the game&ndash;5 tokens in a row.) Your 5 tokens must be placed consecutively in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row. If you succeed in accomplishing this, you are declared the winner. The other method of winning is to capture ten of your opponent's men. A capture is performed by surrounding two of your opponent's tokens by placing two of your tokens one on each side of his. If a player places his tokens in a position so as to become out-flanked, he loses the out-flanked pair of tokens to his opponent. When a capture is completed, the captured tokens are removed from the playing field and placed in the &quot;CAPTURED OPPONENTS&quot; area of board. In this way, both you and your opponent can readily see how the game is progressing. Five pairs (10) of captured opponents constitute a win. Included in the set are more tokens than are necessary to complete the game. However, it is possible that a game could be played out without anyone winning. In this case, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Chek-ro is similar to ninuki-renju and Pente<br/><br/>",

Torpedo, Mine and Ramming attacks are resolved using similar mechanisms, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system.<br/><br/>In line with the style and intention of the rules, armour has been standardised for each class of vessel (of which there are ten covered). Guns have been grouped into 9 classes following the same philosophy.<br/><br/>There is a fleet list covering the significant vessels of 10 nations in this period with 130 vessels.

        "description": "Intro<br/>It is a time of wizardry and power. In the esteemed Academia Magicas, novices from the House of Elementas shall be given their final test: Trial of Grandis. As a Chief Apprentice of your Noble House, you shall lead a quartet of novices through a maze of primordial elements on the ancient Fields of Grandis to earn your Elementor ranks and stand as honoured Magi of Magicas.<br/><br/>Basic Mechanics<br/>- Your objective is to win as much Victory Points (VPs) as possible, while striding through each terrain square to reach the end of the field. <br/>- The Trial ends when all terrain squares at the finishing line are occupied.<br/>- Each Player begins with 5 cards in his/her hand and draws 2 extra cards at the start of turn.<br/>- Each Player may conduct a maximum of 3 movement/actions with his/her playing cards during a turn.<br/>- Each Player can hold as many cards as he/she can in hand at the end of turn, but beware of the thief.<br/><br/>Cards<br/>- There are 2 types of Cards that can be drawn from the draw deck: Scroll Cards and Action Cards.<br/>- Scroll Cards are used for basic movement to each terrain square (see movement)<br/>- Action Cards are special magic scrolls with extra spells such as VP Thief, Revive Mana and etc that can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/>Movement<br/>- The Field of Grandis is a land of power, with terrains warded by elements that bars entrance from those who do not wield them. <br/>- Fire, Ice, Thunder and Poison Wards of varying degrees protect each terrain. <br/>- To stride the fields, you must be proficient in utilizing the Elementas Scrolls (Cards) to calm the elements of each terrain.<br/>- You can move straight or diagonal to the adjoining square by casting your Scroll Cards according to the element and number of scrolls required. e.g. A square guarded by a Level 2 Fire Ward can only be entered by casting 2 Fire Scrolls (cards).<br/><br/>Victory Points<br/>- The field is divided into sections, each section of terrain squares with their own VP value, ascending to the highest VP value at the finishing squares.<br/>- At game end, only the VP value of the terrain squares occupied by each of your Novices is accumulated.<br/>- VP Points can also be earned by performing the Lock Spell (see Lock Spell)<br/>- Player with the most accumulated VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>Lock Spell<br/>- When 2 or more Novices move into the same terrain square, the latest Novice to arrive at the square automatically performs a Lock Spell on the Novice(s) before it.<br/>- Novice under the Lock Spell cannot perform any movement or action until the spell-caster moves away from the square OR the spell is broken with a Lock Breaker action card.<br/>- There is no limit to the number of Novices occupying a square; the last Novice to enter a square will always be the spell-caster.<br/><br/>Trial of Grandis is a strategy card + board game with a minimum luck factor in drawing cards.<br/><br/>Free downloadable files (print &amp; play game board, rules of play, etc) will be available soon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the Red Sash Games website:<br/><br/>Remember Limerick! (RL!) is the seventh volume of Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series, and opens a new subject, the Nine Years War, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg, Toward the end of the 17th Century, at a time when Europe is consumed by war, the powerful Catholic dynasty of the Habsburgs, and the Pope, have formed an unnatural league with the Protestant states of northern Germany, and with the Prince of Orange, de facto ruler of the Netherlands, against their coreligionists, the French. They oppose the overweening ambitions of the Sun King, Louis XIV. To augment the strength of the League, William, Prince of Orange, has taken advantage of popular dissatisfaction with his father-in-law, King James II, to engineer an armed coup and take over the government of England. This will help fill the coffers of the League and ensure that England does not ally with France.<br/><br/>But the English throne brings with it the governance of Scotland and of Ireland. While some in these countries welcome the Glorious Revolution, many do not. Especially is this so in Ireland, where a small Protestant minority lords it over a helot population of Irish and Anglo-Irish Catholics - an Ascendancy secured only a generation before by the swords of Oliver Cromwell's men and still maintained by force of arms and by force of English Law. In the last years of King James' rule, his Deputy, Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel, has worked hard to overturn this Cromwellian Settlement, stuffing the Administration and the Army with Catholics. The Protestants are afraid.<br/><br/>King James, abandoned by many that he trusted, including his own family, suffers a nervous breakdown and leaves England for France, determined to devote the rest of his life to religious pursuits. But his cousin, King Louis, points to Ireland as a place where a fallen monarch may retrieve his fortunes. Tyrconnel and the new Irish Army, and a picked brigade of veteran French, will enable James to drive his son-in-law from the British Isles - and incidentally, force Dutch Billy to withdraw much of his army from the Low Countries, where the French hope to gain much in the next few campaigns. The last Irish &quot;rebellion&quot; lasted eleven years....<br/><br/>",

Like real life, the winner avoids bad situations, capitalizes on opportunity and eventually makes the most money.<br/><br/>A contractor's duties go beyond digging holes, moving dirt and putting up walls. The success of contractors is decided by many factors: union and employee relations, land and property costs and equipment purchases and breakdowns. Encounter the daily woes of a contractor as you struggle to keep ahead of bad weather, employee situations, and most of all, your competitors.<br/><br/>Players move tokens around the board and work on their jobs when they land on a Workday space. Each job is divided into ten phases. Each time you complete a phase, the bank pays you one-tenth of your bid price. You earn rent money in two ways: when the equipment you own is required on other player's jobs, and when other players land on your equipment space. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Description taken from the game box and instruction booklet.<br/><br/>",

You take your supporters where you find them, heavily concentrated for Labour and widely spread for the centrist parties.

The starting player places one piece on either his/her territory, (the 13 squares in front of him/her) or on his/her opponent's territory (the 13 squares in front of the opponent). Both players then take turns placing pieces on the board. Once on the board, the pieces remain in the some place throughout the whole game. Towers are consisting of single pieces or several pieces piled on top of each other.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTHE TOWERSThe Towers are built with a minimum of one and a maximum of 4 pieces. Each piece in an individual Tower must have different sizes and colours. The Towers belong to the player whose territory they are built on. A player can for example choose to place a Tower on his/her opponent's territory to undermine the strength of the opponent's Towers: this Tower belongs to the opponent.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTHE CONFRONTATIONSTowers confront each other when they are aligned, whether diagonally or frontally. There can be 7 frontal alignments and 6 diagonal ones. When one player has got 2 of his/her Towers on a same alignment, only the strongest one can enter a confrontation.<br/>If none of his/her opponent's Towers are aligned with his/hers, then there is no confrontation. An individual Tower can be involved in 2 different confrontations simultaneously, (one on a diagonal, the other on a frontal alignment). Both confrontations are then solved separately. In order to solve a conflict, the strengths of the Towers need to be assessed.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHOW STRONG ARE THE TOWERS?The strength of a Tower depends on the size of its highest piece. The pieces can have 5 different sizes, hence the strength of a Tower can vary from I to 5. Whatever its number of pieces, only the highest will account for the strength of a Tower. For example, a two-piece Tower can win over a four-piece Tower. There is however one exception to this rule: one-piece Towers will always lose to higher Towers. When the highest pieces of two confronting Towers are of equal strength, then the piece that comes immediately under it is assessed and so on until the confrontation is resolved.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTHE MONOLITHS (&quot;TRUMPETS&quot;)Monoliths are used to visualize which of the 2 players (at any stage in the game) has got the upper hand. Each time a player wins a confrontation, he/she is given a Monolith to position on his/her side of the board, on the triangle corresponding to the alignment where the confrontation just took place. The monolith remains with the player as long as he/she is a leader. However, if the opponent gets the upper hand then he /she is given the Monolith to place on his/her side of the board. When there is no obvious leader, the monolith is removed altogether from the board.<br/>A Tower can be involved in two different confrontations, hence a player can win, or lose, 2 Monoliths at once.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHOW TO WIN?The player who wins his/her seventh monolith and does not lose it over to his/her opponent in the immediate next turn, wins the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTHE ASYMMETRY RULEA player cannot copy the move of his/her opponent by positioning immediately after him/her an identical piece (same size and colour) on the same alignment and at a same level of an identical Tower. At least one of these parameters must differ.<br/><br/>",

The player must proceed with the explosions until there is no more hexagon with 3 pawns or more, or until there are no more pawns from the opponent (he has won in this case!).<br/><br/><br/>     The player must start with one of the hexagons having the most pawns on it (it is possible that there are 4 pawns on the same hexagon).<br/>     After each explosion, if there are still possible explosions and pawns from the opponent, go back to step 1!<br/><br/><br/>End of the game<br/>The game ends when a player has no pawns left on the board.

On a player's turn he may move a painter in a straight line in any of the 6 directions any number of spaces. When the painter has finished moving, the player must either place a stone of his color on an adjacent space to the painter or he may transmit the stone to any space adjacent to a contiguous chain of stones of his own color (not other painters of the same color) that the painter touches. Painters may move over any number of stones of either color but may not land on a space occupied by a stone. Painters are not permitted to move over each other. Moving a painter is not mandatory but placing a stone is. A player cannot divide the moving and placing phases between two painters. A player must pass if he has no legal moves on his turn.<br/><br/>The pie rule is used to make the game fair.<br/><br/>",

Movement is complicated by the fact one player may push an adjacent player in the direction of the wind, but may not separate groups of three or four of the opponent's parachuters.

The action takes place into two different worlds: the celestial world, represented by a Taiji (Yin Yang); and the terrestrial world, represented by a map of Japan. The players represent kami and their mission is to give life to the earth. To achieve this, they will play counters, which represent vital energy (ki), in the two different worlds.<br/><br/>Each player can play one counter par turn, but they have cards which represent shintai, that is to say temporary incarnations. With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before. The ki thus changes into kigetsu, &quot;moon energy&quot;, which allows to start a cosmic-scale battle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game starts with two equal armies of eleven pieces facing each other across the river - the Sage piece begins high in her tower, waiting to descend upon the battlefield.<br/><br/>Any piece may capture by sandwiching opposing pieces vertically or horizontally.<br/><br/>The aim is to score six points. These are achieved by moving your pieces into the river and off the board. The biggest tactical question is how soon you wish to move your pieces off the board - if you send too many off the board with an inadequate defence, your other pieces will be surrounded, but if you leave it too late, your opponent will slip off the board unchallenged.<br/><br/>The game is fantasy themed; with Immortal sages, swift apprentices and soaring skyships. It is set on Quiet Mountain, an experimental island of scientific sorcery that has pushed the bounds of its esoteric lore too far - tearing Reality apart in a catacalysmic disaster. The first Sage to leave Quiet Mountain will be able to reach the Empress and blame their counterpart for  the disaster!<br/><br/>",

A curtain is suspended half way down the playing area to simulate fog of war, and can be moved forward or backward depending on the knowledge of the terrain of the opponents. The game is normally played with three of four players per side and an impartial controller. Opponent teams take alternate turns, going through a sequence involving, in that order, artillery fire requests, previously requested artillery fire resolution, direct fire, movement. Combat is resolved by dice rolls on probability tables. The game uses two six-sided dice of different colors, to generate numbers from 11 to 66.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wicked Wickets is a cricket based table game suitable for the whole family, cricketers and non-cricketers alike, and can accommodate anything from two to twenty-two players. The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.<br/><br/>No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &quot;runs&quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &quot;hits&quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &quot;flies&quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher<br/><br/>Official website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/</a><br/><br/>",

To win the game, a player must initially obtain 80 credits and then be the first player to successfully fulfill the requirements of one of the four P.H.D professors.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;P.H.D. is the hilarious and stimulating game of words and definitions that lets you match wits with your opponents or face the word challenge of the board.  Be crafty, deceptive, creative and imaginative.  Bluff with the right answer or deceive with the wrong one.  Be as cunning as you like.  Or be perceptive enough to overcome the challenge of the board.  You win both ways.<br/><br/>P.H.D. is easy to play and no one can monopolize the game, even if they've memorized the entire dictionary&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/>The goal is to earn maximum points judiciously revive France as a puzzle. The board represents the hexagon National (without DOM but with Corsica!). The game consists of many pieces of the puzzle of departments, as well as tokens indicating the prefectures or departmental specialties.<br/>Initially each player draws 5 counties, 10 prefectures and 10 specialties, and each poses its puzzle pieces and a cache behind chips individually. In turn, the players put pieces in the correct spaces beginning with peripheral places (or coastal) and can put together non-coastal places provided they are placed adjacent to the already in place spaces. Thus France will fill the edges toward the center.<br/><br/>A player may ask the prefecture or the specialty in the corresponding space, provided he/she has needed token and collects extra points. If the player can not ask any evidence, he filed a reserve one of its departments and takes one back into the pile. After playing, the player takes all the puzzle pieces or chips in the pile that the number had (the reserve is used when the original deck is empty).<br/>One space on board alone is worth 10 points (and one prefecture alone or in a specialty only), a department with his or her specialty prefecture reported 50 points, 30 points for the prefecture and the specialty, and finally 100 points by asking the 3 elements of same department. The game stops at the laying of the latter department. A penalty of 10 points is imposed for any pawn prefecture or specialty kept on hand.<br/>The highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

At the suggestion of General Kerensky they appointed Jerome Blake as Minister of Communications and charged him with repairing the damaged HPG network. This would prove a momentous decision.<br/><br/>Within a few short years after Kerensky's Exodus, Blake and his followers had seized control of Terra and declared themselves neutral in the coming conflicts. The newly-named ComStar evolved into a pseudo-religious organization, with Blake as its divine founder, that positioned itself as the keeper of technology and the preserver of humanity's future.<br/><br/>For nearly 300 years, ComStar watched as the Succession Wars ripped apart the Inner Sphere and technology was lost, waiting for the day when they would step in to save humanity from a new dark age. But the 31st century changed all of that.<br/><br/>This sourcebook presents the history and inner workings of ComStar, including the devastating schism that struck the sect in the days following their victory over the Clans at Tukayyid.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This sourcebook is largely background detail provided in much the same format as the earlier background books such as House Steiner: The Lyran Commonwealth or The Periphery although it runs up to 3055 rather than 3025.

        "description": "Bottle-caps is a traditional game originating from the beginning of 20th century. It's probably the ancestor of the Pitch Car game. It uses crown bottle-caps to simulate a race. In its early days it was a cart race, now it usually is a car race. It can be played on a table, on a floor or outdoors.<br/><br/>Players start from making the race track. Depending on the environment they may draw it on a big sheet of paper, arrange it using available objects like books, boxes, tools, etc, draw it with a piece of chalk on a flat surface, or even cut it with a knife on the ground. For some game events the tracks were specially designed and made of gypsum.<br/><br/>Then each player takes his or her bottle-cap, and puts it at the start line. To make the caps heavier they are usually filled with candle wax, gypsum, plasticine, clay, or even lead (for outdoor races only). The race begins then and the players - in appropriate order - finger-flick their bottle-caps towards the finish line, avoiding their &quot;cars&quot; getting out the track or stopping on trap areas that require players to go back, miss a turn etc.<br/><br/>",

It's essentially a battle- or campaign-building resource, that works very well with Hot Spots and the Mercenary's Handbook: 3055 in two different ways.<br/><br/>Firstly, it provides an updated military roster for the Successor States, the three major Periphery realms and the clans, the first such major update since the BattleTech: 20 Year Update.<br/><br/>Secondly, it includes locations for every major defence industry plant, anywhere. If you want to know where PitBan 320 engines are manufactured, this book can tell you. Not just aircraft, vehicles and 'Mechs, but every major component. That actually adds a surprising amount of depth for a campaign, because it gives good background reasons for staging raids, slash and burn attacks and the like. It's also not difficult to work backwards using other sourcebooks to place those industry sites in their correct realms at various points in history, so the book can work well with the older House books for games set before, during or after the Fourth Succession War.<br/><br/>This book's no longer in print, but it is available as an electronic download from the current licence holder, and as this isn't a book you'll need out on the tabletop on a regular basis like a main rulebook or the Technical Readouts, it's one that doesn't suffer from staying in electronic form.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Chaos March gives players the information they need to run games and campaigns in the troubled Sarna March. The Guide to the Chaos March  offers players an up-to-date look at the many factions and employment opportunities on the planets in the area, including first-person accounts of the real situations. Chaos March also includes new rules and equipment for BattleTech and MechWarrior, and a chapter describing Outreach, the ideal starting point for a Chaos March campaign.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This sourcebook filled the need for an area that could be used in campaigns that didn't feature the Clans, but also wasn't another &quot;fight the Periphery Bandits&quot; scenario repeated over and over. The location of the Chaos March within the Inner Sphere makes it ideal for use with factions from all of the major Houses, and the book offers lots of plot hooks and ideas. It also introduces several new vehicles, including possibly the most dangerous helicopter in BattleTech history.<br/><br/>This book's probably of most use to those who want to create battles that involve any major or minor faction wanted, want to use Level 2 technology, and don't want to be limited to scenarios linked to the period between the war of 3039 and the Clan invasion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Miniatures Game of Massive Robotic Mayhem<br/><br/>Iron Tyrants is a tabletop miniatures game of massive robotic combat. Each player will field a squad of tyrants, giant walking robots armed to the teeth with cannons, rockets, and lasers in an attempt to dominate the battlefield and crush his opponent under his metal heel. Sometimes, victory may mean simply being the last player with tyrants left standing, but a variety of scenarios are provided featuring a range of victory conditions so that every game is a completely different experience.<br/><br/>A full campaign is also included. The campaign will have players fighting for one of three factions over control of Gateworld Atropos and the future of the Allyrian Sector.  Rules are included for the variety of environs on the gateworld such that the gateworld's weather and conditons bring the battlefield to life.<br/><br/>The system is d10-based and features several areas of resource management leading players to balance risks versus rewards with nearly every decision on the table. The key behind this is the Overload mechanic in which a tyrant may be pushed well beyond its normal capabilities but at great risk to both the machine and the pilot. Players also have a limited supply of Tactics Dice which are used both in determining initiative and in activating special abilities provided by unique commanders. Gameplay is filled with difficult decisions in which every choice has a consequence.<br/><br/>The game was intended to be played on a tabletop filled with terrain but hexmaps may also be used without issue. All game measurements are made from a 1-inch round base so units may be represented by any appropriate miniature. In the very near future we will be releasing printable miniatures for each tyrant in the game.<br/><br/>It's a game about tough choices. It's a game about resource management. Most importantly, it's a game about giant robots blasting the hell out of each other across the torn landscape of the future.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the company website)<br/><br/>In 1885, western Canada is rocked by the specter of rebellion. Louis Riel, who had fled to the US following the Red River Rebellion in 1870 had been called back by the Metis of Saskatchewan to make their case before the federal government. The result was the Northwest Rebellion, which started with the Battle of Duck Lake in March and ended with the Battle of Loon Lake in June. In the meantime, 5,000 government soldiers covered thousands of kilometers and fought four pitched battles against various First Nations and Metis opponents. Fish Creek was a meeting engagement that caused the government forces to re-evaluate their strategy against the Metis. Cut Knife Hill was a reconnaissance in force, which almost cost the government a &quot;Custer&quot; like tragedy. Frenchman's Butte was an assault on a prepared position designed to free hostages and capture the hostiles of Big Bear's Cree band. Each was a near run affair, and each was a battle of the Northwest Rebellion. Each game is grand tactical in scale, with units representing companies (or their equivalent) per unit (10 men per strength point), and each hex represents approx. 100 yards.<br/><br/>The game includes the following 5 battles, each with it's own map and counters.<br/><br/><br/>     Fish Creek - April 24, 1885<br/>     Cut Knife Hill - May 2, 1885<br/>     Duck Lake - March 26, 1885<br/>     Frenchman's Butte - May 28, 1885<br/>     Loon Lake - June 3, 1885 <br/><br/><br/>",

After the units are completed, they pit their team against one or more opponents. The game is like chess on steroids!<br/><br/>The infinite combinations of weapons, movements and defenses against the other team's weapons movements and defenses makes for a unique playing experience each and every game.<br/><br/>Unit design can take up to 2 hours for first time players, and play time can range anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. The object of the game is to obliterate the opposition and collect credits for rewards. With those credits, you can buy more units or upgrade your existing units through the roof.<br/><br/>Strategy is the key to winning. Do you use a bunch of fast and light units or just work with a couple of super strong slow units, or go with a mix of everything? Depending on what you do and what each opponent does, you can battle for hours or you can make a fatal mistake and have things end very quickly. No two games are alike!<br/><br/>",

Players make contracts with growers, sell coffee to their market, and improve their operation in order to satisfy the cravings of addicts the world over.<br/><br/>On each turn a player does the following:<br/><br/>1) Draw three coffee cubes from a bag containing equal amounts of coffee cubes. Add them to the demand meters in the center of the board.<br/>2) &quot;Make contracts&quot; with growers from the four corners of the world by moving each grower marker up or down on the contract grid in front of you.<br/>3) The growers then grow coffee. Each player draws one cube for each region he/she has contracts with. The amount of contracts made for that region as well as the type of cube drawn determines how much coffee you get.<br/>4) The player has the option to advertise specific types of coffee, thus potential increasing demand for their stock.<br/>5) Players then may sell their coffee, making more for coffees in higher demand. Selling coffee reduces demand for that coffee in their region.<br/><br/>Because there is a set amount of cubes in the bag, players must balance supply and demand to stay on top.<br/><br/>Fair Trade: A Game of Competitive Coffee Cartels is the first in a line of &quot;Green&quot; games by I-55 Games (a non-profit publisher aimed to provide workplace re-entry training in St. Louis).

Only one of the decks is used during each game, as chosen by the players.  There is also a gameboard consisting of spaces with the vowel letters a, e, i, o, and u.<br/><br/>On each turn, the player draws a card from the deck of vowel cards.  The player says the name of the object on the card, then advances to the first space that matches the vowel on the card.  To stay there, the player must say another object with the same vowel sound.  Other players may give hints if the player cannot think of one.  If they fail to name another object with the same vowel sound, the player must move back one space.

But suddenly something breaks the silence. The noise comes from old Mrs. Olsen&rsquo;s - it sounds as if a whole car park was just started up. What is going on?<br/><br/>The situation is actually pretty simple: Old Mrs. Olsen is a lawn mower enthusiast and she is just tired of looking at her neighbors&rsquo; beautiful lawns and trimmed hedges while her own garden has been overgrown for years. Now she wants to relive the time when she could race her lawn mowers around the garden. To accomplish this she has hired some of the supposedly nice kids from the neighborhood. The youngsters don&rsquo;t really all want to help, but she offers them money for the grass and weeds they can mow, and she finds a mower in her collection that matches each of them.<br/><br/>The goal of the game:<br/>The players play one of the kids and compete with each other to mow the most grass and weeds while avoiding the flowers. At the same time they try not to run down the old woman, her cat or the other kids. The player who earns the most money (victory points) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each possible combination is represented on one card. Cards will be laid out in a 3x4 grid. Simultaneously the players are looking for a 'trifix', a set of 3 cards where in each of the four categories (shape, quantity, color and filling) all 3 cards are all alike or all different. If one trifix is found the player gets this and the cards are replaced from the deck. Then play continues. Winner is who has found the most trifix at the end.<br/><br/>",

Players play one to six card melds to attempting to win tricks. All the cards have a primary value but also have secondary purposes. Since a card(s) can only be played on a lower value card(s), winning tricks with high cards and secondary purposes of cards allow players to lead a new trick with their low value cards. A game consists of hands scored on the order in which players empty their hands.  <br/>   <br/>  Players can be dealt in or out as the game or social situation requires.  All players have equal hand sizes to start each hand. Game play changes with the number of players playing the game (even though the rules and scoring are the same) since all the cards are dealt out each hand and depending on the number of players each player will have a different hand size even though they have the same number as all others playing that hand. <br/>   <br/>   A game for a new player would take about 20 minutes from start to finish. Despite the name the game makes more and more sense as you play since many of the secondary purposes of cards are actually very intuitive.

        "description": "Horsefeathers is a bluffing-and-betting dice game requiring only twelve 6-sided dice, a dice cup, a handful of tokens, and a box of poker chips in order to play.<br/><br/>Players roll one die each turn and add it to the dice that are already in the center of the table.  These dice are grouped by number.  When there is one die of a given number (say, one 6), it is referred to as a &quot;single&quot;; when there are two dice of a given number (say, two 3s), they are referred to as a &quot;double&quot;; there can never be three dice (a &quot;triple&quot;) of the same number in the center of the table.<br/><br/>When players roll their die, they conceal it under the dice cup and then declare its value.  If, however, the number rolled would create a triple, then the player must call it something else.  The player must lie.<br/><br/>Other players can challenge the declaration by calling &quot;Horsefeathers.&quot;  If the rolling player was lying, then the challenge is successful and the challenger takes a token from the center of the table; the lying player is out of the round.  If, on the other hand, the rolling player was telling the truth, then the *challenger* is out of the round.<br/><br/>The goal in each round is to be the last player standing -- that player gets the pot of chips.<br/><br/>Play continues in this fashion until the last token is taken.  The current round is finished, payouts are made based on any token discrepancies, and then the chips are counted.  The player with the most chips is the winner.<br/><br/>If you want to give it a try, the rules can be found on the game's homepage, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/horsefeathers/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/horsefeathers/</a>.<br/><br/>",

You and other professional thieves have been hired to infiltrate a secret facility and loot the Executive Vault. As part of the agreement, you can keep anything else of value you discover along the way.<br/><br/>Thieves spend actions and each build a hand of skill-boosting Equipment cards used to overcome such obstacles as Bounty Hunters, Exploding Aerial Drones and Killer Robots. The game is highly social, and players will frequently work with (or double-cross) fellow thieves to advance through the building. But ultimately you&rsquo;re in it for yourself ... despite what you may have told anyone else.<br/><br/>If any thief loots the Executive Vault and escapes the building, then the thief with the most total loot is the winner. But in an unusual twist, if you're caught as a thief, you're not out of the game. Instead, you &quot;flip&quot; and become an informant working for the authorities against the other thieves. If all the thieves are caught, then the informant with the most &quot;credibility&quot; gains immunity from crimes committed and wins.<br/><br/>",

Moves are made in a straight line, forward, backward or sideways, but not diagonally. The point of the spinner corresponding in color to the player's knights indicates the number of moves the player may make.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get as many knights as possible into any of the other players' castles, and also to score by capturing the opponents' knights. A capture may be made by a player spinning a number that will land his knight directly in a space occupied by an opponent's knight when not on the gold field or in a castle. Knights may be passed or jumped at any time but they are safe from capture on the gold field or in a castle.<br/><br/>The winner is determined by the score of points. For each knight captured the player scores five points. For each knight moved to opponent's castle the player scores 15 points. The game can be played to conclusion, even though one or two players may be eliminated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The titanic struggle between Red &amp; Blue in 21st century American politics is recreated in all its glory in Election Night, a board game that allows players to feel the roar of the crowds, experience the steely-nerved debate appearence, and enjoy the satisfaction of a political campaign well fought.<br/><br/>To begin the game, players decide what their stand will be on the issues: either leaning to the left, rolling to the right, or sticking to the center on each of five issues: the Economy, Social Issues, the Military, Taxes and the Environment. These positions influence where they can hope to win votes. The more right-wing they are, for example, the easier it will be to rally voters in the South and Frontier states; if they choose a centrist platform, the more likely that Swing State voters are to join the cause.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose whether to campaign, claiming votes ahead of the election; strategize, directing the flow of the contest in their favor; or advertise, swaying voters with a carefully crafted message. And no two games will likely be the same, as cards-in-hand suggest paths to follow and the constantly changing News Cycle shines a fickle light on one of fifteen possible issue positions, meaning that timing and clever play are everything.<br/><br/>The game simulates the modern American presidential campaign, with a home-stretch, flip-flops (and resulting attack ads), gaffes during debates, red-meat speeches, polling, &quot;fire-in-the-belly&quot;, &quot;robo calls&quot; and much more.  All cards appear in both the Democratic and Republican player's deck, the two sides are evenly balanced, and the electoral map is tuned to the latest census numbers that will be in place for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 elections.<br/><br/>",

When a player has the required amount of savings in the Bank, he can progress from one income bracket to a higher one by advancing through the DOOR to Opportunity.  Money can be earned by receiving a salary every Pay Day in increasing amounts depending on the player's degree of education, and also by investing in real estate and skill in managing general finance.  Players have fascinating experiences in banking, savings and loans, interest, insurance, studying in school, receiving scholarships, and in general going through a full lifetime from childhood to retirement.

        "description": "&quot;Throughout the entire war I participated in many large scale operations but the upcoming battle for Berlin was special, it couldn't be compared to anything before it. The front-line had to get through the highly defended echelon zone starting from Oder and ending with the highly fortified Berlin&quot;.<br/><br/>So writes the Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov about the assault on Berlin . For four years the Great Patriotic War continued. Millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks and planes &ndash; the entire might of USSR , Great Britain , France and many other countries were sent to battle. In the end fascist Germany was defeated.<br/><br/>The strategic card game &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; is dedicated to the last period of the war when soviet soldiers assaulted Berlin and completely broke the German forces. Each player takes on the role of a division commander. He has command over different units: infantry, armored vehicles, artillery and aviation.<br/><br/>Each unit has a historic counterpart &ndash; so for instance each rifle company in the game is a counterpart of real life divisions, platoons of KV tanks and T-34s, batteries of &ldquo;Katusha&rdquo; rocket launchers, squadrons of LA-7s and Tu-2 and so on. All in game characteristics were done keeping in mind the actual abilities of the historic counterparts. By using special &ldquo;tactical cards&rdquo; you can use different assaults, tactical maneuvers and psychological effects. Throughout the game, players simulate different actions of their divisions: charges and break through, artillery support and aerial bombings, organization off defenses and blocking enemy troops.<br/><br/>All units in the game and all game events are shown as cards. Each card has an image of the unit, it's characteristics and abilities and also a text &ndash; usually it's a quotation from a historical novel or memoires, or some information on the current unit. All illustrations on the cards are done from actual black and white photos done during the war by using computer technologies.<br/><br/>Booster packs containing new cards have been released for &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo;. Players can add any of these cards to their decks by purchasing the booster packs sold separately. This way, players can make their own unique decks by adding new cards to it. Depending on the cards in the deck victory may be easier than before. It's more important to have a balanced deck fit for different situations then just by adding strong cards. But both players need to have an equal amount of cards in their decks. It is also not recommended to have more than 60 cards in the deck.<br/><br/>There is also a mmo game based on &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The War Online&rdquo;<br/><br/>Victory Day&rdquo; the board game is based mostly on &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG. This way, players can further customize their decks by using cards from &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG. This way they can combine lots of different tactics, use an assortment of squads and platoons and even simulate historical battles from World War 2.<br/><br/>",

Then an semi-circular marker is placed around the disk to show where it was placed and the disk is removed. The card is now turned around and reveals which quadrant of the board it belongs to. The quadrants are card-sized, and the cards show a cross with the precise location. Afterwards, the disc is put back on top of the cards - it contains concentric rings which mark how far the player was off. Points are scored depending on how close the player guessed the location.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Words of Wisdom: the Game 2-10 players compete against one another to be the first to get rid of all the cards in their hands.  Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)<br/><br/>The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.<br/><br/>Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.  The numbered board spaces represent the 66 books of the Bible, and the cards in the Book Deck represent individual books of the Bible.  The cards in the Providence Deck channel Bible-based occurrences such as Trials, Miracles, Prophecies, and Parables.  Nevertheless, the theme is as light and non-intrusive as the game play is: the rules state that no familiarity with the Bible is necessary to play, enjoy, or win the game.  Likewise, there are no specific teachings or stories told through the game itself.  If the game attempts anything spiritual, it is only to familiarize the players with the names and order of the books that make up the Bible.<br/><br/>",

Colonel Arthur Anderson, 155th Battery.<br/><br/>Slim to None is a war game simulation of the battle along the Slim River in northern Malaya.  In January 1942, the 11th Indian Division was sent north to contest the Imperial Japanese Army's advance from their landing beaches on the Kra Isthmus.<br/><br/>However, the Japanese 5th Infantry Division, supported by the 4th Armored Regiment struck first in the early morning hours of January 7th at the Cluny Rubber Plantation and at the town of Trolak, just north of the Slim River. The Allied forces were caught unprepared by the sudden Japanese combined arms offensive, with units scattered along 19 miles of road north of the Slim River, and with little to no weaponry by which to oppose the Japanese armor. Worse still, the Japanese infiltration tactics through jungle terrain the Allied commanders believed to be impenetrable, led to the Allied battalions being repeatedly outflanked and forced to retreat.<br/><br/>The Japanese success here would eventually take them all the way to Singapore.

        "description": "From Zillions of Games<br/><br/><br/>Rapid advancements in artillery during the late 19th and early 20th century meant that when Word War I broke out, the nature of war would be changed forever. That war marked a shift from the infantry charge of old to the modern artillery barrage. Pieces ranged from small mortars to powerful Howitzers. The larger, more complex the ordnance the more soldiers it required in the gun crews to properly fire it. These pieces usually shot expoling shells - called 'Whiz-Bangs' by the troops.<br/><br/>This game recreates the trench warfare of the first World War. The grey field in the middle is 'No Man's Land' - the deadly wasteland that existed between the two sides trenches. The first player to safely get a Soldier across No Man's Land and into enemy territory wins.<br/><br/>Soldiers attack by firing shells. The direction and range is determined by how many Soldiers are working together. Two Soldiers connected in a line can attack up to two spaces away in the direction that their line is aimed at. Three Soldiers in a line can attack up to three spaces away, and so on. A lone Soldier can attack any neighboring space. When an attack is made, none of the attacking Soldiers are moved. The opponent's captured Soldier is removed from the board.<br/><br/>A Soldier can move one step in any direction. A line of Soldiers can be shifted one space in the direction of their line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mistral is the first of a set of naval games from Red Sash Games; a series called Sea Lords.<br/><br/>Mistral covers the War of the Austrian Succession at sea, plus the concurrent War of Jenkin's Ear. Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Mistral covers the western Mediterranean, where Spain tried to keep her lines of communication open to her army in Italy, and France's Toulon Fleet continually harassed the British.<br/><br/>Mistral is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players. A special campaign scenario allows the players to link Mistral with its companion Lace Wars game &ndash; Queen's Gambit.<br/><br/>",

With A=1 and Z=26 every word that you come up with will score you a certain amount of points.<br/>There are 5 topics and and you have a minute to come up with an answer for each, either an answer with as many letters towards the end of the alphabet to score you most points; or a short answer with letters towards the beginning of the alphabet. After the time has run out you go through topic by topic, <br/>you decide whether you answer is unique, an answer that no-one else has chosen; then you think if your word is the highest or lowest depending on which was chosen at the beginning of the game. If you choose to move onto the &quot;Showdown&quot; you can then text in the number to find out your words score. You can, if your good at maths work out the number yourself. <br/>The winner of the showdown gets 20 points, if you had a correct answer but didn't go into the showdown you get 10; and if you didn't think that you had a unique answer but it was still a right answer you get 5 points. <br/>After 5 rounds, totaling 20 minutes you work out your overall score and the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>",

It brings a fresh type to the table top and hours of replayability. I cannot wait to be playing the finished product in my living room.&quot; - Demo Player Richard Nava<br/><br/>&quot;I'm not a game player in general and I was surprised how much I got into (Specimen), playing the first time. I was PISSED when my flamethrower was going to be used against me. PISSED. And I was thrilled for the player next to me when she went for a move that was balls out ballsy&hellip;these guys are the real deal&hellip;FUN STUFF, FOLKS!&quot; - Demo Player Rebecca L<br/><br/>SPECIMEN is a two-player card-driven board game that pits a group of human astronauts against a predatory extraterrestrial life form.<br/><br/>Each turn comprises four action rounds, where each player can perform one of several possible game actions. The Monster's movements are hidden from the Crew player behind a game screen, and the Monster's location is only revealed when the Monster attacks...or if the crew is lucky (or unlucky) enough to find it!<br/><br/>At the beginning of play, a mysterious specimen in the cargo hold has been let loose as a result of the damage caused by a meteor collision. This SPECIMEN is in an embryonic stage and evolves throughout the game, becoming more difficult to kill as the turns progress. In addition to attempting to kill the crew, the monster can also destroy sections of the ship, forcing the human players to divide their efforts between defense and structural repair. The monster can win the game by either killing all seven members of the crew or damaging enough sections of the ship that it breaks apart. Adding the destruction of the ship as an alternate victory condition allows for varied strategies on the part of both players. The human player can use tools to effect repairs, construct weapons and trackers to hunt down the monster&hellip;or ultimately blow up the ship if all seems lost.<br/><br/>The SPECIMEN player constructs his/her monster from a selection of 25 different attributes (offensive, defensive, or special abilities), providing new and different threats to the human player each game. This constantly changing monster, combined with 90 event cards driving game play, allows for infinite replayability. No two games should ever be the same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "...It is the year 2012, and the world is indeed coming to an end.<br/>It&rsquo;s been almost half a year now, and while many try to continue their normal way of living, others began to center their lives around these events, apostolating religious theories about the end of the world, or using the chaos to their own advantages. It is pretty obvious to everyone that there won&rsquo;t be long before something big happens, although what that will be, or what the meaning of all this is, noone knows.<br/><br/>Godswake is an Adventure game set is the near future (or if you read this after 2012, an alternate Earth) when apparently the world is falling apart, but in a very unexpected, mythic, supernatural way. The characters &ndash; represented by the players &ndash; race against each other to get their hands on an allegedly extremely powerful relic amidst the chaos, with what they may not only be able stop the destruction, but also to assume a god-like power for themselves. However, it is a very hard task: the dangers lie not only in the natural catastrophes caused by the troubled matter of the Earth, but also in the insanity of people trying to deal with the coming of the apocalypse, in the rivalry of others who have the same goal in mind and in the appearance of supernatural events and creatures that have only lived in people&rsquo;s imagination before. During their adventures the characters will probably travel around the world, visit exotic places, lead expeditions into relentless wildernesses in search for helpful minor Artifacts, face surprising Adventures and venture into disaster-ridden places all other people are running away from.<br/><br/>Card traits and game mechanics (such as Character Personalities that affect the outcome of adventures they have) all strive to keep the game as thematic as possible, while being simple and straight-forward at the same time. The game tries to keep a short playing time for an adventure game, while still being epic and memorable.<br/><br/>The game has been influenced by many sources ranging from Indiana Jones (regarding exploration in exotic places) and James Bond movies (high tech gear, daring action scenes), through the Supernatural tv-series (with the &ldquo;ongoing apocalypse&rdquo; setting), Hellblazer comics (giving it the darker tone, people with mystical powers, occult and magic), to the Stalker concept by the Strugatsky-brothers (regarding the whole weird zone called the Unknown, where the rumored relic lies). The mood of the game may feel like a mix of all of the above: quite dark and mature, but without resorting to graphic violence or vulgarity; a bit thought-provoking, but not taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The game uses lots of cards &ndash; around 350 in all &ndash; and many tokens as components, aside from a game board.<br/><br/>",

You tell them of your plan to write a hit sci-fi story and suddenly it catches fire! You rush home to your flat in an inspired haze and start writing that million-dollar story: The one about a bunch of Martians and a time machine. One week later, you return to the pub buzzing with excitement. Just as you are about to fill them in, Susie arrives boasting about her new tale, &ldquo;Doomsday: The Martian Shrink Ray.&rdquo; Moments later, Frank counters with a different story: &ldquo;The Robot Toxin.&rdquo; It would seem that your friends have all got the same idea. Happily, you laugh through the night comparing, modifying and sharing ideas. As Steve pours another round, a friendly wager arises: Who can write the best science fiction story in five weeks time? Looking down at your beer-stained draft, you toss twenty-dollars into the pot. This one&rsquo;s in the bag, your pals don&rsquo;t stand a chance. . .<br/><br/>This is a game of draft building. Each turn, players will add and subtract cards from a shared deck. Then, players will draft cards from this deck. After players have chosen a set of cards, they will take turns playing them. In a turn, players can choose to either discard cards (in order to save ink), or to spend ink to play cards (developing plot-lines). The plots players develop will then influence the next weeks workshop, as they help players to add and remove cards from the shared deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, you are managing a fictional National Park in the U.S.  your goal is to build improvements into the park that attract more visitors.  Unfortunately, more visitors bring more problems and nature is always trying to reclaim the land.  Every round you will build you park and accrue visitor points, while one of your opponent's will take nature's revenge and another opponent will play the unruly visitors who will damage the park.  At the end of every year, a visitor assessment is performed for each of the improvement categories and the number of visitor points you have accumulated in each category  that will come to your park the following year are assigned.  This is also the number of improvement points that you will receive that year to improve your park.<br/><br/>At the end of the last round, you tally up all of the visitor points you have accrued and receive bonuses for having the majority in each category.  Highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

A set of color Deflection Templates are included as well for determining where wild shots go, ricochets off the Goal frames, etc.<br/><br/>There is also a &quot;Cheat Sheet&quot; holding some 90% of all that's needed to play the game without having constantly to reference the rulebook. The 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; book itself is 62 pages, with three of full color photos of games and miniatures. Figure and other resources are provided to help fans of the &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; get started immediately.<br/><br/>To quote from Bob Wiltrout's Introduction, &quot;In our experience, people who play this game once play it again and again. In three years of play-testing, nobody has ever played Corner Kick and walked away saying, &ldquo;This just doesn&rsquo;t feel like soccer.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m betting you won&rsquo;t be the first.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re going to enjoy this!&quot;<br/><br/>",

If only you could find them, you could caravan back these barrels of liquid joy and become the pride of the town. That is, if the other would-be heroes don&rsquo;t get to them first.

The players will take turns playing tiles to the board, Phlanxing and/or scoring with the tile played.  The player will then place a scoring piece on the pips they scored that turn.  The last round of the game is signaled when a player uses their last scoring piece or when a player draws the last tile from the supply.  At the end of the game, players will total up the points from their scoring pieces, gaining bonus points by creating patterns on the board (line, cross, triangle and square) with their pieces.

They cannot be damaged in any way (or removed from the game by other character's abilities) nor can they take any Actions other than to move. Umbra and Lucera are removed from play if Dinah leaves play. If an enemy Character wishes to occupy the same space as either Umbra or Lucera, the spirits are moved up to 1 inch (into an open area) by their controlling player to vacate the space. Umbra and Lucera move freely and independently during Dinah's activation as Intangible units with a Speed of 12 and a Control Zone of 4 inches.<br/> Spiritual Link<br/> Dinah can channel some of her magic abilities through Umbra and Lucera. When she does this Dinah is considered as being in the same position on the board as her spirit guardian. If she tries to channel an ability through a spirit guardian that is not within 16 inches of her (measures are taken after declaring the ability activation), the ability has no effect and that spirit guardian is removed from play.<br/> Angel Guardian<br/> If Dinah would be removed from play for any reason, roll a die, if you roll a 6+ Dinah remain in play with one Life Point.

        "description": "From Publisher Website<br/><br/>Axle tribes is the game of automotive combat set within a post apocalyptic world. Please note, that this is a game for the gamers - it is not for profit, nor will it ever be. In addition, the rules will literally be shaped by the players - each new edition will contain rule changes and additions that are suggested by YOU. Please feel free to jot down any ideas as you play and submit them to the Drunk Dwarves webmaster.<br/><br/>And without further delay - we present our first published game: AXLE TRIBES.<br/><br/>The Earth has been blighted. Long ago an event, the great end, turned the world as we knew it into a smitten landscape of broken glass and twisted jungles of metal rod. All that was green and blue, has been reborn in hues of dead browns. The air tastes bad - and it's hard to believe we were ever meant to live here.<br/><br/>Between the endless stretches of waste there are monstrous cities ruled by powerful land lords, where the land still clings to life. But if you live there, you live their way - or not at all. That's why many of us band together and try to survive in the wastes of the bad lands - among the mutant freaks and the harsh ever-present sun. The Axle Tribes rule this land, that is - everything left worth ruling. The Axle Tribes fight, they fight over food, water, and the parts needed to make and maintain our steeds. I am a warrior, my steed is my life, and the life of my tribe.<br/><br/>Game Description Notes<br/><br/>This free set of miniatures rules is meant to be played with Hot Wheels (or similar) model cars on the table top. (Serious players often customize their vehicles with weapons, armor-plating, etc.) Both players control a Tribe and each is allowed to build a set amount of vehicles (called Steeds) to fight it out.<br/><br/>Players work within an agreed upon dollar cap to create a variety of vehicles. Various weapons and vehicle upgrades make each Steed more distinctive, but also add to the cost. The game progresses in Turns. (During a Turn each vehicle is activated once.) Vehicles may move, fire, etc. when activated.<br/><br/>Ten-sided dice are used as a randomizer to decide control rolls, to hit rolls, etc. Maneuvers are based on 45 degree turns. There are special rules for collisions. Each steed has its own record sheet where damage is recorded. Printable counters are included to help track damage and speed.<br/><br/>The victory conditions of the game are left up to the players. A total destruction match in which only one side is left standing is the simplest way to play.<br/><br/>",

In the disease&rsquo;s early stages, patients present with high fever, vomiting, and weakness. Quickly, the Spanish Flu theory comes under scrutiny. Patients all report having been attacked. Where the disease spreads violent crime seems to inexplicably rise. As outbreaks skyrocket, several studies conclusively prove the disease in not the dreaded Spanish Flu; it is something much worse. Late stage symptoms are found to include death, reanimation, superhuman strength, and an insatiable craving for human flesh.<br/><br/>After precious few years of peace, the nations of the world are returning once more to the trenches, united against a common foe. In Zombies &amp; Zeppelins, 2-4 players lead the forces of humanity against hordes of the undead. Together, players must attempt to clear the numerous infested cities around the world. Should they fail, mankind will be swept away in a tide of the damned.<br/><br/>Zombies &amp; Zeppelins is played on a game board depicting a map of the world which has been divided into 25 regions. The game uses a card-driven system to determine both the spread of the undead and humanity's military capacity. Player's must carefully manage their meager resources in combating the undead. Through clever maneuvering of their infantry, armor and artillery, and a little bit of luck, players might just be able to avert Armageddon.<br/><br/>",

The left leg has metre questions, the middle section has litre and temperature questions, and the right leg has gram questions.  After rolling the dice the player takes the larger of the two dice and moves their token forward and takes a question card from the appropriate stack.  If the player answers the question correctly their token remains on that square.  If the player is incorrect the player moves backwards the smaller number of spaces.  If the player rolls doubles their token is moved forward the total of the two dice, and moves backwards the distance indicated on one die in the case of an incorrect answer. If the player lands on a square the same colour as their token, a chance card is drawn.  On some spaces an exam card is drawn.  A player cannot move again until an exam question is answered correctly. The first player to travel the board wins.<br/><br/>",

Players compete for the attention of six girls, each with their own events related to them, and the player with the most events scored at the end wins. The game consists of general events, special events and activity cards. Players start with a deck of activity cards and some general events, though none are kept as a hand, but instead drawn one at a time and played. Each turn, a player can choose if he wants to gain a certain girl's special event card to add to his deck, or if he wants to gain as points the events he'll play. It's a matter of keeping in mind what you have in your deck and relying on luck enough to get them in the right order.<br/><br/>Translated box back<br/>A game distilling the sweet-and-sour (or so 'tis written) romantic memories from fictitious school days.

The Expansion also includes two new thick paper gloss map panels (each 11&quot; x 17&quot;) that cover the Falkland Islands and Argentine coastal areas so that you can create and/or play scenarios that can range over the entire Falklands theater.<br/> The Expansion includes a 20 page Rules Manual that has two sections: the First section adds new, expanded and advanced rules for MNC that add new depths of realism to the game, as well as accounts for advances in technology that occurred during the 1980s time frame. The Second section of the manual covers the 1982 Falklands Conflict, with geographical and related information (as well as rules specific to the Falklands Conflict) needed to plan, create, and play scenarios for the Conflict. This section also contains information about different types of missions that each side performed during the Conflict to help players create their own scenarios. Each mission type also includes a historic 'starter scenario' that demonstrates a typical version of that mission.<br/><br/>The Expansion also includes a new sheet of 280 die-cut counters, with new counters for missiles for red and blue sides, and adds sufficient counters to add a third side (green) to play, which can be used for the Argentine side in Falkland scenarios, or perhaps as a minor navy in a GIUK battle.<br/><br/>Website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.navalwarfare.net/mnc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.navalwarfare.net/mnc.html</a><br/><br/>",

When you keep a letter, your turn is over and you pass the bag to the player on your left. Letters you don't want are placed face up on the letter board where they may be taken by other players. Letters you keep are placed on your letter rack.<br/><br/>The first player to make an answer using all the letters on his or her rack wins the round. The winner scores two points for each letter in his or her answer, plus a bonus equal to the number of the round being played. Other players score one point for each letter in their partial answer if every letter on their rack is used in the partial answer. Players score zero points if there are any unused letters on their rack when the round ends.<br/><br/>An answer may consist of one or more words and may be singular or plural. Blank tiles may be used as any letter and are scored as a letter. Spaces between words and other punctuation are assumed and do not affect scoring.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score after six rounds of play wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Shadowstone Saga is a fantasy/sci-fi war-game. It is set on a dying world, orbiting a morose, purple sun - a sentient star watching life fade away. The Eternal Empire has banished the shadow of death and outlived most other life on this world; the price they have paid for eternity is their flesh. After an epoch of stagnation, the birth of the prophetess Mantra heralds a threat to this Eternal Order. Driven by her creativity the Young Realms are formed; born out of the clash of arms. They seek to restore humanity to its former creativity, even at the price of regaining their mortality.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two ways. The battle engine can be used for individual contests between two players, using armies selected with the games points system (for balanced battles). These battles are fought on a grid, using counters for pieces and are resolved using D6. The game uses a system of statistics which represent the abilities of each regiment.<br/>In addition to these random battles, there is the opportunity to play the full Shadowstone Saga campaign, which is more like an RPG - only one where you run an empire, as opposed to a single character! This is played on a larger 'overview' map of your Empire, and will utilise the battle engine when armies clash.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to overcome your opponent. In addition to straight out brawls, there are objective-based missions, headhunting missions, breakout missions, and even missions where the intention is to intentionally lose a battle without your opponent suspecting your motives (the campaign map creates all manner of intrigues!).<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>&quot;Having fulfilled their destiny, the Phoenix Knights were granted independence, and left to safeguard the empire in their own manner. Phoenix stones were built in their honour; huge monoliths that dominated the landscape like mountains, forever breathing clouds of bone-white smoke (which could be cloying to those who lived near them) to purify the air.<br/>  Decades came and went, then centuries, then a millennium, and then millennia. The other civilizations surrounding the Eternal Empire, rivals and allies, old friends and ancient grudges, slowly started to die out. And as for the wildlife of the world, that too started to dry up and die, and the world became more and more inhospitable, as the balance of life and death was grossly upset. <br/>  Although they were free from mortality, the bodies of the eternal folk were still subject to rot. At first no one really noticed, then the younger ones grew into wrinkled bodies quite soon, and then skin started to peel, everyone had a smaller appetite, flowers blossomed later in the year and perished earlier &ndash; but no one talked about it, for it was happening to everyone. After a huge span of time (beyond the count of calendars, for these eternal folk started to lose track of the passing of years) they had lost their flesh, leaving nothing but their skeletons and their sentience. <br/>   A child had not been birthed since the slaying of the last Shadow Knight an aeon ago, and not a single law had changed for an epoch, and so the order of the Eternal Empire persisted, still ruled by the benevolent High-King Druidainh. The art and culture of the Eternal empire had not progressed, and the lives of its people were a constant repetitious cycle, devoid of any excitement. The bards played the same old songs, which had long since fallen out of relevance, being endlessly repeated until every word became a clich&eacute;. The word humanity was losing its meaning, there was no nature to oppose itself too but for the long-living fungal blooms in their benign forests, the gnarled trees, and the older scaled-species who spent most of their time in dozing slumbers.<br/>   Obscure wars broke out between barbarians and the borderguards, but these were easily quelled, and so governance of the empire required less and less innovation until it was merely a matter of course. The peasants tilled farms of dust, the merchants bartered between themselves, as if they were playing a pointless game. The beast-tamers snoozed beside their wyverns, the spell-callers animated their artificial creations (the dragon-like Draemh) and rode their backs over still nights, lost in their own dull thoughts. The royal philosophers had found all of the answers to life and sat idle, the astronomers stared up at the same old stars, now convinced that they never moved but sat perfectly still like the monks in their mountain retreats...&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VINDALOO - Four Battles from the 2nd Anglo-Maratha War is a game emphasizing easy, quick play that focuses on the unusual features of this area of history virtually untouched by the hobby but truly rich in gameplayer goodies.<br/><br/>VINDALOO simulates the battles of the 2nd Anglo-Maratha War in India (1802&ndash;1805), in which Major General, The Honorable Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)  had field command in the Deccan (the center of the subcontinent)  against the huge forces of the Marathas , the largest independent  empire in India, under the Scindia rulers of Gwalior and the Bhonsle rulers of Nagpur and Berar, complete with the a massive artillery corps, plus the equally important battles in the northern, Hindustan where the troops of the East India Company were under the oft-unappreciated General Lake; all of which was part of the almost subconscious, ongoing efforts of the British, in the guise of their East India Company, to gobble up an entire continent and civilization.<br/><br/>Much of the game system will be familiar to any wargamer. There is no set number of turns, and this is not Igo-Hugo gaming. Variable activation of commands, based on leadership quality, is the baseline. The usual fire/move then shock mechanics are all there.<br/><br/>VINDALOO includes all four battles of the 2nd Anglo-Maratha War:  Assaye and Argaum, in the Deccan, and Delhi and Laswaree in northern Hindustan. Wellington considered Assaye the toughest battle in which he ever fought. (And readers of Bernard Cornwell&rsquo;s first three Sharpe books will find this familiar territory). Each of these battles is on it's own map,  at 120 yards per hex, with combat units being half-battalions (well, two counters for a full battalion). The Marathas have lots of artillery. Good artillery, too&hellip;  according to Wellesley &ldquo;&hellip; the finest brass ordnance I have ever seen.&rdquo;<br/> Each battle has its own opening maneuvers, along with heavy barrages of cannon, followed by gritty hand-to-hand combat.  There is plenty of opportunity for cavalry charges, especially if the Maratha player can activate his massive cavalry compoo (brigades). And all in very unusual settings with heretofore unseen terrain, such as the 8-10 foot high elephant grass that covered most of 2 of the battlefields.<br/><br/>As an added attraction, the game  plays equally well solitaire.<br/><br/>Each copy of VINDALOO will contain:<br/><br/>4 game maps (two - 22&quot;x34&quot; and two 17&quot; x 22&quot;)<br/>Two full counter sheets<br/>Rules Booklet Approximately 24 pages<br/>Battles Booklet Approximately 20 pages<br/>Two Charts and Tables cards<br/>1 10-sided Dice<br/><br/>",

This sharpshooting dynamic is the source of the game's strategic interest.<br/><br/>",

The game is easily learned, fast-playing, and above all it emphasizes story elements of the battle so that the narrative which emerges has a natural feel of a historical written account. Attention is focused on active units, and the full story of each activation is followed until a natural break point is reached, similar to the end of a paragraph in a historical memoir. The game turn has no fire phase, rally phase, etc., but instead, active units may fire, move, rout &amp; rally in any order as needed to develop their plan. Non-active units play an important role at all times, looking for opportunities to derail the active plan. Fireball Forward is playable on a kitchen table in one evening, and it's designed to challenge players with realistic tactical choices, resulting in a satisfying game for everyone.<br/><br/>",

Teams of 5 dragons each (chromatic on one side, metallic on the other) square off in battle to decide who takes possession of the floating Castle and the immense treasure within!<br/><br/>The basic game starts with each dragon's player rolling a d10 for initiative.  Highest roll goes first, ties roll-off.<br/><br/>Movement then commences, allowing each dragon to move 18 inches, curving or turning at will.  Facing is not taken into account.<br/><br/>After movement, each dragon may attack (either with breath weapons or by melee if in range) or defend.<br/><br/>Attacking with breath weapons have a 9 inch range, and automatically hits any target within range.  The target takes the 1d8x10 hp, and may save for half damage (all of the dragon stats are listed on a stat sheet that was included).  Breath weapons may be used three times per dragon per game.<br/><br/>For melee attacks, the dragon must be within base contact.  The dragon rolls a d20, and hits on a six or better.  damage is recorded against the targets hp.<br/><br/>If a dragon is out of range, it may Defend, allowing it to strike any dragon that comes into attack range, even on another dragon's turn (used to counterstrike when an enemy dragon moves into range).<br/><br/>Dragons are defeated when their HP are reduced to zero.

The inhabitants of this world have unique backgrounds and personalities.  Some of them might even be persuaded to join up with a player character, bringing valuable skills along with them.  In order to succeed the group will need to work together as they make preparations for the perilous journey ahead.  Earn Copper Pieces by taking on part-time work at the local bakery, helping townsfolk with their quirky troubles, fishing and more... Of course, those with a more daring personality will find there is plenty of coin to be made catching dastardly Criminals or seeking out fame and fortune in the Fighter's Fighting Guild.  Recruit Companions, find a trusty Mount and gather supplies.  But don't delay, for once the Town Timer runs out the group must set out at last ~ into dangerous wild lands of Feonora.  How well did the group prepare?  You'll soon find out as the party encounters hostile foes or interesting characters looking to barter and trade.  Search for hidden treasure and get swept into unplanned Side Quests.  Good teamwork is vital for those wishing to reach the ultimate, harrowing Final Encounter, which will require a different strategy altogether depending on the Story.  Should the group survive the journey and complete the adventure (together as one) they will enter a special phase of the game that will reveal who among them was most worthy of honor and prestige.<br/><br/>",

Few are accepted, and the honor is great. But that was over a month ago, and nothing has been heard since. In the mean time, rumors circulate of a beast run rampant, killing all those who venture into the depths of the forest. A twig snaps, throwing you back into the reality at hand.

It is very similar to, and compatible with, Melee and Wizard of Metagaming's The Fantasy Trip. Legends of the Ancient World is the fantasy genre series of these games from Dark City Games.

It is designed to play very well solo, but rules are provided to run it more like an RPG with one or more players cooperating to complete the adventure with another player administering the game as a referee.<br/><br/>Battles are fought with counters on a hex map that is included with the game.<br/><br/>",

Through the challenges you will be faced with over a 1000 different questions about wine, easy,  hard and unexpected. The trip will take you through history, France and the rest of the word. It will call upon your ingenuity, logic and general knowledge making it a fun game for all.<br/><br/>The game is a simple roll the dice and answer the question at its basis. There are three colors of questions: mauve (a bunch of grapes) concerning general questions about wine, pink (the letter H) covering a historical question and blue (globe) which is a geography related question. Every correct answer gets you a 'Bravo' card of the relevant color, three of which in turn allow you to enter one of the guilds: Guild of Knights and Epicurians, Commanders of Diogenes and Rabelais and lastly the Globe-Trotter wine tasters. Unless you are a member of all three guilds you cannot win the game, apart from the question boxes there are a few others such as: champagne cork - which acts like a snake and ladders box, Jokers - which allow you to be awarded a right answer even if you don't know it and a few others with specific instructions.<br/><br/>The game is also available in English, German and French apart from the Dutch version. It won a prize in 1992 at the Brussels Eureka meet. Outsiders rate this game as very hard and requiring expert wine knowledge. It is in this sense a totally different game than Connaisseur whose name it resembles.<br/><br/>",

There are different scenarios and four levels of complexity. The mechanic is I go you go, first, the axis moves his air units, then the naval units and finally the ground units, after this the allies do the actions.

Each player controls a Secret Master in one of the two countries, and they compete to see who can most effectively align the local initiates and their prince with the secret faction they support. (Freimaurerei is German for &quot;Freemasonry.&quot; Pronounce it &quot;FRY-mau-reh-rye&quot;)<br/><br/>The game requires nine stashes of Components: Looney Pyramid Games, a deck of playing cards, dice, and an opaque bag. The Secret Master is a large opaque pyramid (black for Illuminati or white for Rosicrucian), who may be accurately representing his allegiance, or may have the opposite alignment concealed within. Blue pyramids represent Freemasons, who are further initiated into higher degrees by having smaller pyramids stacked on top of them. Small black and white pyramids are nested inside high-degree Masons to show their allegiance to the Rosicrucians or the Illuminati. Yellow and/or orange pyramids are used as money.<br/><br/>During the course of play, number cards are placed on the table to represent Masonic lodges, while face cards represent the rulers of the countries. Black suits are Illuminati-allied, and red ones belong to the Rosicrucians. Intrigue actions may change the alignment of rulers, make Mason pieces defect, inspire rulers to suppress lodges, etc.<br/><br/>A certain level of development is needed in order to call a stop to the game. At that point, true alignments are revealed and victory points are totaled. The apparent winner may actually be defeated. Bluffing and subterfuge are key to this game.<br/><br/>",

It's played on the squares of a checkered board, which is initially empty. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsThe escorts of a light square are the square immediately in front of it and the square immediately to the left of it.<br/><br/>The escorts of a dark square are the square immediately behind it and the square immediately to the right of it.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one stone of his color on an empty point.<br/><br/>After a placement, if the two escorts of one or more squares are occupied by friendly stones and said squares aren't occupied by friendly stones yet, the player must place a stone of his color on each one of them, removing, where appropriate, any enemy stones already placed there. Note that some squares on the edge of the board have only one escort or no escorts at all. These squares are not affected by this rule.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesTwo like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones parallel to the NE-SW diagonal are always connected through a common neighbor in Brique, so, as in Hex, each square has actually six neighbours, and the board behaves like a rhombus, with one diagonal twice as shorter as the other. Needless to say, however, Brique is not isomorphic to Hex.<br/><br/>",

Gamers who already owned the base game (which included a full set of cards for a year) could buy the new cards for the previous season, and play the teams without having to buy a base game again.<br/><br/>The package held a set of large perforated sheets for all the actual NFL teams and players, using revised statistical information based on the season passed (so the 1992 published set had the 1991 year stats). Some of the index cards included new rules or clarifications.<br/><br/>The packaging made it very clear that you needed the base game, so if you didn't know what it was about &quot;it behooves you to gently place this package back on the shelf and purchase the complete game&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The idea behind the game is to show that the bible is still relevant today, to personal life as well as to society and politics.<br/><br/>The game consists of two different sets of cards. One contains quotations from the bible, the other descriptions and aspects of modern life in the form of short texts, messages, promotional slogans etc.<br/><br/>The players have to connect the quotations from the bible on the cards in their hands with the cards from the second set. This doesn't necessarily have to be a literal connection, it involves interpretation and translation into different contexts. <br/>Each player has a hand of five cards with a quotation from the bible, of which he/she has to choose one to go with the current card from the second set of cards. Each player then has one minute to explain why they have chosen a particular quotation, with the aim of &quot;selling&quot; their choice to the other players. The players then vote on the &quot;best&quot; (i.e. most fitting) quotation. Each round, a different player is the &quot;buyer&quot;. He/she uses a set of blue chips numbered 1-5 to secretly vote which quotation they consider best, second best etc. The other players use white chips (also numbered 1-5) to guess the buyer's preferences. Players get points for choosing good (i.e. rated highly by the buyer) quotations as well as for guessing the buyer's preferences. <br/>The game ends either after a certain number of rounds, or after a player has reached a certain number of points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

It is played like real football with actual rules and techniques applied.&quot;<br/><br/>There are twelve dice total, six each of two colors. Each player has five dice of one color and one of the opposite color, which is his &quot;captain&quot;. The board is a cardboard stylized football field with plastic sliders moving back and forth in slots to track the ball position on the field, the first down position, and the current down. Real time is used as the game clock.<br/><br/>In general, the game follows the play of a regular NFL match, with kickoffs (including touchbacks), rushing, passing, touchdowns, PATs, field goals, and punts. Players switch ends of the &ldquo;field&rdquo; at the half. Fumbles, interceptions, and even safeties are also provided for. Play consists of both players rolling their dice and comparing the results, with the higher total prevailing.<br/><br/>If a player mis-adds his dice, a 15-yard penalty is assessed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disclaimer:  This game in no way trivializes the tragedy that befell the Donner Party expedition in 1846-1847 but rather is an attempt to recreate the challenges it faced to better appreciate the difficult choices that were made.<br/><br/>In May of 1846 a wagon train left Missouri bound for California, lured by dreams of a new life of wealth and prosperity.  The pioneers chose George Donner as their leader, and in an effort to shave 350 miles off the trip they took an alternate route through Utah known as Hastings Cutoff. This turned out to be a mistake, and subsequently the wagon train became trapped by early winter snow blocking the Fr&eacute;mont Pass in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The pioneers made camp to wait out the winter at Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.  Starvation, illness and even cannibalism took their toll, and out of the 87 original members of the Donner Party only 48 made it out alive.<br/><br/>Players each control a family of pioneers with the goal of reaching California.  The game starts in November of 1846 with food supplies dwindling and more winter storms on the horizon.  Each player receives a cabin and six pioneer dice that represent your pioneers' conditions: Healthy, Lean, Starving, Sick (Dying) or Dead.  Each round starts with an event after which players take turns placing their pioneers on action spaces until the Starvation Phase when they need to feed their families with food tokens and heat their cabins with wood tokens.<br/><br/>Player interaction is maximized by the Beg action which takes food or wood from another player and the Desperation action which is how to draw and play Desperation cards that are either beneficial for the player or punish opponents.  Some card effects and actions to gain food earn player cannibalism tokens, which penalize a player's score at the end of the game. Periodically during the game a Rescue event occurs and players must choose whether to gamble some of their pioneers on a risky rescue attempt over Fr&eacute;mont Pass or wait until the thirteenth turn of the game when all pioneers left in their cabins are automatically scored.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to deliver as many of your six pioneers as you can to Sutter's Fort alive and minimize your cannibalism token penalty.<br/>  <br/>  &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one.&quot; -Spock, The Wrath of Kahn.<br/><br/>&quot;It's fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day.&quot; -Julia Child<br/><br/>",

As such it contains the same original 9 scenarios, and 1 campaign game, with some minor alterations. The game features new map and counter art.<br/><br/>This game allows you to recreate firefights between British and German troops in Normandy 1944, on a tactical scale: individual vehicles, artillery pieces, support weapons, squads and leaders.<br/>The terrain lends itself for a mixture of close quarter battles around villages and bridges, coupled with long range tank duels, due to the relatively flat, open area with little or no hedges (bocage).<br/><br/>Because of the designer's research and availability of detailed sources on the depicted actions, the scenarios have a highly historically informative value, backed by information and pictures of some of the landmarks in the designer's notes booklet.<br/><br/>",

Soviet and Japanese tactical doctrine comes to a head at Khalkin Gol in the summer of 1939. This  pivotal battle was the earliest example of the blitzkrieg tactics so popularized by the Germans in WW2.    Since the Japanese had decisively beat the Russians in the 1902 - 1905 war, they thought it would be easy once again. But, Japanese doctrine was just to stiff and too old fashioned to deal with the realities of modern land warfare in Asia. This battle is recreated in full at the battalion level with a minimalistic rule system.  Wooden blocks for land and air units provide a realistic fog of war as only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong, until combat is engaged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tactical level wargame based on the anime series Mobile Suit Z Gundam. The game focuses on squad tactics of mobile suits in combat, rather than one-on-one battles. This game is an updated version of Gundam 0080 Cyclops Attack, with updated rules and units from UC 0087 (the Gryps War period).<br/><br/>Players control eighteen-meter armored humanoid-shaped robots called mobile suits.<br/>Each counter represents an individual mobile suit. Data cards explain different units and their corresponding abilities.<br/><br/>Each turn, players secretly select the tactics they will employ per platoon, and then units alternately activate by platoon. Most tactics deal with movement or combat. The winner of the battle is determined by destruction of opposing mobile suits.<br/><br/>The game include some scenarios from Zeta Gundam, but the main draw is a campaign game, with the players having the ability to build and customize units sent into combat. In the campaign game, players also manage their pilots in addition to the mobile suits. The pilots&rsquo; abilities can grow through combat experience. Points scored in battle allow for replacement of older and weaker mobile suits by newer models.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Mapello is a Reversi derivative that includes some special pieces that add new features to the game. These pieces are placed on the board to create a particular board configuration before the main game starts: this is called the setup phase.<br/>A given board configuration may be played repeatedly, with players taking turns to play as black and as white. Since each board configuration will have its own nuances, repeated play enables players to experiment with strategies best suited to each setup.<br/>Alternatively, Mapello can be played in free-play mode. In free-play mode, players take it in turns to setup the board. In order to encourage balance in the setup, the player not setting up the board has the option to play as black or as white (hence to move first or second).<br/><br/>The extra pieces are as follows:<br/>-    Walls: They act like the walls of the board border, but placed inside the board. They are immovable obstacles that cannot be played on.<br/>-    Bonuses: They reward the player with extra points when captured.<br/>-    Jokers (addition by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s): They are placed on the border and act as pieces of the colour of the player in turn.<br/><br/>By combining these pieces, players can create millions of different boards.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>-    Game board of 10x10 squares. The inner 8x8 board is used for playing, while the border is only used to place the jokers during the setup phase. <br/>-    64 Reversi discs (black/white).<br/>-    8 walls (gray squares).<br/>-    8 bonuses (blue discs).<br/>-    8 jokers (red squares).<br/><br/>SETUP PHASE<br/><br/>Optionally, the players may agree some constraints on the number of each type of piece to be placed during the setup phase. Then, subject to these constraints the setup player places their chosen number of pieces. Walls and power-ups can be placed anywhere on the inner 8x8 area (except on the four centre squares), and jokers can be placed anywhere on the outer 10x10 border. The game commences with an initial 2x2 configuration of black and white pieces in the following diagonal pattern:<br/> PLAYING PHASE<br/><br/>Two players (black and white) alternate turns placing a piece with their colour facing up onto an empty cell of the inner 8x8 board. Black always plays first. Each piece must be placed adjacent to an opponent's piece (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Then, all the opponent's pieces that are trapped in a contiguous straight line (either diagonal, vertical, or horizontal) between the newly placed piece and an existing piece of that colour, or a joker, are flipped over to the player's colour. A legal move must case at least one opponent piece to be flipped. If a player cannot make a legal move then they pass.<br/>      <br/>If a player places a piece on top of a blue bonus disc, they take the disc (this will score 3 points at the end of the game).<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Players count the pieces of their colour facing up and add the points of the blue discs. Highest score wins. Over a series of games the first aim is to win the most games. In the event of a tie in the number of games won, the point difference over the set of games decides the winner.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/>    Othello<br/><br/>",

Create a heroic identity, form a superhero team and then battle the worlds super-villains and save the earth.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a superhero, fighting for truth and justice as part of a superhero team made up of the other player&rsquo;s superheroes. Your team must foil the diabolical plots of a series of nefarious super-villains and in doing so the superheroes will receive victory points based on their contribution towards defeating each super-villain. At the end of the game the superhero with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>As you will see, the superheroes must work together to defeat each super-villain, otherwise the villain will win and all of the players will lose! However, once all of the super-villains are defeated, only one of the superheroes can win the game.  Collecting victory points calls for playing the right card at the right time, so you will need to think very carefully about which cards to use each round and how to use your superpowers in order to score as many points as possible. On the other hand, being too selfish in the use of your cards and superpowers may result in a super-villain being able to carry out their diabolical plot, and if that happens everyone will lose the game. It&rsquo;s a dreadful dilemma make no mistake &ndash; but then nobody said being a superhero was going to be easy!<br/><br/>Compete over 3-5 story arcs to be the most heroic Superhero and earn the adulation of the public.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1836 is a railway operations and share trading board game in the 18xx series. Set in a 10 x 10 mile area of the West Riding area of England that had a staggering number of very small railway companies called &quot;short lines&quot;, each of which competed very aggressively across duplicative routes.<br/><br/>The core features of the game:<br/><br/>- Highly dynamic track &ndash; There are a relatively high number of named locations that can be laid / upgraded in a variety of competitive ways to ensure that the map develops differently each game.<br/><br/>- Evolving trains &ndash; Each train type evolves as it is bought; e.g. there are 2* 2+1, 2* 2+2 then 1* 2X (think of it as a mini diesel that can count two cities and infinite towns). The 2+1 is rusted by the first type of four (4+2), 2+2 by the second (4+3) and so on.<br/><br/>- Staged Minor Companies &ndash; Minors are available throughout the game, 18 are shuffled and 4 are available in each of phases 2, 3 and 4 (all 12 available privates are visible from the start). Minors convey a benefit (control over a hex, cheaper track etc) and about half are railway companies that can be absorbed along with a &quot;free&quot; train that can be run immediately.<br/><br/>- Loans with Variable Interest Rate &ndash; When a Minor is absorbed by a Major Company it inherits the Minor's liabilities. Loans suppress stock price making stock jumps easier but the interest rate increases as loans are taken, so a balance must be found.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Sip and Strip is an exciting game designed for swinging adults of all ages&quot; -- so says the instruction booklet that comes from the game.<br/><br/>This is a Frank Bresee game, similar to nearly everything else he made, it includes a Monopoly-like board, drinks, and this time stripping.  The game includes a routine board, &quot;sip&quot; cards and &quot;strip&quot; cards (standing in for Community Chest and Chance).  The game can be played by two to six players or even more if you want to play with couples as teams.<br/><br/>The roll of the dice moves your pieces around the board and you are required to do what the squares tell you to do.  Mostly this involves taking sips of a beverage, sometimes taking a Sip or Strip card.  Some of the Sip cards direct personal action like &quot;take a sip and kiss any player&quot; and other cards require all participants to take an action, usually involving another sip of a beverage.<br/><br/>Each complete round of the board includes more Sip cards and more Strip cards requiring you to remove a piece of clothing.  The game proceeds until the sips catch up with you (which is the point of Bresee's more notorious game &quot;Pass Out&quot;) or until everyone has removed all articles of clothing.  The game suggests the last player to remove the last article of clothing is the winner, but local rules may suggest other winners may be declared.<br/><br/>The length of the game depends greatly on potency of beverages, how many articles of clothes players are wearing, and natural distractions that arise from game situations.  Unless all participants are really committed, the games can easily break up from prudishness or embarrassment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TradeOff is the game of stock market supremacy. It pits two to six players against each other in one simple challenge - to make the most money on the stock market so as to out-bid each other for luxury items. However the stock market is volatile and unpredictable. Take-over bids, profit warnings, insider trading and much more, all contribute to make TradeOff an exciting and strategic roller-coaster ride from beginning to end.<br/><br/>HOW IT WORKS: The mat acts as the stock market and consists of four stocks. During the course of the game each stock's value independently rises and falls as dictated by the cards that players collect. Players can predict these rises and falls by studying their own cards and watching how their opponents are investing.<br/><br/>Making an investment is easy. Players select a stock they think will rise in value and simply place a number of their chips on the mat next to the stock's share price marker. Profit and losses are easily calculated by either using the numbers printed on the mat or by using the free app available on our website. But it's not only the cards that determine how the stock's values will change. When players invest in, or sell an investment, the stock's value rises or falls accordingly. This gives players the chance to be nasty to each other by reducing the value of their opponents investments!<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game auctions are held for luxury items. During these auctions players must out-bid each other to secure the purchase of the item. The first player to obtain the requisite number of luxury items wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1945 is an easy to learn, fun to play strategic card game of world conquest for 2-6 people. Players collect armed forces cards and use them to conquer territories. Battles can be changed dramatically by special action cards that have a variety of effects, from helping your troops to bombing your enemies to smithereens. Ultimately, whoever gathers enough points by conquering territories and collecting victory point cards is declared the winner!<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards from the deck. When a territory is drawn, all the players join in to battle for it. The player who drew it declares a Theater of War -- Air, Land, or Sea -- and players deploy troops from their hands face down to hide their strength. (Individual troop cards range in strength from 1 to 5, so while other players can see how many cards you've laid down, they don't know how strong your forces are.)<br/><br/>Players can also play special cards, which increase the strength of one's forces, allow one to see other players' cards, let a player play a card from the discard pile, drop an A-Bomb on a territory to remove it from play altogether, or various other effects. When all players have committed as many forces they wish, all of the cards are revealed, special cards are resolved, and the player with the strongest remaining forces wins the territory.<br/><br/>The number of Victory Points required to win the game varies with the number of players participating. One gains a Victory Point for each territory held, as well as for each Victory Point card held in one's hand. The first player to accumulate the required number of Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In the case of a tie, the pigeon will choose the largest estate.<br/>     If the estate can't be extended, the pigeon flies to the next one (or stays on the pond if there is none).<br/><br/><br/>This procedure is repeated at the end of each turn of the player who has placed the pond.<br/><br/>During final scoring, whenever possible, the squares of this card are taken into account and considered like squares from the estate.<br/><br/>Source: The Pond rules insert.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher: <br/><br/>        In late 3067, the Word of Blake unleashed its Jihad, fanning the flames of violence and spreading it across the Inner Sphere. Three mercenary commands struggled to find their footing and profit from the all-encompassing warfare. As they navigated their way through the conflicts erupting on hundreds of worlds, these mercenaries grew in power, prestige, and character. Facing adversity, victory, defeat, and enemies within and without, they were typical of many commands touched &mdash; for ill or for good&mdash;by the Jihad. As the Jihad unfolded through the Jihad Hot Spots plotbooks, players were introduced to the Chaos Campaign, a new game play system that gave players the opportunity to craft their own games around specific battles and events of the Jihad. Now that campaign, spanning fourteen years of conflict, has been collected and updated. Presented here are all of the Chaos Campaign tracks from the Hot Spots plotbooks and interwoven with select tracks from the Jihad Turning Points e-publication series and several all-new tracks and mini-campaigns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        This volume also includes detailed reports on nearly forty planetary campaigns, providing context and details previously clouded by interstellar media, local reports, and personal journals. With an updated and streamlined core ruleset for the Chaos Campaign and new Jihad era Random Availability Tables for the Word of Blake, Mercenaries, and Militias, this book has everything players and gamemasters need to recreate the pivotal campaigns of the Jihad and lead their forces to victory.<br/><br/><br/>The Total Chaos expansion for BattleTech provides dozens of scenarios for BattleTech games set within the timeframe of the Jihad; in addition to collecting together those already published within various of the Jihad sourcebooks, Total Chaos adds more than 60 completely new tracks, all of which can be fought as one-off games or which can be linked together to provide long-running campaigns for groups of players.<br/><br/>",

Two hundred years after the Age of War, all of mankind now lived, united, under one flag: the Star League. Defending and policing this vast realm nearly 3,000 worlds strong was the largest army ever known to humanity: the Star League Defense Force. Harnessing the largest fleet of WarShips ever assembled, the most advanced technologies in BattleMech and aerospace design, and the finest, most disciplined training regimens in known space, the SLDF was the invincible might that kept the feuding Houses of the Inner Sphere in line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Field Manual: SLDF describes the single greatest military force the Inner Sphere has ever seen: the Star League Defense Force. Including a brief history and overview of the SLDF, its formation, organization, and training programs, this book provides the most detailed look ever at the army that protected the Inner Sphere before the treachery of Stefan Amaris and the Succession Wars that soon followed. Special rules are also included, enabling players to create Star League forces for use in campaigns set in one of BattleTech's most storied eras.<br/><br/><br/>The Field Manual: SLDF supplement for BattleTech provides details of the organization of the Star League Defense Force at the height of the Star League, providing descriptions on many of the major and minor units as well as optional rules to reflect the character and capabilities of those units, details of unit deployment and locations and other aspects of the SLDF to allow players to stage games and campaigns to be fought during this era.<br/><br/>",

It is a 'modern' war in that the majority of the weapons will be used to usher in the First World War. Yet on the other hand it is one of the last black powder wars of the 19th Century. As this war did not last long enough to evolve tactics of its own, and was in many ways a rerun of the American Civil War in regard to the American Army, they decided to treat it as the end point of the Volley, Bayonet, &amp; Glory rules, and offer a two volume supplement for those rules as part of this booklet.<br/><br/>Volume Two Contains:<br/><br/>    A Miniatures Campaign for Western Cuba<br/>    The Uniforms of the Spanish Army<br/>    The Uniforms of the American Army<br/>    The Uniforms of the Cuban Army<br/>    Volley, Bayonet, &amp; Glory for the Spanish American War<br/>    Las Guasimas &amp; El Caney Scenario's &amp; Orders of Battle for Volley, Bayonet, &amp; Glory<br/><br/><br/>",

Each move can be 1 of 3 types:<br/><br/><br/>     to an adjacent empty space.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     jumping over an enemy piece of the same type to an empty space on the other side of the jumped piece.(Note: After the jump the piece doing the jumping becomes immobile during the current turn and the remaining moves are divided to other pieces.) Please reference the section entitled Jumping in the Rules PDF.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     moving a lord onto an adjacent vassal, pinning it.<br/><br/><br/>Friendly lords may Pin an enemy vassal or a friendly one by moving onto them, also that same lord during a turn may not move onto another vassal until he unpins the current one. Pinned vassals are unable to move until they are unpinned and a lord unpins a vassal by moving onto an empty adjacent space. (Note: when a lord unpins a vassal the lord doing the unpinning becomes immobile during the current turn and the remaining moves are divided to other pieces.)

The Russian defenses are caught off guard and must organize quickly to make a stand and proudly defend the Mother Land. Many brave soldiers must answer the call to duty, and many will pay with their lives before either side may claim&hellip; victory.<br/><br/>Operation: Barbarossa recreates this epic battle using a turn-based, area-movement and capture system similar to Axis &amp; Allies. This game does however, use its own unit types, combat rules, D12 combat system, and victory system.<br/><br/>As the German player, you have a set length of time to capture key Russian cities to cripple their production. As Russia, you must find a way to hold out long enough to turn back the advancing Nazis.<br/><br/>",

Scramble is designed for recreating World War II air combat using Tumbling Dice's 1/600th scale aircraft models.<br/><br/>The games are designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.<br/><br/>Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.<br/><br/>Each model represents an individual aircraft or balloon. Elevation is abstracted using 4 levels, and the game uses D6 and D3 (a d6 numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3) for combat resolution.<br/><br/>",

This campaign game lets players recreate, in detail, the fighting of various great battles. Players take up the part of both the overall commanders, choosing which units will reinforce the initial troops, as well as the local commanders, fighting it out for each objective of the campaign. Players use a 'purchase' method to select troops for the first Scenario for the campaign. They set up their troops, determine who will attack and defend in that action then play that Scenario. The end of the Scenario brings the players to the Reorganization Phase, where they resolve the location of the front lines, determine the fate of disorganized and damaged units, and then purchase new units for the next Scenario.<br/><br/>PL 3.0 aims to provide a concise, enjoyable campaign experience, playable by the average gamer over a couple of evenings. Critical Hit regularly releases new CG's for use with Platoon Leader. The latest version of PL is available at Critical Hit as a free download. This new version supersedes versions 1.0 and 2.0 and all errata. PL 3.0 remains compatible with all previously-released campaigns.<br/><br/>",

Parker, is played by 2, 3, or 4 players on an 18x18 board of interconnected circles, with the 26 circles in each of four corners replaced with art.  Each side of the board then features 38 circles with a background of green, red, blue, or yellow, with the 12 circles nearest the outer edge highlighted.  Circles in the middle of the board and between each colored side have a white background, known as Danger Territory.  Players begin with their pieces (green, red, blue, or yellow) on the highlighted circles nearest them on the appropriately colored parts of the board.  Players then take turns moving their pieces in an attempt to get three of them to the highlighted circles on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>Player movements are very similar to Chinese Checkers, with the exception that while in the white area, pieces jumped are removed from the board rather than being left in place.  Some later versions of Telka include rules for playing Chinese Checkers (a.k.a. Peg Chow in some editions) on the Telka board, but these differ from the more commonly known versions of Chinese Checkers (including those published by Parker Brothers) by virtue of the different board and number of pieces.<br/><br/>",

They defend their islands against their enemies (other goblin tribes and races) with their flying craft.<br/><br/>Each player have at least one flying vehicle crewed by a number of characters (mainly goblins), through there are rules for actions on the ground.  Each turn Characters must crew their craft, but those who not crewing can perform other actions like entering combat or shooting at their enemies.<br/><br/>The rules are background based so a scenario will need to be devised before play with victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules suggest miniature scale is 25/28mm (Through I can see that 15mm could be used) and a number of six sided and one eight sided dice are needed.<br/><br/>The Fall of the Goblin Empire was published in the Ragnarok magazine, issue 59, which won the 2011 SFSFW rules writing competition on fantasy air wargamming.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Smile and Like It is a family-friendly card game for 3 - 8 players with a unique twist.  On your turn, play a card and do what it says, simple as that.  Generally the card will instruct you to claim chips (some face up, some face down, all of which have smiley faces of differing levels of happiness on one side) from the center pot, trade chips you've already collected with other players, and so on.<br/><br/>Here's the twist: you don't automatically get to draw a card at the end of your turn.  Instead, you have to claim a special &quot;draw&quot; chip (differently colored than all the other chips in the pot) and have it remain in your score pile until your next turn, at which point you can replenish your hand of cards... but that's all you can do on that turn.  Of course, there aren't enough draw chips in the pot for everyone.<br/><br/>So the tension builds: how long do you dare wait to take the draw chip?  If you run out of cards, you lose chips from your pot to the players seated on either side of you... but if you happen to have a draw chip in your score pile at the end of the game, you take a massive penalty to your final score.<br/><br/>The game comes with three unique methods of scoring right in the box.  One scoring system simply gives more points for happier smiley faces (very family friendly), one scores points for sets of different types of smileys (a bit more strategic, but still family friendly), and one uses patterns of smileys printed right on the cards, giving the players another option on how to play a card: playing it as a scoring card by spending the specific pattern of smileys in the score pile (introducing a hand management aspect to the game suitable for more hardcore gamers).<br/><br/>All in all, Smile and Like It is a game that is simple to learn and play, and yet difficult to master in any of its incarnations, making it a game you'll come back to again and again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player plays one of three alien races that have landed in a tiny Appalachian village. The object of the game is to kidnap as many humans as possible for &ldquo;research&rdquo; and get them back to the saucers. As a representative of a race of &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;, you want your group of aliens to get more victims back into the saucer than the others!<br/><br/>Designed as an introduction to miniatures gaming for new players, R&amp;R uses the basic principles of miniature gaming in an easy to digest, simple form.  The alien figures move by a ruler (but can teleport over the entire board) and engage the human figures by appearing in front of them or making contact. A deck of reaction cards drive the human quarry without the need for a referee and generate much of the humor.<br/><br/>The game premiered at PentaCon in 1998 as a non-threating, humor game for the non-grognard attendees.  It became a hit and was played there and at a few other regional conventions.  A PDF of the basic rules , the deck of reaction cards and a primer on making your own version were freely distributed.  A play-at-home version was offered in 2005 at PentaCon through the R&amp;R/GuffeyConRevue booth.  The production version of the game came in a plastic clamshell containing cardstock figures and buildings. It also included a single  d6, d10, d12 and custom scatter die used for teleporting. In May 2011, a generous review of the game was offered in the Lost Game Safari column of the 'Knights of the Dinner Table' (issue 175) by Andy Miller.<br/><br/>",

It is to be played with a 37-hex-hex board and a XATS set.<br/><br/>Your score is the product of the numbers of your pieces in contiguous groups (as in OMEGA), minus the number of points (i.e. the tips) on your pieces you haven&rsquo;t played.  Maximize your score!  The solitaire rules are the same, except that all same-colored contiguous groups are factors in your score, and all colors' leftover points penalize you.<br/><br/>On your turn, place one of your pieces on the board according to the following rules:<br/><br/>     Pieces are not allowed to point at their own color in an adjacent space!<br/>     No two adjacent pieces are allowed to point at each other!<br/>     You must place it in a space already pointed to by an adjacent piece belonging to an opponent.<br/>     It is not allowed to point out of the edge of the board.  If there is no valid play for you, you simply pass your turn.  If all players pass consecutively, the game is over.<br/><br/><br/>",

Players choose vehicles, crew, and components and engage each other in high-speed scenarios on the road.<br/><br/>Physical components include a road (easy to make your own), vehicles (modified Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars work fine), dice, measuring sticks, record sheets for vehicles, and counters for crew and equipment (downloadable for free).<br/><br/>Players choose a scenario and purchase vehicles as described by the scenario.  Most scenarios pit one player (or team of players) against another, with different win conditions depending on the scenario.<br/><br/>Unlike many vehicle games that rely on arena combat, Road Wolf follows vehicles traveling down a long, dangerous road. Movement is relative to the other vehicles, as all vehicles are assumed to be hurtling forward down the road, represented by a &quot;road&quot; move at the end of each turn.  Hazards such as bridges or debris can move &quot;towards&quot; the vehicles during the road move, as can immobilized vehicles.<br/><br/>Each turn, vehicles get two actions to spend moving, shooting, or other actions. Vehicles may Ram or Melee each other as part of a move action, encouraging close combat.  Degrees of success can damage or destroy vehicles or crew, or cause wipeout checks that can lead to lost ground or even chain reaction crashes.<br/><br/>",

Six sided dice are used for combat randomization and modified according to a unit's type and morale.<br/><br/>The rules were originally written for use with 20mm/25mm figures, however the game is easily scaled to 15mm (and even 6mm or 2mm).<br/><br/>Appendices include army lists and values (so that custom armies can be created), suggested reading and viewing lists, and sources of miniature figures (several of which are still valid 30 years later).<br/><br/>",

As the wisdom of the few remaining spirit talkers fell to the blood lust that consumes the race, the Runes and Bones once used to guide the strategy of the warriors now serve only to entertain them. What once was an honored system of divination, now serves as a campfire game for Orcish warriors everywhere.<br/><br/>From the Creator:<br/>Runes and Bones was created in the summer of 2006 as I was preparing for a 10 day trip to meet up with my Orcish horde for Ragnarok XXI.  Ragnorok is the most popular annual event for Dagorhir Battle Games Association.  It is a week of camping, characterization, and warfare.  I wanted something that felt tribal and could accommodate many players, thus, Runes and Bones was born.  I have created many sets since then for other camping trips and cons.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>When playing Runes and Bones you go around the circle and bid bones in exchange for runes from the bag, which you then play to attempt to win the pot.  Runes have a variety of characteristics which determine which runes they beat and vice-versa.  You are also able to barter runes and/or bones from other players on your turn.  If, on your turn, the rune you played last turn is still the winning rune, you win the pot.<br/><br/>",

It is an experience based on the unconscious perceptions of the oniric mind.<br/><br/>In &Aacute;lmok, the players are in deep sleep, trying to collect parts of their dreams to scape an eternal nightmare. Use your memory, find your way to the wakening, tap in sleeping powers of the unconscious mind, be the first to get free from your dreams.<br/><br/>&Aacute;lmok uses the classic Memory Game mechanic with some twists to make the game more dynamic and enjoyable. In your turn, you turn cards face up and check if they are a group, like the classic game, but here, the groups must have 3 cards, but you can combine then using their color or their number, much like a rummy game. Each group you form, give you points and also a special dream ability that you can use later to gain even more points or save for bonus points in the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player who reaches a certain amount of points first (based on the number of players), is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Donelson Breakout covers the Confederate attempt to escape from Grant's siege of Fort Donelson. It uses the Age of Rifles system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of ACW battles. Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!). To win, you have to use your army like a 19th century commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go. How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.<br/><br/>The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of pre-industiral command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are available for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire. Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/>400m per hex<br/>1 hour per turn<br/>brigade level units<br/>Individual army and division commanders<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dating is hard in the 14th century, and as a matchmaker, business is slim. The plague has most folks too afraid to leave their homes, let alone go out looking for romance. Literacy is very low, so the letters you receive from clients are oftten difficult to make out. To make matters worse, you're not the only match-maker in town.<br/><br/>To come out on top of your rival matchmakers you will have to go with what little information you can decipher and find matches for your clients. At times it will be in your best interest you to work with your opponents, at others it will benefit you to set devious traps for them.<br/><br/>Love is in the air! But so is the plague...<br/><br/>In Black Plague Blind Date, players take turns choosing a card from their hands to play face down as a &quot;blind date&quot;. They then must truthfully describe their card with 1-3 colored &quot;info cubes&quot; (blue = male, pink = female, black = infected, white = healthy, green = high class, brown = low class). Cards change hands during the exchange phase, then each player plays a second card face up next to any blind date. Blind dates are revealed and reputation points are scored based upon the best/worst dates. Matching two healthy townsfolk or two plague-ridden citizens will earn you points, but don't accidentally cross the two and spread the plague! The game is played over 4 &quot;seasons&quot; (rounds) with each season affecting scoring in a significant way. It's a quick-playing game of deduction and bluffing for 3-4 players.<br/><br/>Full rules are available under the Files section of this entry.<br/><br/><br/>    Black Plague Blind Date won the February 2013 Boardroomers Game Design Contest in the 3+ Players category. Entrants in the contest were limited to using no more than 20 standard playing cards and 10 cubes.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Our ancestors invented a way to reduce the craving for playing football during the cold winter months. It was the year 1900. The game was coined &ldquo;Gombfoci&rdquo;, a rather self-explanatory term, which describes a game played with buttons from coats upon a kitchen table. It spread like wildfire and soon came to be well known in such far off lands as Spain, USA or Brazil. These people changed the rules and by this created a new game called &ldquo;12 Touches&rdquo;, which later became an even greater success than its predecessor. (Geraldo Cardoso D&eacute;court&rsquo;s, in 1928).<br/><br/>This game simulates football, the board it is a small football field and both players control a team of disks (or rings), and move them by flicking or pressing their edges, in order to hit a smaller disc (the ball) with them. The players need to score   by moving the ball into the goal. <br/>A match takes 20 minutes divided in 2 halves of 10 minutes each.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, only the sector ball rule will change this. A turn normally consists of moving one of your buttons. The buttons have to slide on the table, but not by pushing or pulling. They can be moved by flicking or by pressing by the finger. The buttons cannot be lifted up and put elsewhere, only after goals and before goal-kicks, free kicks, penalties or corner kicks.<br/><br/>Sectorball actually means a valid pass in the football game. If you move a button and the ball stops close enough (maximum one button size) to another button controlled by you, then you get another turn.<br/><br/>The game is also suitable for solo play. The player then controls both sides. In this can be simulating whole world championships.<br/><br/>Players can play single matches, tournament based matches, league or swiss system.<br/><br/>We are moving the two games in one box. Same board game, two approaches. East meets West on the same &quot;soccer pitch&quot;: Sector Ball Table Football vs. 12 Touches Brazilian.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Islands have been devastated by a huge natural disaster. It has ripped buildings apart, thrown debris far and wide, and endangered the lives of the Island&rsquo;s inhabitants. As the danger subsides survivors are gradually emerging from the rubble and signalling for help.<br/><br/>You can choose. Will you be a team of willing rescuers on a helicopter, a UFO looking for specimens or a hungry dragon looking for easy meals? Either way players score points by collecting the survivors as quickly as they can but are restricted in their flight patterns by the local air currents.<br/><br/>The board consists of a grid of 9 tiles, representing the islands, each with only 2 arrows on to indicate legal moves off of the tile. As the survivors are randomly generated each turn players must try to negotiate their way to them using 2 moves, no more, no less. If they fail to pick anyone up in a turn then they can claim a chaos card that can allow them in a future turn to twist, swap, or twist and swap islands around to make their path easier and/or to foil the plans of the other player.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of only having to negotiate 9 tiles - this is a game often demanding some pretty involved thinking out.<br/><br/>The advanced solo option keeps the pressure on by introducing dangers to your survivors such as storms, fire, and disease.<br/><br/>",

The board is divided into 5 zones forming from the bottom The relegation zone, danger zone, mid table, and European places.

No, it is not a computer game where you pretend to make bicycle kicks, backheel passes, fantastic dribbles, terrific shots, and remarkable saves. It is not a game where the player with the best hand-eye coordination wins.<br/>It is, rather, a football board game where knowledge of football strategy, tactics, and formations is more important than the ability to quickly punch a button or move a lever.<br/>Why pretend you&rsquo;re something you&rsquo;re not? You&rsquo;re not a football superstar and a computer will not make you one.<br/>Why not play a football simulation game where your brain controls movement and play rather than some software program? You don&rsquo;t have the physical abilities of the great players but you may have more overall, intrinsic knowledge of the game they play.<br/>El f&uacute;tbol en casa is a chess-like game of strategy and tactics where, in addition to good and bad fortune (always present in any sporting event), knowledge and skill determine the winner.<br/>You are not a player or a coach. You are the team. You pick the formation. You move the players on your team and pass the ball. You make the tackling challenges and take the shots on goal. You commit fouls, suffer injuries, and get carded. You win. You lose. In short, you experience what a football team experiences.<br/>This is an accurate, well-researched, mathematical representation of association football. All 17 Laws of the Game are incorporated in the play.<br/>In addition to the Basic Game that pits two teams of equal strength against one another, a Tournament Play booklet is included that describes how teams of different strengths can play each other. (You could, for example, play all the games of the World Cup Finals.)<br/>This all-wood game is recommended for players 13 years of age and up. Knowledge of football is helpful but not necessary. Also, many materials are included to individualize your game. (If, for example, you don&rsquo;t like the color of your team&rsquo;s kits or jerseys, you can make your own.)<br/>  <br/>(Designer's explanation)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each year the Kansas City ASL club hosts the March Madness ASL tournament and the club releases a themed scenario pack at the tournament.<br/><br/>In 2013 the theme is Commissars. The Commisar pack features eight scenarios in which the Soviet player can have commissars (rule A25.22).<br/><br/>All eight scenarios in the Commissar Pack are predominantly  larger scenarios; the pack has four large scenarios (over 50 squads engaged), three medimum scenarios (over 25 squads engaged) and one small (less than 25 squads engaged). The scenarios have frequent use of fortifications, unique terrain and environmental conditions. The Pack has seven scenarios with fortifications, two night scenarios, two with extreme winter rules, one amphibious landing and all eight have water hexes (although two are ice rules). The scenarios are:<br/><br/>MM25 Futile Bravery. This scenario takes place during the battle for Smolensk in July 1941. It is a large scenario with the Soviets attacking and Germans defending in an urban environment. The Germans are defending a bridge (Russians win immediately when they control any location). The Russian start on both sides of the river and are reinforced by massive numbers (25 squads) of conscripts stiffined by NKVD troops and commissars. There are also two platoons of T-26 tanks. With these number the Russians can (and likely will) launch human wave attacks. One play test saw no less than six different HW attacks by the Russian player. The Germans defent with Good infantry well equiped with MGs and well led. They also get a radio and 105mm OBA. And a few mobile HTs one with an 81mm MTR. The Germans get a platoon of reinforcing tanks. There is a great deal of rubble in this scenario because of the scorch earth activity of the NKVD and more is in the making. The scenario uses Board 60, with its hills and city environment, Board 8 without the hills and most building are rubble and board 23 with the canal as a large railroad embankment. The Germans must used the mobility of the HTs to reinforce where the main attack falls and have the OBA spotter in the right place.<br/><br/>MM26 Gallant Mogilev. This also takes place in July 1941. It is a medium sized engagement between the attacking Germans and defending Russian. The Germans must break through the fortified Russian positions and capture a bridge. The Russians must defend tenaciously. It uses board 64 to represent the suburban outskirts of the city and board 65 with the river overlay. The Russians receive fortifications including fortified buildings, roadblocks, trenches, wire and mines. Plus two immoble tanks. The Germans get good troops, good leaders, an infantry gun and OBA.<br/><br/>MM27 Odessa Madness. This is a large scenario where the Germans must help the Romanians take a fortified villiage strongpoint. The Russians get strong forces with fortifications including pillboxes, fortified buildings, tunnels, trenches, wire, foxholes and mines. The Germans get assult engineers, sappers and OBA...along with Romanians. The battle takes mostly on board 12 with the gullies actually as AT ditches.<br/><br/>MM28 Sonderkommando Benesch. This small scenario has five Brandenburg squads trying to move past a pillbox and Rusiian defenders to exit. It uses board 7 and 40 to creat a constricted peninsula. Giving the Russians opportunity to make the Germans attack the pillbox.<br/><br/>MM29 Sorve Point. This medimum scenarios has the Germans making an attack against a fortified Russian psoitions. The battle is to capture the level two hill hexes of board 61 with limited mobility of using the seashore on one side using board 7 and marsh on the other. The Russians have fortifications of pillboxes, trenches, foxholes, wire and mines. They also have OBA. The Germans have good troops, MGs and leaders with OBA of their own.<br/><br/>MM30 Frozen Vzvad. This is the first night and extreme winter scenario, with 40 attacking Russian squads against 20 German in January 1942. The Germans receive pillboxes, fortified buildings, trenches, wire and mines. The Russsians receive Rocket OBA and the cover of night. The Russians are attacking to capture over 30 buildings on Boards 3, 8 and 7 between the two frozen rivers. The Germans defend the buildings and cannot let the Russians build up a fire base to blast them out.<br/><br/>MM31 Sevastopol by Sea. This night scenario has the Germans landing and taking the high ground against good Russian troops in June 1942. The scenario starts with the Germans almost across board 8 and landing. However they must get past the Russian sentries and capture the crest of the board 58 hill. The Russian have high morale naval infantry. The Germans have the cover of night in this medimum size scenario.<br/><br/>MM 32 Winter Forest. This scenario has extreme winter in December 1942 with the Germans attacking Partisans to capture the Partisan camp bunkers. The Partisans outnumber the Germans. However the ski equipped Germans can outrun the Partisans and attack from multiple directions in the forested boards of 34, 37 and 52. With the forests the Partisans start much of the fortification HIP and have wire to slow the Germans. The Germans get OBA and can use a barrage rule to box in the Partisans. A SSR give the Partisans Commissars for extra rally purposes. Just how useful it will with the Germans closing in form all sides remains to be seen.<br/><br/>",

You may move your pawns around a maze of streets, back alleys and even make use of the Underground train system. The three interior tiles have police stations, the nine outside tiles have evidence locations.  The object of this game is to score the most victory points.  Victory points are earned by moving your &quot;police&quot; pawn around the game board to various named evidence locations, acquiring the evidence and returning the evidence to one of three police stations.  When you attempt to find the piece of evidence you decide how valuable it will be, the more valuable the harder it is to find.

When moved adjacent to another players pawn you may pay the &quot;bad&quot; guy to attempt to steal various items from the player (money, tools, or evidence).

        "description": "Le Vol de l'Aigle III (The Flight of the Eagle III) is a wargame that recreates some of the most famous Napleonic campaigns.<br/><br/>The system is a double-blinded system that uses an Umpire. Players can communicate only through written messages. It uses maps of that time and a simple system to manage units. Combats are solved using a face to face system, simple but precise, with the morale as the main endpoint. Combats can also be solved using any existing operational or tactical system including miniatures.<br/><br/>The present volume 3 does not need the volume 1 or 2 to be played. It includes four booklets (three are over 60 pages) including all the rules of volume 1 and 2, a new edition of the tactical rules The Eagle Fights, 50 pages of data to transfer all the armies of the time between both systems, the special rules of the ten campaigns included: Bavaria and Austria 1809, France 1814 and the eight Peninsula campaigns in Spain and Portugal (around one a year between 1808 and 1814). Seven maps and 52 units sheets are included.<br/><br/>Cherry on the cake, an experimental recruitment module is also presented, with a strategic map, two pages of units, and rules managing every parameter involved in the Administration of War.<br/><br/>The game is available in French and in English.<br/><br/>",

The Need cards specify quantities of Fulfilment points you have to collect in order to satisfy your Needs. However, the Motivation card gives your objective for the game. You could be a Dominator, seeking to fulfil your own Needs whilst ensuring other players' Needs are not met. You could be an Idealist, trying to make sure everyone's Needs are fulfilled. You could be a Victim, making sure that everyone's needs are satisfied except yours.<br/><br/>There are 12 different Motivations, each with a game goal with different levels of difficulty and worth different scores. If you achieve your Motivation and you have an &quot;End game&quot; card, you can claim the points. But beware! It's possible that more than one Motivation can be achieved simultaneously, so another player may claim points too.<br/><br/>The Fulfilment cards allow you to satisfy your Needs or the Needs of other players. The Action cards allow players to manipulate the distribution of Fulfilment cards, moving or discarding Fulfilment or even forcing players to change their Motivation.<br/><br/>",

After each round of placement, the new buildings are scored and the next round commences. When the whole city grid is filled in, the game is over and the planner with the most points wins.<br/><br/>As an additional twist, each player has full knowledge of the tiles she'll choose from right at the beginning. Once a player draws her hand of buildings, there are no more draws. She'll have to play all but two of the cards.<br/><br/>The game scales from 2 to 7 players by increasing the size of the city grid and eventually decreasing the number of cards in the hand. For instance, at 2 players, the city will grow to 4x4 and each player will have a hand of 10. At 7, the city is 6x6 and the players have a hand of only 7. Each player gets an equal number of chances to score; sometimes an initial card is played (unscored) to start off the city.<br/><br/>",

But great fortunes such as these always come with great risks, and in this case, it&rsquo;s a massive population of giant insects that inhabit the world. Balance the terror of certain annihilation against the greedy desires of your corporate sponsors to ravage the land of its precious resources as quickly as you can. Time is short for those looking to out produce their competitors on the planet, because the never-ending hordes of terrestrial life don&rsquo;t kill you, your boss just might.<br/><br/>Bug Planet is a tower defence worker placement game where two-to-four players can vie against each other in an attempt to control the production of the planet's valuable resources. The game is broken down into a sequence of phases where:<br/><br/>1.) Giant killer alien bugs are added outside of each player's outpost.<br/><br/>2.) Players take turns adding modules to their outpost (such as new weapons, housing, forcefields, and more, while also collecting resources such as minerals, electricity and export points using a worker placement system.<br/><br/>3.) Players take turns activating the modules in their outpost by spending the electricity they have collected this turn. This is mostly done to power up weapons and try to kill the bugs bearing down on them, but also players may mine additional minerals, perform scientific research or reduce the panic in their base (if they have the right modules).<br/><br/>4.) Come nightfall the bugs are on the move. Any bug that survived the day will get a chance to move closer to the player's outpost. The closer they get the more panic they inspire and the more damage they can possibly deal.<br/><br/>Eventually, once it becomes apparent panic has begun to set in at one or more of the competing outposts, your bosses will pull the plug on the whole operation (by way of orbital nuke, since it's the only way to be sure). Be the player who has best fulfilled your corporate mission objectives to be posthumously declared the winner, your spouse will be sent a tasteful plaque!<br/><br/>",

Dealer also places the next 6 cards from the deck face down near the playing field. These are bonus cards and are drawn from if the instructions on the directive card for that turn say to dra2 a bonus card.<br/><br/>Player to the right of dealer starts play and rolls dice to determine which numbered space to advance to and which corresponding &quot;directive card&quot; instructions are to be followed for that turn. Any directive card that says it is to be held by a player is removed from the playing field when the player lands on that space. Any player landing at a space with no directive card next to it does nothing more for that turn. After each person has played, an &quot;administration&quot; is completed, and a new &quot;administration&quot; starts.<br/><br/>Object of game: players roll dice, take cards, follow directions and compete to be the first to declare bankruptcy by spending all their money and earn the title &quot;Certified deficit spender&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pong Tactics is a strategy card game that adds new gameplay mechanics to the classic drinking game beer pong. 10 cups are set up on either side of an 8 foot table. One Formation card is selected to determine the formation of the 10 cups on both sides of the table and then the cards are set aside. Cups may be filled with water or beer (if players are of legal drinking age). The remainder of the game is Action Cards. These cards impact the normal beer pong rules in various ways, such as changing the shot, number of shots, cards in hand, blocking shots, determining the end of the game and much more. The game is played by teams of two players on each side of the table. Each player on a team takes one shot at the cups on the other side of the table; if they make the ball into a cup, it is removed and the player takes a drink either from their own drink or the cup. The goal is to remove all of your opponent's cups by making all the shots. The Action Cards can aid your team or hinder your opponent in achieving the end game goal.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stations Manned and Ready II is a downloadable set of tactical naval miniatures rules for ship models of 1/2400 or 1/6000 scale (though other scales can be accommodated).  Like the first edition of the rules, these rules are set at a squadron level, allowing relatively large battles to be fought on a normal table in 2 to 4 hours. In the 2nd Edition all the separate parts that were in the 1st Edition have been combined and the combat system revised in order that it follows a consistent structure.<br/><br/>The period covered by the rules has been backdated to ca. 1885, and the data sets available expanded even further than before. The data in the system is compatible throughout so ships from all periods could be matched against each other, though this may not be recommended.<br/><br/>Ship data is presented in sets for nations and time eras. The data sheets are fully prepared for you, so there is no need to fill out separate sheets. The only proviso is that when using smaller vessels you may have print several copies and the names will have to be entered individually by the player. Ships from cruiser upwards all have individual sheets. All data sheets take account of revisions of armament at various times.<br/><br/>Time scales are 6 minutes for a game turn, combat is regulated by the use of 5,000 yard range bands, which provide gun penetration values and torpedo hit modifiers. Armour protection is converted to an armour class on specific areas of the ship, taking account of the armour type and date. Damage represents those hits that cause significant damage to the target, and critical hits cause degradation of the combat effectiveness of ships. Command and crew quality are important and ships are commanded and crewed by men of mixed ability, generated using systems which players will recognise from other A&amp;A titles.<br/><br/>The chance of critical damage is now keyed to the &quot;size of the bang&quot; involved, and the number of guns firing (in the case of ships). More guns means a more chances of causing critical damage, and larger shells/bombs mean a higher chance that critical damage will occur. Higher chances also mean that the damage effects may also be more extensive, because we have expanded the way in which the critical damage system works.<br/><br/>Play follows a sequence using initiative. The winner of initiative chooses which side will move a squadron first. Movement then alternates between the two sides. During Movement the slowest elements finish their movement first, so the order is all submarines, then all ships, finally all aircraft. The winner of initiative then shoots with a squadron first, and then play alternates. Combat actions ignore the type of element involved.<br/><br/>Movement takes into account the manoeuvrability of ships of different sizes. Gunnery takes into account the crew skill of the firing ship, interference by shooting from other vessels, the size of the target and the number of guns firing. Hits will cause structural damage and may also cause critical hits, which will degrade the combat effectiveness of the vessel. As ships get more damaged, there is a possible effect on morale, which may cause formations to withdraw to lick their wounds.<br/><br/>",

The Bavarian chief of staff, Ludwig Freiherr von der Tann, met with the Austrian leadership and suggested that the Bavarian army march into Bohemia. There they would form the left wing of the Austrian North Army, and hold off the Prussian First Army at Jicin while the Austrians dealt with the Prussian Second Army.<br/><br/>Von der Tann&rsquo;s bold plan might well have given the Allies victory, but the Austrian commander, Ludwig von Benedek, turned him down and Bavaria pursued a separate strategy. By the time Benedek changed his mind and called for the Bavarians to advance, it was already too late.<br/><br/>Battles of 1866: German Armies is a downloadable expansion set for Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles. It adds the armies of Bavaria, Hesse-Kassel and Nassau to the game as well as the Prussian Cavalry Corps and First Army artillery reserve. There are two scenarios included: a meeting engagement between the Prussian and German armies and a Prussian assault on a prepared German defense. This module is not playable separately; it requires ownership of Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles.<br/><br/>German Armies is a .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to replicate what Henry Waugh's Universal Baseball Association Game may have looked like from the book, &quot;The Universal Baseball Association Inc. J. Henry Waugh Prop.&quot; by Robert Coover.  This allows you to create your own baseball league where players grow old, become all-stars or simply fade away from the league.  From rookie to retirement you follow their careers and act as commissioner and God of their universe just as Henry Waugh did in the book.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling three six sided dice to simulate a baseball game.  Batters can hit for power, strike out, walk, etc. based on their roll.  The unique thing about this game is if you play a full season the rules have you &quot;re-rate&quot; players based on their seasonal performance to continue play to the next season.  This way, you create a living, breathing baseball universe with your own champions, hall of famers, and heros!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Piles is played using a standard 52 card deck, by four players in teams of two. Team members are opposite each other. The dealer deals out 10 cards for each player, one by one; the remaining 12 cards are placed in the middle of the desk, arranged in a 4x3 rectangle called &ldquo;Castle&rdquo;. The player left to the dealer starts play placing one card on the Castle; the others will follow in clockwise order. The color (red or black) of the first card played by the opener assigns the color of each team for that game: e.g., if the opener chooses to play a 3 of Hearts, he and his partner will be the Reds, and the other team the Blacks. Goal of the Reds is to score points by capturing black cards, and vice versa for the Blacks. Cards are to be placed on the Castle, on top of those already on the desk, forming piles controlled by the card on top of it. Each card has an intrinsic value that follows the natural order, starting from the Ace (1) up to the King (13). In the Castle, each card can have from 2 up to 4 neighbors, i.e. cards adjacent either horizontally or vertically. The total value of a card on the Castle is equal to its intrinsic value increased by 1 for each neighbor of the same color and decreased by 1 for each of the opposite: e.g. a red 10 having 3 red and 1 black neighbors, will have a total value equal to the intrinsic value of a Queen.<br/><br/>Rules of the game:<br/>1 - it's alway allowed to place on top of a card another card of the same color<br/>2- a card of the opposite color can be placed, changing the control of the pile, if the card to be placed has an intrinsic value higher than the total value of the card on top of that pile<br/>3- a player can pass the turn. In that case, the opponent at his left will pick at random one of his cards. That card will be added to the piles picked up at the end of the game, possibly contributing to the score.<br/><br/>End of the game and scoring:<br/>A game is over after 10 turns, when the players run out of cards. Each team picks up the piles topped by the cards of their color: all the cards of the opposite color inside the controlled piles are captured and used for the final score. In the final scoring, an Ace is worth 9 points, a King 4, a Queen 3, a Jack 2 and the remaing cards 1 point each. The Red team will sum up the values of the captured black cards, and the other way around for the Blacks.<br/><br/>Two players game:<br/>The game can also be played by two players, under the same rules. In that case, when the two players run out of the first 10 cards, the dealer will deal out the remaing and the game will go on as usual.<br/><br/>",

Players draw, manage, and place land cards in patterns according to their type. In addition to placing land cards players must also place five kingdom tokens on the land cards in order to create point scoring realms.<br/><br/>There are six different land cards: deserts, forests, hills, lakes, mountains, and swamps. Each land type is placed in a particular pattern and scored in its own fashion. Lakes are the only land cards that cannot be claimed by a kingdom token to score points.<br/><br/>In basic gameplay the kingdom tokens do not have any special value causing only the claimed land cards to be scored at the games end. During advanced play each of the players five kingdom tokens has a special ability that can effect kingdom token and land card placement or scoring. The five advanced kingdoms are cloud, fire, gold, iron, and water.<br/><br/>5 Kindgoms does not require a playing board or score counter and is limited only by the flat surface it is played on.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>96 tile cards (16 cards of each land type)<br/>25 double sided kingdom tokens<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rawen's land has been a place of war for hundreds of years. Twelve empires, twelve powerful gods &mdash; all longing for the same thing: limitless might.<br/><br/>Everything started with a Cataclysm and the appearance of the New Ones, who ruthlessly squelched the Old Ones &mdash; except for those who escaped into other planes of existence, specifically four parts of the world that managed to survive the catastrophe: the Big Continent, also known as Askalar where most of the empires lay; to the North, Iceland, the Isle of the Mages; in the south, Fireland, the home of Demons; and in Oceania, Bale, the Life Tree's territory.<br/><br/>The fight has not ended after the New Ones victory. The balance of forces varies, and it takes only a little to break the fragile balance. Fellowships are made, then breached in moments, but the stakes are much bigger than the power over Rawen. The New Ones fight not just for victory; they are seeking themselves. A secret part of their essence, which they can hardly remember. They were born on another world, which they gave up in exchange for survival. In the depths of their minds, a name pulsates about which neither their new dependents nor The Old Ones might know: Earth. The War of the Gods started in the far past of Rawen, but it affects the future of the whole universe.<br/><br/>In the Rawen Trading Card Game, the Gods of Rawen wield their power through their Warlords. As they expand their territories, the armies of the opposing Gods frequently battle one another. Your goal is to defeat the enemy warlord with the help of fighting units, heroes, and summoned spells. Successful attacks by your army weaken your enemies, and thus weaken their God, too. If the enemy warlord ever has as many wounds as health points, the warlord dies and you win the battle.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player chooses a warlord and a class, then creates a deck of at least 45 cards, with the warlord card, class card and primeval energy cards not counting toward this total. The game is turn-based, and in the main phase of your turn, you may act in any order, placing cards from your hand onto the battlefield, attacking with your units, activating a special power, and so on.<br/><br/>",

The Oracle promises eternal life to the species that possesses it. The object of the game is to find the Oracle and hold it until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players journey from planet to planet searching for useful items to aid them in their quest.<br/>They will engage other players with diplomacy cards as well as facing them in player versus player combat.<br/>Different weapon types include energy, physical, mental, fire, sound, and acid.<br/>One on one combat starts at long range. If neither player has died combat progresses to medium and then short range.<br/>Expect to be destroyed. There is no player elimination. Another agent of the species steps in to take the place of the deceased character.<br/><br/>There is a lot of variation in the initial setup. Replayability is built into the design.<br/>After the Oracle is discovered, the universe begins to deteriorate. Planets start disappearing.<br/>Resources become scarce and combatants are pushed together.<br/><br/>Oracle is an exciting fast-paced game that you will find yourself playing multiple times a session.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All a zombie wants is a brain to munch.<br/><br/>Too bad the humans don&rsquo;t want to give them up. We have all seen it before, the zombie hordes march against the panicked humans. The humans eventually entrench and rally then start blowing away the poor hungry masses of undead. But what if there was a different way? A more civilized way of resolving this tired old conflict? What if we could negotiate instead?<br/><br/>RE: Your Brains is based on the hit song by Jonathan Coulton.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of the Zombie and the survivor negotiating the brain eating situation. The zombie just wants a hot meal and is trying to convince the survivor to open the door and be that meal, meanwhile the Survivor just wants to go about his life in peace and would love to convince the zombie to go bother some other poor fool, or better yet just stop shambling around all together. To do this players take turns making arguments based on a set of cards in their hands. The only limitation is the mood of the card played, the content is entirely up to the players.<br/><br/>RE: Your Brains is a fast playing two player game that is as much fun to watch as it is to play and you will often get help from the peanut gallery as you try to debate, cajole, and threaten your way to victory.<br/><br/>There are three aspects to playing RE: Your Brains.<br/><br/>1st is the rock, paper, scissors mechanic. There are three types of arguments to be made, Logical, Emotional, and Aggressive, ranging from values of 2-8. Logical arguments get a +2 bonus against Emotional arguments and -2 penalty against Aggressive, Emotional arguments get a +2 bonus against Aggressive and -2 against Logical, and Aggressive arguments get a +2 against Logical and -2 against Emotional. The bonus or penalty applies to the card being played, not the card on the stack. As long as the value is higher with the applied bonus or penalty (or neither if they're the same type of argument), you can play that card in response.<br/><br/>2nd is the roleplaying aspect. Every time you play a card, you must make an argument of the type of argument you played. Hence, if you're the zombie, you might make an 3 value Emotional plea of &quot;We've always been such good friends, and I would hate to have you be ripped to shreds by some other zombies. Let me eat your brain, and I'll turn you into a zombie so we can be friends forever!&quot; and as the survivor you might reply with a 2 value Logical argument which is actually a 4 against the previous 3 emotional and say something like &quot;One would think if you were truly my friend you would defend me from these other zombies, or at the very least stop trying to eat my brain.&quot;<br/><br/>3rd is the trick-taking mechanic. To win the game, you must win 5 arguments Each player starts the argument with a hand of 5 cards and uses those cards to make their argument. When they can no longer beat the argument on the table (or if they choose not to), the last person to play a card wins that argument. You may play two cards of the same argument type to overcome an existing argument. If a player completely runs out of cards and has no more to respond to their opponent's argument, they lose.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game the pieces are arranged in cross formations on specific board spaces, with each cross containing one piece of each color and the center of each cross being a different color.<br/><br/>A move consists of a player moving a piece orthogonally any number of empty spaces. There are five special spaces which when landed on let the player make another move with the same piece or a piece of the same color, counting it as part of the same move.<br/><br/>The object is to get the five pieces of each color in a connected group. The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or by multiple players; the designer suggests playing with two by trading off setting up boards for the opponent (the goal being to solve the opponent's puzzle in fewer moves than they solve yours), or any number by each trying to solve the same puzzle in the fewest moves.<br/><br/>",

It describes the efforts of three different characters (an FBI agent, a security guard, and a mercenary) as they seek to survive a night of Lovecraftian horror as monsters and madness descend upon a storage facility nestled between the sea and a spooky wood.<br/><br/>The game is played out on an 8x8 hex grid and simulates the escape of a character through a simple set of movement and action rules. Enemies actions are controlled by a simple set of A.I., unique to each enemy, while the scenario to be played can be determined randomly and can be modified slightly according to preference or dice roll. The main driving force of the game is a narrative table, aptly called the Horror Table, which produces results that apply mechanical changes to game play as well as describe the nature of the dark events befalling your character. Couple with a search table, Night Shift creates an environment rife with spooky stuff.<br/><br/>This game was originally created for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Centerpiece is a roll-and-move game primarily for 2 players, or 4 players in teams. It's described by the designer as &quot;super-charged Monopoly,&quot; but it's most similar to Mario Party without the mini-games. The game board is printed on map paper, which allows it to fit inside the small box. After unfolding the board, the colorful box top becomes the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the game board. Players take turns rolling two dice off of the box top; at least one die must end up on the game board itself, and neither can roll farther than the board's border, or the roll is invalid. They then move the sum of their roll. Every space has special effect that triggers either when landed on or when leaving the space. The goal of the game is to collect feathers, represented by paper money, in order to buy puzzle pieces. Puzzle pieces can be purchased when the player lands on two of the corner spaces, and passing the Start Together space generates an income of 25 feathers. Feathers can also be gained and lost in various ways.<br/><br/>Aside from rolling off the box top, the main distinguishing feature of the game is that each player's pawn is represented by a pair of stacked poker chips. When landing on the Banana Split garden space, the poker chips are split up, and are subsequently treated as separate pawns. If they ever occupy the same space, other than the Banana Split space, they are recombined. Split pieces give more options when moving, and some spaces reward the player for having their chips either combined or separated.<br/><br/>As in Monopoly, rolling doubles allows the player to move again, and rolling snake eyes sends the other player's chips to the Bird Cage (identical to Monopoly's Jail space).<br/><br/>Description from Kickstarter:<br/><br/>Super-charged Monopoly. Dice fall off box, the game travels in. White and black poker-chips get pulled apart and put together.<br/><br/>To play simply learn to drop the dice off the box, and keep them on the game-board.   The very first corner space states, Divide Your Game Parts.  What made that work, are five No/Rest circles added to select spaces.  They take away the choice, of which game-piece to move.  Before I adding those circles, catch-22's would happen.   A different space states, Exchange Your Bank of Feathers.  It allows a player to come from behind at anytime.<br/><br/>The inside of the box works great as a game-bank.   Each time around the board Eagle, Duck and Seagull feathers are rewarded.   The goal of CENTERPIECE, becomes a RACE to purchase nine-puzzle-spaces one at a time.  Have a bank of two-hundred feathers, have game-parts together.  Then land on the Start Sun space, or Bidgecage space to WIN.  Players keep score, with black and white pawns, under the box, at the games center.   Who's best at finding the best price for a numbered puzzle-space, while staying out of the Birdcage corner space.  For example to Rent A Horse, to get to the Half-Price space, or not.<br/><br/>All together there are twenty-eight game spaces.  One last example of a game-space states.  Roll Doubles While Here, and spend three-turns at the Birdcage corner. Your game pieces, if divided, would be joined again.  Rolling doubles while in the Birdcage, lets a player leave early.<br/><br/>Because the game-board paper was designed for new maps, it folds forever.  ( It was the most expensive part of the game.)<br/><br/>CENTERPIECE = fast-paced FUN!!!  Tested on family and friends.   People will ask what's the fun all about?   Copy-righted in 1992, a ten-year renewal was also completed.  Old-school face-to-face battle with new IMPROVED format.<br/><br/>",

The mining town it is set in was quite wealthy and bustling with business until one day people started getting sick. After the sickness, many died. After they died, many got back up and started eating the living! It wasn't long before word spread that this was happening all over the country. Quickly, everyone left town as fast as they could heading toward a &quot;Quarantine Zone&quot; they heard of in Boulder, Colorado. You and a small group of other survivors got the last wagon in town and headed to Boulder. It wasn't long before the wagon broke catastrophically and you were all stranded. You set up a basic camp and decided to make missions into town to get supplies and parts for the wagon. Once fixed, you will be ready to Get to the Quarantine Zone.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ironburst is a tactical combat board game using detailed metal miniatures and modular hex-based maps. It plays quick and has simple rules with good tactical scalability. Set-up is fast and so are battles.<br/><br/>The goal is to complete objectives: gathering resources, building, or eliminating specific enemy troops, etc. Players gather resources located on the board to build and repair units and to buy special Event Cards.<br/><br/>The miniature line and the game were developed together, so the miniatures are designed to fit the game mechanisms and vice versa. More specifically, each miniature has multiple moving parts that can be removed (if they are destroyed) and rotated (to aim, to indicate that a weapon has already fired, etc.). Thus, these modular miniatures allow players to do bookkeeping and track game events directly on the battlefield instead of using paper. The moving parts are magnetic and can be swapped in and out to allow players to customize their forces.<br/><br/>To allow the moving parts to take the stress and friction of repeated movement, Ironburst miniatures are cast in a special zinc alloy called ZAMAK, which is not as soft as tin (and much lighter), nor as fragile as resin, while keeping a good amount of detail.<br/><br/>",

Using the element of surprise, they were tasked with seizing the bridges, and more importantly, hold them against the inevitable German counter attack. B&eacute;nouville Bridge was later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in reference to the shoulder emblem worn by the British Airborne forces.<br/><br/>The Battlefield<br/><br/>Using the contents of the battle set, you can really set the scene for this pivotal battle. The centrepiece is a laser-cut model of the bridge itself, accompanied by models of the Cafe Gondre, as well as a pill box, a gun pit and even two telegraph poles!<br/><br/>Next come the forces themselves - for the defenders, 20 German infantry, backed up with a 5cm KwK 39 anti-tank gun and MG42 machine gun team. The attackers are a 10-man British Airborne squad plus a 2-man PIAT team, and an exclusive model of Major John Howard, which is only available in this set. You'll also get decal sheets for both the sides to help you prepare your forces for battle.<br/><br/>Last but not least the box includes a scenario booklet that describes how to set up and fight the battle for Pegasus Bridge.

As the German forces began the push the partisans were ready and awaiting for an ambush. The Partisans were not trained soldiers and the tactics of the partisans were simple and the challenges put on them by their leaders were less than would be expected from a military unit. Surprise and ambush were their best tactic. Their spot chosen lay on both sides of the Narotch stream. Having capturing a German field gun earlier and using their long hidden anti tank gun&mdash;a leftover from the retreating Russians in 1941&mdash;the ambush was prepared. Mines were placed, demolition charges were planted by explosive teams smuggled behind German lines and now the wait began. One Partisan survivor remembered: &ldquo;We would ambush the Germans on the Narotch stream bank. We knew the Germans planned to come to the aid of the guard from the other side of the stream. Our commander, Sagalchik, was also a guide, as he had lived in Miadel for many years and was familiar with the area. When we arrived everything was quiet. Suddenly shots were heard. We lay down and awaited the Germans. When we received the sign to attack we ran to the houses where the Germans and Lithuanian sharpshooters were. The battle lasted a few hours and the Germans dispersed.&rdquo; Within an hour the fight was over leaving the battlefield in partisans hands. The Germans suffered 40 dead and over 50 wounded. &ldquo;Lenz-Sud&rsquo; was off to a bloody start.<br/><br/>Bandenkrieg: Hell Behind the Eastern Front is a historical module depicting combat that occurred during an anti-partisan operation, Operation Lenz Nord, near Borisov in Byelorussia in April 1943.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2 player game, played on the spaces of a 7x7 board.<br/><br/>One player plays black the other white.<br/><br/>2 pawns, black and white.<br/>A supply of black and white stackable pieces.<br/><br/>THE WIN &ndash; There are two ways to win, one way is if on your turn you manage to form an unbroken orthogonally adjacent path, connecting your pawn, your stacks and your opponent&rsquo;s pawn. The second way is if you control the most stacks of 4 pieces high at endgame.<br/><br/>STACK - A stack is one or more pieces of either color.<br/>The color of the stack's top piece determines its owner (e.g., a black top piece makes it a black stack).<br/><br/>Stacks cannot be greater than 4 pieces high.<br/>Stacks of 4 pieces high cannot move.<br/>Stacks cannot split.<br/><br/>MOVEMENT &ndash; Pawns start out on base tiles on opposite corners of the board and move along the outer edge of the board. Pawns may move to any point along either side of the board, so long as they do not jump over their opponent's pawn and so long as they do not occupy the same side of the board between base tiles.<br/><br/>Stacks move orthogonally along empty spaces(no jumps).<br/><br/>Stacks move equal to the number of pieces within the stack. (e.g. , a stack of 1 moves one space, a stack of 2 moves two spaces and a stack of 3 moves three spaces.)<br/><br/>Board starts out empty, then pawns are placed on the base tiles.<br/><br/>TURN - Black moves first, turn then alternates.<br/><br/>On each turn, each player must take one of the following actions, which constitutes a valid move:<br/><br/>&bull;Move your pawn and drop a single piece onto any empty point that lies between your pawn and the target point as long as all the points between your pawn and your target point are also empty or<br/>&bull;Move your pawn and drop a single piece on top of a friendly or enemy stack that is less than 4 high, also the stack most be in line of sight of your pawn and any stacks in-between your pawn and the target stack must have less pieces than the target stack, or<br/>&bull;Move your pawn and then move one of your stacks.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a valid move on their turn. <br/><br/><br/>",

Expect to be kept on your toes with cutthroat moves and counter-moves.<br/><br/>The game is won and lost by activating ingredients on the table; two different ones to win, two identical ones to lose.<br/><br/>Players start by creating the board from a set of hexagonal tiles around a tile marked as the Altar set in the middle of the table. Then, they draw five cards and play their move in turns.<br/><br/>The different actions from the cards include summoning zombies, moving them to specific tiles to bring ingredient cards from one's hand to the table, or sacrifice zombies on the Altar tile to activate or deactivate ingredients already on the table.<br/>Cards can also be combined into advanced actions that bend the rules (steal cards, cancel actions, etc.).<br/><br/>Rules are in English and French.

It can be played either cooperatively or competitively.<br/><br/>Players start on the same &quot;Start&quot; card, and have slightly different attack, search and defense abilities depending on their character. On their turn, they first draw a map card and connect it to the already placed cards, expanding the caverns and creating more opportunities for battles and loot.<br/><br/>Combat and gaining coins works through dice rolls. Players have to beat certain defence scores of the enemies in their roll, and they gain the associated rewards if they're successful. This can also include treasure cards which provide bonuses and extra abilities.<br/><br/>Players can pool their dice rolls together if they are on the same space, to make it easier to gain rewards or defeat monsters. In this case, the rewards are split.<br/><br/>Players can also attack each other for the chance to steal coins from their opponents.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first to find 10 coins and make it back to the entrance. Each character has an additional secondary objective which provides an alternative winning condition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A solitaire card game based on the concept of rhythmic video games.<br/><br/>The player has a band of five dancers from a selection of 11, numbered 1&ndash;5. The dancers are put in a line, where each dancer is either in the front row or back row. From a shuffled deck of notes also numbered 1&ndash;5, five cards are lined up. Each turn, the cards of the lest represented colour will &quot;fall down&quot; (are slid down a bit) and must be &quot;caught&quot; by the team of dancers. However, in order to achieve a &quot;perfect rhythm&quot;, a note must be caught by a dancer with the same number, if caught by a dancer with a number at most 1 more or less than the note is &quot;good&quot; if the note and the dancer are of the same colour; anything else is a &quot;fail&quot;.<br/>Before each catch, the player can only move one dancer one step, either from back row to front row, or sideways, in which case they swap places with whoever was beside them. However, moving sideways to a spot where no dancer is is not counted as a move, and will also cause the dancer who now ends up in the same column as the moved one, to move in the opposite direction, a so-called &quot;cross move&quot;.<br/><br/>Being in the back row gives the dancer one extra turn to catch the note. Also, apart from the current row of falling notes, the player will have another row of notes above it, enabling the player to plan his moves one turn ahead.<br/><br/>The final score is decided by the number of perfects and good rhythm catches. Also, before each game, the player chooses which song to dance to; each song having a special effect on the game. Each dancer also has a special power to activate once per game.<br/><br/>",

A special die is rolled and the event takes effect.<br/><br/>5) ZOMBIE STEP: Depending on the levels of the Zombie Counter one or two extra zombies will be added to the Zombie Roll. Usually 1 die per rescuer is roll (between 3 and 4 die total) plus any extra die added by the Zombie Counter placing zombies in the suburbs of the map. A 6 rolled is a miss and do not adds any zombie.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to rescue the 8 survivors that stand hidden on the locations of the outer ring of the board and then return to the center tile to be retrieved by the rescue team.<br/><br/>The Heroes lose if at any time there are 3 zombies on the central location tile.<br/><br/>The Items deck works as a counter that will increase the difficulty as the game progresses with some &quot;bad luck&quot; cards that can be a devastating force against the heroes.<br/><br/>There are several ways of losing the game and only one way to win so usually players will feel very rewarded when they win as it&acute;s usually on the edge of oblivion.<br/><br/>",

A roving creature senses your presence and hears your movements.

Players start with a set of four cards, which are played to gain lost equipment as they move around the board. Some equipment gives them added advantages to collect parts for their crashed balloon. Players also try to avoid a roving creature.

        "description": "The Trilateral Conspiracy is a mid-level traitor mechanic game that typically takes about 90 minutes to play.  One player (by random draw) is assigned as the Protagonist and is the leader of a group of Heroes trying to expose the Conspiracy.  Another player will secretly start the game as an Agent, posing as a Hero.  Agents win when the Heroes lose.  All other players begin with a Resolve score between 1 and 9.  They start out on the Hero's side, but if and when one of the nine &quot;Conspiracy Expands&quot; cards is revealed in the game, they will switch to an undercover Agent if their Resolve is equal to or lower than the number of Conspiracy Expands cards revealed thus far.  Consequently some players who start as Heroes may choose to play as if they were already Agents right away, others will be Heroes to the end, and some may hedge their bets and try to play both sides.<br/><br/>There are eight locations on the board that serve as potential centers of the Conspiracy.  The main goal of the Heroes is to identify which location it is, and then successfully infiltrate it enough to get the information they need to expose the Conspiracy.  The way to figure out which is the correct one is to infiltrate three other locations known as the Halls of Power.  If successful, each one will eliminate half of the possible locations and all three together will pinpoint it.  The twelfth location makes all of the other infiltrations easier.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will typically do three things.  They will move to a location, play a card on that location if they wish, and then they can either use that location's power (to do things like draw or trade cards) or they can try to infiltrate it.  The purpose for playing cards is to make a location easier (or harder) to infiltrate.  The cards range from -5 to +5 and each location starts with one random card on it.  If a player chooses to try and infiltrate a location, they shuffle the cards on top and then reveal all of them.  If the sum of the cards is equal to or greater than a certain changing difficulty number, they succeed.  Otherwise they fail and may face a penalty.<br/><br/>Successfully infiltrating one of the Halls of Power lets the person doing the infiltration discover one of the leaders of the Conspiracy which in turn narrows down the possible locations of the Conspiracy.  However only the infiltrating player gets to see the card and they may or may not tell the truth about what they saw.  Once the Heroes have an idea of which location is the center of the Conspiracy, they will try to infiltrate it.  If successful, they may take a card from their hand and place it underneath that location.<br/><br/>The game typically ends when the Protagonist feels the Heroes have played enough cards under the proper location and calls an end to the game.  At that time the cards under the Halls of Power are revealed and the true center of the Conspiracy is determined.  Then the cards under there (if any) are added up and if the total does indeed meet or beat a certain difficulty (called the Exposure Level), the Heroes win.  Otherwise the Agents win.  The Agents also win if the deck runs out of cards or if the Protagonist is killed in a failed infiltration.  The Heroes can alternately win if the Exposure Level ever drops to 0.<br/><br/>",

The game employs on-hand measuring devices, namely player's feet, to gauge movement and attack distances, and makes use of a custom paper-craft dice set to resolve ship vs ship combat and other aspects of the game.<br/><br/>Core game mechanics include:<br/> - One ship activation per player turn, allows for an engaging game for all players right to the very end.<br/> - Directional wind mechanic to tactically enhance ship movement.<br/> - Ship crew members, with class based abilities and roles.<br/> - Ranged and Melee based combat system though use of D6 outcomes.<br/> - Removable shields attached to the sides of each ship to track damage.<br/> - Modularised ruleset (expansion packs and optional rules can be swapped in/out at the groups discretion).<br/> - Floating loot provides random power-ups, events and penalties.<br/> - Ship movement through on-hand measuring devices for simplicity.<br/> - The paper-craft kits for the game come pre-cut and assembly is glue free.<br/><br/>",

Each battle is different according to the terrain dice thrown, which determine how many and which dice may battle, if any are modified/doubled, and how many actions each player may take per turn.  Each type of die has basic abilities (resurrection/banishment, mimicry, split attacks, join-forces, re-roll opponent die/dice, re-roll own die/dice), and all but the d4 have special abilities activated by rolling pairs (or more) of the same number.<br/><br/>The player with initiative (usually lower total roll) takes one, two, or three actions (based on the throw of the terrain dice) before the opponent has a chance to respond. Actions include one die attacking another or activating abilities, or activating abilities and then attacking an opponent's die (most common).<br/><br/>There is a balance between thinking through the possibilities and over-thinking what your opponent may do, particularly in the selection of which dice to roll at the beginning of each battle.  Each battle will consist of different combinations of dice, resulting in different abilities interacting, keeping the game fresh and interesting throughout.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme - Shine is a biblically based deck building game. In Shine, you are a person who has recently become a Christian. Though saved and forgiven, you still struggle with sin. Your goal is to remove sin from your life and grow in spiritual maturity. To do this, you will spend time in God&rsquo;s word, prayer, and use your spiritual gifts to minister to the lost and the hurting. It is not as easy as it seems. Satan prowls like a roaring lion. You will face various temptations, but through it all, God will never leave you or forsake you.<br/><br/>Game objective - The object of this game is to build a deck, called a Life Deck. This deck represents a player&rsquo;s spiritual maturity. Each player starts off with spiritual fruit, and a lot of sin. As the game progresses, players try to remove sin from their life decks and gain various cards, including more spiritual fruit. Character cards that represent people in need and sets of fruit cards are worth victory points.  Sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player, with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Game play - As a player you have the choice to pray or to shine.<br/><br/>If you choose to pray, you start off by using one of your spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts allow a player to gain a specific spiritual fruit card. There are 9 different kinds of fruit cards and they are the resource used in Shine to gain other cards. <br/>- You may use the abilities on scripture cards that take effect during prayer. <br/>- You may remove a card from your deck, usually sin. <br/>- You may also place any number of cards from your hand into your discard pile. <br/>- To conclude your turn you draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If you choose to shine, you start by using one of your spiritual gifts. <br/>- You may play and use the abilities on scripture cards and character cards that you gained during previous rounds. <br/>- You may trade a fruit card with any card in the fellowship pool. The fellowship pool allows players to trade fruit cards. <br/>- You may trade in 2 fruit cards to gain a new fruit card. When you trade in a card it is removed from your deck.<br/>- You may play fruit cards to gain new scripture and character cards.<br/>- To conclude your turn draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>When a player draws the last card from their life deck, the current round ends. <br/>- Each player shuffles their discarded life cards and places them under their life decks.<br/>- Then each player draws the top card of their temptation deck and does what it says. Temptation cards force the player to draw more sin cards and have stronger effects if a player has sin that they have not dealt with.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the temptation cards have been drawn. Character cards and full sets of 9 fruit cards are worth positive victory points and sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player with the most victory points is considered to be the most spiritually mature and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players use customized decks to play out fast, exciting battles while others bet on the outcome. Winning bets earns you the cash you need to improve your deck.<br/><br/>Players represent gladiators in a Roman arena. Each round they have a chance to buy better weapons, techniques, and armor to help them defeat their foes &mdash; with each purchase making a better (and more expensive) version of that card available. Then, they'll challenge one of their opponents to a one-on-one throwdown.<br/><br/>Fights are fast, exciting, and surprisingly tactical. First, players reveal three cards from their deck. Based on this information, all other players bet on the outcome. Players then pick those cards up, draw two more cards, and secretly divide them all into two hands: one hand to be used for its fighting power, the other for the special abilities on the cards. They'll then play out a quick best-of-three combat, simultaneously revealing cards, comparing their powers, and, when necessary, deploying hidden tricks.<br/><br/>When the dust settles, the winning fighter collects a victory chip, and the spectators who bet on him win coins that they can use to improve their decks. Players win the game by besting all of their opponents in combat.<br/><br/>",

Each partner decides on their favourite response and uses the electronic Perfect Match device to check their compatibility and advance along the board. the first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light are the winners. Who will be your Perfect Match?<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>2 Electronic Perfect Match Devices.<br/>288 Question Cards.<br/>1 Die.<br/>4 Position Markers.<br/>Perfect Match Game Board.<br/><br/>The players are divided into couples. Each couple takes a position marker and places it in the start square. Remove the perfect match cards from their perforations and place them in their marked positions on the game board.<br/><br/>The Perfect Match Cards:<br/>These cards are divided into two categories: pink 'Girls' cards and blue 'Guys' cards. As the game proceeds, question cards are taken from the 'Girls' pile if the playing couple lands on a pink square or From the 'Guys' pile if they land on a blue square. Each card contains one questions with four alternative<br/>answers marked A,B,C or D.<br/><br/>Choosing the right answer:<br/>If the couple lands on a blue square, one of the other players picks up a 'Guys' card and directs one question on it to the male partner. He must choose the alternative which he feels is most appropriate to him. His partner must try to anticipate his feelings or attitudes on that question and choose the same alternative. Couples should be open and honest in their choice of answer. Similarly, if the couple lands on a pink square, a 'Girls' card would be taken and its question directed towards the female partner. She will choose and answer and her partner should try to anticipate this response.<br/><br/>Questions marked 'BOTH' are  designed to test compatibility, with each partner choosing their own favourite answer in response to the question asked.<br/><br/>Using the Electronic Perfect Match device:<br/>These devices are in the shape of four hearts joined together. Each heart is labeled A,B,C or D, representing the four alternatives on the Perfect Match question cards. When a question is asked and each partner has silently decided on which alternative to choose, they each hold up their device with the chosen representative letter uppermost. They must not allow each other to see their choices. The two devices are then pressed together. If the electronic tone sounds, a perfect match has been achieved for that question.<br/><br/>Dare Cards:<br/>Scattered throughout both packs of cards are Dare Cards. If one these cards appears, the couple must perform whatever is required of them according to the instructions on the card. Their performance is adequate (as indicated by a show of hands) then the couple may roll the die again and continue their turn. Be warned - if you are too easy on others then there is no challenge to perform well. If you are too tough, then your opponent will be equally tough on you. So be fair!<br/><br/>Playing the game: Each couple rolls the die once and those with the highest score start, moving their marker the corresponding number of squares. One of the other players then reads the first question to the starting couple. If the couple achieves a Perfect Match, they roll the die again and advance the corresponding number of squares along the board. Remember, a couple can only roll the die and advance after  they have successfully answered a Perfect Match question or performed a Dare task. The couple continues in this way until they are unsuccessful in either a Perfect Match question or a Dare performance, in which case the control of the game is handed over to the next couple (moving clockwise).<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>The first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light and then successfully achieve a Perfect Match from their Choice of either a Girls or Guys question will be declared the winner.<br/><br/><br/>    Special Note<br/><br/><br/>Should the electronic tone stop working use a nail file or a similar tool to lever apart the two case sections of the blue device. Carefully removed the battery, replacing it with one of identical type. Be sure to position it positive side up. When pressing the case sections back together, locate the letter &quot;A&quot; on the plastic cover over the battery position.<br/><br/>Based on the formerly popular 1980s Network Ten (and much later Seven Network in 2002) Australian TV dating game show of the same name.<br/><br/>",

However, even the best developers make mistakes, and therefor bugs do occur.<br/><br/>Building up your software development factory helps you keep your processes under control. Or you can just hope to get away with your low quality product and heap all the misery on to your unsuspecting customer.<br/><br/>Every player starts with a draw deck containing money, developer and epic cards, from which you draw a hand. During your turn, you can use cards to recruit new developers, special programming or testing tools, fix bugs, outsource or build towards completing your epics.<br/><br/>When you complete an epic, you can hand it over to another player. The epic is tested for bugs. Bugs discovered during the test will cause damage to your epic or the other player's deck.<br/><br/>Your final score is determined by the value of the epics you have successfully handed over, the bugs in your deck and being the first player to finish three epics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "En Prise is a card game of chance and strategy that plays just like chess - for two to four players.  No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).<br/><br/>Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.<br/><br/>Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.<br/><br/>Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.<br/><br/>",

Peter Pan has set out to help their escape, his battle with Captain Hook, and his villainous crew about to begin. Neverland is only for the brave. Those who dare to tread its pathways and cross its rivers should beware, evil deeds are planned tonight.<br/><br/>The game is based on the original Hodder and Stoughton publication of Peter Pan and Wendy from 1921 which uses the illustrations of Mabel Lucie Attwell. The game takes extracts from the text and uses those original illustrations to capture the atmosphere and adventure of the book in an exciting game. The pieces and the packaging have been tastefully designed to make the game a collectors piece for children and parents to treasure today and throughout their lives.<br/><br/>The player playing Peter Pan must set out to clear the mushroom clearings of pirates so the children can make good their escape. The player playing Captain Hook sets out from the Jolly Roger in an attempt to capture Peter Pan. His 6 pirates guard the mushroom clearings, making difficult for the children to escape. Players playing Wendy, Michael and John must find a way to the underground home.<br/><br/>The game boils down to a roll and move with a card mechanic to throw some curves into the game. When Peter Pan and Captain Hook clash it becomes a dice duel between the two.<br/><br/>The game includes a game board, hand crafted Peter Pan and Captain Hook pawns, 6 wooden pirates, 3 wooden children counters, 50 adventure cards, 30 pirate river cards and three wooden dice.<br/><br/>",

As players work together, the universe either succumbs to the calamities or is saved by the grace of the gods!<br/><br/>The goal of the players in Divinity is to accumulate points by creating various objects in their galaxies. The divine cards are used by players to achieve their goal, while calamity cards are force-played through to game, undermining the players' efforts. Depth is created through the interaction of all these cards, creating new situations every game and requiring players to consider card abilities carefully in order to master the game.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players add all their points together to judge the fate of all they've built. Players must play wisely, as both divine and calamity cards can cause the game to end. Control of both points and when the game ends is critical to success.<br/><br/>Divinity is inspired by cooperative games heavy in strategy and planning, as well as light and chaotic party games. It's made to be quick to set up, easy to learn, but full of endless wonder. Why not try being a god today?<br/><br/>",

If one player cannot move any piece, or cannot move Leader to a safe square, that player loses the game.<br/>Players play one after the other like in chess(black goes first), but they can play not just one, but also two (and in special condition three) moves per turn.<br/><br/>Each player on his turn can move any two pieces he has (but cannot move the same piece twice like a prolonged move). If he plays with a two units of a different type (e.g. one Infantry and one Archer), he can move even the third piece but that piece must belong to remaining unit (e.g. If a player moved one Infantry and one Cavalry, he can also move one Archer).<br/><br/>Player cannot move and take pieces on the same turn. When taking pieces player can do it with only one unit (and so he loses maneuver advantage of playing with more pieces). The only way to take two pieces on the same turn is that you take one piece with either Infantry or Cavalry, and if there was any piece within range of your Archers, you can take that piece as well.<br/><br/>Leader and Heavy Infantry are Invulnerable to Archers, but they cannot move on the square which is targeted by Archer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Damier g&eacute;ographique is French game from the WWI-era.<br/><br/>This game is a variation on the classical game of checkers, with a World War I theme.<br/><br/>2 teams of 2 players compete on a map of Europe that is overlaid with a checkerboard pattern. Each team has an equal number of pawns that represent armies. One team represents Germany and the Austrian Empire. The other team represents France, the UK, Russia and their allies.<br/><br/>The board is divided in a western and an eastern battle zone. At the beginning of the game, one player of each team plays in each zone. In the western zone, each player has 36 pieces. In the eastern zone each player has 24 pieces. The battles are played simultaneously, but separately (pawns cannot move from one battle zone to the other). When there is a victor in one zone, his remaining pieces go to his ally in the other zone.<br/><br/>The movement rules are those of the game of checkers. Each players moves in turn. Armies move one space diagonally and capture by jumping over an enemy pawn. Each country has one or two squares that are marked as fortresses. Armies promote to 'generals' when they can occupy an enemey fortress. A general moves as a king in checkers.<br/><br/>A battle in a zone is won by capturing all enemy pieces in that zone. The team that wins in both zones, or wins in one and draws in the other is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beyond Leipzig takes John Prados' popular game design from Beyond Waterloo and applies the system to the greatest of all the Napoleonic campaigns in 1813. Beyond Leipzig is a two-or multi player strategic level simulation of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1813. Players take the sides of France or its opponents, a coalition of Allies. Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Leipzig, Beyond Leipzig takes in the full scope of the military, economic, and diplomatic possibilities inherent in the 1813 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon, still reeling from his disastrous failed invasion of Russia. The French must avoid that outcome and secure their empire in central Europe.<br/><br/>",

His seminal work, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is Latin for &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.<br/><br/>In Newton's Noggin, 2-4 players manipulate ideas inside Newton's head to formulate the concepts necessary to write the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Problems will need to be solved or worked around. Other players' ideas will impede your progress. The player that contributes the most ideas to Newton's masterwork wins the game.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 30 ideas represented by wooden cubes in the player's color and six basic Think Cards. Players must use the limited number of cards they have to place and maneuver ideas on the board to form Concepts - various geometric shapes - that make up the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematical. Players will need to manage their hand size and contents in an effort to obtain the most valuable Think Cards possible without exceeding their hand size. Think Cards played to manipulate ideas do not count towards the player's maximum hand size, but careful management and planning is required because the cards used by a player during their turn return to their hand over time in subsequent turns.<br/><br/>",

The players take on the role as governors of the Swedish colony Nova Suecia in the 17th century Delaware. They must cooperate to build a viable economy in the fragile colony since no player can control all parts on his or her own. The colonists need food, the colony needs money and the resources must be manufactured into tradable goods. The players must also, secretely, allocate common and own resources to the budget to prevent the colony from falling to internal and external threats. Each player must thus find a way to get the upper hand in this cooperative act of balance to emerge as a winner in the end. If they fail and the colony of Nova Suecia falls, all players lose!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include<br/><br/>1. Player balance: The players grow by one district per turn and are thus always equally strong.<br/>2. Game balance: The game has a delicate balance between wealth, food and production. If one area grows on behalf of the others, the game will fall and so will the players.<br/>3. Bidding: All card drawings are followed by biddings where judgement rather than luck determines the outcome.<br/>4. Production &amp; Trade: The players build and develop the game together.<br/>5. Taxation: The players must secretly choose how much to pay for common expenses, thus introducing free-rider and prisoners' dilemma challenges<br/>6. Interdependence: The players must both cooperate and compete to survice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Liberty Match was inspired by Go Fish. It can be played with 2 to 6 players. It is played with American Standard Playing Cards, which is a deck of cards inspired by traditional playing cards.<br/><br/>THE DECK<br/><br/>The 58-card deck has 4 suits (Faith, Declaration, Revolution, and Unity) with 14 ranks: The 1st - 10th Amendment, A Gentleman, a Lady, a Patriot, and a Foundation.  There are also 2 Jokers, which are actually a king and queen. The suits are in 2 colors: Red and Blue.<br/><br/>Faith is represented by a Blue Triangle, (The &quot;All-seeing Eye of the Creator&quot; - like on the back of the $1 Bill)<br/>Declaration by a Red Pentagon<br/>Revolution by a Red Triquetra (Trinity Knot) with a coiled &quot;Don't tread on me!&quot; style snake in the center.)<br/>and Unity by a Blue Circle with 13 stars.<br/><br/>The deck was designed to have a theme of American history and patriotism.  Since America was founded by declaring independence of a royalty-based ruling system, the face cards and suits were changed.  The Amendment cards have portions of the actual text of the named Constitutional Amendment printed on the card, and that text is used in the playing of &quot;Liberty Match&quot;.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>The dealer deals between 5-7 cards to each player (depending on how many players there are). The remaining playing cards are placed face down to form a stock.  The player to dealer's left starts.<br/><br/>Once a pair is made (even if dealt a pair from the beginning) it is to be laid down, face up, on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>In each turn, a player asks for a rank of card that they already have in their hand from a specific other player.  If the asked player has that card, they must give the asking player that card.  If the asked player does not have that card, they reply with &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; - then the asking player takes the top card from the deck on the table.<br/><br/>Before play can continue, the asking player must read the text from one of the other cards in their hand - just the text, not the name of the card.  (Players cannot continue to read the same card repeatedly, unless it is their last card.)<br/><br/>If the asking player is given the card they asked for, or if they draw a card that matches one of the cards they are holding, they can continue to go.  If a player is told to &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; and is unable to make a pair, the next player may go.<br/><br/>When a player has no playing cards left, they must then draw a playing card from the stock until all playing cards run out. The game continues until all the playing cards are played even the stock. The winner is the player who then has the most pairs in front of them.<br/><br/>Example of a turn:<br/><br/>Player 1 asks Player 3 if they have the 1st Amendment. Player 3 hands Player 1 a 1st Amendment. Player 1 lays down the two 1st Amendment cards, then reads &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; (the text from the 2nd Amendment.) And then asks Player 2 if they have any 4th Amendments.  Player 2 says &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot;.  Player 1 draws a card and then reads &quot;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&quot;  It is now Player 2's turn.<br/><br/>There are 2 Jokers the &quot;King of Tyranny&quot; and &quot;The King's Queen&quot; - these have the 4 suits from the standard - or French Deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Time-Travelling Robot Bakery, you are a programmer who works with robots in a bakery, and it's your job to make sure the robots are working as quickly as possible. These robots are capable of time travel, mind you, so as you battle for ingredients and supplies, it's possible for your opponent to go back in time and get to them before you do. If you can bake a cake with your robots before your opponent can, you win!<br/><br/>In the game, players program four robots to move around a modular board and to try to gather ingredients for a cake. The robots are added to the board one by one, as they duplicate via time travel, creating a parallel algorithm of growing complexity. Coordinating the movements as you add more and more robots to the picture is key to solving this puzzle-y game fastest. The game board is created from double-sided cards, allowing for varying gameplay each session with different options on the different sides of the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Business Mogul you play as the leader of a rising corporate empire, competing with your peers to amass the most power. Game play is centered around building an economic engine, and uses a bidding mechanic where players must balance bids to get the good stuff and to avoid the bad against the actions needed to build their empire, while saving high bids as much as possible to convert to cash at the end of each season.<br/><br/>The game has a fixed number of turns - six seasons of five rounds each - and total play time tends to be about 2-2.5 hours for 4 people (the game is designed for 3-5, with a solid 2-player variant), on par with a feature movie. In every round there is one card per player up for grabs - every player gets a card every round. The cards on which players bid are businesses that are used to build up your economic engine, extra actions to be saved until needed most (and they let a player do some things outside the normal rules of play), special agenda cards that give score a bonus at the end of the game (how much depends on how well the conditions for the given card are fulfilled), and bad events (which are to be avoided if possible).<br/><br/>Players are bidding pick order rather than on a particular item. Each players uses a set nine of bidding cards (getting them all back at the start of each season), which represent how the player is dividing their attention that round between trying to get the best of the available items and getting other stuff done. Each bid has a specific action that it allows (lower bids have more powerful actions), and bids saved for the end of the season are worth extra money - the higher the bid the more it&rsquo;s worth. These additional aspects associated with each bid, the action and the end-of-season cash value, make for exciting, meaningful choices every round.<br/><br/>Business Mogul supports multiple valid strategies, though the highest final score usually goes to the player that dabbles in additional strategies beyond their primary one. The key to winning is being tactically smart about balancing pick order vs action vs end-of-season-payout, paying attention to the state of other player&rsquo;s empires and the bids they've already used in the current season, and executing a strategy that adapts to the flow of items up for bid.<br/><br/>There are some fairly common game mechanics/attributes that Mogul specifically does not have:<br/><br/>- It has no player-to-player aggression - the bidding each round is the only point of direct competition. <br/>- It does not have random action outcomes (that is whether or not a given action succeeds is not determined by dice, card draw, or anything like that). <br/>- It does not have any kind of territory control. <br/>- It has no resources / production beyond money and end-game score.<br/>- It does not require memorization of what&rsquo;s been played; aside from a single hidden card each player gets at the start and the particular bid a player is making in a given round, the state of the game is fully revealed.<br/><br/>",

The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.<br/>2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.<br/>3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.<br/>4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.<br/>5.

The random map generation ensures no two games of Space Frontier are exactly the same.<br/><br/>Players gain influence through missions, research, trade, or conquest.

It consists in 300 round cards, each one containing a brief note on a historical event related to the Catalan language and a challenge for the players. There are 10 different kinds of challenges: to create anagrams, to find words, to define words, to identify acronyms, to guess word meanings, etc.<br/><br/>In a game, 30 cards are selected at random: these will be the challenges to the players; and each player begins with 300 points. The game is played in turns. In a player's turn, he/she draws one of the 30 cards and reads the brief historical note and the kind of challenge. Then all players bet points to solve the challenge, before actually knowing the challenge (they just know its kind). After deducting the points bet of each player, the active player reads the challenge and the players try to solve it. All players having solved the challenge receive double the points they bet, while the higher better receives three times the points bet; the players not having solved the challenge receive nothing. After the 30 challenges have been played, the player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

And welcome to Ratnapura, the city of gems and the seat of king Parakkamabahu II. The royal treasurer died and the king is looking for a suitable successor to take care of his vast collection of precious stones and to grow the king&rsquo;s richess. Any suitable candidate has not only to know everything there is to know about gems, but also has to be a cunning business man who understands how to manipulate the market so that he can triumph over all the others.<br/><br/>In the game of Ratnapura the players have a hand of gem cards which they play in order to win tricks. The trump values of several of the suits are determined at the start of the game and can be influenced by the players by winning &ldquo;grand tricks&rdquo;. Changing the value of those suits is crucial for improving your chances of winning tricks, but all the other players will try to do the same. A number of special suits can be used to secure especially valuable tricks or to dump worthless glass marbles into other players treasure vaults.<br/><br/>Ratnapura uses a specially prepared deck for all player counts and thus plays as well with 2 players as it does with the full complement of 5.<br/><br/>Cool Factors:<br/>- A trick-taking game that actually plays equally well with 2 or 5 players;<br/>- Adjustable trump values.<br/><br/>",

Basically you are there to collect as many gems as possible in an ever changing maze while you try to avoid holes, bombs and other players.<br/><br/>The cards are narrow domino cards which are first shuffled and then 8 of them are laid out face up to make a 4 x 4 square board. The remaining cards are then dealt out equally face down to the players, any remaining cards are put to one side. Each player puts their piece at a corner (not on the board yet) and rolls the die to determine who goes first. <br/>You roll the die and you MUST move your piece that number of spaces even if it means losing gems! After you have moved you then place one of your cards from your hand onto the board to change the layout. This can be to your advantage or to sabotage another player.<br/><br/>Keep track of your scores with a notepad and pen to make it easier and once all players have played their cards and had an equal number of turns you count up the scores. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

A series of major offensives in Ottoman-ruled Palestine began in the fall of 1916. After some early failures the Allies steadily moved forward, their advance culminating in the capture of Damascus in October 1918.<br/><br/>Sinai-Palestine is a stand-alone game in the Infantry Attacks series, our World War One equivalent to the long-running Panzer Grenadier series. Units are companies and squadrons, and the sixty scenarios represent actions from the campaigns in the Sinai Peninsula and Palestine between 1915 and 1918, with the Ottoman Turkish army on one side supported by German and Austro-Hungarian detachments, and the British on the other supported by Australian, New Zealand, Jewish, Arab, Indian and West Indian forces.<br/><br/>The pieces are the fantastic, tile-thick laser-cut type seen in Kursk: Burning Tigers and Korean War: Pusan Perimeter. They're just plain fun to handle, and have no scorching or soot like some laser-cut game pieces. These are the best wargame counters ever made.<br/><br/>There are six semi-rigid mapboards, the same type found in Panzer Grenadier games. They are fully compatible with the Panzer Grenadier boards &mdash; you can play scenarios from either series on mapboards from the other game system.<br/><br/>",

Each character has a color (of the family), a strength value to measure victories in trick that are played and a value in gold (victory points).<br/><br/>When everybody plays one card strength and families are compared to determine which player wins the trick. This continues until all character cards from the deck have been played. But beware! It is not the player who wins the most tricks that wins the game, but the player that accumulates the most gold!<br/><br/>Tithe is a very quick and simple game, available in Spanish and English version and totally free for all Dizemo fans.<br/><br/>",

There are three kinds of tasks:<br/> *A trivia question: Ask the question to another player. If his answer is correct, both you and that player gain points.<br/> *A puzzle: Make a certain card combination to score points.<br/> *A dexterity challenge: Complete some action that requires balance or sleight of hand.<br/><br/>Based on a unique concept, Um Himmels Willen garantees fun, tension and variety for gamers of all ages.<br/><br/>Um Himmels Willen is very interactive and contains also a special variant for Teams.<br/><br/>Original description (German): <br/>Tante Lise hat gerade ein Farbenpaar ausgespielt, Oma Frieda der kleinen Hanna eine Quizfrage gestellt und Papa Ferdi versucht 10 Karten auf seinem K&ouml;rper zu verteilen, w&auml;hrend er eine Spielkarte auf seinem Kopf balanciert.<br/><br/>Um Himmels Willen ist das Spiel der verr&uuml;ckten Karten. Denkbar einfach sind dabei die Regeln. Karte spielen, Aufgabe erf&uuml;llen und Punkte kassieren. Aus drei Kategorien k&ouml;nnen die Spieler eine Aufgabe w&auml;hlen: Quizfragen, Knobel- und Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben.<br/><br/>Eine Quizfrage stellt man einem beliebigen Mitspieler. Kann dieser die Frage richtig beantworten, bekommt auch der Fragensteller Punkte. Man muss also kein Quizmaster sein, um Punkte zu bekommen. Die Mitspieler richtig einsch&auml;tzen zu k&ouml;nnen, ist viel wichtiger. Bei den Knobelaufgaben gilt es Kombinationen mit den verschiedenen Eigenschaften der Karten zu bilden: Farbe, Buchstabe oder Zahl zu Drillingen, W&ouml;rtern oder Stra&szlig;en formen und Punkte kassieren. Die Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben fordern Balance, Fingerfertigkeit und Spontanit&auml;t von den Spielern. Aber auch eine gute Beobachtungsgabe kann hilfreich sein um Punkte zu machen, gibt es ja noch diese &bdquo;Geheim&ldquo;-Karten. Passt man nicht gut auf, landet so eine fiese Karte schnell auf dem eigenen Punktestapel. Oder man verpasst eine Blitzaufgabe und kassiert Minuspunkte.<br/><br/>Interaktivit&auml;t wird bei &bdquo;Um Himmels Willen&ldquo; gro&szlig; geschrieben. Ein Gro&szlig;teil der Aufgaben bindet mehrere Spieler mit ein. Jeder kann immer mitmachen, ist aber nicht gezwungen dazu.<br/><br/>Durch das einzigartige Konzept wird f&uuml;r alle Altersgruppen Abwechslung, Spa&szlig; und Spannung geboten.<br/><br/>F&uuml;r 3-6 Spieler, ab 8 Jahren.<br/><br/>Eine spezielle Team/Familien-Variante erm&ouml;glicht es auch gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Gruppen Freude an &quot;Um Himmels Willen&quot; zu haben.<br/><br/>F&uuml;r 2-6 Teams, ab 8 Jahren.<br/><br/>",

General design was almost completed, but the translucent film used for the black line drawing had slightly stretched when passing in a copy machine, probably under the influence of heat. Duccio Vitale didn't have the money to redo all four maps and the project aborted.<br/><br/>17 years later, Buxeria got access to the original files and was able to restore them. The 4 maps that make the complete Fortified Harbor and the various counters intended for the game are now available for sale but the various booklets which were supposed to be provided originally were never written.<br/><br/>",

The aim was to overrun the Axis frontier positions, defeat the Axis armored reserves, and then drive west to relieve Tobruk. The attack came to grief in large part because of the deadly fire of German 88s well-emplaced in several key positions, but most famously at the key defile of Halfaya Pass, forever after known as Hellfire Pass.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>Hellfire Pass is a World War II simulation of the British Battleaxe offensive on 15-17 June, 1941. Operation Brevity is also included as an introductory scenario. This game marks a long-awaited, new chapter for the fast-playing, operational-level system enjoyed by many in Beda Fomm &ndash; a classic Frank Chadwick game design. The popularity of the game system is its blend of simple gaming mechanics that delivers fast-paced, nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.<br/><br/>Fans of Beda Fomm will be pleased to learn that the original game system has been retained, while also evolving and elaborating on it to best capture the protracted nature of the battles in this game. Both the Brevity and Battleaxe offensives were examples of protracted combat where both sides were challenged to sustain their efforts in the field while also maneuvering aggressively over a wider landscape.  New rules covering Supply, Repairs and Regrouping, and Morale Recovery represent additions that speak to that need to sustain operations in the face of losses. The game also reflects the greater availability of certain weapons &ndash; primary AT guns.<br/><br/>Now available for preorder from Consim Press<br/><br/>",

You also don't want to get promoted or else you will become part of the soulless corporate machine. Try not to get too stressed out though or you'll burn out.<br/><br/>Each player (drone) is given a tracker for his/her HR Warnings, Career, and Stress levels. If any of those trackers reach 5, that drone is out of the game (sort of).<br/><br/>Each round (workday) goes like this. Each drone chooses 1-3 cards to play from his/her hand of 7 cards and places the face down on the table. Once everyone is ready, the drones take turns revealing his/her cards. Everydrone adds up his/her productivity for the day. The drone with the highest productivity gets &quot;praise from the boss&quot; and has to draw a career card (which will most likely increase the career stat) and the drone(s) with the lowest productivity gets &quot;yelled at by the boss&quot; and increases their HR Warnings stat; all other drones are safe for the day. Everydrone draws back up to 7 hand cards and the game goes until there is only one drone left.<br/><br/>",

In Cute Pixel Art!<br/><br/>In Super Mini Adventure, players lead parties of powerful heroes and delve deep into the dungeons to slay foul monsters, all in the name of honor, glory, and shinning loot! But wait! For the biggest danger comes not from the monsters, but your fellow adventures! Watch out for their back-stabs and sabotages, as everyone frantically competes to slay the monsters and claim the prizes. Let the slaying begin!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to earn Coins by defeating Monsters. Players do this by forming up to two adventuring parties of Heroes, assigning 1 Champion and 1 Companion role to each. Players then attempt to defeat the monsters by matching up to their stats (STR, MAG, and DEX), all the while playing different Hero cards and utilizing abilities to block other players from making the kill. At the end, when all the Monsters are defeated, the most courageous (and cunning) player with the most Coins wins.<br/><br/><br/>Super Mini Adventure is a Take That! style card game. Players play out combinations of different Hero cards to defeat monsters, while utilizing the different abilities on those cards to gain the upper hand. Construct combos and chain abilities, to set yourself up not only for the kill, but also to block and prevent your opponent from doing the same. Simple to learn, but with deep layers of strategies that will have you coming back for more!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Planetaire is a astronomy-themed educational rummy-type card game for one to four players. This description will focus on the 2 to 4 player game, but there are also variants for one player or for 4 players on 2 teams. When playing with 2 or more people, the object of the game is to be the first player to make The Grand Tour by collecting all 9 planetary suites, including Pluto as a planet since the game was published before 2006. In case of a tie (2 or more players completing The Grand Tour in the same round), the player who completed the Grand Tour who has the most points wins. A planetary suite consists of a planet and all of its moons. For the sake of not making the sets impossible, the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune each have 4 moons in this game. The moonless Mercury and Venus count as complete sets by themselves. The planets are categorized as inner or outer based on their position relative to the main Asteroid Belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.<br/><br/>The game has 92 playing cards, a pad of scoring sheets, a rules booklet, and 4 reference cards, which list all the cards needed for each of the 9 suites. The set of cards are color-coded by type, and each planet is also in a different color to make it easier to see what goes together. There are 2 of each planet and the 20 moons used in this game, and 1 each of 8 asteroids and 8 comets. There are also 10 wild cards which can serve in place of other cards, 2 each of 5 different types. The two Planet X cards will substitute for planets. The other 8 wild cards can all substitute for moons, with 4 of them also being usable for an asteroid, the other 4 for a comet. There are also 8 action cards, 4 which reverse the player order and give the person playing the card an extra turn, and 4 which discard a moon card (you can either discard one yourself, or make the next player discard one before beginning their turn, which can result in some complications if they don't have any moons or moon wild cards in their hand). Action cards are played by discarding them at the end of your turn (if you choose to use the discard moon card on yourself, you get to discard that card and one of your moons, with the moon card on top in the discard pile).<br/><br/>During each turn, you start by drawing until you have 10 cards in your hand (at game start, you have 9). So the smaller your hand is at the beginning of your turn, the better are your chances to draw cards you need. You can then lay down any number of comets and asteroids, up to the maximum of 2 of each, but can only lay down the planet and moon cards when you have a complete set of the same color - a planetary suite, or enough wild cards to substitute for the cards you don't have. You can use any number of wild cards in making a set but cannot play 2 of the same moon in a suite - but must have 1 of each or a suitable wild card. You can also pick up wild cards or complete planetary suites if you can replace them from your hand. You don't need to replace a Wild Card in order to pick it up if it was acting as a comet or asteroid. You can use a planet you scored in a previous round, which is called Retro-Touring. Laying down a previously scored planetary suite does not earn you more points but can serve the player doing this in several ways. You end each turn by discarding a card from your hand, whether or not you laid down any cards on the table. You can not have more than 2 asteroids, 2 comets, 1 Inner Planetary Suite, and 1 Outer Planetary Suite laid down on the table at the same time. If you have all of these in front of you, you are said to &quot;Go Out&quot; and the round ends immediately.  When one player completes all the cards to Go Out, ending the round, all the other players are then said to be Set. &quot;Set&quot; players are penalized for the point value of the cards in their hand. You count up the points of all the cards you laid down, with the planets and Planet X on the table being multiplied by 10, and then everyone except the player Going Out have to subtract the point value of the cards in their hand (planets are at face value for this portion of the scoring). This can result in a negative score. Most of the wild cards have a value of 0, with the exception of the 2 Planet X cards, which are worth 10. The moons, asteroids, and comets are worth 1. Action cards in the hand of a &quot;set&quot; player cost them two points. The planets increase in point value from 1 to 9 based on distance from the Sun (so Mercury is 1, Pluto is 9, etc). Usually one player is designated as the scorer and writes down everyone's points at the end of each round. You only score for a completed planetary suite the first time you use that particular planet.<br/><br/>The rulebook suggests that a different player should be dealer in each round. The Dealer rotates counter-clockwise in each round, and the players also go in this order, with the player to the right of the dealer going first. This direction is used because it corresponds with the orbits of the planets around the sun. This brings up some of the other educational aspects of this game. Each of the cards has a photograph or art of the object, and a few interesting facts about the object pictured. The Wild Cards are named after and depict other objects in the Solar System that are not in the normal cards. There is also more information and many website links of other educational resources in the rulebook.<br/><br/>There is a Solitaire version of the game, in which there is no point scoring or shuffling of cards within a round, the planets have to be obtained in a specific order, you deal cards and draw to a Phantom player (which are not available until you shuffle for the next round), and there are also 9 cards permanently discarded at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A press-your-luck card game of sci-fi goodness.<br/><br/>You are the captain of a salvage ship. It isn't glamorous but it is profitable. The salvage of a lifetime just drifted into nearby space. Unfortunately, you're not the only salvage crew to respond. Since you all arrive at the derelict together, interstellar salvage laws apply. Within the ship are dangers and rewards alike, just waiting for you.<br/><br/>In this fast-paced game of risk-taking and decision-making, you and up to four additional players try to claim the most salvage from the derelict ship before its failing engines finally explode. You'll go room to room gathering up salvage and avoiding deadly hazards. Will you get out of the derelict and tuck away your acquired salvage, or press your luck against the growing threat of the deadly hazards?<br/><br/>This game can be played in under 30 minutes and is simple enough to be grasped by young players. Older players, however, will enjoy it even more as they weigh the odds and make their decisions.<br/><br/>Each player is a faction that has an immunity, and the push your luck aspect comes from flipping the top card of the deck.  You can get salvage points that are evenly distributed among the players left on the ship and the left over goes to a kitty.  You can also flip over a hazard, which only kills you the second time a hazard of the same type is revealed.  Before you flip the next card, you have a tile that says, stay, or to back to ship. If you go back to ship, you keep the points that you have gathered and take the kitty points.  If you stay, you keep going until everyone dies or leaves for their ship.  There are five stages of the game.  Each stage you also shuffle an artifact and a black hazard which no one is immune to into the deck.  Each faction also has an artifact that will score them 20 points, whereas if you don't get your special artifact, it is only 10 points.  At the end of the five stages, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players collectively generate a creative prompt by playing a card game. This prompt outlines the kind of future that the thing-to-be-imagined comes from, specifies what part of society or culture it belongs to, describes the type of object that it is, and suggests an emotional reaction that it might spark in an observer from the present. Players must then each write a short description of an object that fits the constraints of the prompt. These descriptions are then read aloud (without attribution), and players vote on which description they find the most interesting, provocative, or funny. The winner of each round keeps the cards put into play for that round, and whoever has the most cards when the game ends is declared the overall winner.<br/><br/>",

Racers use their stamina, shift gears, make use of abilities like 'drafting' and 'sprinting' and strive to reach to the finish line first. The game makes use of unique mechanics like card interlocking, sliding and rotating cards, 3D like vertically folded racer cards to fit a fairly complex but tactical game in just 18 cards. The race is played on a track made up of 6 'track cards' which are either flat sections or climbs and descends of different gradients. Double sided track cards allow for a second more difficult track to be made from the backs of the cards giving replay ability to the game. There are 2 racers to chose from while they each have their own special abilities the other one does not have. You can play a big game of 3 laps or a short filler of 1 lap, so immerse yourself in the world of bike racing, micro style!<br/><br/>",

This game simulates the campaign at the battalion/division level. Each combat strength point of Divisions/brigades/regiments are represented by standard military unit symbols (with a few exceptions) and each combat strength point is equivalent to one combat maneuver battalion, while units represented by armoured vehicles consist primarily of battalions of tanks (or armoured cars, in the case of the cavalry/armoured car units)(armoured divisions, though having tanks, are still at least half infantry battalion units). The combat system is based on differential, rather than odds, as each combat unit fights one against one as opposed to a hex(es) unit aggregate vs unit aggregate. Corps/army artillery and air are separate components added to combat, as both played an important part in the struggle and really could not be factored into unit value.

        "description": "In this game, players take on the role of grizzly bears who are trying to collect their beloved honey. Yet, they can never get their precious without taking some risks. Not only are there furious wasps and bees ready for revenge but also their bear buddies may be casting a covetous eye and trying to snatch each others&rsquo; honey with their bear hands (no pun intended). There are different types of function cards in the game which allow the players to do different things such as finding out what is hidden in the beehives or taking another player&rsquo;s tile. Players can use their memory and deception skills to make full use of the different functions and turn it into a mind game, in which the winner will have outdone the others by tricking their opponents and earning the most honey. At the end of game, players score points for each honey tile that they own. The honey bee and wasps cause no instant harm to the players during the game, however if the players still have them in their baskets when the game ends, they will be penalized. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

And the outer system Space Law, the code of order that makes it illegal to abduct Humans, is poorly enforced.<br/><br/>Each player plays as one of four Alien species, each with a special power that will help them expand their control of the galaxy. Players must collect Flux Cores and abduct as many Humans as they can while expanding and maintaining their control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player plays an Action card and assigns its Action Points. Then, the player rolls three Energy Cubes (dice) and 'burns' the Energy Value (pips) at the various Power Cores around the board or Species card. Players must collect Flux Cores (+1VP), which are needed to abduct Humans (+2VP) and explore the galaxy (+VP), in order to earn VPs and win the game.<br/><br/>Action Cards also have a Combat Bonus that can be applied in a Space Battle, where the struggle for control is most apparent. Each Alien species also has a unique species trait that is also applied in a Space Battle. Players also struggle for control of the galaxy in a tug-of-war fashion on the Control track.<br/><br/>When the last Human has been abducted, the game is over. The player with the most VPs wins. Ties are settled with one last Space Battle, with the current VPs included as a combat bonus.<br/><br/>Requires 3 (or more) dice, 4 tokens, and all included files.<br/><br/>",

But they will not be idle for long.<br/><br/>Part of the challenge is running against the clock.

In Face Up Match Up place all cards face up on a table or smooth surface. Have an adult request a match. For instance, &ldquo;can you find the &ldquo;7s?&rdquo; Children can take turns or compete to see who finds the most matches. Or have the child pick up twelve cards in numeric order. For a more challenging game, turn the cards face down and play a memory matching game. Try to make matches by turning over two cards on each turn. If the cards match, take the cards. If they do not match turn them back over in the same place in the game. A challenging puzzle keeps the fun going for years to come.<br/><br/>Why families love this item:<br/>Make learning numbers fun with a girl&rsquo;s favorite theme &ndash; princesses! Colorful dancing princesses adorn each card. Each card includes the numeral, the number word, and a physical representation of the number in symbol. The compact box makes this a terrific take-along item.<br/><br/>",

Chronologically, a turn corresponds to about half an hour. At the end of the 10th turn the battle ends and the situation will be assessed using a scoring system. The resulting score will determine the outcome.<br/><br/>Combat results are resolved by the rolling of two six-sided dice, with various modifiers applied as detailed in the rules.

        "description": "Demi: Labyrinth of the Gods is a cooperative game where each player takes on the role of a modern day demigod (there are eight to choose from). These 2-4 players must then work together to navigate a labyrinth that shifts and changes as you play, while trying to accomplish the task of finding three ancient artifacts the gods have demanded in order to prove your worth and gain access to the exit - but there's a catch!  This labyrinth is filled with mythic monsters and traps...<br/><br/>This is a tile-based game.  A grid of thirty face-down tiles represent rooms within the labyrinth.  Players move together as one, flipping over a room to move into it, one room at a time.  To represent the fact that the Labyrinth is always in motion, when the players enter a new room they choose the orientation of that room (provided one entrance/exit points back the way they came).  They then replace the room they came from with a room from the next difficulty tier.<br/><br/>Within each room they draw from an encounter deck and face off against monsters out of Greek mythology, traps, or if lucky - a pile of resources they can use to upgrade their gear or utilize their special abilities.<br/><br/>Each of the eight demigods has three special abilities:  A Free Ability they can utilize anytime the text applies, a Cost Ability they can pay resources they've gathered to activate, and a Coin-Flip ability they receive later in the game, letting them tempt the fates for a positive or potentially negative outcome.<br/><br/>Winning means reaching opposite corners three times to gather the three artifacts, then back once more to find the exit - the shifting rooms that are constantly replaced as you progress means player tactics in room orientation to determine the route become a deciding factor in the group's ability to make it out alive.<br/><br/>",

Each player will try to put together the best movie-making teams in order to maximise the profit from each movie they make.<br/><br/>As movie producers, players will hire cast and crew from a central shared market, while trying to deny their opponent access to key cast and crew members. Once a player has assembled a set of cast and crew cards, they will play these cards to produce a movie from a shared set of screenplays. Each screenplay has its own set of cast requirements and awards cash and other bonuses, based on the quality of the production. The richest player at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Director's Cut: The Card Game is a game about set collection and resource management. It's suitable for 2 players and takes around 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

Manage your cards and playing pieces to win!<br/><br/>The playing field consists of blank (black) hexes and numbered/lettered (purple) hexes that represent cards from a standard playing card deck.  Be the first player (at the end of your turn) to properly align your pawns on the playing field hexes so they individually match every card in your hand.  <br/>Ex: If a player has a 4, 5, and 9 in their hand, their pawns must be on a 4, 5, and 9.  If a players has a 6, 6, and J in their hand, their pawns must be on a 6, 6, and J.<br/><br/>Set-Up:<br/>Standard game: Place the starting hex in the middle and then around that, the same number of Playing Field hexes as there are players.  The Playing Field hexes are oriented so the middle playing line is connected to the Starting hex and additional playing lines are able to connect to Playing Field hexes to the right and left (if they are being used).  <br/>Modified game (Number and/or Placement of Playing Field hexes): To make the game harder or easier, you can use less or more Playing Field hexes than the number of players.  Additionally, Playing Field hexes need not be connected to each other.  Example (on back page): You could have three Playing Field Hexes and neither of them connect.  Note:  It is recommended the number of Playing Field hexes should not be more or less than one, from the numbers of players.  Example: If there are 6 players and only 3 Playing Field hexes, the game could get congested.<br/><br/>Modified game (Number of Pawns/Cards per Person):  To make the game harder or easier, players can start off with more or less than 3 pawns.  Each player must be dealt the same number of cards as they have pawns.<br/><br/>Pawn Movement:<br/>Ace through 10, move one pawn a respective number of hexes: A = 1 hex, 2 = 2 hexes, 3 = 3 hexes, 4 = 4 hexes, &hellip;. 9 = 9 hexes, 10 = 10 hexes.<br/>Jack = Move an opponent&rsquo;s pawn 5 hexes.<br/>Queen = Move one or more of your pawns a total of 5 hexes.<br/>King = Move one of your pawns anywhere from 1 to 5 hexes.<br/>Joker = Everyone&rsquo;s cards/hand are passed to the right.  Note: No pawns are moved.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The German raid on Astrakhan marks the eastern-most limit of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during WWII. What is remarkable is the small number of German units assigned to this sector, just the 16th Motorized Infantry (Greyhound) division, given the frontage and lack of substantial information regarding the Soviet&rsquo;s forces. It was due to this lack of intelligence about the Soviet&rsquo;s intentions and movements that the division&rsquo;s reconnaissance battalion, along with some sympathetic Cossacks, was sent out from Elista on September 13th. The unit&rsquo;s four day raid took them 90 miles beyond the Axis occupied village to the outskirts of Astrakhan during which they destroyed a fuel train, gathered intelligence about the nature of the Soviet&rsquo;s forces, and set off alarms in the region that sent STAVKA scrambling to deal with the threat.<br/><br/>Greyhound vs. Bear portrays the German raid and Soviet response in a quick playing and easy to learn mini-game. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve combats. The game is also easy to play solitaire.<br/><br/>",

The game is published in an English / Japanese edition.<br/><br/>The players take turns to play cards from their hands to a central discard pile (as in the game UNO). The cards have instructions, such as &quot;Make circular motions with your arms&quot;  and so on. If a player is unable to play any card, they must continue to perform the action written on the top card on the discard pile, while continuing to play the game. The first player who empties their hand is the winner, and the last player holding cards is the loser.<br/><br/>Publisher summary:<br/>「手を回す」など様々な行動が書かれた手札をウノのように場に出していきます。手札を場に出せなくなったプレイヤーは場に最初に出た札に書かれた動きをとりながらゲームを続けなければなりません。手札がなくなったプレイヤーから勝者となり、最後まで場に残ったプレイヤーが敗者となります。<br/><br/>",

Players will take on the role of parasites and their respective hosts in an attempt to gain or steal the most points by the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played with a deck of cards containing a set of colored host cards for each player numbered 2,3,4 and 5. The deck also contains special action cards, one for each player.<br/><br/>Players will also receive four parasite tokens of their selected color valued 1,2,3 and 4. The players colored host cards and parasite tokens represent potential points.<br/><br/>The game starts with one card turned face up next to the draw pile. Drawn cards will be placed next to this card. A new row will start after five cards have been drawn.<br/><br/>On your turn players can (1) place a parasite on a host card, (2) move a parasite to an adjacent host or action card, (3) draw a card to place in play or (4) pass.<br/><br/>Drawing a card will activate a scoring phase. All previous cards are then evaluated for scoring condition. Cards of your color without any parasite tokens score the full value for the player. Cards with parasites where the value of the parasites are of less than value that the host card it is on will score points for the owner of the parasite and card owner. EXAMPLE: A three green parasite on a five blue host card will score three points for green and two points for blue.<br/><br/>Cards where the total of the parasites is equal to or more than the host card total, will NOT score for either player. Action cards allow players to perform a special action like move other players tokens or look through the deck.<br/><br/>The game is over when all the cards have been drawn and placed into the play area. The player with the highest point after all the cards have been drawn is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The 74-guns Argonauta was a ship-of-the-line of the Spanish Armada that had previously served in the French Navy under the name Argonaute and participated to the battle of Trafalgar. She was transferred to the Spanish fleet in 1806 in exchange for the Vencedor. After a short career, it was used as prison ship in C&aacute;diz during the French siege of the city. On 26th of May, French prisoners broke their mooring lines and ship went adrift and wrecked. In order to prevent the French from using it, British and Spanish sent gunners boats to set fire to the ship: Argonauta was destroyed by flames and sunk on 29th of May 1810. This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish T&eacute;m&eacute;raire Class ship-of-the-line &quot;Heroe 1808&quot;. Each Sails of Glory Ship Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other Sails of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the ship: a special base with gaming stats, a ship log and a specific deck of maneuver cards. The ship base, ship card and ship log are printed on two sides - The game data of a second ship is printed on the back.<br/><br/>",

As a small start-up company with a truck, an office and a dream you are throwing you hat into the ring to challenge the big boys. The freight has to be moved and there is competition for who can get to loads first and who can make the most profitable routes. But watch out, Smokey is on the prowl. So put the hammer down and let it all hang out. You have to get loaded up &amp; truckin&rsquo;.<br/><br/>As a player, you represent a small but growing trucking company seeking to pick up and deliver goods in the most efficient manner possible. Amassing money is one way to achieve victory, but there are other ways to score as well. It is important to dominate a region or two with the most deliveries while not ignoring the other regions. In the end, your deliveries will be compared to the other players to determine which company has the best overall presence in the US.<br/><br/>Players gain presence by moving their trucks from city to city across the United States picking up and dropping off deliveries along the way. You can specialize in high profit cross-country runs or you can make numerous short routes. On each turn the vagaries of the business will be determined by a deck of event cards. Each player will then get to buy new hubs and trucks before setting out to scoop up goods before a rival comes along and 'steals' the load.<br/><br/>",

New cards aren&rsquo;t drawn or played &ndash; no table needed!<br/><br/>A modern man, done with his day&rsquo;s work, steps out of his office tower&rsquo;s lobby into the busy bustle of a city sidewalk. Just as he is getting his bearings set towards home, he collides with someone.  He apologizes profusely.  She politely excuses herself.

This first adventure within the Netherwood explores the mouse rangers of the Northern Waywatch Chapters. Hailing from within the slate walls of the Keystone Fortress, they maintain eternal vigil over their sacred wardens. The legendary hero of the Watch, Chaptermaster Gorix Stormfeather, is preparing plans in the candlelit chambers of his fortress for the defense of his realm. His brave rangers patrol the borders, bracing for a clash that will inevitably come. The fist tightening its grip around their way of life is that of the Shadow King himself, the pale rat Vermithrang, and his legion of rodent warriors.<br/><br/>The Shieldbash system narrows its vision towards the small-scale conflicts of 5-15 fighters per side, involved in Skirmishes depicting a particular encounter between warbands. These encounters may be isolated or part of a Tale, a linked series of encounters where characters and conditions carry over from one fight to the next. Bash can be played on a battlefield as small as 2&rsquo;x2&rsquo;. A fighter is usually a single warrior on a 20mm (or 40mm) base, but it can also be a beast or group of lesser warriors. Defined by a few, simple attributes and abilities, each fighter is uniquely suited to his role on the battlefield, without bogging down the commander with unnecessary complication.<br/><br/>During a Round of battle each player will take turns as the active commander. His opponent will draw a Stone for him on his turn, allowing him to assign Surges to his fighters. These Surges allow the fighters to perform actions, which include moving about the battlefield, attacking enemy fighters, or other tasks performed in pursuit of victory. In addition, each commander has access to the resource Mischief. Mischief allows a commander to perform extra movement, modify a die roll, or execute other minor actions that enable him to bend the rules to his favor. However, the active commander&rsquo;s opponent must agree upon the expenditure of Mischief, creating a dynamic of haggling and compromise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game played with traditional deck of cards, with some small elements of poker.<br/><br/>The deck is divided in two: Red Cards &amp; Black Cards.<br/>One player takes all the black cards, while the other takes all red cards. They will each play with their own deck throughout the whole game - never mixing them.<br/>Players will separate the face cards (J, Q, K) and keep them in their hands at all times. The rest are shuffled.<br/><br/>Both players will pick 3 cards from their own shuffled deck.<br/>Immediately after, they will choose to play either Queen or King as their &quot;Warlord&quot; for that round. They will place 1 Queen or 1 King face down and reveal them at the same time.<br/>If a player has chosen a Queen, they can (but are not obligated to) discard 1 card from their hand and take 1 new one from their deck.<br/>If they have chosen a King, they can do this up to 3 times.<br/>The face card is kept in front of them.<br/><br/>Now it's time for battle.<br/>Each player selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. They then reveal the card at the same time and lay it in front of them.<br/>This is done until the three cards have been played.<br/>The player with the highest ranking 'combo' wins the battle. Combos are valued similarly to poker, but only with 3 cards. Below is the ranking order:<br/>1.   3 of a kind<br/>2.   Straight (3 numbers in consecutive order)<br/>3.   Flush (same suit)<br/>4.   2 of a kind<br/>5.   Card (highest number)<br/><br/>The winning player will take the defeated player's warlord and put it aside as a trophy.<br/>Game ends when one of the players runs out of warlords.<br/><br/>Players can use their Jacks to surrender in a battle. Jacks can be played instead of a number card (with the same behavior - keeping it hidden until both players reveal their card).<br/>If a player surrenders with a Jack, he/she will lose all the number cards he/she has already laid down (not the ones in his/her hand), plus the Jack that triggered the surrender. But he/she will save their warlord.<br/><br/>If there is a draw during battle (or two players play a Jack), nothing happens. Players take their corresponding cards and continue to the next round.<br/><br/>Players must shuffle all their number cards after every round (except for the ones they have lost, of course).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wonderluette  is a poker style card game that uses Aluette Card Game suits (Clubs, Coins, Cups, and Swords) and special action cards called Wonder Cards designed from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The game is to be played by 2 - 6 players and each round can take up to twenty minutes. The object of the game is to be the first player to get a Flush, thus winning the round.<br/><br/>So the story goes, after the death of the Jabberwocky the residents of Wonderland had a lot of stress off their shoulders. The game was created by the Mad Hatter to give people something to do with their newly found recreational time. With this new lack of stress, they needed something to help become stressful again, this was the answer to that dilemma. After Alice's Adventure Underground, the Hatter decided to create the game using Aluette designs, that consists of no queen cards nor the suit of hearts. He thought this best since everyone was still getting over the events, but did like the idea of the added stress. Initially the game was designed for three rounds, but that did not deem stressful enough and has been increased to five rounds. The winner of the round is simply the first to get a Flush (cards with all matching suits), the player with the most wins in the five rounds--keeps the deck. Only one deck exists in Wonderland so this was the best way to ensure everyone could own a copy.<br/><br/>While Lewis Carroll may not have conceptualized this game in his works, we have taken it upon ourselves to do so. The majority of the cards in the game are traditional Poker Cards, the Action Cards include imagery from the original book and the artwork in the game is originally by Arthur Rackham.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>1. Cards are shuffled and scattered in a pool in the middle of the Tabletop.<br/>2. Each player grabs five cards from the pool.<br/>3. During their turn a player may use a Wonder Card or Discard a Card, then draw again from the pool.<br/>4. The object of the game is to get a flush, once someone gets a flush they win the round.<br/>5. The best of five rounds is declared the overall winner.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you roll a die and extend your wall of stones by that number. When you place stones, you place the first one on a square adjacent to any one of your stones, then place each of the remaining stones adjacent to the stone you placed last. If that square, or the line of squares beyond, are occupied by opponents' stones, instead you skip these squares and place your stone on the nearest empty square beyond them. In this case, you pick up all the stones skipped over and gain victory points. But beware. When you pick up opponents' stones, you leave a gap between your walls, which is vulnerable to their counter-attack.<br/><br/>At the center of the board, there are large obstacles you can use as your defense, and bonus stones which can be scored like opponents' stones.<br/><br/>A game consists of rounds equal to the number of players, and a round ends when three minutes of real time have passed. Everything on the gameboard is held over to the next rounds, with an exception at the beginning of the final round, when the stones on four corners are removed from the board, allowing the potential of big points.<br/><br/>At the end of the final round, the player who has picked up the most stones wins the game.<br/><br/>This game comes with a sandglass to keep track of time, and an original music CD which goes well with the atomosphere of the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>古代エジプト が舞台。シンプルなルールと奥深いゲーム性が特徴の砂時計を使った新感覚の石取りゲーム。オリジナル音楽CDも付いており、音楽とともにゲームを楽しめる、五感の遊戯。ゲーム内容は時計回りにサイコロを振って出た目の数だけ持ち石を盤上に置き、他のプレイヤーの石を挟んで取ります。砂時計の砂がすべて落ちきる時間（3分間）を1ラウンドとし、規定のラウンド数（2人プレイの場合＝2ラウンド、3人プレイの場合＝3ラウンド、4人プレイの場合＝4ラウンド）が終了するまでに石を一番多く取ったプレイヤーの勝ちです。<br/><br/>(Using Google Translate on the above Kanji text gives us:  &quot;Ancient Egypt stage.

June, 1941, as a German platoon leader you will fight your way across Russia in a tactical tour de force. Each month you will take part in engagements against a random number of Soviet squads and accumulate victory points which facilitate promotion, unit upgrades and awards.  Single, tournament style engagements or one of two campaigns may be played.  Designed from the ground up as a solitaire system, the game's brain is an innovative hex template that is used for unit placement.  This primary system works in concert with a proven chit pull sub-system and action charts which dictate if an enemy unit moves (if so what direction) fires, or does nothing. The map is framed by a slew of information which you must keep track of including: squad action points, leader action points, sudden death track, sniper track, month track, weather, initial German deployment, expected level of enemy resistance, engagement type (three possible types), arty/air strikes, and a victory point track.  The map is a generic, base map upon which terrain tiles are configured according to the given scenarios or simply your own whim! Combat is comprised of a combat results table that determines the number of step losses and subsequent pinned, suppressed or broken results.  Or, you may chuck the primary combat engine for an alternative &quot;buckets&quot; of dice combat engine!  Close combat is brutal and there are no guarantees in this game. Units will often have to roll to perform an action,and at game start, you will have to spot an enemy before you can fire at it. Finally, all of this occurs on a modest 7x9 hex grid!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battlefield 2-player card game from NewVenture Games has been popular for some time. The American Civil War edition commemorates the 150th anniversary of that great conflict, the cards being completely redesigned to depict army units, officers, and civilians from the 1860s. One player assumes the role of the Union, the other plays Confederate units, meeting on the field of battle. In skirmish after skirmish, players deploy their forces card after card, fighting gallantly for their nation's survival.<br/><br/>Each of the two decks contain 72 cards, from the volunteer infantry with aged muskets, to the advanced firepower of artillery and cavalry. Famous generals take to the field, supported by the Corps of Engineers, civilian support groups, and even the President may make an appearance. Hope to avoid disease and inclement weather, and hope for a prisoner exchange or timely reinforcements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many Parsecs of Space (working title but yes - pun intended!) is an upcoming space 4X game that reimplements Martin Wallace's innovative deck building mechanic from A Few Acres of Snow. Anyone familiar with AFAoS or Mythotopia will be playing MPoS in minutes, though it's far from a simple reskinning. MPoS takes the core mechanic in an entirely new direction by introducing exploration and trade in a multi-player science fiction setting. Location (world) cards are variable and hidden at setup and revealed only when explored. This is not only thematic, but creates infinite replayability and solves the dominant strategy issues (ex. Halifax's Hammer) that can plague low luck games with a static setup. Trading with your neighbor is essential because nearby star systems may lack the resources you need to expand your empire.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES:<br/><br/>     Unique sentient races for asymmetrical play.<br/>     Secretly customize your race beforehand so other players won't know what they're up against until first contact!<br/>     Choose a government and economy that allows you to discard, reserve, and remove cards according to your playing style. <br/>     A world suitable for your race to colonize may not be for your neighbor. One race's garbage is another race's treasure!<br/>     Technology cards function like empire cards from AFAoS but with the added wrinkle of a tech tree.<br/>     Steal resources and technology from your neighbor or trade partner with piracy and espionage.<br/>     5 scarce resources (energy, metals, military, organics, and science) must be acquired so trading is a MUST to efficiently grow your empire.<br/>     Discover ancient artifacts on dead planets and worm holes that connect distant star systems.<br/>     Terraform tide locked worlds to make them suitable for colonization.<br/>     Invade an outpost or colony to make it your own or NUKE it so nobody can colonize it!<br/><br/><br/>",

Therefore, at the beginning of the game all 25 buildings are laid out on the table, ready to be torn down and blown up. Of course, this work is not done by itself but you need trustworthy workers like Slobodan, Leonid or Hao Wech. During each game round each player buys one of these at an auction, and thus equipped with the required devices they can demolish a building, provided the following conditions are met: the player is able to get rid of the construction waste (legally or illegally &ndash; the main point is: away with it!) and there are sufficient vacant spaces next to the building. Of course the nuclear power plant in the heart of the city is harder to break into pieces than the hot-dog stand just next to the city limits sign. This edition introduces the bureaucrats. They can be useful with their special permits if once and again there is not enough space to demolish a building. A successful demolition results in a demolition award for the player and they keep the tile for scoring at the end of the game. Who would not like to blow the revenue office to pieces and thus earn a little tax refund? That way the buildings vanish one after the other until there are only 2 or less left standing. The player who has demolished the most valuable buildings is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Abriss takes about 45 minutes to play, the game mechanism is easy to understand and there is little downtime. The auction of subcontractors and bureaucrats provides interaction and is kept simple - there are only 3 possible bids. With the random set-up, each game offers a new challenge for the players.<br/><br/>The new edition includes bureaucrats and the expansion ABRISS-AUFTR&Auml;GE/DEMOLITION-CONTRACTS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In April of 1948 soviet forces halted the supply of Berlin in the British zone then went on to block land routes in the American zone. This was easy to do since Berlin itself lay deep in the Russian zone. Two million civilians dependent on allied supply watched delivery slow to a trickle. Requiring a daily minimum of 5000 tons of food, fuel, and other necessities, Berliners began dipping into their reserves. American officials estimated they would run out of fuel in 45 days but would run out of food long before that.<br/>The Allies faced a difficult decision. Abandoning the city would be a huge loss of face that could lead to the eventual loss of all of Germany to the communist bloc. On the other hand, with all land routes into Berlin cut the city could only be supplied by air, and was such a thing even possible? The Soviets didn't think so. When the blockade commenced, Americans were only capable of delivering 300 tons of supply a day. Together with the British who could manage 400 daily tons. Officials admitted the tonnage still fell woefully short.<br/><br/>Supplying a major city by air for an indefinite amount of time? Nothing approaching it had ever been attempted. Despite the overwhelming odds, the Allies determined to give it a go. Veteran pilots and aircrews were recalled as disbanded cargo units were refitted and flown back to Europe. The effort was massive... no, it was beyond massive, nevertheless, Stalin was certain the operation would fail. His determined opponents proved him wrong. This Herculean effort is remembered as the West's most selfless accomplishment.<br/><br/>Over the course of 12 months the airlift provided 2,225,510 tons of cargo for the city's survival. At one point an airlift plane was lifting off every four minutes. In the end, more supply was provided to Berlin by air than could have been provided by rail. The Soviets did not stand passively by. There were 726 recorded instances of Soviet harassment involving everything from aerial buzzing, and ground fire to rockets, chemicals, smoke and balloons. In the course of the airlift 25 aircraft were lost, costing the lives of over 100 American, British and German personnel. And during the course of the airlift, many curious and heartwarming incidents enhanced the legend of their effort, including the candy bomber, the tour of Clarence the camel and the Easter Parade.<br/><br/>The Berlin Airlift is a historical treasure begging to be gamed and here we attempt to fit the bill. But a game is only as enjoyable as the conflict it portrays. The game pits players against each other in a race against the clock. Can players overcome accidents, miscommunication and soviet interference to achieve their goals? Who can deliver the most tonnage, and will it be enough for Berliners to survive? Naturally, Berlin Airlift is only representative of the larger enterprise, but in it, players will enjoy tense competition as they face all of the elements these brave allied aircrews faced when the war ended and - the blockade began.<br/><br/>Players will command either a British or American air squadron. Each squadron consists of up to three flights depending upon the number of people playing. Each flight contains from 3 to 5 period aircraft depending upon the scenario and the faction being played. Individual planes have a rated capacity and in some cases are restricted to carrying fuel. The object for each player is to attempt to carry his squadron's tonnage goals in fuel, food, medicine and spare parts into the city and carry refugees and finished products out (cargo is represented by colored cubes). Each turn the ACTIVE player rolls two dice, consults either the Personality chart, the Help &amp; Hindrance or the Soviet Harassment Chart to determine effects, then begins drawing flight chits to determine who moves when. Strategy enters into the Active player's assignment of problems, decision making as to what to carry and who to fix, what base to return to and how to block opponents from reaching their goals. Oh, but players must be careful, for there is a cooperative aspect to the game. Players have to keep up the Berliner Morale for if it remains in the negative range after the final flight has delivered its cargo Berlin loses and so do all players.<br/><br/>",

One in particular is a Black Rabbit, which is where they get their name from.<br/><br/>The producer of the dice has five different rulesets for the dice in order to play a variety of games with them. They also encourage you to come up with your own games to play with them to make them your own.<br/><br/>The rule sets are:<br/><br/>1. Pass. Where the players roll one of the die and they have to incorporate the image rolled into the ever growing story of the group.<br/>2. Vacation. Which is a memory game where each player rolls a die from their pool and says what they saw on vacation based on what is on the die. Each player does this but has to remember what each previous thing rolled was. Failing to remember a previous roll forces you to give a die to your opponent. The last person with dice wins.<br/>3. Story telling. A fake it until you make it game. You roll a number of the die and make a story with all the images rolled, trying to tell a coherent story.<br/>4. Compound. Where you roll two dice and then you have to come up with a compound word related to the two die rolls. <br/>5. Synonyms. A game where you roll a number of dice and then pick two dice to make a synonym based on those two dice. You score points every time you successfully come up with a synonym. Play to a agreed score or a number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

During the Ferry Phase, players move their ferries along the river Acheron.<br/><br/>Different souls (Lovers, Families, Spartans, Merchants, etc.) have different movement rates, restrictions, special abilities and delivery fares. Players vie to maneuver beneficial combinations of souls onto their ferry and detrimental combinations onto their opponents' ferries.<br/><br/>The monsters Cetus (a many-tentacled river horror), and Cerberus (guardian of the Gates of Hades) pose a hazard to players. Three random Gods &amp; Goddesses are in play each game. Players who sacrifice the most bulls to a God or Goddess receive their favor; players who sacrifice the fewest bulls receive their wrath. Favor is generally beneficial and wrath is generally harmful. Effects vary by God or Goddess and have a large impact on gameplay. A key component of strategy is that nearly any positive effect can be negative in some circumstances and vice versa. For example, an upgraded ferry is larger than the default ferry, but may take more turns to load.<br/><br/>A player wins the game when they deliver nine souls to the Gates of Hades or accumulate 30 coins worth of money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Over: Remix is the sequel to last year's successfully funded Game Over. It's a card game that mixes fast paced battles with dozens of video game inspired characters and items. Accommodating 2 - 6 players, rounds last 30 minutes each with gameplay specifically designed around replay value. The 198 card game is a mix between random chance and thought provoking strategy.<br/><br/>Game protagonists are simple creatures. They're programmed to either kill, collect points, or find treasure. So when the TV goes OFF and they're left to their own devices, they continue trying to do just that. The characters refer to these achievements simply as &quot;Wins&quot;, and their thirst for them is insatiable. In Game Over, each player will take control of three characters to compete for a win in 1 of 3 ways.<br/><br/><br/>     Last Man Standing: Player's are knocked out of the game once all 3 of their characters have died. Be the last to survive for this win scenario.<br/>     High Score: Gems can be collected throughout the game for bonus points. Be the first to accumulate 25 or more points to win this way.<br/>     Quest Complete: There are 3 enchanted golden items hiding within the deck. The first player to find all of them has completed their quest and won the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

Take a hawk for every hawk on a chicken card you get during an auction (not in case of payment by another player). At the end of the game, every hawk eats a mouse (and a blind hen, if there is no mouse in your display) and every surviving mouse eats a corn.<br/>Mission/Job cards: draw randomly two or three of these cards and keep them secret from the other players. When scoring, prove that you have met the requirements of your mission cards and earn additional points. Missions are different, for example collect a minimum of specific cards (value 1, 2, 3 or 4) or a sequence in a common color (green 1-2-3-4).<br/><br/>",

There are 3 levels of play, basic, advanced, and full.  <br/>2. The advanced level adds player controlled 2-, 5-, and 10-share companies twisting the availability of shares and the benefits of lots of early cash.  It also adds an auction for starting companies which evens out the initial priority.<br/>3. The full game adds bonds (basically loans from players to companies).  Bonds do not count against the certificate limit giving early cash an added benefit and giving companies another way to raise money.<br/>4. Although, in theory, train maintenance reduces the stress of the train rush, limiting the number of all trains (including the biggest brown trains) means the late train rush is brutal, often going from the first brown train to the last in less than one OR.<br/><br/>Replayability and scaling by player count is also covered:<br/><br/>1. Although the basic map is static, 4 of the 7 big dollar city locations vary from game to game.  In addition, players choose their starting city when they start their RR.  All this changes optimal routes from game to game.<br/>2. The size of the map and the tile count scales by the number of players.  This also changes which big dollar cities and which RRs are included from game to game.<br/><br/>Play time:<br/>The game is designed to be from 90 - 180 minutes although it needs repeated plays to achieve.<br/><br/>",

They influence your combat strategies but you cannot include them in your deck: they are placed, face down, beside the game table.<br/>3. Equipment: weapons and armor. They have special effects which influence your strategies. As with Objects, they cannot be part of your deck: they are instead placed, face up, beside the game table.<br/><br/>Each match round takes place through five simultaneous phases;  Turn's beginning &rsaquo; Card drawing &rsaquo; Movement  &rsaquo; Combat  &rsaquo; Turn's End. You have to choose you cards for the whole combat round in advance and your cannot change any cards after the round has started. In the world of Mastery, the deck is representing your character profile. Constructing your character profile is here summarized within these three rules:<br/><br/>1. The character profile must be formed by no less than 30 cards and no more than 50.<br/>2. You can only include cards marked with the class your character belongs to (exceptions are possible on some game variations).<br/>3. Object and Equipment cards should not be part of your deck. But you can choose and bring with you to a match 2 object cards, placed down beside the board. You can freely select Equipment cards as long as the total number of occupancy (parameter written on the Equipment card) for all the equipment chosen is equal to or less than 5.<br/><br/>The combat rounds continue until either of the champions has fallen and the winner has become a hero!<br/><br/>",

Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly trained forces, led to a German pincer attack which cut off advancing Soviet troops from the rest of the front.

        "description": "With a Purpose is the next supplement book for the modular Victory By Any Means campaign system with a focus on objectives and goals. Campaigns have a tendency to focus on goals and exclude the story element. This expansion has a more granular scope, focusing on a commodore instead of a supreme commander. Instead of an open ended campaign, players are working to achieve victory points.<br/><br/>This is done by defining the major objectives given to the players from their central government. Additionally, players will receive high priority missions that need to be completed. Campaign Moderators will have more freedom to explore the motivations of an empire, becoming a true 5x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate, eXplore, and eXplain). With A Purpose supports a number of players and team play for those players who wish to try cooperative campaign games.<br/><br/>Since players represent low level commanders than a typical Victory by Any Means campaign, the scope of the degree is altered. Campaign turns represent shorter periods of time and each ship and ground unit is all the more precious to pull off the work given from their central command. The area will simply have more territory to explore as these campaigns include more minor systems that may exist between all the important campaign worlds in a normal game. Players must be ever vigilant of their actions and careful to control the amount of tension in the region.<br/><br/>",

Each player builds food chains by connecting various Arctic species cards including polar bear, walrus, ringed seal and narwhal.  Event cards such as carbon pollution occur, which melt sea ice and cause some animals to migrate or die.  Players can also play Action cards in order to help protect their food chains.  The player who keeps the most animals alive wins.

The first player to move 4 of his pieces to his opponent's side wins the game. Passing is prohibited, so a player with no legal moves automatically loses. Blank pieces can always be used with no risk as they always move one space and are thus key to creating a winning strategy.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>４個の持ち駒を自陣から敵陣まで移動させる対戦型すごろくゲームです。<br/>バックギャモンのように自分の駒で敵の移動を妨害しながら交差して駒を進<br/>めるのが特徴です。駒の数字によって移動できるマス数が決まっています。<br/>早く４個の駒を相手陣地まで移動させれば勝ちですが、パスは禁止なので合<br/>法手が無ければ負けになります。<br/>無地駒は必ず１マス進めるので、これを安全パイに使いながら移動の戦術を<br/>組み立てます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a fight that largely determined the fate of eastern Kentucky, two small armies clashed along the swollen tributary of Middle Creek. An officer of some promise, Humphrey Marshall, generaled the CSA. A relative unknown commanded the USA by the name of James A. Garfield.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Marshall had no choice but to withdrawal. His supplies were thin and he was fearful of his army deserting. The battle unmade his reputation and he was barely heard from again. The Federals, conversely, celebrated a victory. Colonel Garfield earned a brigadiers star, and took the first step along the road that eventually led to the White House.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 28-Page Rules Book<br/>1 4-Page Exclusive Rules Book<br/>1 12-page Examples of Play and Glossary/Index<br/>140 half-inch full-color, die-cut counters<br/>1 22x17 Map/Playing Surface<br/>Charts and Tables<br/><br/>About the Rebel Yell! system<br/><br/>Rebel Yell! is a simulation of American Civil War small-unit tactics. The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.<br/><br/>There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &quot;problem of approach,&quot; in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &quot;modern&quot; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area. Rebel Yell is &quot;big&quot; only in the sense that it is detailed.<br/><br/>",

The most collected pairs wins.<br/><br/>Variant 3 - The Super Orgie<br/><br/>2 or more players. All cards and texts in use.<br/><br/>In this variant, the players flip over four of the 48 face down cards; when there is a match, the talks are read and have to be followed.

The map covers all of South Vietnam.  Cambodia and Laos are not depicted, and the Ho Chi Minh Trail is abstracted.  Turns are one season (three months) and units are brigade/regiment in strength, with assets such air air support represented as separate counters.  Communist units have face-down sides that hide their strength and US/Allied units must first detect them in order to attack.  Combat is odds-based.  The US can have a variable level of commitment, which is both influenced by and influences the US Public Support level.  Soviet/Chinese Commitment is also tracked. Thus, the game tracks outside geopolitical influences on the conflict. Victory is achieved by causing (or avoiding) the collapse of the South Vietnam government, which depends on Communist capture of key towns (which reduces the Stability Level) and presence of NLF Sanctuaries (which is compared to the Stability Level). There are four scenarios: a 44-turn campaign scenario covering the entire war, and an 8-turn scenario covering just the Tet Offensive and its aftermath, a 14-turn scenario covering the Vietnamization period from 1970-72, and a Final Countdown scenario depicting the end of the war from 1973-75, which lasts 12 turns.<br/><br/>",

It consists of amalgamated components of Game Designer's Workshops Europa series of military simulations, including Fall of France, Their Finest Hour, Narvik and Spain and Portugal. It uses the current rule set from Fire In the East, with some modifications, plus completely new (unofficial and experimental) air, naval and political rules. It models the strategic and operational options open to the Wehrmacht as its focus turned to the Western Allies.<br/>They may choose to repeat historical options, or find a new and more successful strategy. The scenario opens with the German Army redeployed after the dlsmemberment of Poland.

        "description": "Le zug is played on the dark squares of a 17x17 board (the four edge squares must be dark). A game starts with 12 pieces per player. Nine pieces of each color are placed on the first and the last row. In the first move (each player's first turn) the players put their three remaining pieces on the row next to their other pieces in any order they want them.<br/> After that players move at their turn one of their pieces diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Players also can jump over their own pieces or over those of their opponent (even combining both colors) similar to Halma but only diagonally forward. However, they don't have to jump, if they don't want to, and they can stop a jumping move anywhere, not making the largest jump possible. After the last jump they are allowed to move the piece, which did the jump, one square diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Again, this is not mandatory. No pieces are ever captured and the jumped pieces remain untouched.<br/><br/>The first four rows of each player are called their &quot;railway station&quot; (&quot;gare&quot; in French; &quot;Bahnhof&quot; in German). Players are not permitted to enter their opponent's railway station, before they have vaca&shy;ted their own one. After a player has entered all of his pieces into the opponent's railway station, he is allowed to move or jump backward to reach the final goal position, but only as long as all of his pieces remain in the opponent's railway station.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to place nine pieces on the last row and the remaining three pieces anywhere on the penultimate row, that is to recreate a valid start position on the opponent's side of the board.<br/><br/>The name of the game is French and German mixed together (&quot;le&quot; is the masculine French article; &quot;zug&quot; means train in German). The game is meant to celebrate friendship between the French and the German peoples after centuries of wars fought between them. It is related to Halma and Salta. Le zug was first described in the book &quot;Le livre de tous les jeux&quot; (Edition Solar), which was published in France on January 1, 1989.<br/><br/>",

It has become quite popular in Russia, where a lot of discussion is going on at several game forums. There are postal tournaments and numerous problems have been composed recently that show the beauty of this game.<br/><br/>The game has basically the same rules as Russian Checkers. However, captured pieces are placed beneath the capturing piece and so columns are formed (similar to Bashni). A king can only move if it captures. After the capture the king becomes a normal piece again unless it ends its turn on the opponent's back row. The game stops if a player cannot make a move. The winner is the player who has got more pieces of either color in the opponent's half of the board. The sum of all points is always 24.<br/><br/>Adijuh is played with a standard Chess board and Checkers pieces.<br/><br/>",

When you earn 1 gold your opponent loses 1 gold, and vice versa. This means when you buy extra ships or movement, you are giving your opponent gold in exchange for the advantage. You earn gold by sinking enemy ships, occupying gold mine spaces, having 3 Battle Coins at the end of your turn, and by praying to the volcano gods and successfully causing an eruption.<br/><br/>You start your turn by building your fleet, sailing, and declaring any battles you&rsquo;d like. When fighting, your Battle Strength is equal to the number of coins that make up your ship (ships can be built up to 3 coins high) plus any Battle Coins you commit. Three Battle Coins float between both players throughout the game. If you commit a Battle Coin to a battle, you have a higher Battle Strength for the current battle, but you must pass any committed Battle Coins to your opponent.<br/><br/>After the Battle Phase, your opponent decides if he or she wants to pray to the volcano gods. If your opponent prays, he or she shakes 3 Prayer Coins. The number of heads shaken moves the Volcano Track marker, which can cause an eruption. Ships within the Lava Danger Zone when the volcano erupts take damage depending on the severity of the eruption. After the Pray Phase, you end you turn by earning gold from any gold mine spaces you still occupy. Then play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>To create your free print-and-play copy of Volcano Cove, print the board and rules at VolcanoCove.com and find 10 pennies, 10 nickels, 5 dimes, and 3 quarters. You now have everything you need to challenge someone to your first game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple Campaigning is a 48-page A5 full colour booklet containing Campaign frameworks for Ancient and Medieval warfare, which can be played as boardgames or as bases for miniatures battles. Includes Solo Campaigning (the Rise of Rome), Angevin Empire, Across the Steppes (Mongol Conquests), The Millennium Campaign (11th Century Europe), Crisis of Rome (3rd Century AD), The Wolf on the Fold (Assyrian Empire), The Calamitous Fourteenth Century (late Medieval Europe).<br/><br/>Each of the seven Campaign wargames contains rules for re-creating the conflicts of a historical epoch and region, with counters on a map and using either a combat results table or miniatures.  They vary widely in complexity; some have minimal rules and can be played very quickly, while others have detailed political and/or economic rules.  The games are designed to entertain both historical boardgamers and miniatures buffs.  Several can easily be played solitaire.<br/><br/>The point of each game is to determine by die rolls where conflicts arise, fight the battles and compare the outcome with history.  Several include victory point tables so that players can measure their success against each other or, if playing solitaire, against the historical outcome - for example, can the player outdo the Lionheart and King John in holding the Angevin Empire together?<br/><br/>Some of the games can easily be completed in an hour, if using a combat results table; others take considerably longer, while all can last for many sessions if the battles are fought on the tabletop.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seizer's Chess is chess variant.<br/><br/>The first distinction is that the pieces are flat shapes that indicate movement more than rank. The shapes can be stacked in a way that allows players to still tell what pieces are stacked on top of each other.<br/><br/>The second distinction is gameplay. Instead of eliminating a piece from the game when it is captured, the player actually captures, or Seizes, it and adds it to the piece they used to capture it.<br/><br/>For example, if a Rook captures a Knight, the Rook+Knight can now move as a Knight or a Rook, the choice is up to the player.<br/><br/>If that combination piece is captured, then it transfers its powers on to the next piece - and so on.  This applies to Kings as well, (as the capturing piece).  Player could potentially end up with a King that can move like a Queen and leap like a Knight.<br/><br/>The creator claims that the game is so volatile that a computer cannot defeat a human player in this game.<br/><br/>",

You have evaded them for now, but need to get back to Earth. You head to Lunar 7, an old abandoned lunar base, hoping to find a still working ship.<br/><br/>Just as you all manage to reach the landing pad and start moving into the base, the Alien ship finds you. It begins dropping aliens all over the base trying to find and prevent you from escaping. Now you must find the supplies you need to repair your ship and escape, all while trying to hold off the ever growing hoard of aliens.<br/><br/>Game is played as a cooperative game, with everyone helping to make sure all of you escape.<br/><br/>Basic game play: Each turn you have 3 action points which you use to move and explore (placing tiles), picking up and dropping off resources (energy cells) to power factory tiles that build repair parts. You collect the parts and take them back to your ship to repair it and escape the aliens. At the end of each turn you will draw an Alien card that tells which tile an alien lands on. When moving to a tile with aliens the player 'pushes' the aliens off that tile onto surrounding tiles. Anytime a tile has 4 or more aliens, the aliens destroy that tile (flip it over) and scatter to the adjacent tiles. This can lead to chain reaction where one tile being destroyed causes more tiles to be overloaded with aliens and destroyed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are many old relics from humanity's first time through the Breach. Most of these are the usual variety- ruins, coins, books. But there are forgotten things as well, things that were imbued with magic and life.<br/><br/>Collodi is a living puppet, the size of a human adult. It was made to be an entertainer, a marionette that told stories through others of its kind. Collodi was a delight and a wonder of its age that was created to love its work, and so it did. At the closing of the Breach, after the mayhem that followed, the puppeteer was left alone in Malifaux, with no more children to share stories with. The next century passed slowly. To make up for its loneliness, Collodi began making new puppets from bits of wood it scavenged. These fake children became the audience for new shows and stories, but it was never quite the same. As time went on Collodi began to slowly drift away, losing its grip on itself.<br/><br/>When the Breach reopened, Collodi rushed to the newly arrived settlers, drawn by the laughter of children. The adults attacked the living puppet, forcing it away with torches and axes. Denied the ability to fulfill its purpose, Collodi learned to hate. It vowed to teach humanity the emptiness it had felt for so long in the absence of children. It started making a new kind of puppet, using the blood of stolen children as a template. Collodi wanders Malifaux in its painted wagon, hiding in plain sight behind the masks it wears, still committed to its now twisted purpose.<br/><br/>Collodi&rsquo;s box comes with nine models, including Collodi himself. The Marionettes serve as Collodi&rsquo;s totems, giving it fast, tough minions that are utterly loyal to the puppet&rsquo;s evil will. The Wicked Dolls provide another variety of useful minion, in that they can repair other puppets and teleport next to an enemy in the blink of an eye. Vasilisa watches over all these puppets with a caring eye, but should an enemy catch up with its incredible speed, they will have to contend with its sharp needle and expert sewing skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Even as a young monk in the temple of High River, Shenlong was considered exceptional. What surprised his instructors was the determination he showed to learn the other styles when exposed to them. His brutality was matched by a ruthless cunning that drove him to master every temple style. While he was fully aware of the political power this granted him in the valley, he was not prepared for what would follow.<br/><br/>As dusk fell one day, sunlight blazed from an isolated temple on the valley wall, said to house the Dragon. Shenlong, the only person capable of looking at the searing light, found himself drawn to the ancient building. He walked in alone, emerging the following sunrise as more than a man. He was covered head to toe in tattooed scales, sunlight blazing in his eyes. Where he trod, the ground scorched. A new era in the valley had begun; the Dragon had chosen a new host.<br/><br/>Although he doesn&rsquo;t look it, Shenlong is thought to be more than eighty years old. The Dragon does not permit its hosts to age, holding them at their physical peak as long as it chooses to inhabit them.  While this arrangement is never eternal, Dragonhosts are known to have lived for several centuries. As long as the Dragon has need of a host for his plans, Shenlong will be near immortal. With the Dragon now turning its ancient eyes to Malifaux, his current host has a great deal to do before he becomes tiresome and is cast aside.<br/><br/>Shenlong&rsquo;s crew comes with seven models, including Shenlong himself. The Monks of High River are brutal combatants with flaming punches and kicks, and they serve Shenlong aside his totems, the less flashy but equally devoted Peasants. The towering Sensei Yu ensures that everyone, monk and peasant alike, is properly trained, no matter how many legs get broken in the process.<br/><br/>",

The game title literally means &quot;Souls escape while ogre sleeping&quot;.<br/><br/>In this game, players are fallen souls in Hell, and try to escape from Hell while Oni (the guard of the Hell in this game) is sleeping. Each player has their own bag of advancement chips. There are three types of advancement chips: +1 space, -3 spaces when drawn twice, and -3 spaces when drawn once. You may continue drawing chips as you wish, but when you are forced to retreat three spaces, you may not advance any spaces.<br/><br/>As the game goes on, you will have more chips in your bag, changing draw probabilities. You should build your chip pool in your favor, but your bag may be swapped with another player's, so you need some strategy.<br/><br/>This game comes in scroll shape, and the game board is actually a picture with old Japanese style. It can be hung on the wall as an interior accessory.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>地獄に堕ちた魂たちが、地獄の門番である鬼が眠っている隙を見て、天国への脱出を目指します。プレイヤーはそれぞれ中の見えない袋を所持し、その中に入ったチップを引いて進めます。チップには一マス進めるチップ、二つ引いたら三マス戻されるチップ、引いた時点で三マス戻されるチップの三種類があります。三マス戻されるか自分の選択で引くのをやめるまでいくらでもチップを引くことができます。ゲームが進むごとに袋の中のチップが増え、確率が変動していきます。有利になるように自分の袋を育てますが、袋自体を交換されることもあるので、戦略も必要です。<br/>また、このゲームの最大のウリは、巻物の形をしているということです。和のテイストを最大限生かしたビジュアルで、壁に飾ればインテリアにもなります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DONK! - the Samurai Duck, the computer game, was created by THE HIDDEN and released in 1993 on the Amiga / Amiga CD32 games console.  In this 20th anniversary commemorative card game, Donk has to tackle 7 Zones in his arch enemy Eider Down's world (Con-Struct, Electro Moss, Hab, Hanic, Plasma, Rock, and Subaqua), seeking the Gems that unlock the Zones, destroy Eider Down's Fortress, and defeat Eider Down himself!<br/><br/>Each Zone is represented by a separate deck of cards.  To complete a Zone, Donk must work his way through the deck, turning over cards which could be Enemies to defeat (by spending Spin Power or using Power Ups), Hazards to avoid (by using Power Ups), various Devices such as the Map (to reveal the next few cards and jump ahead), Teleport (to jump to another Zone), Blocks and Switches that can hinder or help progress.  Ultimately, Donk needs to find the Gem card within the Zone deck that unlocks the Zone, and then get to the Exit card to complete the Zone.<br/><br/>Each time a Zone is completed, Donk will get a chance to attack the Fortress / Eider Down by spending what Spin Power they have left if it is enough. If all Zones are completed, and Donk has enough Spin Power left, they could get the chance to defeat Eider Down in the Final Battle!<br/><br/>Donk! can be played in 1 player mode, as a solitaire card game, or in 2 player mode where Donk and his fighting partner Judo Juggs team up (sharing Power Ups) / or go head to head to complete Zones and defeat Eider Down.<br/><br/>",

The patients (yellow pieces) start the game in their jails and the doctor must stop in an adjacent space to free them; once free, a patient moves the same way of the doctor and must exit the board reaching the yellow arrows. Every patient get out this way scores 1 point for the doctor's player. <br/>The guardians (black pieces) move again like the doctor, but can take the yellow pieces (the patients) moving on them. <br/>Each yellow pieces taken this way is removed from the board and scores 1 point for the guardians player. <br/>Important: a guardian can move on a patient only if black pieces has numerical superiority or tie on that line of the grid! Moreover, they can not overstep or jump the doctor white piece. <br/>The player with more points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is a great filler game for large game groups or a good light game to play while your waiting for everyone to show up to game night.<br/><br/>The game's theme revolves around the -18th and -19th century rural North America practice of &quot;barn raising&quot; (also known as &quot;raising bee&quot;).  In those times, and still today in Amish and other small communities, members of the community would come together to build up a family barn.  A lot of preparation is done prior to the build out and the actual barn raising event only takes one or two days.  Barn raising usually consists of a mix of experienced and inexperienced local men and the help of some paid specialists.  Most of the tools and supplies were all shared and gathered by the community as well.<br/><br/>Based on this theme, the Barn Raiser card game was created.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 14 structures and 24 military units available to build.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a Headquarters, Barracks, 8 Gold, 1 Crew, and 8 &quot;Advantage&quot; tokens which can each be used as an Attack, Range, Movement, or Heal bonus.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player may take up to 4 actions, any combination of: Mine Gold, Hire Crew, Move, Attack, Train Infantry, Build Structures or Vehicles.<br/><br/>Because of limited Gold in the game, players will need to decide how to balance gathering resources with building up defensive structures and building their army.  In addition, their army can be built quickly with Infantry units, or more slowly by first building structures such as Foundries, Arsenals, and Steam Works to build up armored units, artillery, and tanks.<br/><br/>Attacks are resolved by comparing Attack Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &quot;Advantage&quot; if played) to Defense Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &quot;Advantage&quot; if played).  Defending units may be destroyed, disabled, or sustain no damage.<br/><br/>A player wins the game by destroying their opponent's Headquarters or all of their opponent's army.<br/><br/>Cover art was created by Todd Sanders, winning the cover art design contest for this game.  Some of the game piece art was created by BGG user &quot;Skoll&quot;.  He created images for: &quot;Skirmisher Patrol&quot; and &quot;Iron Infantry&quot;, and because of those, really helped create the look and feel of the rest of the game piece images.<br/><br/>",

The game is availlable to play digitally online and you can buy a paper version to play with your friends.<br/><br/>In Element Circle the players battle each other over the control over the four elements Earth, Water, Fire and Air. In the circle appear four elements at random that can be used by any player and the players obtain spells from the same deck. The players then choose their innate elements that only they can use and take turns to use their spells to beat the other players. Each element has their own signature effect.<br/><br/><br/>     Earth is a solid and cannot affect the elements.<br/>     Water is a fluid and alters the state of the game.<br/>     Fire is destruction and intense.<br/>     Air is motion and mobility.<br/><br/><br/>Element Circle is played in rounds. Depending on how the players act, a round can be very short or relatively long. The trick to winning Element Circle is to be able to see how to play your hand best, predict the actions of your opponents and to best judge the strength of your own hand as well as those of your opponents. There is a lot of randomness in the rounds that keeps it interesting to play. Even the best players will lose some rounds, but will eventually win more rounds than others. Normally the first player to win three rounds wins the game, but when playing online each win increases your score and rating.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopolis (eng. Monopoly) game was made in Lithuania when this country was part of the Soviet Union, like the other Baltic states.<br/><br/>Just before the end of Soviet Union, politics became softer and allowed more things from the western culture like this game for example (not actual Monopoly version). Such things became popular among people, but the rule that everything had to be written in Russian remained, that's why this game's Rules are written in Russian.<br/><br/>The yellow lid of the game box only show the &quot;shareholder cards&quot; as well as some of the little &quot;Chance cards&quot;. <br/>Each side of the little game board has 3 company spaces, 1 railwaystation and a &quot;destiny&quot; space (showing a yellow circle with some image).<br/><br/>The 23 spaces on the board are from onwards: <br/>Pepsi-Cola -10%-circle - Marlboro - Kn&iuml;b (Kiev) - Las Vegas - a Jail corner - Philips - policeman in circle - Opel - Alma-Ata - Ford - cowboy on totem pole (Destiny corner) - Parker - sun and cube in circle - Toyota - New York - Asahi - judge corner - Atlantic - sun and cube in circle - Honda - London and Panam.<br/><br/>The instruction on the destiny spaces respectively reads:<br/><br/>     side 1: pay 10% of your funds and put it in the &quot;destiny pool&quot;.<br/>     side 2 with the policeman: pay a fine of 500 and put it in the &quot;pool&quot;.<br/>     side 3 and 4: test your luck by taking a Chance card.  It is remarkable to see that the &quot;Destiny corner&quot; is officially used as the &quot;Free Parking corner&quot; in the unofficial family rules in Parker Brother editions!<br/><br/><br/>Besides, there is an inner circle in the center of the game board, called Klondike, being an essential part of the game. Klondike can be entered any moment, by paying the Bank 500. Starting point is the pointing hand as in the main part of the game. The Rules for this section are as follows:<br/><br/>     Landing on each of the empty yellow spaces player receives 1000 from the Bank.<br/>     Landing on the space with the gold coin player receives 5000 and the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the money bag player receives 10000 and the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the pistol player loses all his money received in Klondike and has no right to leave the Klondike.<br/>     Landing on the space with the black cat player loses all his money received in Klondike and must return one of his most precious shareholder cards to the Bank as well as one of the cheapest he owns, but he still has the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the pointing hand player must return to the main game with the money he collected in Klondike.<br/>     Philips shareholder card. Instead of property deeds players receive a shareholder card  from the banker the moment they buy shares of a property or station. <br/><br/><br/>How does that work? Let us take the Philips property to explain:<br/>The first share, together with the &quot;shareholders card&quot;  (like a &quot;property deed&quot; in Parker Bros. Monopoly) can be bought for 16 the moment you land on this free space. A next player landing on this space have to pay you 4.<br/><br/>When you are short of cash you can pawn this card with the Bank for 8.<br/><br/>A second share can be bought from the Bank for 160 after which a visitor must pay you 40. The value of this share however is 140. In order to remember how many shares you own on this property you place the blue plastic paperclip on line 2.<br/><br/>In this way one can collect up to 5 shares by finally paying 6400. That moment the value of your total shares is 3200 and any visitor has to pay you 1600 each time he lands on this property. Should you run out of cash you can pawn this card with the Bank for 3200. <br/>There are 18 small (56x69 mm) yellow Chance cards, to be placed on the red dot in the centre of the board.<br/><br/>Some of the instructions on these Chance cards read:<br/><br/>     Konkurentu dovana gangsteriui 1000$ = Player receives 1000 from each other player and he gets the right to throw the dice 3 times. <br/><br/><br/>In addition he is allowed to rob another player, f.e. the moment he lands on a space owned by another player the owner must hand over all profit to this player. <br/><br/>     Nenumatytos pajamos 50% = Player receives 50% of his own properties (stocks and stations) from the Bank.<br/>     Mafija 1000 $ = Player has to proceed to the Destiny corner and pay 1000 fine.<br/>     Air Mail = Player does not move per space but per board side. On doing so he is allowed to land on a space he likes, except on the corner spaces. However, he does receive 200 passing the Start corner.<br/><br/><br/>Black cat = Player must return one of his shareholder cards to the Bank, without the right to redeem it.<br/><br/>The procedure with the stations is somewhat different: When buying a station player has to pay 800 to the Bank and in the same time he receives a hexagonal, plastic chip. The more stations a player owns the bigger profit he gets. The moment another player lands on your station he owes you 200 per station. Should an owner runs out of cash he can, like with the other properties, pawn a station with the Bank for 400 with the opportunity to redeem the station when he has enough money again.<br/><br/>The money consists of rather a number of plastic coins in various colors and diameters. The 11 denominations are: 1 - 2 - 5 - 10 - 20 - 50 - 100 - 500 - 1000 - 5000 and 15000.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>A &quot;Kashindan&quot; (士業愛) was a feudal Japanese Daimyo's band of retainers, something similar to a small elite company or a unit of faithful bodyguards. Consequently, Kashindan is not a game for mass battles, but was designed to play skirmish fights in an hour, in which the loyal vassals of a hero fight each other for fame, honour, prestige, personal feuds or because they favour opposite sides in a larger political/military confrontation. From the lowest peasants to the most prestigious Samurai lords -- the composition of an army depends only on the hero's capabilities to convince and inspire followers, i.e. it is entirely up to the player's tactical decisions.<br/><br/>Kashindan takes place in feudal Japan before a Portuguese ship stranded off the Japanese coast in 1543 and introduced the people of Nippon to the Arquebus (gun). During those times, honour meant a lot to &laquo;the ones who serve&raquo; (Samurai) and warriors would often ride up to the enemy ranks before a battle, challenging a worthy opponent to a duel. Duels could also be fought by appointment or over the smallest of insults. It was a time when life could come to an end very suddenly, be it by disease, famine or war, and this uncertainty partially shaped the attitude towards death and an honourable way to face it. Nevertheless, it was also a period during which social barriers were not yet as fixed and impenetrable as Toyotomi Hideyoshi would make them by the end of the 16th century -- an ambitious, driven man with some loyal retainers could conquer a province or even forge an empire.<br/><br/>The game does not require a lot of miniature figures, dice, rule books and expansions. To get started, 10-50 Ashigaru, Ninja, Peasants, Samurai and Sohei to represent a hero's Kashindan, about 10 six-sided dice (D6) and the aforementioned rules and game accessories are enough to drench your Katanas (Japanese swords) in blood. The army creation process allows a wide variety of styles to be played and the opportunity to adapt the commander to a player's personal style, whether you prefer to shoot arrows from a distance or to wield a Naginata in close combat. Although the author had the Heian/Kamakura period from 1000-1300 AD in mind, figures from up to the Sengoku Jidai (warring states) era should work as well with some historic laxity, as long as no firearms or face masks with beards are used.<br/><br/>The game was written by a gamer for gamers, and while the use of a turn deck may not be unheard of, a small random factor and not always being able to move all figures add a level of tactics that offers challenges similar to the unforeseen influences that affect the outcome of every battle in real life. The game mechanics are deliberately kept reasonably simple to allow both new and veteran players alike to get into the game quickly. Not having to read through half a dozen Warhammer tomes means that scenarios can be played in different ways to allow for the improvement of one's approach or a revanche after switching sides within a reasonable amount of time, usually around an hour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&hellip;the naval battles of the Dutch Wars were unlike any that had been fought before in terms of the number of ships engaged in the rival fleets and the extraordinary and unprecedented firepower they carried into battle.  The sonorous sounds of those distant encounters were heard fearfully by awed and wondering folk on the coasts of England, the Netherlands and France, drifting in like a distant thunder. (Hainsworth and Churches, 1998)<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder is a Historical Simulation of the Anglo-Dutch wars at Sea of the Mid-Seventeenth Century.  The bitter commercial rivalry between England and the Dutch Republic sparked a series of three wars fought in the span of just over two decades.  These hard-fought conflicts spurred innovations in the art and science of war at sea and would serve as the template for maritime conflict for the next two centuries.<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder examines war at sea at the dawn of the age of fighting sail at both the Battle (tactical) and Campaign levels. In the Battle Game, players recreate single historical engagements between fleets. The simple initiative and control system allows players to select maneuvers and move groups of ships in a way that models the inherent friction of command and control of the time.  Maneuvers are executed using counters representing groups of 3-4 ships, allowing players to easily recreate the often very large (~90 ships in each fleet) battles of these wars.<br/><br/>Campaign Game Scenarios focus on important portions (approximately 2 months) of each of these wars. In a Campaign, players strive to secure control of the sea, while denying it to their opponent. Players must pay close attention to logistics, weather and tides to ensure their battle-fleets are in the proper condition and position to prevail.  Fog of war models the limited intelligence available to the commanders.  Players provide orders to their fleets on a Campaign map, and when opposing forces meet, battle is resolved on the Battle Map as with the tactical game.<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder covers a number of historical Battle and Campaign scenarios including:<br/><br/>First Anglo Dutch War(1652-1654):<br/>Dover●Plymouth●Kentish Knock●Dungeness●Portland●Gabbard Shoal●Scheveningen<br/><br/>Second Anglo Dutch War(1665-1667):<br/>Lowestoft●The Four Days Battle●St. James Day Fight<br/><br/>Third Anglo Dutch War(1672-1674)<br/>Solebay●First Battle of Schooneveld●Second Battle of Schooneveld●Texel<br/><br/>Battles range from relatively small engagements (~20 ships per side) to very large (~100 ships per side). Battle scenarios can be played in a few hours and the tactical system is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Campaign scenarios range from approximately 6 to more than 20 hours to play.<br/><br/>",

The New Earth League, headed by the new super-power, the Xian, has ordered exploration of Alpha Centauri, with the prime mission to discover habitable planets and new forms of energy. Currently, the energy for propulsion, plasma from Helium-3 fusion, maxes out space ship thrusters at one-tenth the speed of light.<br/><br/>After mining Helium-3 on Mars and the Moon, it has taken over 50 years and three space bases to traverse the 40 trillion kilometres to reach AC. The pioneers spend their days charting and mining the planets and moons of the 3-star system.<br/><br/>On a routine mining trip to super-hot planet, Sir Isaac Newton, a new type of lava is discovered. Rumours soon spread throughout the factions of a new volatile fuel for propulsion. Admirals are alerted, suspicions are raised and treaties are broken.<br/><br/>Five competing factions: the Freelanders, New Brittany, the Nairobi, the Xian (Sian) and the Mozzies vie for control of the newly discovered resource. It's unstable properties could be harnessed to allow mankind to finally reach it&rsquo;s long-sought-after goal &ndash; to travel at the speed of light!<br/><br/>You are the captain of your faction.

Your goal is to fight past enemy bots, including a cloaked one, knock out laser towers and destroy the opposition fortress. Along the way you must collect lava-X and titanium which can be traded for reinforcements.<br/><br/>METTLE is a fast-paced game where both players are immersed in the action at all times.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The basic strategy of Pirate Attack! is to build up your ships while sinking your opponent's ships. Meanwhile other players are trying to do the same thing to you.<br/><br/>After sending your ship to sea, you can play Blacksmith cards to increase your cannons or decrease another players cannons, Carpenter cards to increase your strength or decrease another players strength. Draw an Attack Card and then destroy an opponent's ship (if you can). When a ship is sunk, receive gold which can be spent at The Market on Witch Doctor Cards so you can curse your opponent's ships. Buy some Fortune Teller Cards to protect yourself from others placing Witch Doctor Cards on your ships.<br/><br/>Summon a Sea Creature to attack other player's ships. Force two other players to attack each other. Anything you can do to destroy your enemies and become the ruler of the seas.<br/><br/>Use a Spy to remove useful cards from other players or a Thieving Monkey to take a card from an opponent and keep it. Better keep a good watch on your gold with a Guard or someone may try to steal it with a Thief.<br/><br/>Lower the prices at the Market so you can buy more items or close the Market so your opponents cannot buy items to hurt you with.<br/><br/>Once you have several ships at your command, use the Armada Card to join them all together and fight as one to destroy your enemies.<br/><br/>Force your opponents to Walk The Plank or strand them on an island so they lose a turn.<br/><br/>The play is simple. Draw 1 card, play 1 card (some cards can alter this). Play a ship, increase your ship, decrease another players ship, open/ close a market, steal cards or if you draw an attack card then attack a player with your ship. Receive gold and buy items to make you stronger or hurt your opponents.<br/><br/>Each expansion pack adds more things you can do and more markets to buy from to help you on your quest to rule the seas.<br/><br/>The main game includes 350 cards. There are 6 expansion packs ranging from 50 to 100 cards each. Each expansion pack adds a new level of play to the game.<br/><br/>The first expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- The Magic Shop&quot; adds a Magic Shop full of things to help your ships and hurt your enemies.  Double your ships cannons or strength, reincarnate ships, confuse where a ship attacks, and some main deck cards like Royal Navy to attack all ships and Hurricanes.<br/><br/>The second expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Raise The Dead&quot; adds bigger ships, cards to steal Magic Shop cards, more Sea Creatures, larger Royal Navy, Raise the Dead cards, Duplicate a ship, Spirit of Good Fortune, Eliminate Cards and Sails of Invisibility.<br/><br/>The third expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Miss-Direction&quot; adds more Ships, more Sea Creatures, Whirlpools, Windstorms, Stranded On An Island, Exploding Cannons, and Miss Direction.<br/><br/>The forth expansion pack of 100 cards and 2 Dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Walk The Plank&quot; adds another Ship, Walk The Plank, The Trap, Smoke Screen, Power Play, The Magician, Damn Pirates, Insurance, Ship Bonus, Card Bonus, Into The Sea, Davy Jones Locker, End Of The World, Force Fields, Visions, Return To Port and The Gambler.  So many more ways to mess with other players.<br/><br/>The fifth expansion pack of 100 cards and 1 Chip &quot;Pirate Attack- The Tavern&quot; adds a whole new market. The Tavern is a place where you can bribe a drunk sailor into telling you secrets and info, some good, some bad.  Get Double Play, Sneak Thief, Pick Pockets, add cannons and strength to all of your ships, give away your hand, make someone lose their gold, mix all cards and re-deal, give all ships a Witch Doctor, hurt another player with minus cannons and strength to all their ships.<br/><br/>The sixth expansion pack of 50 cards and 2 dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Special Abilities&quot; gives players (who chose to) a Special Ability, but only if they are willing to Sell Their Soul to get it.  Get a bad item like no ships bigger than 7/7, overcharged at markets, no gold when killing a ship.  But then get a good item like Black Market, The Vault, or Money Master.  This deck also includes The Blockade so you can stop cards from being played and 20 new ships with abilities.<br/>The main game can be played as a stand alone and expansion packs can be added to give the players more things to do during the game. Best when played with 3 to 10 players. Ages 8 and up.<br/>This is a high quality game. It comes in a nice, sturdy 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot; game box with plastic insert to hold all the cards from the main game and each expansion pack, so all the cards are together. Expansion pack boxes can be folded and placed under the plastic insert for keeping.<br/><br/>The game has great replay ability. Not the same old game every time. Certain cards make things different every game. You can even remove cards to give the game a different play. Play with or without expansion packs.  You can play to a certain number of Fame Points, play for a specified amount of time and most Fame Points at that time wins or play all the cards and go for last ship standing wins.<br/><br/>",

By this game we want to draw attention to the global power imbalance and the discriminatory practice of visa issuance. Visa applications from people coming from the Global South are rejected above average and mostly on the grounds of the insufficient &ldquo;intent to return&rdquo;. Hereby, the visa allocation is used as a way of racist and power-motivated exclusion of people who want to come to Europe for professional or private reasons. The visa allocation manifests the power and privileges of the Global North.<br/><br/>The game includes 28 passport-cards and 6 action cards.<br/><br/>A critical and informative game for the whole family!<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Wir haben ein Kartenspiel der besonderen Art entwickelt: das Reisepass-Quartett!

Nobody even stopped to ask, &quot;What if Predator had laser eyes?&quot; Each round in Clusterfight, players throw combatants into the ring, then change the dynamics of the fight with &quot;battle cards&quot;. Sure, Batman could beat up the Pope, but what if Batman was &quot;Vomiting Uncontrollably&quot; and the Pope was &quot;Fighting Mad&quot;? Everyone has a chance to bet on the outcome, then a judge decides the winner and bets are settled. When all players have judged twice, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>50 card expansion to the popular party game Clusterfight!

Choose your favorite champion among the four available, studies the opponent's weaknesses, choose whether to play on the ground, grass or concrete.<br/><br/>Each player receives 1 tactical card and 10 actions cards (service, vol&eacute;e, back, smash, etc) of his champion, then shuffle each deck of Reaction, Challenge and Event cards.<br/><br/>Before each match determine who goes first by rolling the D12. The person serving gets 3 ball cards, these determine which direction(or lane) you are attempting to hit the ball into. The other player gets two ball cards. Whoever is serving then chooses an Action card to attempt and rolls the D12. The card will tell you what each Die result will mean remembering to take into consideration any modifiers the tactics card grants you. You might fail by missing the ball, hitting the net, or even hitting it out on the opponents side. Or you might succeed by merely hitting it in, lobbing it in or ACE smashing it in. you then drag the Ball token to the appropriate spot on the board and the other player gets a chance to respond based on the type of success was achieved, attempting to hit it back in a similar manner. The Player go back and forth like this until some one misses or all 5 balls are used. Points are awarded the same way they are in real tennis and win conditions are also identical.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zomburbs is the zombie apocalypse if it were to happen in your idyllic neighborhood. It is also an interactive deck-building game in which you shoot zombies, build your fort, buy loot, and ...ahem... &quot;help&quot; your neighbors, in order to thrive during the zombie apocalypse. We felt that the deck-building genre too often felt like a 4 person game of solitaire. Our aim is to evolve the genre and create a game where you might be scratching your opponent's back...just to stab it later.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to accumulate the most victory points in both your deck and your fort by the end of the game. Cards will have varying number of victory points and weapon cards are worth no victory points since you use them to earn higher victory point cards called cure cards. The game ends when either the wound or cure cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn an increasing number of zombies will be added to a player's walls. Creatures stay behind your walls until they are either shot or if they overcome the strength of your wall. When creatures come over you walls you can end up taking wound cards which are worth a negative one victory point and they will hinder your deck a bit. There are ways to remove wound cards and there are not that many in a game so your deck will not be adversely affected by them.<br/><br/>There is a resource in the game that you can collect called scrap. It can be used in one of two ways. One you can use it to reinforce your walls, therefore preventing zombies from coming over and giving you wounds. You can also use it to construct buildings. Buildings are essentially abilities that you can use at least once per turn since they don't have to drawn from your deck, they are also worth a good amount of victory points. An example of one building is the zombie catapult which you can use to fling zombies on your walls towards other players.<br/><br/>If you help other players you can earn two different types of cards. One type is called consumables and they are one time burn cards that can either help you or mess with the other players. The other card you can earn are cure cards which are worth a decent number of victory points and provide the ability to easily kill creatures on your walls, therefore allowing you to continue to &quot;help&quot; other players.<br/><br/>The game is a &quot;take that&quot; game so players who prefer coop games might not enjoy the mechanics of messing with the other players. I spent a significant amount of time in making the cards that affect other players in a mild and fun way versus king maker or knocking somebody out. The game was intended to be very interactive so most abilities are centered on that. Alliances will be formed and broken throughout the game which makes it very dynamic each time.<br/><br/>There really is no trashing in this game so you only start with 5 cards. This allows a player to get to making fun card combos much sooner in the game. This also allows you to focus more on the type of strategy that you are going for in the game.<br/><br/>The cards for purchase in the tableau area are fairly unique with a maximum of 2 copies versus 10 of the same card that normal deck builders have. This gives each player a unique feel/identity each game. It also makes the replay value fun and fresh each time you play the game.<br/><br/>",

As with a number of games from Rocca Spiele, the goal of the game is to empty your hand of cards. In this game, however, the minor and major arcana cards have distinct rules dictating how they must be played to build the titular castle. For a minor arcana example, cards of the same suit must be laid out to form a path, but cards of the same number must be laid out as if you were stacking the depicted cubes atop one another. Major arcana cards are placed as rooms at the ends of such paths. Additionally, each minor arcana suit has cards that provide special effects, such as forcing the next player to draw, or allowing you to forcibly give cards to another player.<br/><br/>As is traditional with Rocca Spiele games, the rules are fairly simple, with the focus being on producing an artistic 3D layout on the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview<br/><br/>IBETCHA is a highly interactive mix of Cards Against Humanity and Never Have I Ever. Guess what your friends have done, hear their stories, then laugh your face off. You're gonna love IBETCHA, we guarantee it. The game is basically truth serum for people that aren't in the CIA (and some that are). See which of your friends can read people, dazzle them with your past mistakes, then crush them.<br/><br/>Game Rules<br/><br/>To start the game, each player draws eight random Betcha Cards that say things your friends may have done or are willing to do. All the cards are ranked by explicitness (1 to 3 points).<br/><br/>Each round has a different Victim. Everyone puts down a card (face-down) they think the Victim has done. Then, the Victim has to respond &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to each one. The group then screams which story they want the Victim to tell. Whoever submitted the chosen card, gets to keep it and receives the number of points on it. The first person to reach 10 points, wins!*<br/><br/><br/>    You can also play forever.<br/><br/><br/>",

It's played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized, initially empty square board. The suggested sizes are between 9x9 and 19x19.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA domain of one color is a set of orthogonally adjacent points that includes no points occupied by the opposite color. In other words, a domain of one color can include zero or more stones of that color and zero or more empty points.<br/><br/>A domain is alive if it includes a line of six orthogonally adjacent points in the same row or column. When the game is played on tiny boards, the required line length can be reduced.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player must place a stone of their own color on an empty point that is part of a living domain of their color.<br/><br/>After a placement, all enemy stones that are part of no living domains are removed from the board.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tObjectiveThe game ends when there are no points on the board belonging to living domains of both colors. The player with the highest score wins. A player's score is the number of board points that are part of living domains of their color in the final position, plus a komi in the case of White.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the even number of points which are added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player tells his opponent the even number which will be used as komi, and then the second player chooses which color to play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAcknowledgementsLin was inspired by Rin and Loops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The conflict between King Charles I and Parliament had come to an irreparable breach by the time the King raised his royal standard at Nottingham. There was now war between the King and his Parliament and the country was divided in its loyalties. The Royalists, who favor the King&rsquo;s cause, begin the war with many excellent troops and an advantage in cavalry troops, but have initial limited financial support from mostly towns and castles. Parliament starts with a somewhat reliable force in the London Trained Bands and a more solid financial backing from most of the kingdom&rsquo;s cities, but initial cavalry and leaders do not inspire confidence. Of course, the fortunes of war can change these circumstances over time.<br/><br/><br/>     Two Player game refighting what is often referred to as the First English Civil War. This Renaissance conflict is often identified in the &ldquo;Pike and Shot&rdquo; category, since musketeers fought around blocks of pike men for protection from cavalry. <br/>     Troop Types are represented with abstract counters. Infantry counters denote up to 1500 men and cavalry units represent up to 1000 men. There are units of dragoons and artillery trains as well. Special and elite units are also represented, such as the Northern Horse, Cornish Infantry, Lifeguards, and Hasselrigg&rsquo;s Lobsters. Both sides can also press Levies into service when necessary. <br/>     Game Boards display a map of England and most of Scotland. It is hex based with terrain within each and many prominent towns, cities, manor houses and castles are portrayed. Some of these locations have high fortification ratings and some do not. Necessary playing tables are located on the board for ease of play and necessary reference charts are provided to assist the players.  <br/>     Noteworthy Commanders are represented in the game, with holding boxes for leaders of larger armies. <br/>     Multiple Scenarios to play depending on when players want to begin and how long they want to play.  <br/><br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/><br/>     Leader Driven - Play is divided into turns, but players move alternately, sometimes one going before the other a few times depending on circumstances. Leaders are the core to the game system with all actions being mostly conducted by them. Leaders have ability ratings for strategy and battle. Some also have special characteristics peculiar to them such as Impetuous, Financial Resources, Cavalry Commander, etc.  <br/>     Multiple Events Combination - These continuously have an effect on the game. This is provided by a combination of the turn chart, a random events table, and event counters. Event counters are played immediately on locations, leaders, or units and at times are deployed by the choice of a player. <br/>     Strategy Counters - These can be rolled for by leaders, and the larger their rating the better. This provides some uncertainty as well as advantages and disadvantages as appropriate to each case. Strategy counters can be played immediately or held for the duration of the turn for opportune moments.<br/>     Variable Combat System - Each side has a respective Battle Deck to add more panache to the Combat Result Table (CRT). The CRT gauges results based upon the size of the battle, so it is not one size fits all. <br/>     Scotland Shown - Many games on the English Civil War focus solely England and Wales. The necessary parts of Scotland are shown here to include the effects of Montrose&rsquo;s campaign on the war.<br/>     Attractive Coin Counters - Provided to help track paying for the cost of war.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Life Sucks is a party bidding game where players expend future potential to avoid or embrace the worst life has to offer. In the end, only two players win: the one with the most points and the one with the fewest.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with 15 points and 7 success cards. These cards are the best things a player might achieve if not for life getting in the way. They range in level of achievement and can include having once gotten a B+, becoming a local celebrity, writing a bestseller, or owning a private island.<br/><br/>During each of the 5 rounds, a number of life event cards will be revealed (one for each player). All life events are bad and they can manipulate a player's point total, cause on-going problematic effects, or effect end game scoring.<br/><br/>Players then secretly bid with their success cards (numbered 1 through 7). Once revealed, the players choose life events from the pool from the player that spent the highest card to the player that spent the lowest. When there's a tie, success card suits will determine the winner. The suits are Intelligence, Charisma, Wealth, Health, Creativity, Looks, and Charm.<br/><br/>Life events and which suits break ties will change across the rounds as the players get older. Young life events appear during the first and second rounds, adult life events appear during the third and fourth rounds, and elderly events appear during the last (fifth) round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, life events permitting, each player adds the value of any unused life events to their point total. The player with the most points wins. The player with the least points shares in an equal (and often more difficult) victory.<br/><br/>",

With a warning given to police that if they don&rsquo;t call off their manhunt within an hour, another innocent civilian will pay the price. It&rsquo;s up to you and your team to discover which of the 12 suspects is the offender, where they are hiding, which weapon was used on the victim, and arrest him/her before the time runs out.<br/><br/>In this game, each member of the team gets to play as one of Commonville's finest, exploring the city, consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.<br/><br/>During each round, each player will roll a varying amount of dice up to 3 times. You may then use the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). Donuts can be used to perform special dice actions (such as passing a die to another player). There is also a special blue Investigation die that can be used to perform actions rapidly (but only by the lead detective). After performing any actions, the team must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.<br/><br/>There are 12 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 11 of them (and found the weapon that was used on the last victim), you must collect an Arrest Warrant from the Police Precinct and arrest the remaining suspect. If you can do all of this before time runs out, the team wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Divided We Fall presents the events of the American Civil War. As part of our Strategic Decision Series of games, this is a game of skill for two players - there are no random events. Yet, each game is amazingly different from the others - this is because the two players focus their attention on the most crucial decisions, and there are many to be made! USA and CSA troops are scaled from brigades to corps, plus state militias. Forts, naval/riverine and leader counters (army, some corps) are included.<br/><br/>Players are limited to a fixed number of actions per turn - early, the Confederacy gets the most Command Points (actions), later in the war the Union does. Use the Command Points to move leaders - army commanders who can move the armies they're with - or to move individual units which usually move more quickly by themselves. Or use the Command Points to build your defensive works.<br/>    There are six turns per year: Winter (Dec-Apr), May, June, July-Aug15, Aug16-Sept, and Oct-Nov. These time frames were selected because the 135 most important civil war battles are spread equally across them.<br/>    Reinforcements and leader arrival/departure occurs each turn, and replacements are spread out across each combatant's territories - but the Union gets 11 replacements per turn, while the South gets 7. These 7 are spread among the 7 groups of key (&quot;Flag&quot;) cities, which are grouped from the Trans-Mississippi, the Mississippi River, Alabama, Tennessee/Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. As the Union player takes the Flag Cities in each group, CSA replacements decline.<br/><br/>The Confederacy, however, can make a lightning strike into the North, either shooting for Washington DC or other targets which can end the war and the game immediately, or warrant intervention on their behalf from France and Britain.<br/><br/>Movement is point-to-point and is affected by weather and terrain. Access to the rivers and seas gives the Union a significant bonus and the CSA another headache. Sea and river invasions are a staple of Union attacks, but are expensive to conduct and limited in number. <br/>    Leaders permit large army movements, but also heavily affect combat, increasing unit effectiveness and reducing losses. Combat is dice-less, based on our algorithms of civil war combat, in which terrain, weather, force size, and leadership all play a role. The biggest army doesn't always win, nor does the one with the best leader!  <br/>    The Union Navy threatens all the Confederate ports with blockades and invasions, but the CSA's ironclads can block them. The CSA also relies on fortifications to help out, and once these get big the Union must slowly (and expensively) reduce them to force the rebels out.<br/><br/>Political events are included: Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia all have special considerations. Early occupation of these can provide bonuses to the Confederacy, or deny the Union additional troops.<br/><br/>Scenarios starting in 1862 and 1863 are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1930s baseball game, named after Babe Ruth, has a highly unusual gameplay mechanism. It may be the only boardgame where players actually hit a ball with a bat and see the outcome on the board.<br/><br/>The 2&quot; diameter ball is mounted on the top of a foot-long stand ending in a spring fastened under the metal board. The foot-long wooden baseball bat is used to strike the ball, causing the ball stand to fall across the &quot;umpire&quot;. This is a curved rubber barrier topped with 25 teeth and a string that runs horizontally through the teeth.<br/><br/>When the ball stand hits the umpire, it pushes into one of the 24 gaps, each of which is numbered. The gap it struck can be seen after the ball bounces back up because it kinks the string at that location. Each number is repeated along the outfield wall along with a result, from Ball or Strike to Home Run or Out.<br/><br/>Each team has a set of wooden peg players, and the play proceeds and is scored like a regular baseball game. There are dials on the board for recording balls, strikes, runs and outs during an inning, and paper scorecards for recording the results of each inning.<br/><br/>Later editions of this game did away with the umpire. Instead, the board had an outfield wall with three holes and a jagged top. The ball was on a string and if it went over the wall, each notch had an outcome like this first edition. In addition, players could score a home run or extra-base hit by getting the ball through one of the holes, but would be out if it hit the wall and bounced off.<br/><br/>",

In Shibboleth you play as a member of one of eight socioeconomic classes living in a city that is in the middle of a bloody revolution. In each round just like in each revolution throughout history there is a class that leads the revolution, a class that does the dirty work, and a class that is blamed for the hardships of the past. These three classes will be random each round. With 512 different possible combinations each revolution may be similar to events from history, or completely original. Players will have to use deceit and cunning to bide their time and escape to freedom, or turn on one another and join the revolution. Each round takes 3-5 minutes to play and is completely unique.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Tsar &amp; Emperor is the second scenario book for Grand Fleets, covering naval engagements during the first year of the Russo-Japanese War.<br/><br/>At the turn of the century, the idea that an upstart Asian nation could defeat one of the European Great Powers was laughable. Japan may have unexpectedly prevailed against China ten years earlier, but few had any doubts Russian battleships would make quick work of the Combined Fleet.<br/><br/>Admiral Tōgō largely answered those doubts with his surprise attack on Port Arthur. The war which followed was the first to translate the rapid technological advances of the late 19th century into massive casualty counts, presaging the killing fields of Flanders, leading many to dub it World War Zero.<br/><br/>In addition to eight historical scenarios, Tsar &amp; Emperor contains a total of 160 individual ship cards, including more than 80 named ships from over 50 different classes of the Imperial Japanese and Russian Navies, alongside selected ships of the pre-World War period from the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, the Chinese Beiyang Fleet, and the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>Can you preserve the honor of the Tsar against naked aggression? Or will you advance the Emperor's dream of a modern Japan, taking her rightful place on the world stage?<br/><br/>",

The player with the most warmth points (victory points) at the end of the fourth round is the winner of the game!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 cards that represents the different Broskams and each of their special powers. The players will draft these cards one at a time and pass the remaining to the players on their left (and right depending on the round) until they have a new hand of 6 cards. After that, the players will choose one of their 6 cards and reveal them simultaneously. Then, starting with the first player, everyone will use the card they revealed to either place one of their Broskams onto the board (leave the cave) or use the special ability printed on the card, moving their Broskams closer to the sun for more warmth points!<br/><br/>",
