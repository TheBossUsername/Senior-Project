        "description": "Chaos Tactics is a dexterity game where skill and strategy are needed to defeat your opponent by using your army of eight units. Players battle over a series of rounds by flicking their units until one player claims the entire board. Each army contains seven different unit types with one type, the soldier, having two units per side. The six non soldier units have special abilities that can be used throughout the game. The constant action will create chaotic battles making each round feel like an entirely new game.<br/> The player using the blue pieces starts the game by choosing one of their pieces and flicking it. Once the piece is flicked, resolve any special abilities if applicable. The red player then takes their first turn by doing the same. Play alternates like this until the round is over; with the goal being to knock all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces off the game board entirely. If any part of a piece is still on the game board, it is still in play.<br/><br/>A round is won when only one color remains on the board. With each round won, the winner claims a new row allowing them to place a piece or pieces in that row in the next round. For the following rounds, players may place their pieces in any of the spaces of the rows they own, with at least one piece in the row closest to their opponent.<br/><br/>The game is won when one color has claimed all eight rows.<br/><br/>Inspired by Chapayev<br/><br/>",

Extracting the resources from Sikarra will not be an easy job; it is rife with dangers; cannibals, pterodactyls, and the volatile volcano itself. The slopes of the volcano are covered in a dense jungle that is very difficult for modern machinery to penetrate. The only people able to move through this difficult terrain easily are the local tribe&hellip;rumor has it they may even be able to travel on the backs of the great winged pterodactyls that circle the volcano.

        "description": "Crack the Code with three levels of challenge is a brain testing game of logic and mental concentration. The object of the game is to crack the secret code of your opponent by means of simple logic and deduction. Players challenge each other in turn by setting out a row of three, four or five coloured code counters according to the level of skill and difficulty to be played. The game can be made even tougher by allowing the code maker to use any number of the same coloured counters, and or leave spaces, to make up the code.<br/><br/>The code maker sets up the sliding screen so that it is placed directly in front of them just allowing space to place and hide their secret code in the spaces provided. The code breaker must try to duplicate the exact colours and positions of the secret code. Each attempt is marked with a tick for an exact colour and position match or a cross for the correct colour but incorrect position.<br/><br/>Players swap roles and the winner is the one who breaks the code in the least number of attempts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sheeplike is a Theocratic Card Game for family worship based upon going out in the ministry and finding Sheeplike ones and starting bible studies while avoiding Do Not Calls. 2-4 players ages 9+ can play in 30-60 min using tools like the bible, pioneers, Jesus and even Jehovah to win the householders hearts over.  The goal is the first player to 4 bible studies. You gain a bible study by finding the Sheeplike one out in the territory or be the last player still in the round.<br/><br/>Setup:  The territory consists of 9 cards (houses) grouped in 3 piles hiding where the Sheeplike and Do Not Call cards are.   Shuffle the Sheeplike, Do Not Call and 1 Not Interested cards and create 3 piles.  Then deal 2 more territory cards on top of the 3 piles.  Players are each dealt 1 card each from the publisher cards.<br/><br/>The game consists of 2 stages:<br/><br/>Door To Door: Players draw and play cards searching through the territory stacks for the Sheeplike one. There are 17 publisher cards that allow players to flip the cards in the territory and move cards around within the stacks. This allows for players to hide traps and uncover the Sheeplike card. If a Do Not Call is flipped without the protection of the Bible card, that player has to sit out of the current round. If the Sheeplike one is not found by the time that there is no more publisher cards to draw from then the next stage starts.<br/><br/>Return Visit: Once all cards have been drawn from the publisher draw pile. All players turns over their one card in their hand.  Whoever has the highest value card, they get the first pick of where they think the Sheeplike card is at. Remember the players have had a few turns to deduce the most likely location of the Sheeplike one. So when the publisher pile is getting low, it is good to hold onto higher value cards.<br/><br/>",

It consists of a series of matching cards, one side with a letter and word printed on it, and the other with a corresponding picture.  The cards have a puzzle piece edge, and each card only fits its pair.<br/><br/>There are two possible ways to play.  One is called Match Out.  In this game, cards are placed face-down and each player draws an equal number.  The first player places the top tile on their stack face-up.  Each player in turn then turns up his or her top tile.  If it matches any of the turned-up tiles, the player matches them, puts them aside, and turns up the next tile in his or her stack.  This continues until no matches are made, and play passes to the next player.  The first player to eliminate his or her stack wins.<br/><br/>In ABC Rummy, letter and picture tiles are places in separate piles.  Players take turns drawing from either stack until they all have four tiles in their hand.  If any players have matches, they may lay them down immediately.  Each player then draws a tile from either pile and tries to match it to tiles in their hand.  If there is a match, they are put aside and the player may draw again.  If not, the player may keep up to four tiles and must discard any others face-up in the middle of the table.  Further players may draw from either the piles or the face-up tiles, making as many matches as possible.  Play continues until one player has five pairs.<br/><br/>",

The full game download is available on his website.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>The Scourging of the North was a campaign of retaliation by the Alliance of western Men and Elves against the Goblins from the Northern Wastes. This was a war intended to break the Goblin army and scatter it forever.<br/><br/>Aimed at the great Goblin citadel of Angmar, with the northern snows fast approaching, whoever controlled that foul fortress would be in a strong position to survive the winter intact and finish the campaign of annihilation in the spring. The Alliance came very close to seizing Angmar, but a rallying of Goblins from across the Northern Waste to its defenses overcame the forces of the West.<br/><br/>Battle for Angmar is played on a map of the desolate Goblin lands where the 3-day battle was fought. It uses playing pieces that represent the military units that partici-pated in this campaign. Each player is a leader commanding an army of troops. The individual Alliance ground units represent approximately 250 Men or Elves and what was left of their equipment after the long march across the southern regions of Middle Earth. The Goblin units represent approximately 400 Goblin warriors each.<br/><br/>General course of play:<br/><br/>Players alternate turns moving units and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the victory condition of controlling the city of Angmar at the end of turn 7.<br/><br/>",

Cards can path off in any direction, limited only by your table space, but must match connecting symbols.  These symbols also grant one time special actions, some good, some bad.  No matter what one action you choose on your turn (draw, place, take track from back on line) the mine cart always moves one space further.  The color of the space it lands on also causes 'something' to happen, so careful as you lay your track, giving lots of choices...<br/><br/>Players cooperatively lay track until the last track (last card on bottom of deck) is placed, however the dwarf with the most vp left in his hand of track is declared the master track builder and receives the promotion from his boss.<br/><br/>This game is an entry for the geekway to the west design contest.

Every round, a card from the event deck will be played to the timeline, which will increase the 'bad' resources (threat, fatigue, and setbacks) and limit your ability to gain the 'good' resource (progress). Then, players will take turns playing a card to the timeline to counteract these 'bad' resources while gaining as much progress as possible.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of general action cards and starts the game with 3 powerful character-specific actions. Each action card adds or subtracts one or several resources, as well as sometimes giving the player access to powerful abilities such as looking through the action or event decks.<br/><br/>The resources are kept track of on shared boards. Each minute of the timeline has a threat track to keep track of the amount of threat you have minute-to-minute. Additionally, there is a progress and fatigue mat that is used in combination with specific tokens to keep track of your current totals for those resources.<br/><br/>If you are able to accumulate enough progress while keeping threat and fatigue low enough before you run out of space on the timeline or the event deck runs out, then you win.<br/><br/>",

Each player begins with 6 cards consisting of armor pieces and weapons that are played one at a time in front of the player, then the rest of the hand is passed either clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on game round) until all but 2 cards have been played. Then each player has the opportunity to swap out one piece of their assembled armor for what remains in the hand they are passed to complete their set. The remaining cards are discarded and everyone compares armor values, which are increased or decreased by certain affects on each card. The player with the highest value wins, simply because they can take more of a beating than the others. Cards are then shuffled and dealt for another round. Play as many rounds as you like, but we recommend 1 round per player +1 round, best out of that number wins!<br/><br/>",

Place these at suitable distances apart about the room (attach to walls, !f convenient).<br/>Look at the Key Sheet and you will note that a girl's Name heads each list. Now the idea of the game is that the girl is friendly in turn with each of the boys whose names follow and finally marries the young man whose full name is made up of the first letters of the Christian names reading from top to bottom of the list and the wedding date is that at the foot of the list.<br/><br/>By filling in his recording card as instructed below a player is able to make a list exactly the same as that on the key sheet corresponding to a particular girl's name.<br/><br/>Suppose we take the name Barbara. Write Barbara in the first space of a recording card; then look for Barbara in the left columns of the Names Lists and on finding it write in the second space the boy's name opposite in the right column, i.e. Roland. Next find Roland in the left column of a Names List and write in the third space the name opposite, For example - lan. Continue in this way until the date June I2th is found opposite Stuart and entered in the last space alongside the word WHEN.<br/>Now enter the first letters of each name recorded in the column headed &quot;FIRST LETTER&quot; and it should then be fairly easy to divide them into two groups giving a Christian name and surname. Write them in the space alongside the word WHO.<br/><br/>Give each player a recording card and see that he has a pencil.<br/>To begin the game call out one of the girls' names on the Key Sheet and the player who is first to present a correctly completed recording card is the winner.<br/><br/>An alternative way of playing is to write in the first space of each recording card to be used, before the game starts, the name of a girl and at the word &quot; GO &quot; each player completes his card in respect of the girl whose name appears on it.<br/><br/>",

Then they take a long string with a bead tied to one end, drop the bead at the start point of a map, and slowly lower the string, attempting to draw a line with it from start to end while connecting the goals and avoiding the obstacles. Crossing (or capturing) a goal gives points, while touching an obstacle subtracts points. If a player runs out of string before they reach the end point, they score zero for that map.

Power Management is crucial in the game as you will need to mine for Power Coins to obtain enough energy to run your empire.<br/><br/>The cards have beautiful and colorful imagery right out of 1950s science fiction. Players will easily get emerged into the genre of the game.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Each turn, players spend their Power Coins (earned by minting or mining or landing on Mining Moon cards)to bring out fighters like Robots or Monster Mercenaries that can attack opponent's. Building a strong Base (Base cards form the back row on tabletop) allows players to shoot Long Range Weapons, Use Force Fields for extra defense, and create Power Coins. Players can customize their draw decks to follow different strategies and playing styles. A player looses Life Points when attacking fighters are not blocked. When a player reaches zero Life Points, they are out of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can always find a character that matches your play style.<br/><br/>Team up with other players to take on challenging foes, or try to go it alone and reap all the rewards for yourself.<br/><br/>Game play is structured so that everyone gets to do something meaningful on every turn. There's even a handy &quot;Rules Card&quot; that both keeps track of whose turn it is AND serves as a reminder of all the turn phases, turning a potentially complex turn into something that anyone can understand!<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to level up your character to level 5 or collect 30 gold. You level up by gaining experience from defeating monsters. In each turn players can commit their characters to fight one of the enemies, buy/sell equipment, spawn new monsters or heal themselves. Players can join forces to attack enemies together and share the prize, but only if the first attacker agrees, so there's an element of negotiation involved. Additionally players have equipment and action cards at their disposal which allow them to boost their stats and perform additional actions. Monsters are defeated by comparing your characters and the enemies attack/defence stats modified by the result of a dice roll.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Advent Saga is a story-driven physical and digital Tactical Card Game that combines the excitement and traditions of popular card games, with the strategic elements of Tactical RPG's. The game takes place in an original universe where a devastating war is waged upon 3 different galactic factions. Players will choose from hundreds of cards to battle with, while discovering endless possibilities in combat strategy.<br/><br/>Advent Saga is a highly customizable game, in that each of the 5 resources have their own strengths and weaknesses, while each of the 10 advents have unique abilities that set them apart from each other. This allows you to build a deck to cater to your own style of play! The object of the game is to reduce the opposing Advent&rsquo;s morale to zero. This can be achieved by strategically using the cards in your hand to deploy, attack and dominate your opponent.<br/><br/>One goal with Advent Saga was to add elements that rewarded meaningful choices over just drawing powerful cards. With the creation of our 4x4 battleground, players would not only need to rely on strength and power, but would also need to discover and develop new strategies involving Battleground position, Range, areas of effect, and much more.<br/><br/>",

Along the way, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  If a player lands on another marker, they move back six spaces, and in order to start moving a marker at the beginning of the game, they must roll at least a three.  The book comes with an &quot;electronic&quot; die that generates random number from 1 to 6.

        "description": "BACKGROUND: Mexico Ablaze is semi-historical simulation of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). The Game begins shortly after the United States of America (USA) and Mexico have begun hostilities near the border of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Army is now building up their forces to kick the United States out of Mexico. The US must capture enough Mexican controlled Settlements before the Mexican Army is able to effectively mobilize an overwhelming force.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the United States Forces in Mexico. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to capture three or more of the five Key Mexican Controlled Settlements of Monterrey, Buena Vista, Vera Cruz, Tampico and Mexico City before the &ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&rdquo; Campaign Card is Drawn. If the Mexicans capture 3 of the four US Settlements of Fort Texas, Laredo, Corpus Christi or San Patricio, they win. Also, if the US has not captured three of the four Key Mexican Settlements and the &ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&rdquo; Campaign Card was played, the Mexicans Win.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Mexico Ablaze features many colorful game counters of the various Unit types that fought in the Mexican War, including individual Heroic Officers that later served in the Civil War. Battles can be fought on a large Battle Mat and includes assaults on fortified settlements.<br/><br/>MEXICO ABLAZE can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

The main game is called &quot;Elliot Moose Counting Board Game.&quot; In this game, players roll a die to move their pieces around a track around the outside edge of the board. When they land on a space, they take the tile depicting a number or objects. They must then choose a face-down tile from the middle with a number printed on it. If the number matches, they keep the pair. If it does not match, both tiles are returned to their places and the next player takes a turn. When all pairs are claimed, the game ends and the player with the most pairs wins. Players can also choose to play &quot;Counting Memory,&quot; which plays similarly but with the die and track removed. Players simply choose a tile from a stack and try to pick the face-down number tile that matches the number of items depicted on the card. Another option is &quot;Guess Which Number!&quot; where one number tile is hidden, the other are placed face-down and players take turns guessing which number is missing.<br/><br/>",

Each time you play, the game is quite different with custom characters, a lot of strategy, and a dash of luck.<br/> Imbroglio is a game for 2-7 players and has multiple styles of play, from player vs player to players vs board.  An average game can be played in 45-60 minutes, but with possible expansions in the future, games could be expanded to almost any length.  The basic mechanics of the game are a mix of tile laying, resource management, and dice rolling.  <br/> Our original thought would be that the game would be targeted toward families or gamers who like mythology, strategy, and 'sticking it' to other players.  That being said, the game is quite modular and could accommodate many different game genres!<br/><br/>",

This has been overlooked for well over two centuries; nothing is taught about Arnold except his treason. The fact is: if not for him, the rebellion would probably have failed and its principal players hanged. If he had died at Saratoga instead of being seriously wounded, his legacy would have been nothing short of legendary. Cities, counties and perhaps even a state would be named after him. Statues of Arnold would be standing in parks nationwide and his monument would be visited by throngs of people in the District of Columbia every day.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Arnold had enemies as well as supporters, and those enemies contributed significantly to his conclusion that the colonies were not yet ready for independence. In Benedict Arnold Poker, a breezy combination of poker and rummy, you will meet some of the men in each group, and Arnold himself.<br/><br/>[Note: this game is an unfinished, although playable prototype. - ASF]<br/><br/>",

Players collect neighbors that are coming to the BBQ and place them in a line to form the most awesome picture. <br/>Every round players choose a neighbor, the player that chooses the quickest goes first and:  <br/>-places his neighbor in a picture.<br/>-uses that neighbors ability.<br/>-selects a new neighbor to take into their hand.<br/>When any player has 10 or more neighbors in his picture the game ends. The player who has the most awesome looking picture (points) wins.<br/><br/>The different cards are what makes this game interesting. Some neighbors look better than others, meaning they are worth more look-at-my-awesome-life (lamal) points. Other neighbors are faster or have better abilities. For instance, some let you take neighbors from another players hand or let you switch around neighbors who are waiting to have their picture taken. <br/>This is useful as many neighbors only look good in the right spot.  That hillbilly standing next to the BBQ with a jerrycan could make for an awesome picture, but not when a policeman or concerned mother is standing next to him...<br/><br/>Other playmodes introduce the option for fast neighbors to pick up stuff(cards), which can help your strategy in different ways and 'you'(cards), which reward you for having neighbors of a certain color. With these you get a game where there is no right play, only a right play for the situation!<br/><br/>",

When all branches are set, the players return to their sparting space.<br/>Winning Points are awarded for singele branches, 3 branches in an area, 2 or more nighboring areas with 3 branches und the order of return to the starting space.<br/><br/>",

It's up to the player to buy low, sell high, and try to bankrupt their opponents out of the sky.<br/><br/>Ventures in the Void is all about risk and reward.  The unique double ended cards mean that each time a player transacts with a planet they increase the opportunities for opponents to reap huge rewards. Will they make their rendezvous in time to cash in, or will an opponent stick them with a customs inspection or labor disruption and delay them right out of their profits?  Every credit matters when the first captain to make 300,000,000 credits wins.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a ship and a fist full of credits. Each turn players may play a trade card, move, and play an event card. Movement is based on the range of the ship and a player may move along the grid up to that range.<br/><br/>Trade cards are double ended with a supply and demand for a single planet. When a player transacts with a planet they play the end of the card that they are utilizing facing them and no other player may use it. The other end of the card is now available for all other players to use. Each player may only have two trade cards active in front of them at a time.  New trade cards replace those that are in play, cutting off access to those deals.<br/><br/>Event cards either hinder opponents or give the active player an advantage. Events are resolved at the end of each players' turn. <br/>Ship upgrades that extend range or cargo space are available for the duration of the game for a tidy sum of credits. Players must decide if the bonus will recoup the investment in time to edge out their opponents.<br/><br/>The goal is for each trade to double or triple a player's resource investment but with only two of the available trade cards in a player's control each transaction is a gamble.<br/><br/>",

In this bingo-based game, players choose either multiplication or addition and create 5x5 bingo-type cards using lists of numbers included in the book.

One player then rolls two dice (12 and 20-sided), calls out the sum or product and players mark that number if it appears on their card.

The ships were to spend hundreds, if not thousands of years, searching the stars for a new system that could support mankind once more.  One of those fleets arrived upon &lsquo;Mu Area&rsquo; a system that surpassed expectations, providing a number of larger planets that could support life, colonization began.<br/><br/>Now many years on the colonies established have splintered, separated and developed their own societies.

If there are no cards in the draw-pile, she ends her turn by drawing a card from the hand of the player on her right.<br/><br/>The Zookeeper is a Joker. Once played, if a player has the correct card which the Keeper has replaced, that player may play that card and take the Joker for herself.

But the way home is hard to find: you turn right, then left and sometimes there is no way! You have to look closely and build the way anew, relocating the game boards if nescessary.<br/><br/>To play, the 16 large game boards are laid out in a 4x4 grid on the floor.<br/><br/>Each cattle is assembled by putting the die-cut cattle in a colored standee. Then, the cattle are randomly distributed between the players. All players start at the same spot on the grid, Mike Donalds Ranch.<br/><br/>On your turn, a player throws the die and moves his pawn along the way, one field for each pip. The goal is to reach the color-coded pasture, matching the color of one of his cattle. To do this, it is allowed to change the grid of game boards to open up new paths and maybe hinder the other players on their plans. The first player to place all his cattle in the right pastures wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Pick up a cardboard counter and read the word aloud (it is written both in latin letters and in phonetics). Each player listens carefully, and says &quot;yes&quot; if he thinks this word belongs to his card. He then put the counter on his tray. If the sentence from his card is now complete, he reads it to the other players and gives a translation. The translation can be checked with the translation wheel. If it is correct, he keeps the card, otherwise the first player giving a correct translation gets the card. A round is played until all cardboard counters are gone.

If a player happens to find all four pieces, he fills his Turtle board with four of his nine counters.

Players start at the beginning of a track printed around the outer edge of the board.  On each turn, they roll the die and move along the track, landing on one of many types of spaces.  On a monument space, the player gains the trophy card for that monument.  A Metro space allows a player to move to any other Metro space.  A Tourmobile space allows movement to any monument, but the player must answer a question from a Challenge card to win a trophy card.  On a challenge space, the player draws a challenge card and asks another player the question.  On an incorrect answer, that player must return a trophy card to the board.  On a take a card space, the player must choose a card and answer the question to continue.  There are also roll again and lose a turn spaces.<br/><br/>Players' turns end in one of four ways--answering a question incorrectly, answering three consecutive questions correctly, winning a trophy card or landing on a &quot;lose a turn&quot; square.<br/><br/>Players continue to circle the board until one player collects trophy cards for all four monuments, winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Developed by University of Southern California Alumni, Trojan Challenge is a Monopoly-type game where players move around a track, landing on activity spaces which represents conferences, exhibits, performances, athletic contests and other events at the university.  When a player lands on an activity space, he may purchase that activity for the designated cost.  He may then purchase up to two upgrades (which are called &quot;reserved tables,&quot; &quot;group reservations,&quot; etc.) either immediately or on a later turn.  When other players land on these spaces, they must pay the owner the amount designated on the card.<br/><br/>A few extra wrinkles are added.  Detour spaces place a player onto an alternate track when they are landed on.  &quot;Go Trojans Go!&quot; and &quot;We Are SC&quot; cards can give players extra money, take away money or offer other benefits or detriments.  Parking Lot spaces cause loss of a turn, and various other spaces may increase or decrease the player's money total.  Passing the start space, unlike in Monopoly, costs the player $600.<br/><br/>Players start with $6000 each (tracked on paper--no paper money is included) and try to gain funds as they play.  Landing on other players' spaces forces a player to pay them a designated amount.  If a player cannot pay, he or she may sell any assets owned to other players or give them back to the bank for half value.  If still unable to pay in full, the player is out of the game.  The game can be played to one of three pre-agreed ending conditions--a time limit, until one or more player are eliminated or until only player is left.  The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Optional rules allow a player to move another player back to the starting space by landing on their pawn and allow for discounted purchase of upgrades on spaces if matching sets are collected.<br/><br/>A metagame rule governs the use of a &quot;Trojan Gold&quot; space.  If a player lands on this space and agrees to donate a pre-determined amount of real (not in-game) money to the real University of Southern California, he or she gains an upgrade to place on any owned property.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Gentleman's Game Of Cannibalism<br/><br/>Players take on the role of wealthy victorian era socialites and compete through braggadocious storytelling to determine who is the most interesting person. The only problem is that when money is no object what could you possibly wager with? Well winning a hand in Samuel Sandwich may be more literal than you might think.<br/><br/>Samuel Sandwich is designed for 2 to 4 players<br/>The game consists of cards, playmats, counters and coins.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of &ldquo;doings &amp; deeds&rdquo; cards each of theses cards has a selection of color coded words which are used to construct a story. These cards also contain a custom Samuel Sandwich suit and a point value so that at the end of each round your point total can be determined.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round a &ldquo;consorts &amp; cohorts&rdquo; card is flipped to reveal a famous historical figure. This person will be the subject of everyone&rsquo;s  story as they try to outplay each other. There are 2 wagering rounds one when the &ldquo;consorts &amp; cohorts&rdquo; card is revealed and then again when players select and place the cards they will be using face down on the table.<br/>after wagering is resolved players take turns revealing and telling their story to the group. After everyone has told their tall tale the points are added up and the winner takes the money bet during this round as well as all cards played during the round (minus their own).<br/><br/>Feeling hungry?<br/><br/>Winning A Hand<br/>After winning a round a player may then select one part of another player to eat. The correct counter is removed from that persons player mat and is placed in the stomach of the round winner.<br/><br/>Trading In<br/>Players may also trade in 10 doings and deeds cards they have won from other players to select an additional part to eat.<br/><br/>Selling Off<br/>If a player finds themselves low on funds at any time in the game they may sell off a part to the highest bidder in order to replenish their financial stockpile to continue wagering.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the player who has eaten the most is declared the winner. <br/>The key to success is not what you eat, it&rsquo;s who you eat and how much!<br/><br/>",

Gameplay involves playing cards from your hand that match those being performed in the currently playing matches on your television (if the match you're watching has Shawn Michaels using a dropkick, you can play Dropkick).<br/><br/>The goal is to pin your opponent of course, by playing the correct cards/sequences to end the match.<br/><br/>",

On a circle of his own color, the player takes all token on the circle. If a player gets on a space that is occupied by another player, he gets all the token from his playing piece, which is then returned to it's starting circle.

A woman of stunning beauty, the Dearg Due was forced into a marriage to a man she didn&rsquo;t love by her controlling father. Distraught about never being able to be with the man she truly loved, she killed herself, but death could not hold her in the grave. She rose up and exacted revenge on her father and husband, and drained their bodies of blood. Now, she rises from her grave in County Waterford to spread her curse upon the land.<br/><br/>Her vampire minions must drink in the counties of Ireland, vying to become the top vampire of all the island. Or, choose to be a werewolf and try to thwart the vampires.<br/><br/>Gampeplay<br/>The gameplay is designed so that the game is interesting and fun, even for those not drinking, but simple enough that people who are drinking can play the game. The game will still be quite enjoyable if the drinking aspect is omitted entirely.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The first player to reach 25 victims, and make it safely back to the Waterford Cemetery, wins the game.<br/><br/>Players travel from adjacent county to county (or by train, if they wish to skip to a different part of the island). They then roll the dice to determine how many victims they will get that night (if any). Drinks are determined by the number of victims. The players may also attack each other.<br/><br/>If the players wish, one player may take on the role of the werewolf, whose mission is to kill all of the vampires.<br/><br/>",

This is accomplished with small icon decks called &quot;Halots&quot;.<br/><br/>Action action decks contain either enemies or Items that can be gathered to help in encounters. At certain points of the game, &quot;Happenstance&quot; cards will sometimes hinder players actions whereas Character cards present helpful traits.<br/><br/>Silvanus is a versatile game, many of the components can be added or adjusted to fit a desired difficulty for players. There are optional modes of play such as allotted moves instead of real time play, and more. Short story snippets are included in the rules to give players a glimpse of Silvanus lore.<br/><br/>",

The tomb itself is broken down into 3x3 square tiles that you draw randomly and add to the map as you go. Sometimes you might find a monster Hiding in the halls. These monsters are hoarding the treasures for themselves and it's up to you to defeat them by rolling a higher dice roll than their power level. Once the monster is defeated you get the treasure for yourself. Some of this treasure may help you in your adventure, or be a curse that hinders your progression.<br/><br/>Be careful though. The tomb is only open for a limited time and anyone can trigger the collapse. Once the tomb collapses you have a limited amount of time to get back to the entrance. If you make it out then congratulations, count up your treasure. The archeologist with the most treasure wins! If you don't make it out, sorry about your luck.

These choices allow the development of teams with very varied personalities.<br/><br/>The board game will begin in a more basic form, with four national teams and rules to play endlessly unique matches. But, with the help of additional goals, we can unlock and release the game&rsquo;s full fledged potential by means of the campaign mode, in which the rules for managing the entire technical and administrative team, including trainings, casting athletes, managing the teams resources, fully customizable teams and even stadiums construction will be out allowing a hugely expanded strategical and tactical options in the best and definitive soccer game ever made!<br/><br/>NOTE: WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN ON: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.sibite.com.br/ViewCampaign.php?cid=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.sibite.com.br/ViewCampaign.php?cid=63</a><br/><br/>Check out the project in english and english subtitles as well!

        "description": "VERBA is the new language learning card game developed by The Pericles Group. The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.<br/><br/>All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nocturn is a game that combines two genres &mdash; strategy and horror. It takes place in the underworld where players take control over one of the nations struggling to survive among the dead realm. Players establish Houses and grant them lands, obtaining more Lords for their wars and intrigues. Through these Houses they also call armies or build mighty cities and strongholds for their nations. Their goals are simple: expanding borders and finally subjugating each other. During the gameplay the fifth player will lead diffrent force. Death, the original sovereign of the realm. In an attempt to recapture his lands, now lost to the living, he will pose a major threat to all the other players.<br/><br/>Easy to play/Difficult to master<br/><br/>The game can be played using Short Campaign rules (for 3 players, game time ~150 min) or Long Campaign rules (for 4-5 players, game time ~180-240 min). The basics of Nocturn are simple to learn and a game can start even with only one person fmailiar with rulebook and other players having only general idea about it. Gameplay favors not the players who blindly memorize all the rules but rather those who can scheme and think outside the box.<br/><br/>The possibilities on how to play Nocturn are only up to player imagination. <br/>As a player you can shut your nation inside a massive well defended valley surrounded by the mountains, waiting for an outside world to degrade into chaos. You can play as an agressor, focusing on conquering other players cities and strongholds while building few yourself. Or if you want to scheme in darkness, submit early in the game to the neigbour and deceive stronger players while engaging in secret actions destabilizing the world everywhere but in your lands. Still, you have to remember the World is constantly evolving around you with each passing turn.

        "description": "Elemental is a strategic board game of simultaneous action and hidden information. Players assume control of either the light mage or the dark mage and control 7 elementals in a duel. The elementals--water, fire, earth, wind, frost, bolt, and light/dark--interact in a 5-way rock-paper-scissors system. Each of them is equally strong, given the right circumstances. The goal of the game is simple: either defeat or isolate your opponent's light/dark elemental.<br/><br/>The trick is that you can only find out your opponent's pieces by battle or deduction. Each player will be trying to gather information while cutting losses and revealing as little as possible. Elementals can sustain 2 hits, allowing players to take calculated risks and control an area with a bluffed piece.<br/><br/>The arena itself plays into the deduction process with its fountains (which provide tantalizing bonuses for matching elementals) and its energy wells (which generate crystals for special one-time maneuvers). Once the player has deduced their opponent&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, they can take command of the arena and lead their elementals to victory.<br/><br/>The Print and Play is available here: Elemental Print and Play<br/>Note that the print and play is meant to convert an old set of checkers and 2 D6. As such, the lightning elemental is not included in this version, as that would require 4 more pieces than the standard checkers set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you outmaneuver the other players and control the finish?<br/><br/>Finish Line is a simple game of moving cars from start to finish. Except everyone is moving every car, and everyone is trying to get the cars to finish in a different order.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can move up to five cars one space, or remove a stop sign from the board. Optionally and in addition, a player can place a stop sign, or use one of a limited number of &quot;shift chips&quot; to move a car, move a stop sign, or draw a new Finish card. The goal for each round is to get as many cars as possible to finish in the order on your Finish card. The goal of the game is to be the first to have 10 cars finish in the order on your card.<br/><br/>The dynamic of Finish Line changes depending on the number of players, so that an effective strategy for a two-player game might be of no help at all in a four-player game. Adaptability is key.<br/><br/>",

The New world is yours for the taking, but beware there are other ambitious adventurers who would dare try and take what is rightfully yours. Forge your own destiny and make history on The Spanish Main!<br/><br/>In Cutthroats, you and up to five other players vie for control of key towns in the Spanish Main. Players utilize one of seven skills to attack each other's ships and towns.<br/><br/>Ships move by use of a 12 sided die. But players can only move in certain directions on the board, which can be changed after reaching a port. Players that land on another player's port must pay port fees to that player or try to conquer the town.<br/><br/>Combat takes place when a player passes another on the high seas and decides to attack. Each player rolls a 10 sided die and adds to that number, the number of cannon upgrades they have. Best two out of three wins the fight. Losers are forced to lose an upgrade, and pay a ransom to the victorious player as well as being sent to the nearest town.<br/><br/>Players are eliminated if they owe more doubloons than they have in their hold. Last player with money wins. A secondary way of winning is to conquer all five towns and hold them for a full round of play.<br/><br/>",

It allows the players to spy for the south and see if they can influence the war. In the first scenario they try to steal the plans of the Monitor. In the next scenario it is 1863 and they get to try and influence the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg. The last scenario is in 1865 and involves a fellow named John Wilkes Booth.<br/><br/>This is an Engle Matrix game of moderate complexity. Players take turns moving character tokens on a map to set up scenes and create sections of the narrative. Each addition to the story is evaluated in terms of how likely it is to happen and how well it fits with the overall story. This evaluation determines the number that needs to be rolled for the new segment of the story &quot;to happen&quot; and to be added to the main narrative.<br/><br/>The player who contributed the most significant elements of the story is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

All the players draw a hidden objective card which will give them their own personal agenda to fullfill. These agendas will most of the time lead to conflict of interest between the players. Objectives can be for example: to control the most of one kind of resource (eg. oil deposits, natural gas), to own public utilities or services of general interest (eg. Power, Water or Telecommunications) or to save the country (preventing the country from either falling apart in revolt or declaring bankruptcy) or ruining the country (to end the game before the 8th turn).<br/><br/>The game begins with each player drawing hidden objective cards<br/>Each turn, an event card is drawn, which will give flavor to the game as well as affect the policies and actions taken during that turn. <br/>Then, the players controlling the creditor countries, draw cards from the &quot;Memorandum&quot; deck and choose which policies they'd like to have adopted by the debtor country. In order to entice the Debtor, they offer the policies face down with a bribe card face up. Bribes can be either money or relief measures which give victory points and breathing space respectively to the Debtor player.<br/><br/>As a general rule, in order for the creditor player to earn victory points, he needs to control properties and to fullfill their hidden objectives to win the game, while any debt owed to him by the debtor player by the end of the game will be lost. On the other hand, the debtor player earns victory points from the bribes accepted, from the properties that remain public, from the happiness of his people (if any) and from the level of the debt (if he hasn't declared bankruptcy).<br/><br/>",

All players will use these cards to move around the board, capturing emblems from each player, first to do so wins.<br/><br/>How to move around the board each play will also have a deck of movement cards number 1-6 these are one time use. Also two direction cards that are reusable clockwise and counter clockwise.<br/><br/>During turns everyone at the same time will be playing one ability card, one movement card and a direction. Once all players have locked in their cards played them face down.Players will all reveal just the ability cards some cards are faster, some negate while some do really awesome things.<br/><br/>Once the cards are revealed plays in turn order or priority will move and activate their abilities.

        "description": "This is a brand new concept for traditional card games. In this game, the cards are colorful particles and the table top is an active collider slamming them into each other for the betterment of science. Experimental patterns called Waveforms are placed into the collider in an attempt to break them down into readable samples. Depending on the strength of the collisions you might get the harmonization of a perfect sample, or the particles might cause an explosion, scattering random particles around the collider and possibly ending the experiment too early.<br/><br/>This game comes with rules for both solitaire and multiplayer games for up to four players. Both versions of the game play very similarly. At the beginning of the game you pick a Waveform, which is a pattern of face up and face down cards played to the table. At the beginning of a player's turn they play one card from their hand by placing it face up onto the table. Once the card is played, the collider engine begins to run.<br/><br/>The collider engine is a set of rules that cause the cards on the table to interact. The highest numbered card located at the bottom of the Waveform will search for the lowest numbered card it can interact with (based on suit). If it finds one, it will pull that lowest numbered card to itself and they will merge into a new number (by adding their numbers together), then one of four different reactions will occur based on that new number. Once that reaction is done, the collider engine begins searching for another possible interaction, and keeps doing so until there are none left, which ends the turn.<br/><br/>Players score points by collecting cards based on some of the possible reactions. In the solitaire game the object is to score well while trying to clear all of the cards from the Waveform. The multiplayer version is all about getting the highest score through multiple rounds of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: OUTPOST WAR is a solitaire game of the battles for the Hills and Ridges along the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) during the later stages of the Korean War (1951-1953). The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Company during its grueling and miserable turn manning a Hilltop Outpost before they are relieved. As the Company Commander, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles. You have the choice to play as a US Marine, US Army, French Army, Foreign Legion or British Commonwealth Infantry Company.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of OUTPOST WAR is to successfully survive a Tour in the Hilltop Outposts along the MLR in Korea. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations manning an Outpost on a Ridge or Hill. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Outpost Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Outpost Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.<br/><br/>OUTPOST WAR can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

In this game, you will stretch your imaginative and logical mind to crack the secret behind the Code Machine. Come unlock the genius within! The product is a beautiful fusion of a word game and a logic game. Its interactive game-play makes it a great piece for friends and family pastimes. The difficulty levels are controlled by players, so it is also a nice adult-child educational toy. Something special about this product is that it features a patented word coding method that is unique, but easy to understand. So while enjoying the fun and challenge, players can gain knowledge of vocabulary and coding.<br/><br/>Easy to learn. How to play ... <br/>Step 1: Draw two game cards to determine the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; of the secret word to be formed. Reveal the two cards to all players. <br/>Step 2: One player uses the chips to form a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine. Cover it with all windows closed. <br/>Step 3: The other player(s) must crack the secret word with as few windows opened as possible. Ask questions wisely for hints in the process. The player that requires less windows opened is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>In a two-player game, one player is the Encoder, the other the Decoder. The Encoder forms a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine using the information from the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; cards, starting from the farthest left position, in correct spelling sequence, and announcing the number of letters in the word. In each round, the Decoder opens one small window at any position and attempts to name the secret word. In each game, the Decoder has a total of three changes to ask the Encoder a yes-or-no question for a hint. The questions can be used all at once or separately. When the secret word is cracked, count the number of windows opened. Switch roles and repeat. The player who required less open windows to decode the secret word is the winner.<br/><br/>In a three-player game, one player is the Encoder and the other two players are the competing Decoders. The Decoders take turns opening windows and attempting to crack the secret word. The Decoder who successfully cracks the secret word first is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rondo  is a game for 2-4 Players, with a rotary disk on the game board.<br/><br/>The Rotary disk is transparent. Except the start and end fields the whole way with all fields are covered with this disk.<br/>The path on the board is seperated in 2 concentric circles, with the private starts at the outside and the private destinations in the middle.<br/><br/>The base rule is a simple, role the die and move one of your four pawns in direction of your private destination.<br/>The pawns have 2 sizes. If your pawn is larger or equal as the pawn before it, you can pass it with a high die number.<br/>If your pawn is smaller than the pawns on your way you have to stay behind it.<br/><br/>Each pawn can throw out each opponents pawn if the pawn reaches exact the position of it. This is independent of their size.  <br/>Some fields are marked. If a pawn hits one of the marked fields, the disk is turned with all pawns on it. The new position is reached, when the players pawn is on the next marked field.<br/>There are only some single links between the circles and only 1 link from the inner circle to your Destination.<br/><br/>Therefor the rotation of all pawns may move them nearer to the destination or they have to run a full round again because they were moved on the wrong side of the link.<br/><br/>",

The player to have played the highest card receives the &quot;major blessing&quot;, all other players to have played any cards with a value greater than 0 receive the &quot;lesser blessing&quot;.<br/>blessings can have all kinds of effects, ranging form players directly gaining points by gaining dice or adding points to their dice, but also performing actions like stealing other player's dice or exchanging dice with other players.<br/>When all god's blessings have been resolved play continues with the next round of bidding.<br/><br/>",

In the middle of the table, there are five recipe cards, which show different ingredients. Players take turns drawing new ingredients and playing ingredients on the recipe. On their turn, players can either play one ingredient on a recipe, or play all missing ingredients on a recipe. If a player plays the last missing ingredient, he scores that recipe, and it is replaced by a new recipe. Play continues until a player reaches 100 points.<br/><br/>The game has different game modes. The basic game is aimed at younger players, and allows them to focus on the symbol matching. The other game modes add Golden Ticket cards to the game, which are special actions that are rewarded randomly, and Role Cards, which give the players different special powers.<br/><br/>",

Things aren&rsquo;t as simple as that though, oh no, this world is full of all the Anime tropes you&rsquo;ve come to know over the years. Tropes are elements that appear in multiple creative works, so if you watch Anime, you will know lots of the tropes that are used. Can you help the General Protagonist end up with the Girl Next Door? Or will the obsessive Yandere try to keep them apart? Maybe you&rsquo;re lucky and the Yandere isn&rsquo;t interested in you, but you still need to worry about your Rival getting in your way, along with all the other guys trying to get the Girl Next Door&rsquo;s attention.<br/><br/>Heroes and Love Interests are drawn randomly, so each time you play Doki Doki Love!, you will have to find the best way to make you Hero appeal to the various Love Interests. While it may seem easy to just increase your Appeal and Encounter a Love Interest, be warned that it is not. Other Heroes will try to lower your Appeal and get in your way. Who said love was simple? You must fight with all your soul to end up with the person you want! And don&rsquo;t worry, you can mess up their plans as well.<br/><br/>The base set for Doki Doki Love! contains tropes found in slice of life, romance/comedy, and school Anime. Do not fret though! There are plenty tropes in all kinds of Anime, so maybe (hopefully) there will be new ones coming in the future&hellip; And don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know many tropes, you will learn more after playing this game.<br/><br/>Oh, and this game is about Anime and love, so you know some Ecchi elements will find their way into the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Salmon Life Cycle Game follows the adventures of a salmon as it grows and travels from freshwater to the ocean, then back to its' birthplace stream.  Each fish encounters dangers growing to adulthood.  Players learn how few salmon actually return to their birthplace to spawn and reproduce and some of the many hazards they face as they complete their life cycle.<br/><br/>Up to six individuals may play the game, or two to six teams with two or more players per team.<br/><br/>Players or teams collect and lose &quot;energy tokens,&quot; representing how salmon feed, grow, and lose energy in a daily struggle for life.<br/><br/>Players or teams have a reserve of fish lives.  During the course of the game if they lose one of their lives they may cash in a fish life to continue play. This reinforces the concept of how many salmon die before they spawn.<br/><br/>",

The players have to do this clockwise till all figures are placed.<br/><br/>The youngest player has started this positioning and also starts the &quot;real&quot; game.<br/><br/>He chooses 1 of his figures, places it in the  neighboring field of the inner circle. This is the start figure. The next 6 figures have to bet clockwise 1 to 10 coins. The minimum bet is always the bet from the previous figure. After all bets are done the owner of the start figure rolls the die. He counts from his figure the number of the die and the owner of this figure gets the all bets and this figure is the start figure of the next round. Players which cannot pay the bet are out of the game. All their figures are taken off. The empty fields are counted for the result. If the die &quot;hits&quot; an empty field the money stays in the pot for the next round. The figure next clockWise is the next start figure.<br/><br/>Game ends when only 1 player is left or after a pregiven time. Player may decide to end the game earlier as planned, then the rules say a Minimum of 6 rounds have to be played.<br/>Game winner is the one who has the most money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game uses a standard deck of playing cards to pit two groups of heroes against one another in an epic battle involving tactics, spells, and espionage.  The game is for 2-players and usually takes 20 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with fantasy role-playing games then you will immediately recognize many of the game&rsquo;s concepts.  In this game the three court cards - the King, Queen, and Jack - become the Knight, the Witch, and the Thief.  Each hero type has it&rsquo;s own unique strengths and abilities.<br/><br/>The setup is easy, the action is fast, and you more than likely already have a deck of cards lying around.  So the next time you and a gaming friend are looking for a little action why not use those cards and see how your valiant knight fares in battle against some wily thieves and crafty witches?<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 4 court cards and these will become their Party of Heroes.  The heroes are placed in a 2x2 pattern in front of each player, called their Marching Order.  In this way the two teams can be imagined to be facing each other in a battle formation.  The position of each hero in the marching order is important as some hero types are more effective on the front lines while others are better off in the rear.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds similar to RPG games where initiative, movement, special abilities, and attacks are used to hinder and eliminate the members of the opposing party.<br/><br/>Attacks are resolved by comparing cards played from the players hands (their &quot;Inventories&quot;) and if it succeeds then an extra combat step is played to determine if the defender survived the attack or not. Throughout the combat decisions must be made and there is a press your luck element to the fighting.<br/><br/>First team to eliminate the other wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This game consists in buying properties: islands - islets - realestate, factories, piers and then developing them by building on them. (Note: You must take care to follow the order in which you are authorized to erect buildings). Each investment is provided added value thanks to a rent which becomes higher and higher, as this enables the player to set up a cash flow for himself. But if it is true that all of the players collect rent for their respective properties, they must also pay money out when they pass over the properties of other players.<br/><br/>Moreover, the game has a number of small surprises that the player must evaluate in advance to avoid finding himself at loss. Of course, &quot;Le Jeu de Polyn&eacute;sie&quot; Game, is only a game and the names of the property, islands, assets indicated as well as the card rules have no basis whatsoever in reality. This game is a pure fiction that seeks only to entertain your children and the big kids that we have remained too!<br/><br/>User description:<br/><br/>Players take the part of land owners in French Polynesia, attempting to buy and then develop their islands. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes. The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money or, in a timed game, to be the player with the largest amount of assets.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio. If a player owns all the spaces within a colour group, he may then build hotels, farms or a fishing fleet on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which cannot be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail. The game allows a player to purchase insurance or hire an attorney, to have some protection against some forms of misfortune.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pride and Glory: The Peloponnesian War is a strategy game set during a war in Ancient Greece. Players take control of the cities of Athens and Sparta and train soldiers, construct buildings, capture cities, and engage in epic battles for the future of Greece. Players control their empire from a full campaign perspective on the game board, but once a battle begins, players can command their soldiers in tactical, unit-by-unit combat on separate battlefield maps.<br/><br/>Game turns are divided into the four seasons of the year. Each season has four phases in which players: 1) Build up their empire by recruiting units, constructing buildings and conducting diplomacy. 2) Move their units around the Campaign Map and besiege cities. 3) Engage in battle and command their soldiers in tactical, simulation combat. 4) Protect themselves against revolts of the people and the stormy seas of the Aegean.<br/><br/>Every triumph brings your city more glory, and closer to victory, until all Greece kneels before you. Throughout the game players earn things called Glory Points for doing things like capturing cities, winning battles &ndash; even just by proving that your enemy is too cowardly to come out and fight. Whichever player is the first to get to 75 Glory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The superheroes (that's you), lead the other heroes of the city into battle to protect a city on the edge of destruction.<br/><br/>A wide range of threats will endanger the city every round, and it's up to the players to nullify them before they can launch an attack. By pairing up your heroic strengths to the weaknesses of your enemies, you'll be able to arrest the attacking forces.<br/><br/>These threats are only the first layer of danger, though. There's always a supervillain in the background working against Cascade City throughout the entire game. Even worse, the more progress you make towards foiling their schemes, the angrier the supervillain gets, and the more dangerous they become.<br/><br/>As if all of that wasn't enough to keep your heroic hands busy, plot twists will change the way the game is played from round to round. One round might see the villains sporting shiny new weapons, while in the next your entire team might be turned into gorillas! As the supervillain's master plan unfolds, these dynamic events will force your team to work together and adapt your strategies.<br/><br/>Thankfully, your elite team has plenty of resources to combat these threats. Some of the heroes in your team work better with each other and can join forces for massive, game-changing unite attacks! You can even summon entire supergroups to show the villains what havoc really means! Not only that, but the denizens of Cascade City are ready to fight for their homes. Whether it's the plucky news team alerting the populous of danger, the tireless repair crews rebuilding the city after vicious attacks, or the dashing Kelly Courier who risks life and limb to help your team get to where they need to be. And if all else fails, each player has their own special superpowers that they can unleash when the situation is dire!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary:<br/>クライムオン! (Climb ON!) is a Japanese board game produced by the doujin circle Kichikichian.<br/><br/>Climb ON! is a tile placement game with a theme of lead climbing. You assume the role of a climber and create climbing routes by placing wall panels on the board. Several squares are drawn in a wall panel. You roll dice and advance the number of squares, heading the top of the wall.<br/><br/>Every action consumes stamina, so you need to rest during your climb. You can try to make a challenging climb to the top without a rest, but it comes with a risk of falling down. To save you from falling down, a belayer controls a rope tied with you. You win the game if you climb up to the top of the wall first.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the game Climb On! which is completely separate.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>リードクライミングをモチーフとしたパネル配置型すごろくです。<br/>プレイヤーはクライマーとなり、自ら壁面パネルを配置してルートをつくりあげていきます。壁面パネルにはマス目が刻まれており、クライマーは2～4個のダイスを振りながら壁を登っていくことになります。<br/>すべての行動はスタミナを消費しますから、休憩をする必要もあるでしょう。<br/>挑戦的なクライミングで一気に壁を駆け上ることも可能ですが、それには墜落というリスクがついて回ります。その被害を最低限にするためにプレイヤーとビレイヤーの間はロープで繋がれています。<br/>こうやってルートを駆け上り、壁の頂点に上がったプレイヤーが勝利者となります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many, many sunsets ago, it started as a card game. It is a game about an armadillo in a handheld video game. Two twins, who had been playing the game since the womb, decided to create such a game by designing a system they deemed the Intento RiiPlay. It may have had monotone graphics but it had a cool level editor.<br/><br/>However, the prototype was hijacked by their rival creators and codenamed the Mega Raystation. Soon after, the project was apprehended by the government which saw the name as a threat to national security. Nonetheless, Intendo went on, and its founders continued playing RIC O&rsquo; Chet, the armored &lsquo;dillo card game.<br/><br/>You too can play this card game! Players create a level from their level cards for their opponent to beat. Each players level starts as 3 cards with controller button icons that must match the icons on their editor cards to score.<br/><br/>As cards are scored from the left, cards shift just as they would in a side scrolling platformer. The creator of the level uses their editor cards to determine which level cards are placed next. The first player to score all 12 of their opponents level cards wins the round and the opponent loses a health. If  a player loses all health, they have lost the game!<br/><br/>",

Set in an original world drawing upon dragon mythology from the many legends of our own world, Dragon War: Riders of Ashara focuses on dragons and riders fighting against air, ground and sea adversaries.  Their foes come from the nine kingdoms of man across three separate continents- each with their own motivations and machinations. Ashara is a world of incredibly high mountain ranges that divide the continents, meaning that wars must be fought either from the air or by sea.<br/><br/>Ashara, being the known lands of the kingdoms of mankind is at war.  The year is 1448, being the 120th occurrence of the year of the Falcon in the Zodiac of Shen. Nations battle for conquest, glory, and power. Dragon riders, highly trained warriors and the pride of their nations, sit atop powerful dragons to do battle with one another and defend against threats from the skies, lands and seas of Ashara. Dragons fight with tooth, claws and their mighty breath weapons of fire, ice, lightning, poison, acid, wind or the mysterious life stealing power of the rend. Choose your dragon and the nation you defend as you take to the skies from the back of a young and agile drake or an ancient and powerful wyrm. Or, choose to register as one of the many mercenary wings, small bands of dragon riders fighting for the highest bidder or for your own personal crusade. The time has come for heroes and their mighty steeds to take to the skies. This is the age of the Riders of Ashara.<br/><br/>",

You know of a bank that is stocked with safe deposit boxes loaded with cash, and you have assembled a team of 13 faithful robbers to do the dirty work. As you settle down to craft the perfect plan for the heist, you find out that several other people are planning to hit the same bank. Naturally, you decide to throw caution to the wind and move forward with the heist, planning it as you go... What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?<br/><br/>Underprepared Heist Management is a fast-paced card game for 2-5 players. During the heist, players work with a limited pool of plans that they are dealt, managing their heist as best as they can by ordering their robbers to steal and terminate other robbers. Situations may arise that completely alter the flow of the heist in unexpected (and sometimes deadly) ways. After the heist, everyone tallies up their take, revealing the hidden contents of the safe deposit boxes they managed to grab during the heist. The manager with the highest haul is the winner!<br/><br/>",

To do so, they draw and play cards that are worth points, including action cards that may affect opponents' points totals. To play a card, players roll a six-sided die to determine which cards they can play, based on a to-play cost.<br/><br/>The game revolves around chance (drawing the best cards), strategy (knowing when to play which action cards), and math (knowing when a certain move is the most effective one to make).<br/><br/>Players draw cards from a single deck and then play cards from their hands to create their own pile of cards, the Stack. At the end of the game, the total value of the stack is the points total for that player. However, by playing action cards players can exchange cards from their own stack with that of an opponent, thereby getting rid of bad cards or stealing good cards. Interaction with stacks is done by Action cards, which have a negative value.<br/><br/>",

If one got lost in the woods, one might have seen among the trees one of their totems, which were sacred objects they used to channel their energy. The legends also say that the gods loved to play and that, every few years, they would transform the entire forest into their playground and compete for control of these totems.<br/><br/>Borealis is an epic game of conquest in which players represent old gods of the boreal forest, trying to capture each other's totems using units with various abilities. It is played on a modular hex-based board, which is created anew at the start of each game by the players and can be transformed during it. It lasts 9 rounds, and to each round is assigned a season, summer or winter, which affects the units' movements and the arrival of reinforcements.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Be the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the 9th round. At the end of each round, a Victory Point is awarded to the player who controls the most totems. If there's a tie, no Victory Point is awarded. If, at any point, a player's victory becomes inevitable because his or her point lead is greater than the number of rounds remaining, the game should end then.<br/><br/>",

RPG by authors Simone Fini and Riccardo Giuliani, published by Limana Press.<br/>In War of Wonders extraordinary human beings with powers beyond imagination fight on WW II battlefields alongside regular troops and iconic heavy tanks to change History. National heroes, monsters born in laboratories and mysterious beings with their own secret goals: every and each of them will add new tactics, game options and strategies to your games.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>Nazi Germany declares war on Europe, and its army is unstoppable. Prodigious beings appear on the battlefields to support the Wehrmacht's efforts: flying men shower flames upon the enemy; women wearing iron masks punch through tank armour; bloodthirsty beasts devour entire regiments. The world is about to succumb to the might of the Third Reich. Aaron Spiegelmann, a Jewish scientist who escaped from the Mauthausen concentration camp, is the only hope for the Allied Forces to stop the Nazis. Spiegelmann is the genius who created the Wunderkammer, a new technology that allowed the Germans to create real superheroes with extraordinary powers. With his guidance, the US Army launches Project H.O.P.E. in order to produce their own genetically modified humans to be deployed on the battlefields. As the war rages on and every army creates its own Meta-Humans and war machines, Natural Prodigies, unscrupulous Adventurers and even secretive groups of Warlocks step into battle. From the European battlefields to the Pacific Islands, a conflict like never before is unleashed and spreads with no boundaries: humanity will forever remember it as the first War of Wonders.<br/><br/>",

Throw the die and move along the track and if you land on a space with instructions, you must obey those instructions. It has a few differences to common games of this type. Some spaces 'attract' other players' pieces to come to help you with an Alarm. This in effect means that other people will be helped forward if they are behind or brought back if they are in front.

        "description": "The Little Big Game of Word Maven consists of 6 letter dice, a dice cup, paper money and a sand timer. One die is a vowel die, with a e i o u and an 8-ball on the faces. Five dice have a mix of consonants, vowels and wild sides.  Players roll the vowel die to determine who goes first. Each player receives starting money from the bank and a Jackpot Fund is started. <br/>On their turn each player rolls all 6 dice. The goal is to make the longest word possible with the letters on the face of the dice. The player may roll up to 3 times per turn, but must keep at least one die per roll. The first roll is free; money must be paid to the Jackpot Fund for each extra roll. If the 8-ball face is rolled the player's turn is immediately over. Each turn must be finished before the timer runs out.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on the length of the word the player makes. Longer words pay more money. The Jackpot is won when a player makes a 6 letter word without using any wild sides. The winner is the player who has the most money at the end of a predetermined time, or the player who reaches a predetermined amount of money first. Additionally, each die has an orange letter on one face that spells the word &ldquo;MAVENS&rdquo;. Spelling MAVENS instantly wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If, at any time, a ball does not roll into a hole, the player may blow it again.<br/><br/>Game 1. Add the two numbers together after both balls are in holes. The highest total wins.<br/><br/>Game 2: Start with a base total of 5. Add the value of the hole where the first ball lands. Subtract the value of the hole where the 2nd ball landed. Highest total wins.<br/><br/>Game 3: Use all 4 balls. Again, start with a base total of 5. The first ball's value multiplies the base score. The second ball is added to the running total. The third ball is subtracted from the running total and the 4th ball is divided into the running total after the third ball has been computed. Highest total achieved, wins.<br/><br/>",

The maximum number of hands is therefore twelve, but total score will vary according to the skill of player in placing the cards.&quot;<br/><br/>Every player has a deck of cards.

All players then take their copy of that card and everyone, on their own board, places the card somewhere on the 5x5 grid.

        "description": "Fantasy Football: Draft, Deals, and Dice (FF3D) is a card drafting and dice rolling game that allows players to simulate the fantasy football experience. FF3D is designed to be played with 2 or 4 players, though expansions can easily allow up to 16 players. FF3D can be played in anywhere from 60-120 minutes, depending on the length of time players spend on their initial drafting process.<br/><br/>The base game of Fantasy Football: Draft, Deals, and Dice allows players to compete with each other over a shortened four week fantasy football season. The Owners have the opportunity to draft their fantasy rosters from a pool of randomized Players at the start of the season. The Team and Player Ratings are randomized at the start of each season, so no two seasons will ever be the same. One year, the San Francisco QB could be a star player with major upside &ndash; the next year, he could be a mediocre talent that shrinks in the Primetime. The winner is able to initially assess the random market conditions of the league to maximize their draft selections within their roster restrictions, as well as able to navigate the flow of the season&rsquo;s Defensive Matchups, Injuries, Hot Streaks better than their opponents.<br/><br/>After establishing agreed upon Roster Requirements for the League, the game begins with (and features) everyone&rsquo;s favorite part of the fantasy football season &ndash; the fantasy draft.<br/><br/>The Game is split into three main segments:<br/>The Fantasy Draft<br/>The Regular Season<br/>The Playoffs<br/><br/>Owners will draft a team of Players and set their starting lineups against the opposing Owner on their Fantasy Schedule. The Owners take turns determining their Weekly Results by rolling a specified number of Offensive and Defensive dice for each Player in their Starting Lineup. The number and types of dice rolled are influenced by the Player's Skill and Upside Levels, as well as any Team Matchup Modifiers, Player Hot Streaks, or Player Injuries that have been assigned to the player during the game play. In-Game Events could also trigger unexpected outcomes that can swing the momentum during a game. After all games have been played, the Owner with the most points in the matchup receives the win. At the end of each week, Players are randomly selected to either go on a Hot Streak or go on the Injured Reserve. Owners may replace Injured players by following a Waiver and Free Agency process against the other Owners to select Players from the pool of unselected Players from the initial draft. The first three weeks make up the Regular Season, with the Top 2 teams competing in Week 4 for the Championship.<br/><br/>",

The Game begins after the American Civil War and the re-United States is ready to expand its influence and power. The US feels its Manifest Destiny is to expand and annex the Territories separating the Eastern States and California.

This can be accomplished either through military victories or through diplomatic Peace Treaties.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the US Army Forces on the Frontier of the Southern Plains. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to pacify the Indian Territories in the region in order to make it safe to build US Settlements, as well as, the Transcontinental Railroad. The Player must attempt to build a number of US Settlements with a total Settlement Value (SV) of at least 41 by the end of the Turn in which the last Campaign Card is Played.<br/><br/>FEATURES: SAVAGE PLAINS features many colorful game counters including US Cavalry, US Infantry, US Artillery and Gatling Guns, Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche and Apache Indian Units.

And imagine playing &quot;capture the flag&quot; outside and giving each player a role to play as a specific warrior from history.<br/><br/>You get these 4 games in 1 from Royal Combat: Warriors of History, the card game.<br/><br/>Led by the Royal Gold Star players and assisted by the Special Silver Star players, each team / player strategizes against their opponent to defend their own castle while attempting to capture their opponent's castle.  In the active role play option and the tabletop battlefield option there is a castle area and a battlefield area on which your green star warriors from history can be placed along with the gold star, silver star and shadow players.  Shadow players are lowest in rank but operate subversively and secretly in the shadows and have special powers that enable them to capture certain members of the higher ranks.<br/><br/>For example, the Royal Gold Star cards (King, Queen and Knight) can take out the Special Silver Cards (General, Admiral and Ace), which can take out the Green Star Warriors from History (Commando, Spartan, Samurai, Mongol, Ming, Viking, Highlander, Zulu, etc...), which can take out the black star Shadow cards (Sniper, Ninja and Spy).

        "description": "Chromatix is a connection game (in the vein of Hex) for three players. The game is played on a &ldquo;hexhex&rdquo; board (a hexagon shaped board made of hexagonal cells). Opposite sides of the board are labeled in the three secondary colors orange, purple, and green. One player owns the orange sides, another owns the purple sides, and the final player owns the green sides. The playing stones are the primary colors of red, blue, and yellow. Each player plays the primary colors that mix to form his/her secondary color (e.g. the player who owns the orange sides plays the red and yellow stones). On his turn, a player must play a single stone in one of his/her two primary colors (&quot;own-stones&quot;) to any empty cell. Once placed, stones do not move. Corner cells belong to both of the sides that meet there.<br/><br/>A player can win in two ways: if there is (a) a group of own-stones that connects his sides; or (b) a group of own-stones that connects three non-adjacent sides. If more than one win criterion is achieved simultaneously, then the winner is the first player in move order (beginning with mover) who has thus fulfilled a win criterion. A player who is blocked from both ways of winning is eliminated from the game (but his/her stones remain on the board).<br/><br/>One last rule is the &ldquo;STOP-NEXT&rdquo; rule: A player may NOT play in a way that leaves the next player with an immediate win on his/her next turn. (In other words, you must block the next player if possible.)<br/><br/>Chromatix was inspired by the three player connection game Triskelion, designed by Bill Taylor and Joao Neto.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>Serpents is a strategic race game with almost no luck involved. Its theme is the struggle for survival among 7 varieties of serpents. The game is played with 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Each player takes a postcard-sized game board that depicts a winding serpent. The serpent is divided into 26 segments, each with a number ranging from 1 to 3 (some segments have a special effect: Attack or Guard). Each player places their three tokens on three segments from the tail. The goal is to take all of the three tokens to the serpent's head.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player add up the numbers where their three tokens are on, and simultaneously advance one of their token segments equal to that total. If the token lands on an Attack segment, each opponent must move all of their own tokens 1 segment backward, unless they had just advanced a token to a Guard segment.<br/><br/>Players interact with each other by Attacking/Guarding, and each serpent has its own special ability. Each turn, each player has limited options, and they are known to all players. So players' decisions and interactions will determine the winner.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>サーペンツは2～4人用の異なる7種のヘビで生存競争を行う、運の要素がほぼ無い戦略レースゲームです。<br/>プレイヤーは異なるヘビのコロニーとなり３つのコマのマス目に書かれて居る数字の合計を１つのコマの移動力としゴールをめざします。<br/>マス目には攻撃やガードのマークもありプレイヤー間のインタラクションが発生します。<br/>また各ヘビはそれぞれ固有の能力を持ち、これらの使用の見極めが重要となります。<br/>最も早く3つのコマ全てをゴールさせた者が勝者となります。<br/><br/>",

Turns out the planet's wildlife is more of a threat than the war was. Now most people are doing what they can to survive, while those few that thrive aim to mold this new world as they see fit.<br/><br/>Players spend currency called Clips, which is provided by controlled bases, to hire differing levels of troopers, based on the amount spent to hire, and summon them to Base Spaces they control on a hexagon girded map consisting of various different terrain types.<br/><br/>Players selectively draw cards from a personal deck into their hand. Players spend Clips to purchase Tier Cards and summon them from their hand of cards to a base they control. There are three tire types, Blue Tier, Green Tier, and Red Tier, each with different types of corresponding weapons and armor cards. Tire color types and sub-types determine the effectiveness of different types of weapons vs. different types of armor and vice versa. The more Tier cards of a color the player has attached to bases they control the better the items, of the matching color, they can equip from their hand to troopers.<br/><br/>Once players have troopers on the map they then spend movement points to maneuver their troopers around the map in an effort to defeat their opponents by utilizing terrain spaces which conceal troopers to keep their tier investments a secret, eliminating enemy troopers in combat, capturing neutral/enemy bases, stealing enemy tech, exploring dangerous ruins for lost technology that could aid their efforts, and visiting settlements which will challenge their wits and offer beneficial trading options.<br/><br/>Combat is initiated when a trooper attacks a target that is within range of their equipped weapon at which point an eight sided die is rolled. If the number rolled plus the level of the attacking trooper is greater than the level of the target plus any modifiers, then the attack hits and damage is calculated based on weapon and armor types and sub-types.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All Gods Are Dying is a strategic board game about the true nature of religions<br/><br/>Earth is the planet of our evolution. The home of all mankind and all of it&rsquo;s imaginary creations, the so called &bdquo;Gods&rdquo;. These things can elicit such emotions in humans that make them able to willingly do literally anything. Churches are organizations created to control and use these emotions. They nourish the delusion and work for their owners&rsquo; greed. Atheists are free fighters against Gods.<br/><br/>Every player leads a religion. Religion deceives with light but good things are all available by secular ways. Delusion, oppression flow from religion. Missionaries collect money and convert people. The aim is to make more money, to level-up the religion, to reach the highest level and power over all others.<br/><br/>There are three different kind of areas in the game where religion&rsquo;s missionaries can get money from believers. City, country, and playground - because some religions like to use children for their purposes. Values are depending on the religion&rsquo;s nature and popularity in the area.<br/><br/>You start the game on the first level. By collecting enough money you level-up your religion in greed. By successfully finishing a mission you level-up your religion in spirituality. On player's board numbers show bonus points or penalties valid at that level. That value influences the collected money and the power to convert as well.<br/><br/>Four kinds of levels are to go through from white to red. With different colors new action cards and mission cards become available. Level-up by money becomes more expensive. You have five cards in the game, action and mission cards mixed. You have three cards hidden with face down. And you have to show openly the other two.<br/><br/>You may do the following in your turn:<br/><br/>     Roll the dice and move your followers (the pieces)<br/>     Get your money from your followers<br/>     Or convert other player&rsquo;s follower<br/>     Use an action card and draw another one &ndash; action or mission card<br/>     And may accomplish one of your missions<br/><br/><br/>Or, if you don&rsquo;t like your cards<br/><br/>     You may replace up to three of them.<br/><br/><br/>Your aims are<br/><br/>     to reach the top level of greed,<br/>     to reach the top level of spirituality.<br/><br/><br/>Depending on the game style you may win by reaching the top level, or beating others.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stack 'Em 5 is a highly addictive, unique new board game that has aspects of several classics before it, such as chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, Connect 4, Go, and even Pente, but on a whole new level, or should I say levels. Think of it as 3D connect 5 on gogo juice! And, unlike all its predecessors, and most strategy games of today, Stack'Em 5 allows for more than 2 players at a time. That being said, it is an incredibly strategic battle for 2 players, however as many as 7 can enjoy it, but with 8 or more we wont take responsibility for what might happen next. You and your family &amp; friends will find a new meaning of competitiveness, making Monopoly Night look like a calm night! It's extremely simple to learn for even the youngest gamer, but will take years to master its strategies, making it challenging for the veteran player as well.<br/><br/>Strategy 101: Every single move counts in the which players try to achieve 5 in-a-row, ball by ball! The fundamental rules take less than a minute to learn, yet the game has the complexity to engage both beginners and experts alike - perfect for the entire family!<br/><br/>Stack 'Em 5 Rules!<br/><br/>Each player chooses a color and takes a set of balls. Players take turns stacking balls on the board, the first player starts by placing his/her first ball within the 9 center rods, after which point play is open to any of the 49 rods. Each and every ball is stacked strategically so that 5-in-a-row is accomplished vertically, horizontally, or diagonally just so long as it forms a straight line from point to point with NO turns. Easy Right! The rotation of play is counter-clockwise with a time limit of 30 seconds per turn,  keeping you on your toes. The board itself spins completely around, either left or right on the center rod, giving the current player the ability to look at all the different angles. Only the current player may move the board, and he/she may do so as mush as they like, until the end of their turn. Once a ball is stacked, it cannot be removed or placed elsewhere, and the players turn is over. There are no restrictions on how balls of different colors are stacked. You may put a ball on any of the 49 rods that are open. Once 7 balls occupy a rod, that rod is full, giving the players a total of 343 possible positions on the board. The goal is to simply block your opponent from getting 5-in-a-row while strategically placing your balls to do just that. Be tactical. Obstruct your opponent(s) while expanding your own &ldquo;territory&rdquo;. The game ends when a player has been able to link 5-in-a-row in any way possible.<br/><br/>",

This is determined by adding up the numbers on the right hand corner of each pair of mates.<br/> Dealer gives each player seven cards and puts the rest of the pack in the middle, turning over the first card. Each player looks to see if he has any mates. This can be seen by matching the number at the top right hand corner. A pair must be one male and one female, not two males or females. If he has any pairs, he places them face up in front of him, so that everyone can see.<br/>Each turn, the player must have a minimum of five cards in his hand before he starts. If his hand has become depleted because he won some pairs on his previous turn, then he must take as many cards as he needs from the middle pile to bring his hand up to five. He can take the last card thrown down by the last player as one of these cards if he wishes. If he has a pair (or pairs), he puts them in front as before so that everyone can see. At the end of his turn, he throws down one card on the upturned pile.<br/>Tracey Trouble card can be acted upon when the player wishes to steal unprotected pairs ie: if one is picked from the pile, he may act upon it immediately or keep it until it is of more use.<br/>Johnny Condom cards can be used whenever a player wants to protect his pairs whether he picks one up or is dealt one. To protect a pair he must place a Johnny Condom card on top of that pair.<br/>Right Brian Bummer cards are good for nothing and are there as a joker card - mainly to hold up the game.<br/>5When all the pairs are out and the only cards still circulating are Tracey&rsquo;s, Johnny&rsquo;s or Right Brian&rsquo;s, then each player adds up his score and the player with the highest number is the winner.<br/><br/>Amusing Note: According to the back of the box there are cards called 'Right Brain Bummer', i.e. no good, but in the components they have changed to 'Right Brian Bummer'.

The cards each have a Japanese word printed on them, and are color-coded by part of speech (e.g. all verbs are red).<br/><br/>Each card has a point value, and playing the cards according to a color pattern results in a grammatically correct Japanese sentence that awards the player points equal to the sum of points on cards played. In solo mode, the player tries to reach 20 points in the fewest amount of hands. In collaborative mode, players work together to build and improve sentences until the deck runs out of cards. In competitive mode, the points a player earns on his or her turn (&quot;turn points&quot;) allow the player to eliminate cards from opponents' sentences or entire sentences if enough turn points are available.<br/><br/>This deck of Japanese: The Game differs from other decks in vocabulary and art. The vocabulary is in the theme of Japanese folk tales and mythology: sentences like &quot;Momotaro defeated all the Oni on the island&quot; and &quot;The elderly woman healed her companion&quot;. This is in contrast with, for example, the Original Core Deck of Japanese: The Game that creates much more general sentences like &quot;My dog will eat the doll&quot; and &quot;Your friend is fun.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The perfect dice game for little ones.<br/><br/>Game-play:<br/>Each player takes turns to roll a multi coloured dice, then move their rescuer to the next space on the board which matches that colour. If a '?' is rolled, that player must draw a card from the deck and follow the instructions; e.g move forward/backwards x spaces, swap places with another player etc... If a player lands on a fire, they miss a turn while they extinguish the flames. The first player to get to the top of the hill, rescues the little girl and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Clearly poor judges of character, on arrival they have discovered that the chainsaw maniac intends to murder them and has quadruple locked the front door to ensure that they don't escape before he has a chance to do so. A player wins the game by either getting four keys and touching the front door, or by being the last player alive on the board.<br/><br/>A player moves around the board by rolling dice and moving as many squares in any direction accordingly (but having to move around holes).<br/><br/>After the initial first 3 goes, the maniac is released and follows the nearest player to him (who is moved by a player rolling the dice to determine the amount of spaces he goes once each player has had their turn). Once the maniac touches a player, the player must roll a certain number or higher than that number to ensure that they have not been 'hit' by the maniac.<br/><br/>Keys are obtained by searching through furniture (a card is drawn from the deck each time someone looks through furniture). The card can also be one of a special move which they can use).<br/><br/>A player wins once they collect 4 keys and then rush to the front door to unlock it and escape.<br/><br/>",

Each player races to occupy the locations provided to either gain loot as the Robber, or protect the city as the Cop.  The Cop player also attempts to arrest Robbers that are on locations. The game ends when the Robber has gained 24 loot, or the Cop has 24 arrests.  The cop can also win by stopping the Robber from getting 24 loot after all the locations have been played.<br/><br/>The Cop and Robber each have a deck that includes Units, Items, and Actions.  The Units and Items are used to occupy the locations.  Each location requires a different number to occupy, and a specific number of turns.  There are 4 locations out at a time, and 24 locations in the game in total. The Action cards are used to affect things like occupy time, defense and attack buffs, and hand management. If a player wins a location uncontested, as a Robber they win the loot, and the Cop gets 1 more location off the game board. If the other player does contest while occupied, they must play that same number of Units and Items required against the occupied player.  Each Unit has a level and it becomes a war type-highest number wins after all levels  are added up, action cards are played, and a die is rolled.  Along with the win, the player also get an Event card, which can be played for big bonuses and affect the game positively or negatively.<br/>Lastly, each player has a home base.  The Robber has their Hideout, and the Cops stay in the Police Station.  Loot and arrests are also held in these home bases, and through the play of an event card, Each player can attack the others home base for bonuses, and to lower the number of arrests and loot they have collected.  <br/>Its a fun fast paced 2 player game, with a fun light theme, and some great art and cards.<br/><br/>",

But now, Guardian City is in need of a new Super Hero to head the Allied Legends League. Each hero is on a quest to earn Feats of Bravery, in consideration of being nominated to run the League. To keep things interesting, Commissioner Freeman has enacted a Rule of Brawl, which will give heroes the opportunity to prove their mettle.<br/><br/>Hero Heads is a card game of Super Heroes and their ability to Save the Day. All the heroes of the game are from the Golden Age of Comic Books including such heroes as Miss Masque, Blue Beetle, and the Black Terror. Captain Marvel proved to be one of the most popular superhero comics of the Golden Age, regularly outselling the adventures of Superman during the 1940s. The Core deck is for has 70 Cards and is playable by 2 to 5 players, including 10 Public Domain Super Heroes, 10 Crisis Cards, and 40 Feats of Bravery Cards. The game is a quick card drafting game that is best played in rounds--the average round taking around 20-40 minutes. For those of you that are a fan of the Golden Age of Comics and enjoy quick competitive card games, then Hero Heads is a great choice for your upcoming game night.<br/><br/>Each player is given a Super Hero to start their game, then dealt five cards from the Core Deck. Players compete to be the first to obtain all nine required Feats of Bravery, using simple symbol mechanics to give the player the sequence needed in order to win. This mechanic resembles poker or gin--each Super Hero has a sequence needed to win seen on the card as signs in the form of road signs.<br/><br/>There are also Special Powers and Crisis cards which allow players to force opponents to discard important cards breaking up their sequence.<br/><br/>On each hero's turn, they must perform one action:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card from core deck<br/>     Play a Special Power or Crisis card<br/>     Discard any number of cards to discard pile<br/>     Obtain all Feats of Bravery needed<br/>     Win the game, by obtaining your Hero's total required Feats of Bravery<br/><br/><br/>",

The Main Deck is shuffled and the first thirteen cards are placed face down on the table in a cross, with one in the center and three leading out on each spoke. Each player chooses one of the spoke ends to start on. The goal card is placed face up as a fourth card at the end of one of the unchosen spokes. One card from the Main Deck is then dealt to each player and the card at the end of the spoke they each chose is flipped face up, revealing the first room they must move through.<br/><br/>Game-play: Players take two actions per turn from an assortment of actions including drawing new cards, using special rooms to fabricate protective Shieldpass cards, place a new room from their hand into an empty spot adjacent to one or more cards, check a neighboring face down room, or move from room to room. To move from a room without spending cards, a player must either have a Shieldpass attached that matches either the Security clearance of the room (Theta, Sigma, or Omega) or the attack type of the room (Fire, Ice, or Bolt). Alternatively, a player may elect to &quot;crash&quot; a room by discarding cards from their hand to draw cards from the Dice Deck in order to equal or overcome the number at the top left of the Security Room they are in. Once a room is crashed, it no longer hinders any player for the rest of the game. The first player to move their robot character to the goal card and spend an action there wins the game.<br/><br/>The game also serves as an alternate art poker deck, and has a one-to-one correspondence with a standard deck. Rules for playing a free version, by using a standard deck of cards are also available.<br/><br/>",

The players send dragons to attack or defend cities in order to control as many cities as possible. Players can also cast spells to strengthen the beasts. Aside from the pure joy of burning your friend's cities down or forcing his dragon to turn tail and run, Dracovalis features simultaneous play, so you'll be guessing where your opponent will go every turn.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will secretly decide what towns you wish to attack, or which of your towns are vulnerable and need defending. Once all players have decided, everyone moves simultaneously and the battles begin. Combat is resolved through a simple multi-round dice-pool mechanic that feels like combat and resolves quickly.<br/><br/>You will have a limited number of spells that you can cast during your turn, and the spells can be cast in multiple ways. Will you burn many spell components to ensure your spell goes off properly, or will you risk spell failure to hold some components in reserve?<br/><br/>At the game end, the player who controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>",

A game with 4 players takes 45 to 60 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Each player starts Hierarchy as a pawn, advancing up a simple roll-and-move track. As you advance up the track, you &quot;promote&quot; from pawn to rook, knight, bishop, queen, and (ultimately) king. Each promotion gives you a new special power to help you bend or break the rules of the game. Several of these powers pertain to voting.<br/><br/>Oh, did I forget to mention voting? Each player has a hand of cards. Some have immediate one-shot effects while others are votes. Votes introduce new rules to the game. When you propose a vote, you declare who (one, some, or all players) the new rule will apply to. If the vote passes, it stays in play one round for every vote it passed by (If a vote is 5-to-3 in favor, that vote's rule will stay in play for two rounds.). Votes can affect many different things such as movement, cards in hand or in play, votes, etc.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the last square of the board wins the game. With the player powers, unexpected one-shot card effects, and the possibility of sanction through votes against you from the other players, it's a task easier said than done.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Name: Luddit. Mix of &quot;Ludit&quot; (Latin: &quot;He plays&quot;) and &quot;Luddite&quot; (-&quot;against the machines&quot;- cause the ultimate purpose of this game -project- is to be impossible to solve by computers; i really hope some of you would want to join forces with me in this holy crusade  ).<br/><br/>Characteristics: the leading objective was (is) to make a game which could be as difficult as possible to solve for the computers (maybe...impossible?). By the moment, contrarily to my interest, the rules are by far not simple, ...im trying to improve that. I tried to achieve complexity by giving to the game a very chaotical and recursive nature. The board is defined in order to try to let an action to have infinite repercussion in the unfolding of the game. Its notable that, strictly speaking, the board doesnt have borders (as may be seen in the rules), so there is no &quot;preferential positions&quot;. Its interesting to note that the definition of &quot;loop&quot; does lead to literally infinite possibilities of combination in some cases (its definition is precisely the feature that has leadme to think that this game can be much more than just &quot;dificult&quot; for the computer...). And its interesting to note that wining implies to reduce this possibilities to one, that is, to reduce the number of possibilities, which is the thermodynamic definition of negative entropy. So you have to play with chaos to bring order.<br/><br/>Equipment: <br/>- 9x9 Torus board with 9x9 square grid (a standard 9x9 GO board can be used, obeying the mechanic of the torus board), 18xwhite stones, 18xblack stones. (i decided this size mostly to facilitate initial playtesting. Of course the game can be played in larger boards)<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>1 - Game is played on the intersections. Adjacency is defined as orthogonal and diagonal (i.e. every intersection point has 8 adjacent points).<br/><br/>2 - There can&rsquo;t be more than 18 total stones on the board at any time.<br/><br/>3 - We will call &quot;piece&quot; to every single stone or loop. A piece is of the color of a player if every stone that composes it is of the color of that player. A piece is &quot;at range&quot; of another if they shares at least one of their adjacent intersections.<br/><br/>4 - We will call &quot;loop&quot; to every group of pieces (regardless of color) where every piece is at range of at least another two pieces of the group (nothing prevents loops for sharing pieces). Its implied by the rule, but to clarify: If a piece A is composed by all the stones that composes a piece B, and viceversa, then A and B are the same piece, and B cant be considered has &quot;another&quot; piece for A, and viceversa.<br/><br/>5 - We will say that a piece is &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player if its of the player color or if any group of pieces (regardless of color) that are at range of that piece conforms a loop.<br/><br/>6 - A player makes a &quot;move&quot; by either:<br/>a) Taking a single stone of his color from the outside of the board and placing it in an empty place over the board.<br/>b) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board.<br/>c) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board, and then placing it back on an empty space on the board. If the removed piece is a loop, it has to remain a loop when placed back on the board.<br/><br/>7 - At the start of the game the board is empty. Each player is assigned a color. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two moves, if he has no legal move to perform the game ends, and he loses.<br/><br/>",

Kjos Music Co.)<br/><br/>Similar to &quot;Slap Jack&quot; this is an educational card game for 2-8 players to help learn music keys, signatures and chords.<br/><br/>To start the game, the deck of Cat KEY cards are shuffled and set aside and then the Major KEY SIGNATURE cards, the Primary CHORD cards, and the WILD Mouse cards are shuffled together and dealt evenly among players.  A Cat KEY card is turned over to show what key the players are in, and which primary chords and key signatures they are looking for.<br/><br/>Players take turns flipping over the top card from their deck and placing it in the central discard pile until the flipped card shows a Major KEY SIGNATURE or a Primary CHORD card belonging to the key of the Cat KEY card, then players race to &quot;pounce&quot; on it by slapping it with their hand.  The first to slap correctly adds the discard pile to his deck and then play continues.  If someone incorrectly slaps, he has to give a card from his deck to each other player.<br/><br/>The player who can collect the entire deck (or a majority, if playing with a time limit) is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The game box is magically packed full of endless adventures.<br/><br/>Legends of Rakasa: Fordra introduces players to the world of Rakasa through Five Introductory Chapters. After players play through those first five chapters, players can go on to create their own unique adventures, or go to the Trivatch.com Forums page to check out game types others are creating.<br/><br/>The game is played on tiles (some holding decks representing the Roads, the Ocean, and the Forest). While seeking to complete different objectives, players hunt across Rakasa by moving their player tokens to the different locations and battle creatures using their player equipment. Players use the parts of defeated creatures to upgrade their equipment. Though upgrading isn't ever the main objective in the Introductory Five Chapters, players are much more likely to succeed in their adventures with stronger equipment.<br/><br/>Along with hunting, crafting, and battling using the cards in Rakasa, players perform different actions using Rakmin, a mini puzzle game included in Legends of Rakasa. Rakmin consist of small tiles and dice. The Rakmin puzzle system is used for actions such as tracking down something or unlocking items.<br/><br/>Five Chapter Story cards guide players through the introductory chapters of Rakasa. The events of these chapters play out over the space of roughly three days in Rakasa. Time passes, hour by hour each turn. Day turns to night and night to day as the events of the chapters unfold. Players may decide to work together cooperatively or work in competition with each other throughout all of the chapters.<br/><br/>The Introductory Five Chapters can be played as individual game instances (each consisting of 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay). The chapters can be played as a set of sequential events, with players progressing their equipment through the chapters. Players can also jump straight into a chapter without playing previous chapters by starting with general gear that matches the difficulty level of the game at that point in the Introductory Five Chapters. After playing through the standard chapters of Legends of Rakasa: Fordra, players will be ready to venture off and create legends of their own!<br/><br/>",

In contrast to the player&rsquo;s own &quot;skip stones&quot;, the opponent's &quot;skip stones&quot; act as barriers, preventing pieces from moving over them.

        "description": "Planeteer is a unique dice allocation and tile laying game set in a retro science fiction universe. Each player takes on the role of a freelance space exploration agency. Throughout the game they will be hiring personel (known as Planeteers), exploring planetoids, encountering aliens, and completing objectives based on scenarios.<br/><br/>The game begins by drawing a random 4&quot;x4&quot; starting tile. This tile will set the scenario for the current game, whether it be a crashed starship of colonists that need rescuing, an alien hive that must be destroyed, or a cache of rare space minerals that can be mined and exploited. Players will then take turns laying down tiles to create a 5x5 grid that will serves as the planet's surface.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: The Preparation Phase, and the Action Phase. During the Prep Phase, players will allocate dice to different tasks, such as acquiring components to build rovers to explore the planet surface, building and deploying rovers, researching technology, or recruiting more Planeteers (represented by 6-sided dice). Players have a maximum number of Planeteer Interaction Points (or pips) that can be allocated amongst their available Planeteers. Once players have taken their actions in the Prep Phase, any remaining Planeteers go to the Flight Deck, and will become the Pilots for the rovers during the Action Phase.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players will assign their Pilots to any rovers they have on the planet's surface. These vehicles can perform tasks such as moving around the planet, interacting with objects (like salvaging or mining for minerals), or attacking (other players or aliens). Each scenario has a certain objective to complete, and the player who does so most efficiently wins the game.<br/><br/>One of the most unique aspects of Planeteer are the rovers. Rovers are built by stacking components (cardboard chits). Each stack has a hole in the middle to fit a die (the pilot). The die face will show how many actions are available for that rover. Actions are dependent on the components equipped. Each component stacks so that it's available actions (icons) don't overlap, so any icon showing is an action available for that rover.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Madzzle is a universe of engaging games which explores the most exciting worlds on our Planet &amp; beyond!It was created to give anxious parents an alternative for  their smartphone/ tablet hooked kids.<br/><br/>Madzzle has reinvented the way world looks at Jigsaw puzzles.  Jigsaw puzzles always meant broken images,however with our patent pending  zero gap technology, we have eliminated all gaps literally in a puzzle. This also meant that the completed puzzle could in turn become a board to play endless new games. This is how we added two more games for unending fun.<br/>Object Hunt: In this game players race to find objects on the completed puzzle.<br/>Data Duel: Its a trump card style game where players square off with each other based on facts and location of the object on the      completed puzzle.<br/><br/>Madzzle also solves the biggest problem with Jigsaws i.e. that it is not portable and once completed have to be dismantled. With the help of our magnetic mat, Madzzle can be moved around and players can also roll up the completed puzzle and roll out the completed puzzle whenever they are in the mood for some Madzzle Fun.<br/><br/>Madzzle is available in three exciting themes- Bermuda Triangle, Mysteries of the Amazon and Worldopedia.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ho, traveler! If you would wander these lands, you must prepare yourself; pitiless death stalks all those who roam far here. Carry with you strong iron blades, and cover your shoulders with heavy cloaks. Select with care those hale companions whom you can stoutly trust. I pray ye have honed your skills in combat, or perchance taken on the trade of magics. You will find many aged relics on your path: make use of them, if ye will. For there are those who would pursue you, and their steel is sharp, their ilk stalwart, their wits keen. The fragments of that ancient alliance weaken now, and the tenuous peace of this age threatens to expire&hellip;<br/><br/>Third Age: Eternal exists in an exciting universe where beasts, known as the Awakened, inhabit a land that would not be unfamiliar to the player. As a modular card game, one must select a cadre of heroes, outfit them with arms and armor, call upon the aid of companions, and employ skills and actions to face the opposing player in battle.<br/><br/>In Third Age: Eternal, vitality, a card&rsquo;s life force, is also one&rsquo;s main form of currency, and a delicate balance must be stricken to win&mdash;so weigh your defenses against your offenses or you may quickly find yourself overrun. Certain cards or abilities require additional payment in the form of exhaustion, a card&rsquo;s capacity for exertion; but overwork a companion or gear and you will find it will expire. In Third Age: Eternal, one must constantly balance one&rsquo;s own vitality and exhaustion, which ensures a challenging game of tough choices and rich tactics.<br/><br/>Each deck in Third Age: Eternal can play through wildly different strategies. You may be a hero whose skills with the gun are all you need; or strike among an army of companions and ride into battle with your brothers-in-arms. Or maybe you&rsquo;re a mercenary of magic and action, and you will weave great firestorms to devastate even the largest forces. The possibilities are endless, but you must be clever if you wish to be standing after the dust settles&hellip;<br/><br/>Third Age: Eternal is a robust and customizable game that is unmatched in its flexibility of strategy.<br/><br/>",

After 9 to 12 rounds, the game ends and the player with the most valuable portfolio wins!<br/><br/>Before the game begins, players will secretly contribute cards to a market deck, which governs how well the four sectors of stocks perform in each round. Players will thus have partial knowledge of how the markets will improve or degrade. Then they must fill the gaps in their knowledge by keenly observing how their opponents play.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he or she may buy stocks from their hand to add to their portfolio, sell stocks for some liquid cash, work to increase the value of a stock (by discarding similar stocks from hand), play a headline card to enact an event, or pass. They will want to be careful, though-- There are multiples of each stock card, and each card of a given company will gain and lose value identically throughout the game.<br/><br/>So look out before adding value to your share in Manitoba Maple; your opponent may own a share in the same company and directly benefit from your action!<br/><br/>",

This game is about an epidemic, but instead of being threatened by diseases or zombies, the players must escape their own weapons. In this game, players may even want to give weapons to  their opponents in order to get rid of them.  <br/> Like in other games, players need armies to protect themselves or attack their opponents. They also have populations to sustain their armies. But the problem is: <br/> 1. Weapons never leave the game. When an army is killed, its weapons stay on the board. Those weapons are given to another population (even belonging to another player). That population thus becomes an army. <br/>2. But armies need populations. When an army is not sustained by a population, it starves and is removed from the game. However, as explained in rule 1, its weapons stay on the board and will be given to another population. <br/> As more and more weapons are added in the course of the game, this mechanic threatens the players with a snowball effect: The more armies get destroyed, the more populations become armies by receiving weapons.The  more populations become armies, the less armies can be sustained&hellip; And so it gets only worse: as those unsustained armies are eliminated, the remaining populations receive even more weapons ...  <br/> The winner will be the player that best survives this process.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Magic Shop is a game of magical, mercantile mayhem! Players each assume the role of a wizard or witch running their own magic shop, using ingredient cards to to concoct potions, talismans, scrolls, and magical weapons and armor with the help of your apprentices. Apprentices are sent into the market to gather magical ingredients and advertise to potential customers, or you may have some stay in the lab to help with the work of enchanting.<br/><br/>Ingredient cards are placed into your &quot;cauldron&quot; to produce a dice pool. This dice pool is then rolled in an attempt to complete enchantment lines (sets of specific dice facings). Players may opt to try and add more dice to their cauldrons to complete additional lines to make their items more valuable, but risk drawing magical accident cards that may make their apprentices vanish, curse the item, or turn some of your hard-earned gold into lead.<br/><br/>Cast spells to help you in your endeavors by having an apprentice visit the caster's tower, or hex your opponents to give you an edge in your quest to be the greatest magic shop owner in the city.<br/><br/>Try to anticipate your customers' needs when they arrive and sell them as many of your finished items as possible and pave the way to your victory! Victory Points are earned primarily by making the most gold selling your enchantments, but victory points may also be earned from completing all enchantment lines on a magic item. Points may be lost if your items end up cursed. The wizard or witch with the highest number of victory points at the end of eight turns is considered the winner.<br/><br/>",

The box contains a small Event Book; according to the specific terrain, a die roll is needed to decide what is about to happen in that round with your character.

        "description": "Nuramuru literally means &quot;earth track&quot; in many of the Aboriginal dialects still spoken today. Travelling their land without maps, Indigenous Australians created a series of songs based on the contours of the land. The songs defy language, and are aural representations of the landscape. Knowlegeable Aboriginals could navigate very great distances with accuracy by singing the landscape. Nuramuru allows players to explore the continent of Australia, expand their territories through strategic game play, and become educated about the rich history and culture of Aboriginal people.<br/><br/>Nuramuru pits four players against each other in a race to explore the country of Australia. Players must explore territory and collect point cards to be the first to 75 points and win.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by Bruce Chatwin's 1987 book 'The Songlines', and draws its game mechanics from Ticket to Ride and Settlers of Catan. Played on a point-to-point network map of Australia, each player moves to an adjoining location, draws a card from the deck, and if he has the required card type(s) for the location, can claim that location by placing one of his tokens on it. Another player can steal possession of that location by moving to it and spending twice as many of the the required card type(s). Players receive points for each location controlled, extra points for individual locations on the ancient Songlines, and a bonus for complete control of a Songline.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moneyball combines euro-style mechanics and the latest in advanced analytics (Sabermetrics) to build a true 21st century tabletop baseball simulation. Moneyball plays faster, smoother, and more accurately than anything before it. Player cards are not jammed with complicated and unsightly dice tables, just 5 straightforward 1-10 ratings for hitters (Contact, Patience, Power, Bunting, Baserunning) and pitchers (Control, Velocity, Repertoire, Move, and Stamina). There are no dice rolls with multiples charts to reference, just a simple card draw for the pitcher and chit draw for the batter.<br/><br/>Run your front office like a real front office by evaluating talent using the same metrics actual scouts and GMs use today. Not the stats of yesteryear. With advanced Sabermetrics, we've learned there are just a handful of underlying statistics that determine a player's performance. For pitchers the only stats that really matter are his walk, strikeout and fly ball rate. It&rsquo;s been statistically proven that a pitcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; has very little influence on the outcome once a ball is a play. It&rsquo;s much more dependent on the stadium, weather, the defense behind him, and pure luck &ndash; all factors beyond his control. For hitters, strike out and line drive rates, more than anything, determine their batting average. Moneyball has been built from the ground up using these underlying principles.<br/><br/>Pitchers are streakier than hitters and are therefore modeled differently in Moneyball. Their performance is highly volatile and can vary greatly from game to game because your starting pitcher&rsquo;s draw deck is constructed before each game. The pitcher deck, which determines strike outs, walks, and home runs consists of 108 cards. Your starter&rsquo;s deck has only 36 of those cards and it is typically reshuffled several times each start. One of your roles as the manager is to evaluate his &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as the game progresses. This creates fantastic &ldquo;heat of the moment&rdquo; decision making that does not exist in other baseball sims. If your starter is wilder than usual or has served up several gopher balls, it&rsquo;s probably because he didn&rsquo;t have his best &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; i.e. his draw deck has more walk and home run cards than usual. So recognizing when your starter doesn&rsquo;t have his best stuff and yanking him is CRUCIAL to your success as a manager. Starters in Moneyball are not purely random dice rolls with a backwards cause-and-effect &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; modifier added after they&rsquo;ve already gotten lit up. Manage your starting pitcher like a real manager, not a dice roller&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qaanaaq is a game of palindromic pattern building for two or three players.<br/><br/>Needed: Paper and pen<br/><br/>Goal: To have the most points when the board fills.<br/><br/>Setup: Draw a 5x5 grid on the paper with the center square blacked out, or an 8x8 grid with the center four squares blacked out. For two players one player plays 'Q', the other plays 'A', and the letter 'N' is neutral. For three players each plays one of the three letters.<br/><br/>Gameplay: On each turn, players write one of each letter into any empty cell on the board (the center is not a playable cell). When the board fills up then the scoring begins.<br/><br/>Scoring: Palindromes are checked along the horizontal and vertical axes.  For each palindrome containing your letter, score points equal to the palindrome's size minus the number of opponent letters therein. The neutral letter 'N' (2p only) is not considered an opponent letter. In addition, palindromes may also contain sub-palindromes that are scored separately.<br/><br/>Examples: The palindrome QAQ for the Q-player is worth 2pts. However, the palindrome QNQ is worth 3pts. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>The palindrome QQQQ is worth 4-points, but also contains sub palindromes QQQ, QQQ, QQ, QQ, and QQ, making it worth a total of 16-points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction in the instructions:<br/><br/>&quot;Each player is a Secret Agent trying to capture enemy spies by carefully plotting their constantly changing locations.  The spies are hidden on the indexed underworld turntable below the playing surface. In turn, Agents make secret investigations with the DetectiMeter, which will register the presence of a hidden spy.  Using these readings, each Agent marks his own findings on the plastic plotting chart in his notebook.  Players send their turns by reindexing the turntable, which changes the locations of the spies.  All Agents must adjust their notebooks accordingly, in order to &quot;shadow&quot; the spies as they move about in the underworld.  When an Agent can arrest a spy in the act of committing espionage, he uses the Limousine to pick up the spy and drive him out of hiding. The Agent is rewarded with the point value assigned to the crime where he made his arrest.  When all seven spies have been captured, the Agent with the most points is THE WINNER.&quot;<br/><br/>The game makes extensive use of magnets.  The spy disks contain magnets, and the Detectimeter detects their presence.  The Limousine, which is played on the upper board, has a magnet with which it picks up a spy below the board.  When the Limousine is brought back to the Agents home base, the spy disk falls out of an opening under the upper board.  Cool game!<br/><br/>",

Scan your purchase through the scanner to find how much each item costs.&quot;<br/><br/>There are two ways to play the game.  Level 1 is called Shopping Cart Match.  In this game, each player has a card with a shopping card marked with circles corresponding to various coins.  Each player in turn draws a card, passes it through the &quot;secret scanner&quot; to determine the value and then takes that amount in play money from the &quot;cash register.&quot;  The coins taken are placed on the circles on the card if they can fit.  The first player to fill all his circles wins.  Players figure out which combination of coins to take in order to fill the most circles on their card.<br/><br/>Level 2 is called Secret Shopper.  In this version of the game, players start with a set amount of money.  They then roll a die and move a pawn along a track.  Each space will instruct them to buy one or more items, buy for a friend, return a previously bought item and collect money, or lose a turn.  If an item must be bought, the player draws a card, passes it through the &quot;secret scanner&quot; and then pays the indicated amount back into the cash register.  Coupon spaces reduce the price of items.  Once one player reaches the end the track, the game ends and the player with the most money remaining wins.  Unlike Shopping Cart Match, there is no strategy to this version of the game, although players must be able to make change.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Zlatan Board Game! appears inside the back cover of the book Zlatan by Illugi J&ouml;kulsson. It follows the life and career of Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It is a simple roll-and-move game where players roll a die to progress along a track. Spaces along the way refer to setbacks and successes in Zlatan's life and career, corresponding to moving forward or back on the track or gaining or losing turns.  Some spaces also require player to complete actions such as counting to 60 or speaking in a French accent. The first player to reach the end of the track wins, although the rules specify that players decide whether an exact roll is necessary.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game of French origin derives its name from the French names of the wind directions West-North-East (Ouest-Nord-Est) and is played on a circular board showing four arms, like the vanes of a windmill. Each such arm consists of three paths of seven cases, leading up to a eighth case (one per path) which is located on a mounted, turnable disc in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Each player sits at the end of one arm and places one her own three playing pieces (marbles) on the first case of each path. A neutral playing piece is put on the eighth case of each middle path (so four in total, one per arm). The goal of the game is to move the own pieces to the opposite cases, one in each arm. (The color coding on the board makes clear which path to use in which arm.)<br/><br/>Note however, that the other players' pieces can be passed but that neutral pieces form an obstacle to all players.<br/><br/>On each turn a standard six sided die is rolled on each turn. The player can then either move one own piece over the according number of spaces or make one of the following alternative moves instead:<br/><br/><br/>     When a even number was rolled, the disc in the middle of the board may be turned 180&deg; (thus relocating all pieces - neutral and owned by the players - on it).<br/>     When an odd number was rolled, the disc in the middle of the board may be turned 90&deg; - clockwise or counterclockwise.<br/>     When a 6 was rolled, the player may take one of the neutral pieces in play and move it to any free space on the board.<br/><br/><br/>When making a normal move and landing exactly on an other playing piece (neutral or belonging to an other player), the active player may also move that piece any free space on the board.<br/><br/>In a two player game, each player plays with two colors. In a four player game, the two players sitting opposite to each other can play as teams.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to get ones pawns to the starting positions of the opponent or on the center spaces of the board.<br/><br/>The game was published before 1908.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kamasutra: The Game of Love was originally published as 8 pages of rules insert between pages 92 and 93 of Lee Siegel's book Love in a Dead Language. It is a competitive two-player game played on a board easily customized from a standard Pachisi board. In addition to the board and the text of the Kamasutra itself, the game requires the following components:<br/><br/><br/>     6 pawns of three sizes and two colors<br/>     64 unique cards divided into eight suits (each card representing a sexual technique) <br/>     1 pair of dice<br/><br/><br/>One player has three male pawns, the other has three female ones. The goal of the game is to move these from their home circle to the central Kamaloka (&quot;World of Eternal Pleasure&quot;). To make the final approach to the Kamaloka requires that each pawn first collect one card in each of the 8 suits of the Kamakala deck. Cards may usually be acquired when a pawn is moved into a space containing a pawn of the opposite sex. Special spaces provide other conditions for acquisition, loss, or trading of cards.<br/><br/>The board design includes some double-sized spaces that provide a choice of paths, allowing players to adjust the effects of dice rolls for movement. Also, a pawn may move clockwise or counter-clockwise, but only one of the two directions on any given turn.<br/><br/>",

Each player sets a &quot;fleet&quot; of 20 ships on the first three rows (24 spaces)of the 8x8 gridded board nearest its home base. Four spaces are left vacant. As in Stratego the placement/order of battle is hidden from the opponent. One side is chosen to go first and movement is one space in any unoccupied direction with alternating turns. Attacks are made when one piece moves to a vacant space directly in front of an opponent's piece and the rank/class of the ship is announced. The ship with the highest assigned value is the winner and the lesser piece is removed from the board. If both have the same value, they're both removed. One important difference is that each side is given 4 Submarines with the lowest assigned value of 1, but they take ALL pieces except the 4 Subchasers (value 2). Attacks need not be made when a piece moves into attack position. If no value is announced with the move, the piece acts a block to the opposing piece. The player whose Submarine attacks the opponents flagship first wins the game. If both flagships are removed through a draw attack, the game continues until one fleet is removed entirely from the board or the game may be called a draw.<br/><br/>Fleet pieces/order of battle<br/><br/>1 Flagship - value 10<br/>1 Battle Cruiser - value 8 <br/>2 Battleships - value 6<br/>2 Cruisers  - value 5<br/>3 Destroyers - value 4<br/>3 Torpedo Boats - value 3<br/>4 Subchasers - value 2<br/>4 Submarines - value 1<br/><br/>20 pieces in each fleet (red and blue). Pieces are made of wood.<br/><br/><br/>",

A team game,<br/><br/>It's no issue to simulate ambient noise, the poor quality of telephone communication, .. On the one hand we'll put two teams in the competition (which will happen to find his treasure in first... and then it will create an emulation.. a sense of urgency, like a crisis situation). And in addition, we will impose, round after round, a way to communication even further (sorry.. pas could help..), such as talking with your hand in front of your mouth, or like a ventriloquist...<br/><br/>To take into account the possibility of being wrong because different terrain typess, near the treasure the different areas of the treasure map will bear the name of beaches... all different beaches, but with similar pronouniations. (Oracabech Playa, Ocarabess Palia, Oracabess Playa etc etc...).<br/><br/>Finally, to follow the paths on the reconstituted map with your finger... These paths are almost impossible to follow with the naked eye... Indeed, they have green dotted amid the lush greenery in orange red tones... On the other hand, when we place the small red filter of transparent plastic on the map and push it with our finger, flora disappears, leaving the path that must be followed...<br/><br/>The most interesting part of this game, it is that, in explanation, we are told only the rules of the game to the different teams. Each is free to use the mode of communication and  following the roads seems it best adapted to the situation... And with the urgency of the game, against the competition, each trying to go to the more quickly... and forget everything else. Except that at the end of each part, without using clear communication techniques, no chance to have found the right solution... repeat the exercise with communication secure leads, each time to find the solution.<br/><br/>In summary, this game is more meaningful than all the usual seminars playful setting, and which led to doubt one's understanding...<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>Game is only played with 4 players, 2 on each time. One of each pair of players is the apprentice attempting to find the treasure with the map by  blindly pushing a smaller red player piece. As you get closer and closer to the treasure (likely different colours or borders to indicate different zones), the other player (playing your pirate mentor) has their directions conveyed more and more muffled to simulate their memory or your understanding of their directions becoming less and less certain. Either it's a time trial between the two teams, going one at a time or it's simultaneously play (and the first to reach the treasure wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box: &quot;Bilby Buddies is a matching game designed to teach animal recognition to children between the ages of 18 months-6 years.&quot;<br/><br/>There are two ways to play Bilby Buddies, both takeoffs on classic games. In &quot;Bingo Style,&quot; each player has a board marked with 12 animals. Players in turn choose a tile from a face-down stack and call out the name of the animal. The player who has the animal on his or her card claims the tile. The first player to fill the boar wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Memory Style,&quot; each player gets a game board. The 48 animal tiles are spread out face-down. Each player in turn takes a tile, tries to match it to their card, and if it doesn't match, puts it back face-down. Other players may gain an advantage by remembering which tiles are where. The first player to fill his or her card wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the pretentious game of Hipsters. A world of social intrigue, popularity and betrayal. In a game of &quot;Hipster&quot;, you will fight over the current trendy location and its hipsters. By spending items or purchasing items, you can pretend to be something, that you are not. The hipster who persuade the most followers, win the game.<br/><br/>Are you ready to become a pretentious board gamer?<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>Setup: Each player draws a random Hipster card from the Hipster cards deck. Add it facedown in front of the player. Add the &ldquo;In the City&quot; starting location card to the middle of the table. Each player draws 5 single value Item cards from the Item cards deck.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Item cards deck and split them into X piles face up (X is the number of players). Shuffle the Hipster deck and split them into X piles face up.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest Hipster initiative, chooses the starting player. Players take their turn clockwise.<br/><br/>Round: Starting with the first player, the player can play five Item cards from their hand. Each card has a printed status value, which can be used to purchase other Item cards. Item cards also have bonuses, when paired with other items. The more you combine, the bigger the pay off.<br/><br/>The player can also &ldquo;make a move&rdquo; on a new hipster, from the Hipster deck, at the current location (not another players hipster). They do this, by spending items equal to or higher then the Hipsters printed status value. They place these item cards facedown at the location, and in that players turn, other players can fight for attention, buy spending items which subtract from the cards added by the initiating Hipster. When another player choose to spend items, the cards are discarded afterward and they will have that amount of card less in their turn, as they have played their card out of turn.<br/><br/>Each Hipster card, has different status values with each an attached event. The player can choose to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; one of these statuses and activate the attached event. When buying a hipster, it becomes part of that players following. Each hipster card also has a printed association (i.e. Cafe Hipster). The players gathers hipsters, which match their starting hipster association, as they are the only one giving credit when ending the game.<br/><br/>If a player has spotted, that another player is collecting a specific association/trait, they can challenge that player by naming the trait. If they are correct, the player can once per game, select that players current hand. If they are incorrect, they must give the other player their hand. When a Hipster is bought, the player can choose to change location, as each location has events or abilities that might make things better or worse for the other players as the location will alter items and hipster values, traits and abilities.<br/><br/>Ending the game: The game ends, when there are no more hipsters in the hipster deck.<br/><br/>Winning Condition: The Hipster with the most like-minded hipsters win the game (cards of the same trait).<br/><br/>",

The rules are easy to play, allowing the War Gamer the creativity in designing or modifying the rules to their own standards utilizing their own scenarios or using the numerous scenarios included based loosely on many historical skirmishes and some fictionalized accounts throughout Portugal and Spain. The game uses a random card generating system, in which each miniature figure is matched to a game card shuffled into the card deck. Figures are assigned a random number of Action Points each turn based on a 1d6 die roll at the start of each round so their action abilities also change each turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War on the High Seas is set in the year of 1750 around the time that world trade was plagued by piracy, dangerous ocean voyages and fierce wars. Can you a small time merchant battle the stormy oceans and avoid the scourge of piracy to rise up with a fleet of merchant ships and enough wealth to become the leading merchant the world has ever known. Or will you get drawn in to a life of piracy, fighting and stealing your fortune. Or perhaps you will find wealth in war and help your nation conquer the world.<br/><br/>Players begin the game representing one of the major nations of 1750 as a small time merchant with limited ships and wealth, they have to trade goods across the world visiting ports until they can expand. With each new ship they add to their convoy their power across the oceans grows and they must decide when the time is right how they will gain a victory and win the game.<br/><br/>There are four ways to win the game, by trade, piracy, war or a mixture of all three. Each turn players roll a dice and move across the seas from port to port, where they can either trade, attack, offer passage, repair or buy another ship. Attacking ports and other convoys will lead to piracy unless first a letter of marquee is obtained from the players government. Becoming a Pirate has few rewards and will immediately alienate you from ports unless it too flies the Jolly Rodger.<br/><br/>The game evolves quickly and as the players get closer to their winning objectives, a race emerges to either beat them to the pip or to sabotage their efforts and gain some more time to build on their own convoy. Only the brave and unscrupulous can hope to gain a foot hold in the war on the high seas.<br/><br/>",

Deal a card also to the table face down and put the rest of the deck on top of it perpendicularly.<br/>This card will not be drawn except if the last action is a mandatory draw (with card #2).<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>1. Draw a card from the deck next to your own card<br/>2. Put one of these card down in front of you and execute the action on it (active cards #1-#6 and #9, passive cards #0, #7, #8)<br/>The cards are collected face up on top of each other so that the numbers on the cards are visible.

In the former case, the last remaining player is the winner. In the latter case the winner is who has the highest card in their hand.<br/><br/>Cards (pieces in the deck):<br/>0 (2) If another player looks at this card, that player is out.<br/>1 (5) Guess a player and a number (except #1).

Natal is feeling threatened and has organized a Military Force to cross into Zululand and force Cetswayo to disband his Army. As the Commander of British Forces in Natal, South Africa, you must protect the British Settlements and squash the Forces of Cetswayo by capturing their Capital of Ulundi and 8 additional Zulu Kraals.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the British Forces during the invasion of Zululand. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to capture the Zulu Capital of Ulundi and 8 other Zulu Kraals before the Campaign Deck is exhausted or the Zulus have Looted 5 of the starting British controlled Towns. If the Zulu Army Loots 6 or more of the originally British controlled Towns or Settlements, the Zulus win. Also, if the British do not capture Ulundi and 8 other Zulu Kraals before the Campaign Deck is exhausted, the Zulus Win.<br/><br/>",

If a pawn gets on a space, that is occupied by another pawn, this pawn has to reveal it's identity.

The game consists of 37 Hexagonal Playing Pieces, 1 set of instructions and a nice Black Cloth Pouch w/ drawstrings to hold all the pieces! Set-up time is approx. 2-3 minutes with playtime amounting to 5-10 minutes, and this game can be played with up to 6 players.<br/> GAMEPLAY:<br/>1st) dump out the hexagonal pieces onto your playing surface and find the queen chit (she has an image on each side of the chit so it should be easy to find her).<br/>2nd)Place the queen in the middle of the playing surface.<br/>3rd)Arrange the rest of the pieces (beekeeper logo side facing up) around the queen piece until you have 3 rows around the queen. (The playing surface should resemble a giant hexagonal shape, or honeycomb)<br/>4th) Youngest player gets to go first by pulling 1 chit from the game (*NOTE* only pieces with 3 open sides can be removed from the arranged pieces).  He/She will then flip over the piece and find the following;<br/>BEE POINTS:  These give you points to win the game<br/>ANIMALS:  These guys make you lose turns<br/>HONEY TOKENS: You need at least 6 honey tokens to pull the queen from her throne when she has at least 3 open sides and end the game and with her you get 10 bee points.<br/>BEE NET or HONEY EXTRACTOR:  Use these cards once during gameplay to steal a bee chit or honey chit from an opposing player (once used they must be discarded to the side)<br/>  Once the first player's turn is complete, then the person to the left is next to pull a piece from the hive.<br/><br/>ENDING AND WINNING THE GAME:<br/>  The game is ended when the Queen chit is removed from the playing surface, which can happen two ways;<br/>  One way is if she has at least 3 open sides and someone has 6 or more HONEY TOKENS.<br/>  The other way is if there are no more chits to pull from the game, then the queen is rewarded to the next player's turn.<br/>  The game is won by the person with the most Bee Points, so count up all of your drones', larvas', workers' and queen bee's chit values and that will be your Bee Point count.<br/><br/>Norshanks Game Cause:<br/> As with most of the games that Norshanks Games will be marketing, this game is tied to Beekeeping Associations in various countries, and every time a game is sold, part of the profits will be donated to the Purchaser's Current Country of Residence National Beekeeping Association.<br/> The donated funds will go to the Beekeeping Associations to help save the bees by; researching colony collapse disorder, increasing bee populations, educating the public about the importance of bees, and many other great projects!<br/> With your help we can help reverse the collapse of bee populations everywhere!<br/><br/>Game is expected to be ready for shipment in Winter.<br/><br/>",

The combined pawns can be separated, if an opponent lands on a space that is already occupied by two combined pawns.<br/><br/>",

Will you be able to quench your thirst or will die trying? In an odd mix inspired by Wings of War, Mille Borne, and Mad Max, we have a head to head card game with dice rolling, location smashing, and card shooting fun!<br/><br/>A deck of Distance Cards is shuffled and placed between both players. A deck of Item Cards is also shuffled and place between both players. Finally, a set of six vehicle cards (representative of each player's car layout) and a gear box card is given to each player.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards from the Distance Deck and rolling 1d6 to try to beat the difficulty value listed on each card. Different locations have different difficulty values, sometimes causing damage to vehicles or rewarding players with items like armor or weapons. As players successfully maneuver through locations, they add these cards to their Distance Traveled deck.<br/><br/>Players may also choose to attack each other to cause damage to their vehicles, use items to boost their position, or press their luck and avoid disastrous terrain (no one likes minefields).<br/><br/>The player with the most Distance Traveled cards at the end of the deck or have gained 10+ cards than their opponent wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Exciting and educational boardgame for learning about the Kanza language and culture. The traditional language of the Kanza people is Kadnzele, or simply Kanza. ALthugh it is a separate language, it is closely related to the languages of the Osage, Ponca, Omaha and Quapaw tribes. Kanza is a Siouan language, and so it also has similarities in grammar and vocabulary with loway, Otoe-Missouria, the languages of the Sioux peoples, as well as more distant ties to Crow, Mandan, Hidatsa, Biloxi and others.<br/><br/>Wajiphanyin is played as a roll and move game. Points are awarded for translations from English to Kanza, Identifying animals, other objects and words  with the Kanza words, and translating Kanza to English. An emphasis is placed on worlds from the natural environment. Score sheets are used to keep track of the points and task. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner. The duration of the game (usually time) should be decided prior to playing.<br/><br/>During a long and very devastating period in the history of the tribe, usage of the language began to taper off dramatically. This trend continued into the twentieth century until only a handful of the fullbloods in the 1970's could speak fluently. Today all of these elders are gone. The Kanza people today speak English as a first language, but many can still understand and use the Kanza words and phrases.<br/><br/>The Kaw Nation is interested in both preserving the language and more importantly reviving it. The Kanza Language Prodject is a special department of the tribal operation devoted to this task. This game is an important part of the education and preservation of this language and its importance in the culture.<br/><br/>",

They start with 16 cards each, 4 of each of 4 abstract symbol types.<br/><br/>Each turn one player is the modification player and sets the relationship graph, i.e. symbol 1 beats symbol 2, 3, and 4, symbol 2 loses to symbol 1, but beats 3 and 4 etc. Both players then lay down one card from their hand and then use the relationship graph to see whose card beats the other. If a player's card beats the other's according to the relationship graph, then they score a point.

A deck of tunnel cards depicts the subterranean void left behind by the drilling ship as it burrows deep underground. Meanwhile, robot miners (controlled by talented robot pilots such as yourselves) emerge from a hatch at the rear of the ship and venture outward. As the game unfolds, the stream of tunnel cards will become longer and longer, stretching across your table. The drill ship can be advanced in any direction you wish, so long as the tunnel does not intersect itself.<br/> Object of the Game: As robot pilots, players use dice to move their robots through the tunnel, pick up ore, and deliver it back to the ship. Space bucks are scored for each ore cube brought back, with big payouts earned for multiple ore of the same type. The pilot who earns the most space bucks before the end of the game (at which point the ship will resurface and return home) is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Harvest resources, hire crew, modify your ship, and manage to get out with the highest profit before it supernovas.<br/><br/>Novanauts is a card and dice game for 2 to 4 people that will take around 1 to 2 hours to complete. Players in the game act as the sponsor of a space salvage mission. The star in this solar system is close to going supernova, so time is limited.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a ship capable of harvesting resources from available planets in the solar system for profit. Each planet has a unique mixture and abundance of each of the possible resources: Noble Gas, Organics, Mineral Ore, and Research Samples.  Resources are claimed by rolling dice to see if a particular harvest was successful. The monetary value of each resource is set by a market, which shifts up and down as demand grows or shrinks for the resource.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will hire crew and buy modifications to enhance their ship and gain new abilities to help them reach this goal. Crew usually grants small buffs, and modifications often grant new abilities.  While a handful of weapons exist to punish a player who has put all his victory points in one basket, it is often not an efficient use of time or resources to pursue hostilities.<br/><br/>The game progresses through events called solar instabilities.  Each die roll has a chance to produce one or more of these events.  As more and more of these events occur, the player's home base, Stardock, slowly moves further and further away from the unstable star.  When the Stardock reaches the last planet in the system, it prepares to leave and does so immediately before the star explodes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the star goes supernova (harming any players still left in the solar system) or every player safely leaves before that point.  The winner is the player who has accumulated the most victory points through collecting money, crew, modifications, and research samples.<br/><br/>",

Neptune rises on the iceberg riddled coast. Someone put your loot on that ship, and the time to retaliate is running thin!<br/><br/>Overview: Plundering Pluto is a dexterity, dice and deduction game pitting two seafaring K9 pirates against one another. The first player to destroy the three sectors of their opponents ship with their p.a.w.s. canon fire is the winner.<br/><br/>The game has three levels of play for various types of gamers. The introductory dexterity game simply builds the strength of ships by rolling the die, then taking turns firing cannon cards to subtract their values.<br/><br/>The next levels of gameplay introduce ship customization with weapons and icebergs. Finally, a bluffing, deduction card game may be used to add a strategic twist. The choice method to plunder Pluto is yours!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stabling Rivalry is an exciting, card-driven, streamlined simulation of thoroughbred racing. You and an opponent represent friendly, rival stable owners, who train and race horses for fun and profit. On this racing day you both have a lot of horses at the track, and you&rsquo;re focusing on bragging rights. Which one of you is the better judge of horseflesh&mdash;and which stable will win the most races and side bets? Playable in 30 minutes to an hour, Stabling Rivalry will provide the thundering excitement of the sport of kings&mdash;and the ultimate answer!<br/><br/>From his stable of horses, each player selects one for each race. During play, a player draws a card from a small display of action cards and then plays one from his hand. If it matches the color required on his horse&rsquo;s card for the current furlong, its normal value is used. (If not, it is played &quot;penalty-side&quot; up-- with a lesser value.)<br/><br/>The cards played each furlong are totaled throughout the race. If tied at the start of a furlong, initial post position breaks it. Class markers allow a player to re-draw a card-- to help himself or to hinder his opponent. Additionally, players can &quot;jockey for position&quot; and sometimes &quot;dump&quot; the face-up cards of the display; the leader and other player have separate criteria for this.<br/><br/>After both players have played a card for the current furlong, the top card of a special deck representing the other horses in the race is turned face-up. Some of these cards have various effects in addition to their numerical value, while others have two possible values and one of the players will have to choose which to play.<br/><br/>After all furlongs have been played in a race, the horse with the most total value wins. Class markers and then post position breaks ties between players. The number of races won plus betting chips won are totaled to determine the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Full sail ahead!<br/>The importance of the sea was considerable in 19th century Brittany, form the Royal and Merchant Navies to the fishing fleets. The ports are as diverse as they are numerous, from the Orient to Ponant, Lorient, a port of the Royal India Company, Nantes with its international trade, Saint Malo the port-town of buccaneers, Paimpol with its Terre-Neuve breed of life-saving dogs and last but not least that high-point of fishing and maritime history, Douarnenez. At a time when the wind, the currents and the tides were master, commercial shipping and fishing was assured by 'bisquines', 'chasse-marees', 'lougres', 'goemoniers' laden with sea-weed and other ships.<br/><br/>Hatoup will take you on a series of original regattas with simple rules to follow, allowing you to discover the maritime feeling of the Breton ports.<br/><br/>Overview of the game:<br/><br/>Two teams of two players each compete to be the first to deliver the 4 trade goods (gold, wine, linen and timber) to the right port. There are 5 major ports: Douarnenez, Nantes, Saint-Malo, Lorient and Paimpol. Each player is native to one of the ports and their mission is to deliver all 4 commodities to the port that buys them. Each port accepts only one type of goods (for instance Nantes is the port for wine). But you cannot deliver to your own port, but to the free port of Paimpol instead (thus the Nantes player must take the wine to Paimpol). The movement of each ship is driven by the play of one card from your hand each round. There are 52 movement cards in four suits (sextant, telescope, knife and cosh) numbered 1 to 10 plus M, I, K (this is a customised poker-like deck). After playing a card you follow the instructions of how to move your ship. The goal is to deliver your cargo and bring your ship back to port. The winner is the team who docks all eight ships first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shuffle the 36 knight cards and deal all the deck to all the players. Each player keeps these cards as a face down pile in front of him. At the same time, they reveal the first card of their deck. The one that revealed the highest card takes all of the cards and place them under his deck. If there are ties for the highest card, tied players play a second card face down, then a third card face up to see who wins all the cards in play. If an other tie occurs, you repeat (one face down, then one face up).<br/><br/>If a player loses all of his cards, he is out of the game. The winner is the one that won all the 36 cards.<br/><br/>The drawings and the lenght of the weapons help the children players to understand the cards value : The longest blade wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set of rules with scenario instructions and background material to create a story set in London during WW2. Players take on the role of characters involved in a net of wartime espionage, and attempt to fulfill specific goals assigned  to their characters by the scenario.<br/><br/>Based on the premises of the situation, players discuss possible ways to advanced the story. Next, players use the Matrix system created by Chris Engle to establish how likely certain proposed developments in the plot are to occur, and roll dice to determine how the story will progress. Discussion after discussion and roll after roll, an overall narration emerges.<br/><br/>Specific victory conditions exist based on the mission that is being played, but as in many storytelling games what matters the most is to work as a team towards the creation of a rich and satisfying narrative.<br/><br/>",

An advertisement for the game was later published in the &quot;West Australian&quot; newspaper (Perth) on Wed 6. Oct. 1909, p.6 col. 7:<br/><br/>&quot;This, it seems, is an adaptation to the Commonwealth of a map game, said to have been exceedingly popular in the different countries to which it has seen made applicable. The Australian map is marked of into 136 squares, and with the aid of dice which determine each stage and counters for each of two, three, or four players, a journey is performed throughout Australia, beginning at Brisbane and terminable only at Sydney. In the shape of contrary winds, a wreck, deserts, bush, and other obstacles to easy journeyings, the way of the traveller is made difficult, and at the same time exciting, and by an ingenious contrivance in the rules the question whether he will ever reach Sydney is attended with considerable doubt, which enhances the interest of the game. Both for young and old it should prove thoroughly diverting, and it has the added advantage of possessing considerable educational value. Wigg and Son are selling it at a price intended to bring it within the reach of everyone&quot;.<br/><br/>",

There are 7 concentric rings (wire rings in their hollows), one for each celestial body. The rings are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Each ring has a colored bead for the celestial body itself and red (favorable effect) and black (unfavorable effects).<br/><br/>Each player has an individual board with 2 concentric circles. They show also the 12 star sign sectors, written at the edge of the big circle. In the inner circle the sectors are numbered with 1 to 12. This numbers are called houses, which represent astrological aspects like personality, &quot;possession and wealth&quot;, &quot;adventure, erotic&quot;.<br/>The inner circle has 5 concentric rings where special marker placed at the beginning on each field of the middle ring one.<br/><br/>At the begin of the game the inner circle is positioned by random (special dice rolling) and stays then till the end of the game.<br/>Also the position of the rings on the central board are random turned at the beginning as described in the rules.<br/><br/>The player chooses a house (number) with as much red and colored beads in the equivalent sector.<br/><br/>Dependent on the number each player has another star sector.<br/>Each round the sun ring is rotated by 1 (Counter clock) and for the other circles 2 dice are rolled. 1 dice shows which circle is rotated and the second die shows how much.<br/><br/>How many dice rolls are possible for the actual player is calculated out of the sum of red plus colored pearls minus black pearls in his star sign sector.<br/><br/>The player is allowed to roll the dice less than allowed.<br/>The players look at the Pearl of the actual moved circle in the sector relevant for them. If the pearl is red or colored he moves the marker on his board 1 ring to the edge otherwise (black) 1 ring to the center.<br/><br/>Game Ends after a preset sun moves (e.g. 1,5 rounds). The player who has most of his marks on the outer ring wins the game.<br/>The rules allow to read the astrological result for each player.<br/><br/>",

Roll a die (5 and 6 hit). The opponent is allowed to shoot also with all of his figures which are in range, also with the hit one.<br/>After this all hit figures are removed.<br/>Then the Opponent has his turn with move and shoot and the first player may shoot back.<br/>After each double turn it is checked if a player has conquered a capital City. If this is the case all opponent figures are removed from this country.<br/>After 8 double turns there is a value of points calculated from the number of his cities. With this points new stones can be bought dependent on the &quot;Value of points&quot; of the different types. These can be placed on own cities.<br/>The same calculation is done at the end of the game. The winner is the player with the higher number.<br/>The game ends after a predefined number of rounds or if one player has lost all his figures.<br/><br/>",

Highly advanced satellites that the inhabitants think of as gods - &ldquo;Lorestars&rdquo; - orbit this world, periodically irradiating the surface in an endless cycle of long-abandoned experiments.  The native lifeforms and human settlers live a primitive state of violence because of the volatile effects that the satellites have had on their genetics over the centuries.  When specific satellites are in certain parts of their orbits, the bursts of radiation even cause some inhabitants to change into alien monsters.<br/><br/>In this part of the Lorestar story, you play as one of five unique characters that turn into savage creatures when their satellite god passes through the right constellation.  Vying for survival in the wild outskirts of small towns, some of these characters, like the planet they live on, are confused wanderers, while others take advantage of their abilites to ruthlessly hold power over weaker people.<br/><br/>Control the position of the Lorestar icons by outsmarting your opponents in a simultaneous card draw that spins the central game board.  Once your character has turned into a monster by aligning the Lorestars in the inner board to the constellations on the outer board, play attack cards and use your monster abilities to continue to foil your opponents and dwindle their health until you're the last monster standing.<br/><br/>Survive this battle and unlock the next chapter of Lorestar!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Despotic is a fantasy themed 2 player spatial-tactical strategy board and card game. In Despotic, players assume the role of gladiator-like parties sent to battle one another for the Emperor's pleasure.<br/><br/>Unlike the abstract game of Chess, Despotic plays fast, adds some luck, probability management, decision limitation, and equalization(handicapping of Chess-Masters). In Despotic, the goal is to destroy your opponent's &quot;King&quot; or to run your opponent out of their 20 Power cards.  Losing a Unit requires the removal of Power Cards equal to the Unit's Value.  Also, Players remaining in Check must remove 2 Power Cards from their deck.<br/><br/>Initial set-up is like standard Chess, however each Player has 2 decks of cards (20 Movement Cards and 20 Power Cards).  Each Player starts with 3 Movement Cards.  During a turn, the player can (a) Play 1 card from their hand and resolve its effect, (b) Discard any number of cards from their hand and draw back up to 3 cards (Power and/or Movement Cards), -OR- (c) May remove any number of Dead Cards in their hand from the game, and then may draw and play 1 Power Card for each Dead Card removed.  At the end of a turn, the Player draws back up to their hand limit size of 3 cards (from either Power and/or Movement Cards).<br/><br/>Movement Cards allow a corresponding Unit to move as indicated (standard Chess patterns).  Power Cards allow non-traditional movement and/or create special effects/abilities in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chevalier: Medieval Battles is a wargame for two players which simulates the battles of Europe&rsquo;s Middle Ages. Players take on the roll of a Medieval general, building their army, maneuvering them on the battlefield, and issuing special orders. The game uses unit cards to represent units in the players&rsquo; armies which are arranged on a unique play mat to represent the flanks, front line, and reserves of the army.<br/><br/>Players construct their armies by selecting up to eight unit cards representing fifteen different types of Medieval units. Each unit has a listed maximum army limit, type, equipment, and combat stats for their differing &ldquo;status levels.&rdquo; Players also select a hand of eight &ldquo;orders cards&rdquo; which can be issued to units during gameplay to move them to a new location on the player&rsquo;s play mat or gain one-time buffs.<br/><br/>After players alternate deploying their armies on their play mats, combat occurs in a series of turns divided into an Orders phase (when orders cards are played and resolved) and Combat phase (when combat is resolved).<br/><br/>During the Orders phase, players simultaneously play any orders cards they wish to use face-down on the unit receiving the orders. Progressing in a set pattern determined by the play mat, these orders are then sequentially revealed and resolved.<br/><br/>Combat between units on the board is resolved following the same sequential pattern as resolving orders cards. To resolve combat, players add up the relevant combat skill for the current unit and any situational modifiers (such as the type of unit opposing a unit, whether the unit is charging that turn, or any orders cards affecting the unit) to determine how many dice to roll. Each die rolled which meets or exceeds the target unit&rsquo;s current &ldquo;defense&rdquo; value for its current status level scores one &ldquo;hit&rdquo; and permanently reduces that unit&rsquo;s status by one level. As each unit&rsquo;s equipment listed on its card gives certain bonuses against certain unit types, often while imparting a penalty against other unit types, players can gain an advantage by careful use of their deployment and orders to pit their units against their optimal opponents. Units decrease in effectiveness as they take hits, becoming weaker in both offense and defense. Each unit has three status levels ranging from undamaged to heavily damaged. Any unit reduced by hits beyond its third status level is removed from the game.<br/><br/>The winning player is the one with the last unit remaining on the board.<br/><br/>",

In autumn, when the cold winds force the noble heroes home, they return to the king's court and tell of the mighty deeds they have done...sometimes embellishing their stories a bit.<br/><br/>Epic Tales is a card game in which players put together a hand of cards composed of monsters, items, and treasures, and then boast about the mighty deeds they have accomplished. The goal of the game is to gain the most fame by defeating the most monsters, visiting the most exotic locations, and finding the greatest treasures in the land.<br/><br/>The King's Humblest Servant--the player who boasts the least fame--gets to hear each other hero's tale and decides whether to force them to prove their story or to accept it as they say.<br/><br/>If you are forced to prove your story then you must show how you used your items, companions, and skills to defeat the monsters you boasted of defeating. If you were telling the truth then you win even more fame; if you were lying then you lose fame for each monster you were unable to defeat.<br/><br/>Whoever has earned the most fame after 3 years wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trivia Party: Sports is a card game that combines a traditional deck of cards with sports trivia.  There are four different ways to play:<br/><br/>In Trivia Party, one player draws a card and asks a question of another player.  The answering player may choose from questions ranked from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest) and gains points equal to the difficulty level on a correct answer.  Incorrect answers gain no points.  After one question, the next player takes a turn.  Players play until the deck is used up or to an agreed total.<br/><br/>Upward Mobility is played similarly, but each player starts off being asked question one and proceeds through the questions to number five, earning the point value for each question answered correctly until he or she answers wrong.  So, for example, if a player answers questions 1,2 and 3 correctly but misses #4, the score would be 6 points.  Like Trivia Party, play continues until the deck is used up or until one player reaches an agreed point total.<br/><br/>In Auction Trivia, each player starts with 25 points.  One player chooses a card and reads the 5-point question.  Players then bid on the card.  The highest bidder then wins the card and tries to answer all five questions on the card, gaining points for each question answered equal to the point value of the questions (for a maximum of 15 points per card).  These points are added to his starting point balance.  The winninbg player then becomes the next auctioneer.  Players are eliminated if their balance drops to zero.  The player with the most points when all cards are used up wins.<br/><br/>In Trivia Poker, score is kept in the same way as Trivia Party.  However, when a player answers a question correctly, he or she keeps the card.  Players try to gain cards to build the best poker hand possible.  When a player gains a sixth card, he or she must discard any chosen card, keeping five cards.  The game ends when all cards are used or when all players hold five-card poker hands.  There are two winners: the player with the most points and the player with the best poker hand.<br/><br/>",

Each grid section has numbers (1-10) across the top and letters (A-L; J and K are missing) down the side.<br/><br/>After deciding who goes first, the first player calls a shot on his opponent&rsquo;s ocean grid, say E7. His opponent must declare a hit if the grid square is occupied by a ship or a miss if it is not. The player that fired marks the grid number on his target control area with a Red bomb if it is a hit or a White bomb if it is a miss. Then the second player takes his turn, with either a hit or a miss being declared by the first player and the results recorded by the second player. Turns are taken until all the ships in one players fleet have been sunk. The five ships have a total of 21 hits. Each player keeps track of the number of hits he has made and declares himself the winner if his target control area has 21 Red bombs.<br/><br/>This game is very similar to Battleship, but based on the art and packaging was most likely published before Battleship, between the late 1950's and the mid-1960's.<br/><br/>",

It's time to shred this slope like no other!<br/><br/>In Avalanche, each player assumes the role of an adrenaline crazed snowboarder, and participates in an event where riders deliberately race an avalanche (and each other) down the mountain. It is of course important to stay in front of the snow, and to try and finish the event first, but what really matters to these shredders is bragging rights. In the end, whoever has the most to brag about wins!<br/><br/>Each round, players will simultaneously choose up to three action cards to bet, and place them face down on the table. Once everyone has decided which moves they want to try and pull off, they reveal their cards, and each player rolls in turn order for the resources they need to successfully complete their actions. Some actions are easier to pull off than others, but will usually grant you either fewer bragging rights, less combo, or less movement.<br/><br/>After each player has completed their rolling phase, the avalanche is advanced, and anyone who is caught by it must subsequently roll for an immediate rescue. Once they've managed to successfully latch onto a helicopter, they lift out, land one space in front of the avalanche, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By the beginning of October, 2014, the first set piece battle in the war with the radical ISIS terrorists occurred at Kobani, Syria, along the Syrian‐Turkish border. ISIS intended to secure this border town to make it easier for their volunteers to enter Syria from Turkey. But, like many battles, it was a battle that need not to have occurred. ISIS volunteers had entered from Turkey from many crossing points but the one difference was its close proximity to the ISIS capital of Raqqa. It was that reason that ISIS decided to fight a more conventional battle this time. It seemed like a sure win as up to 4000 ISIS soldiers gradually descended upon the Kobani area along with some 25‐30 AFVs from captured Iraqi booty when Iraq allowed the city of Mosul to fall. These AFV's, American M1 and T‐72M were still formidable weapons even in inexperienced hands and add to this numerous artillery guns from war booty, and ISIS was almost assured a victory. But like at Stalingrad in WW2, where the Russians refused to be defeated, the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) felt the same. Kobani had been in Kurdish hands and as ISIS swept many Kurdish towns into their hands and slaughtered them, the Kurds decided to make a stand.<br/><br/>A map hex is 550 yards across. Each unit represents a 100 men and each turn represents one week. The game lasts from Oct 1 to Jan 15. Leaders represent a single person, while AFVs represent 5 five tanks. Artillery units represent one battery of 4-6 guns.<br/><br/>",

Use word families to build reading, spelling, and comprehension skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Word Shark is an educational board game where players compete to use tiles to build or complete words.  It comes with two-sided mats, offering two ways to play.<br/><br/>Side one, the Shark Mat, has five different incomplete words, each with the first letter missing.  The letter tiles with consonants are placed in a pile face down.  Each player in turn chooses a tile and tries to complete one of the words on his or her mat with the letter.  If a word cannot be completed, the tile is returned to the pile face down.  The first player to complete all five words wins.<br/><br/>Side two, the Ocean Mat, challenges players to make as many words as possible on their mats.  Each player starts by drawing an agreed number of starting red consonant tiles and yellow vowel tiles.  Players then work simultaneously to create as many words as possible on their mats.  Players may continue to draw or trade tiles from the center pile to continue making words.  (The rules do no specify how many tiles can be taken at a time).  Players can decide whether to make words individually or in crossword fashion.  The winner can be either the player who made the most words or the player who used the most tiles.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns randomly choosing an apple marker from the box.  Each marker shows a number of apple seeds.  The player must correctly count the seeds and then, if it matches a number on their card, place it over the number.  The marker is then flipped.  If the player counted correctly and the number matches, the marker stays on the card.  If the number does not match one on the player's card or the player counts wrong, the marker goes back in the box.  If the player draws an apple with a worm, he or she must put an apple from his tree back on the box.  An apple core causes loss of a turn.

In I Remember, a spinner is added and tiles are assigned to one of four categories (food, animals, toys or transportation).  The game can be played at three levels.  Level one is played with only one category of tiles, reducing the number to make matching easier. Game play is identical to Memory--players turn over two tiles trying to find a match.  If the tiles match, the player keeps them.  If not, they are replaced in the same positions and the next player plays.  When all tiles have been claimed, the player with the most tiles wins.<br/><br/>In level two, players spin the spinner to determine which of four categories they must match.  The current player then turns over a single tile.  If it matches the category spun, the player keeps the tile.  If not, it is replaced in its original position.  The next player then attempts to match the same category.  Once a match is made, the next player spins to determine the new category and play continues.  When all tiles have been claimed, the player with the most tiles wins.<br/><br/>Level three is played in a similar way to level two, except after spinning players must find two tiles with matching pictures in the category spun.<br/><br/>",

The rules note that it &quot;should only be used by a trained professional.&quot;<br/><br/>In the game, players roll a die to move pawns on a track.  As they move, they land on various types of spaces.  On Feeling Card spaces, the player must draw a card with a feeling printed on it and describe a time when he or she experienced that feeling.  On a Do A Stunt space, the player draws a card and performs the action printed on it.  On a Mail space, a card with the start of the first sentence of a letter written to a friend or family member is drawn.  The player must complete the sentence.  On a Family Happenings space, the player draws a card with a question that refers to a family problem that the child may have experienced (cards are marked with categories so the therapist can customize the deck to his clients).  The player must answer the question.  Roll 'n Go squares occur at junctions in the path and allow the player to roll again and move in a direction determined by their roll.  Sent To Your Room squared require the player to go to their &quot;room,&quot; a space marked with their pawn's color.  They must then answer the question in their room before rolling to leave the room on their next turn.  On a Spin space, the player spins a spinner and may gain or lose a turn or gain or lose chips depending on the roll.  At the end of each player's turn, he or she receives one chip as allowance.<br/><br/>Players attempt to reach the end of the track, which if the peak of the roof on the house-shaped track.  The game may end in one of two ways.  The first player to reach the peak of the house can be declared the winner, or a time limit can be imposed, with the player holding the most chips when time runs out winning.  In this version, reaching the finish space brings a bonus of five chips, after which the player may continue to move on the track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In What Do You See? Colors, players choose face-down cards, trying to be the first to complete a set and win the game. There are three different ways to play.<br/><br/><br/>     Search and Match Colors - Each player takes a card marked with a colored star designating which color he or she will collect. Picture cards are placed face-up in the center of the table. Each player in turn takes a card to match their color. If the color matches, the player keeps the card. If not, he or she must put it back. Play continues until all players have six matched color cards. This game is for very young players, and is meant to teach color recognition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Seven That Match - This game is played similarly to Search and Match Colors. In this version, each player has two color cards to match. Cards are placed face down. Players pick one card at a time and try to match it to one of their cards. If it matches, the player keeps the card. If not, it goes back to the center face down. The first player to collect six cards matching the color of one of his or her star cards wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     What Color Do You See? - In this version, each player has a game board with spaces for eight different colors. All cards are placed face-down on the table. Players take turns choosing a face-down card. If the player doesn't yet have the color, he or she covers the corresponding space on his or her card. If he or she does have the color, the card goes back face down. In this version, there are also wild cards, which can be placed on any color. The first player to cover all colors on the card wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

A player who occupies 2 or more spaces wins the game. A player may roll his dice at any time and use them as a tile of the number of depicted pips. Players are free to choose whether to use their dice.<br/><br/>To place a tile on top of an already placed tile, the new tile must bear a higher number. Additionally, even numbers must be placed on top of even numbers and odd numbers on top of odd numbers. The fact that 2 or more tiles that add up to the higher number may also be placed is a key feature of the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>お互いに1～6の数字がプリントされた６個の駒を３カ所のボード上のスペースに重ねて置いて行き、2つ以上のスペースを占拠した方が勝つ陣取りゲームです。<br/>任意のタイミングでダイスを振って、出た目の数字駒として使うことができます。ダイスを使う使わないは任意です。<br/>既に置かれた駒の上に駒を重ねて置く場合は、重ねる駒の数字より大きく、奇数の上には奇数を、偶数の上には偶数を置かなくてはなりません。<br/>ただし２個以上の駒の合計数でも置けるのがミソです。<br/><br/>",

The multicolored gameboard shows these pathways  with each metabolic intermediate identified by name, structural formula and number of carbon atoms. The names of the enzymes are printed on arrows that symbolize the chemical reactions of the pathways.<br/><br/>The players move tokens representing carbon atoms along the pathways. A molecule of a carbon compound is symbolized by a stack of the proper number of tokens. Thus glucose would have six tokens, and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, three.<br/> A deck of 70 &ldquo;enzyme cards&rdquo; is used to regulate the play. Each card shows a reaction present on the board with the name of the enzyme. To move a molecule from one step in a pathway to the next, a player must have in hand the appropriate enzyme card. There are three enzyme cards in the deck for each reaction on the board as well as four &ldquo;wild enzyme&rdquo; cards which may be used to catalyze any reaction. The game makes use of ATP  &ldquo;currency&rdquo; of three denominations: one, three and ten ATP units. The ATP is gained or lost by a player depending on the reactions being  carried out as the game proceeds. The object of the game is to gain more ATP than the other players. Oxidative phosphorylation is simulated by the use of tokens representing NADH and FADH, and special cards representing oxygen. Oxygen debt is simulated  whenever a player  with reducing power lacks oxygen cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme and goal<br/>In Miner the players steps in the role of hardworking Miners. The Miners are searching for resources like gold and iron on a 3D Game Board. To be more efficient they have to upgrade their shovels and pickaxes and can buy additional ropes. With negotiation skills they have to sell the mined resources on the market. <br/>The player which earns the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The special thing about Miner is its unique 3D sandbox in the middle of the game board. The sandbox includes 180 massive resource blocks. Hidden under soil there are stone, coal, iron and gold, that want to be discovered. The player steps in the role of a miner. With negotiating skill they try to sell the mined resources on the market for a good price. <br/> Each round a player has 10 hours to perform actions. Every action costs time, which is displayed on the player&rsquo;s game tableau. When there is no time left the player can knock off work and the next player begins his turn. <br/> What actions a player can choose?<br/>The key element of the game is the 3D sandbox. Inside of it every player has a game character. In the sandbox the player can move, climb or mine resources. In the beginning of the game all players are standing on soil, but the deeper they dig, the more exciting it will be.<br/><br/>But that's easier said than done. Every player starts with only one rope. So if you want to dig deeper you should better buy some additional ropes in the town. With the mined resources you can go to the market. But be careful, the prices shown by the resource dice are changing every round. When you don&rsquo;t want to sell the mined resources you have to store them in a warehouse. Every player owns a warehouse on his private deck. There are also 4 warehouses in the town available which can be rented.<br/><br/>If you want to rank among the best, you soon have to go to the forge and buy better tools. Of course some coins have to be reinvested but with better pickaxe your mining will be much more efficient.<br/><br/>If there is some time left, you can work for the day laborer to earn some coins or you can visit the tavern. In the tavern you can get some benefit cards which can really make the difference.<br/><br/>With all these actions you can plan your turn. If there is no time left you have to wait for the next round. Plan your turns clever and you will have the right resources at the right time. The player who owns the most coins after 14 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War of Cakes is a competitive game where you will face other players in a pastry aggressive competition. During the game you have to build pies with ingredients and recipes that you get during the game, but beware! the other participants can ruin your creations. Nata, dynamite, chocolate or barbed wire are just some of the ingredients that we use to achieve first place in the contest.<br/><br/>War of Cakes it is a turn-based game. It is a card game consisting of a deck of ingredients and other recipes. On each turn the player may draw cards and put recipes you want to build. Each player has their own cakes, but the recipes can be placed on any cake. First put the recipe and then you are adding ingredients, turn by turn. Every player is required to use an ingredient in their turn (whenever possible). An ingredient can be used on their own or others recipes.<br/><br/>In short, to put a piece of cake in a cake we need to take several steps:<br/><br/>1) Put the recipe under construction.<br/>2) Adding the necessary ingredients<br/>3) Put the cake recipe.<br/><br/>They are not used dice or the like. The strategy is that players are required to use at least one ingredient per shift. And if not well managed, it can finish putting on good ingredients good recipes from other players.<br/><br/>This makes it a semi-cooperative game. There are also recipes for cakes remaining points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dice Of Debt is a &quot;serious game&quot; designed to help software development teams deal with the common problem of technical debt. If you're not familiar with the concept, technical debt is the drag on productivity that sloppy coding and testing create. Teams sometimes have to take shortcuts, but they pay the price, in the long term. Here's where to get it: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.game-change-llc.com/diceofdebt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.game-change-llc.com/diceofdebt/</a><br/><br/>Teams often have a hard time justifying to their management, or to themselves, the investment needed to reduce technical debt. Fixing the existing code, or implementing practices that improve the quality of future code, have a cost. Under time pressures, and with an unclear picture of how much of a drag on productivity technical debt really is, teams are hesitant to make a hard choice, even if it increases the amount of software value that the team will eventually deliver.<br/><br/>The game simulates the work of an Agile software team over the course of 10 sprints. (If you're not familiar with Agile, or sprints, just suffice it to say that we're talking about the work that a team can get done in a series of 10 2-week intervals.) The 12 dice used in the game represent the team's capacity, which is split between coding new features and dealing with the burden of technical debt. You roll one set of dice to represent the value of the new features, then subtract the total from the roll of another set of dice to represent the burden of technical debt.<br/><br/>The players (working cooperatively, since they're the team) can decide to implement measures that will reduce technical debt. Either the pool of technical debt dice will get smaller, or you will subtract from the final result of rolling these dice. You have to set aside some time and effort to implement these technical debt-reducing measures, so your capacity for coding new features will drop temporarily.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to produce the largest amount of new software value (features) by the end of the game (again, 10 turns, representing &quot;sprints&quot;). There's no specific &quot;win&quot; condition, other than to see how much better you can do, in the end, than if you had taken no action to reduce technical debt.<br/><br/>The real victory the players can achieve is a good conversation about what they might do, in their own work on software teams, to reduce technical debt. Now that they've seen the long-term productivity gain they can achieve from a short-term productivity loss, it will become easier to justify the difficult choices.<br/><br/>The game is not designed to provide an extremely accurate simulation of the benefits that each technical debt-reducing measure might provide. However, it does simulate other aspects of decision-making about technical debt. For example, the players can see how important it is to invest earlier rather than later in reducing technical debt. In these ways, the game also provides simulation value.<br/><br/>Dice Of Debt is going to be part of a package of materials that the Agile Alliance is producing to help people combat technical debt. We will post more specifics when we have them. The current plan is to publish this package by the end of 2015.<br/><br/>",

Players roll a die to move on a track, landing on various letters along the way.  When they land on a letter, they must use three (or four or five, depending on the level chosen) positive words describing the player to their left or right in sentences, within 30 seconds.  If they are able to do so, they earn an amount of money that corresponds to the difficulty of the letter (for example Y and U earn $1000, A and S earn $300).  One player is The Negotiator, a sort of gamemaster.  Players who are unable to think of enough words can buy a word from the negotiator (who has a book of suggested words) for half the value of the letter space.  The Negotiator also controls the money and the timer.<br/><br/>Players may not repeat words that have already been used.  Other players may challenge a word used by a player as being incorrect or not positive.  If the challenge is successful, the challenger gets double the value of the letter.  If the challenge fails, the original player gets double value.  The rules specify that a dictionary should be consulted by the Negotiator.  There are also &quot;self-esteem&quot; space where players draw a card which describes an effect of high or low self-esteem.  These cards either give extra money to the player or cause a penalty to be paid.  If a player must pay a penalty and has too little money, he or she must get a loan from The Negotiator, which must be paid back plus 10% interest.<br/><br/>Game play continues for 30 minutes.  At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins, and is awarded a Certificate of Merit.<br/><br/>",

Chips showing all the multiplication products of the numbers on the grid are included.  Each player takes an equal number of chips from a face-down pile and places them standing on edge, so they are visible to the owning player and hidden from other players.  Leftover chips are placed on the correct squares of the board.<br/><br/>In turn, each player spins a spinner, looks at his or her chips, and places any chips corresponding to the number spun onto the grid.  If the chip is placed incorrectly (i.e. not the product of the numbers in the row and column) the player must take the chip back and lose a turn.  If the spinning player does not have the number spun, he passes to the player on his left, who may then play that number if possible.  If not, play continues to pass to the left until a player can play the number.  If no one has the chip, the first player to spin spins again until someone can play a number.<br/><br/>The first player to play all his or her tiles wins.<br/><br/>",

There are 3 rounds of drafting where the cards get more valuable, but more expensive and your gold is dwindling.  Fortunately each card you add to your castle has 3 attributes, Victory Points for winning, Defense to protect against other players attacks and Favor.  Favor is added to your Victory Points at the end of the game, but in between rounds it can be traded in for more gold so you can afford the more expensive cards, but then gold is not worth any Victory Points.  There are other ways to gain gold such as sending your knights on adventures or buying Vaults for the Nobles to store their wealth in.<br/><br/>Speaking of Nobles and Knights these can be added to your castle through adding specific cards and score addition points at the end of the game.  The real prize is when you add the right rooms to gain the King or Queen!<br/><br/>However, your opponents will be attempting to ruin your prospects of success.  They can pay to discard cards you need, throw waste into your castle preventing people from inhabiting it or just outright attacking you to steal Victory Points.<br/><br/>It is up to you to manage your gold, Nobles, Knights and Servants to build the most impressive castle and win the game!<br/><br/>",

Draw cards appropriate to the number of players, and choose one to play and discard the rest. In a 2 player game, draw three cards. In a 3 player game draw two cards. In a 4 or 5 player game draw two, but players also have the option of playing the top card of the discard pile instead of drawing.<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/><br/>When playing a card, you must do that action stated on the card, but only if can: i.e. if a card requires you to sacrifice a Patrician and you don't have one, you may ignore the effect. In a 4 or 5 player game, do not mix sacrificed cards with the discard pile. A sacrificed personality is removed from the game.<br/><br/>Each player draws and plays in a clockwise fashion until there are no cards left to draw and the game is over. If there is only one card left the last player must play this card as their final card. Then each player tabulates their total.<br/><br/>Determining a Winner<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the very end of the game wins.

Friends become enemies and enemies become bigger enemies as you race along your own individual tracks from the starting space to the finish line.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s how it breaks down:<br/><br/>1. Roll the die and move forward that number of spaces<br/>2. Decision time!  You could:<br/>     a. Move yourself forward a few more spaces.<br/>     b. Move another player back a few spaces.<br/>     c. Place an obstacle on an opponent&rsquo;s track<br/>     d. Place a benefit on your own track<br/>     e. Draw one of 60 mildly zany chance cards and let fate be the boss of you.<br/>3. After each round of turns, there&rsquo;s a non-secret vote to determine who should move back several spaces.  Now&rsquo;s your chance to convince the others to gang up on the player who&rsquo;s winning, the player who wronged you last turn, or the player who just doesn't share your opinion about the 1973 NBA All-Star Game. <br/>4. Repeat.  Exact revenge as needed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game consists of a cardboard folder. The inner left leaf has the rules and a pocket holding eight cards with numbered horses. The inner right has a spinning wheel with 21 wedges of different size in either red or black, each with an instruction to either put money into the pot or take money out. The rules say tokens like matches or nuts can be used instead of money. The numbers 1 to 8 are printed around the wheel, each with a thin black line leading to the wheel.<br/><br/>One player starts in charge of the wheel. Players choose their horses in turn, starting from the left of that player. For each race, the player in charge of the wheel closes the folder, turns a thick cardboard disk on the back of the folder that is attached to the wheel inside, and then puts the folder back on the table and opens it. Each player looks at where his number lies on the wheel and follows the instructions for that wedge. Because of the layout of the wheel, the result for each horse will be different. If a horse's number is directly on a line, that player does nothing.<br/><br/>The wheel-spinning duty rotates around the table. The rules suggest that the spinning player's horse is out of each race. After the agreed number of races have been run, whatever remains in the spot is split equally, and the player with the most tokens wins. If the pot ever runs out of tokens, the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

Players roll dice and make important decisions, developing their powers of Reason, Ethics, Wisdom, Virtue and sense of Well Being while gaining various Insights along the way. The player who becomes more fully enlightened (gains the most Insight Points) will ultimately triumph &ndash; and win the game!<br/><br/>Generally, players will randomly select and roll three dice and use two of them to move their playing pieces up five colored columns -- sometimes taking scoring markers (IPs) -- until they reach one of the top spaces of each column. Some markers allow special modifications to a die roll. The game ends when one player has climbed all five &quot;stairways&quot; and thus has maximized all five powers as noted above.<br/><br/>Playable in 30 minutes, Aristotle&rsquo;s Stairway is a cerebral, two-player filler with dice-rolling, tough decisions &ndash; and, with several catch-up mechanisms &ndash; usually results in a hotly contested, down-to-the-wire game!<br/><br/>",

Contains: 1 Rat Fink magnetic board, 2 Thwacks for tossing the marbles and 12 flat magnetic marbles called Thwarbles. Instructions for assorted target games are included.<br/><br/>Tourni Thwarbles - Toss the thwarbles. The object of the game is to collect the most Thwarbles&trade; by touching or landing on previously tossed pieces.<br/><br/>Pick off ThWack! - Players place nine Thwarbles onto the board with one in the center and eight along the edges on small ThWack! dots. The Thwacks! on the edge can be placed in a position where they extend partially over the edge to increase difficulty. Players toss their ThWack! attempting to land it on a Thwarble. If successful, the player removes that Thwarble from the board. Play continues until all pieces have been removed. The player with the most Thwarbles at the end wins.<br/><br/>ThWack! ThWarbles - Players pitch and stick their ThWarbles to the board attempting to hit target areas.<br/><br/>RatFink Fly Swat - Players toss ThWarbles to tag ten fly images on the board. Whichever player manages to cover the most flies with his or her ThWarble wins.<br/><br/>Rotation - Players lay out four to six ThWarbles in a clock-like pattern or &quot;rack&quot; around the edges of the board. Players then call which ThWarble they will hit. If they miss, it's the other player's turn. If they hit, they call another ThWarble, continuing until they miss. Winner completes the pattern first.<br/><br/>Chip Shot - One player begins by tossing a ThWarble onto the board, which represents a golf hole. The players attempt to tag that piece in the fewest number of shots. The player who takes the fewest number of throws or &quot;strokes&quot; to hit either 9 or 18 &quot;holes&quot;, wins.<br/><br/>Thwack 'Em - Four Thwarbles are placed on the board. Players pitch a thwarble trying to cover one on the board with his own thwarble. (If so he removes both thwarbles.) Player with the most thwarbles wins.<br/><br/>ThWack! ThWarbles 2 - Players determine how many rounds they will play, how many ThWarbles each player will toss out to start each round, and the distance that each player must toss from. Players see who can toss their Thwarbles closest to the edge without them falling off. Player who lands the most thwarbles closest to the edge wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Westerplatte Peninsula, FREE CITY OF DANZIG, POLAND, 1 September 1939: In 1925 the League of Nations allowed Poland to keep only 88 soldiers in their positions on the Westerplatte peninsula. Secretly, however, the garrison was slowly expanded to 176 men and six officers. The position was separated from Danzig by the harbour channel, and only a small pier connected them to the mainland. The Polish-held part of the Westerplatte was separated from the territory of Danzig by a brick wall. Fortifications built at Westerplatte were in fact not very impressive: there were no real bunkers or underground tunnels, there were only five small concrete outposts (guardhouses) hidden in the peninsula's forest; and a large barracks prepared for defense, supported by a network of field fortifications such as trenches and barricades. Cellars of outposts were fit to fire heavy-machine guns from within them. In case of war, the defenders were expected to withstand a sustained attack for 12 hours. Beginning on September 1, 1939, German naval forces and soldiers launched World War two with their attack on the Polish Military Transit Depot (Wojskowa Skladnica Tranzytowa, WST) on the peninsula of Westerplatte. Despite estimates of their ability to hold out, the Polish garrison held on for seven days in the face of a German onslaught that included Stuka dive bomber attacks. The defense of Westerplatte served as an inspiration for the Polish Army and people in the face of the debut of the Blitzkreig amidst German Case White. Their struggle is still regarded as a symbol of resistance to the Nazi invasion that plunged the world into war.<br/><br/>This is ATS WESTERPLATTE: FIRST SHOTS OF WORLD WAR II, an amazing assault that will live proudly in the martial history of Poland forever. The battleship Schleswig-Hiolstein stood off Westerplatte to shell the defenders into submission.<br/><br/>There was just one thing the aggressors did not count on: the Poles would ... not ... submit! They stood, stoic, as the world watched in awe. And against every onslaught the Germans could hurl at them. Stukas, more Stukas, artillery... engineers. An amazing struggle on a map that has been described as a &lsquo;work of art&rsquo; and is one of the more unique pieces of wargame cartology ever to see print. Includes all the combat counters needed to play.<br/><br/>",

Once a player's opponents have accepted a nonsense word and its definition, the player moves his game pawn one space for every letter in the word.

If the player lands on a blue square he rolls again.<br/><br/>Other squares require the player to answer a question about traffic to proceed. The questions are divided into 3 age-appropriate difficulties: 6-12 years, 12-18 years and 18 years and above. There are 2 questions in each difficulty on each of the 90 playing cards. Which one is used is decided by whether the dice roll was even or uneven. On a correct answer you get to go again - a wrong answer ends your turn.<br/><br/>Finally there are squares that move you further on the board or ends your turn.<br/><br/>Each time a player crosses start he is awarded a traffic-sign. The first player to collect 4 wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts of with a private fortune, a company and a company fortune.<br/><br/>The turn order is decided by the company you start with and every time you pass start you will be able to buy more companies - and thereby get more turns each round. Passing start also adds more money to your fortune and allows you to pay out dividend from your company if you have qualified.<br/><br/>Movement is decided by rolling either one or two dice - the player decides - but if you roll 2 and get two of the same you will receive a bonus. Where you land you will have to pay rent but that will also allow you to place your company logo on the square. From then on all players that land on the square will have to pay you rent as well.<br/><br/>If you get your logo on 5 different types of squares or a lot of players land on the same squares this makes the companies on them worth more.<br/><br/>In the game you can pay to get helpers in the form of lawyers and accountants that makes it possible to buy and sell more companies and negate consequences of special squares and event cards such as tax and a visit from the Fraud Squad.<br/><br/>Before the game starts it is decided when to end the game: At a certain time, at a certain fortune, at a certain number of companies owned or so on. The game should have a length of minimum an hour though. When the game ends your fortune is tallied up and the one with the largest one wins.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;re just about to call your best friend, as you see a zombie that&rsquo;s slowly approaching you on a unicycle. You can&rsquo;t run, you can&rsquo;t hide, so what are you gonna do? You&rsquo;ve got 4 objects at hand&hellip;Manic Monster Mayhem is a card game about stopping monsters with everyday objects.<br/><br/>3-5 players<br/>~30-45 min<br/><br/>How it works:<br/><br/>Each player gets 4 different objects, with which they have to stop beasts like a T-Rex on a pogo-stick from attacking. How they get rid of that beast is up to them &ndash; defeating, bribing, seducing, scaring... everything goes. Almost.<br/><br/>But since there are no heroines or brave adventurers among them, our poor players have to face ghastly monsters with ordinary things like spoons, lemons, vacuum cleaners and ladders. So the only way to succeed is using their wit and creativity &ndash; alright, a sharp tongue might be helpful as well&hellip;<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>- Each player takes a pen and a piece of paper and writes his/her name on it<br/>- Draw 1 Monster and put it in the middle of the table<br/>- Hand out 4 item cards to each player<br/>- Select starting player<br/><br/>As soon as the game is set up and a monster has been selected, our &quot;heoroes&quot; have to tell the others how they defeat the gharstly beast. Hereby the players take turns, beginning with the starting player.<br/><br/>Once all players have told their story, they secretly vote for the best one, writing the name of that player down. Afterwards a new round begins and a new player becomes the starting player.<br/><br/>After every monster has been defeated (number of monster = number of players) and everyone has voted, the grumpiest player counts the votes and announces the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2112 and the machines being produced now run on quintessence, a fully renewable energy source held in Spirits.  In 2040, Dr. Russel VanOrman Quine discovered that Spirits contain energy that can never be destroyed.  Even when used to power heavy machinery, this energy source (quintessence) dissipates into the ether, returning to its unknown source.  All we need to do is collect it.<br/><br/>You have just been hired by B.E.E.net to collect Bound Ethereal Energy Spirits (B.E.E.S.).  Seems simple?  Just find B.E.E.S. wandering around in any haunted manor and grab them with your VanOrman Machine aka &ldquo;H.I.V.E.&rdquo; (Held Intensity Vitality Extractor).  The main issue is a H.I.V.E. needs to be exactly Arrayed to grab a Spirit by joining Tubes to match it.   Of course there may be some side effects.   So... BEE careful.<br/><br/>Holding Spirits makes a H.I.V.E. rise in Pressure and Tubes may leak.   A failed Tube can lead to the unbinding of the Spirit and the Tubes must be trashed.  The Spirit is released back into the unknown perhaps to be rebound another day.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that although Spirit collectors work together, you must all fill your quota each day or you may lose your jobs!  Alternatively, an especially good harvest may get your pictures on the wall at headquarters.<br/><br/>B.E.E.S. can be played cooperatively or competitively, and the cooperative game can be played with one player.  Your goal in the cooperative game is to collect a quota of Spirits and Quintessence, and your goal in the competitive game is to have the most Quintessence when the game ends.  To collect a Spirit and acquire its Quintessence, you must build an Array with Tube cards from your hand and pass both an Array test and a Pressure test.  When you collect a Spirit, it goes into your H.I.V.E. and affects you Pressure.  Players must manage their hand of Tubes and decide how to build their Array while balancing the board state when deciding which Spirit to target.  Gameplay is relatively simple, but the nuances in your decisions determine your level of risk vs. reward and can also greatly affect the other players.<br/><br/>",

The Queen of England, Isabella of France, is unable to claim the French throne for herself, and has claimed it for her son, Edward III. France rejects the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. The Player represents the House of Plantagenet with the ambition of attaining control of France. As the Commander of English Forces, you must control a significant number of French Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is played.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the English Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 10 French Cities and 12 French Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the French control London and Portsmouth at the end of their Turn, the French win. If the last Campaign Card was played and Player does not control 10 Cities and 12 Towns, France Wins.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: NO KING OF ENGLAND features lots of colorful game counters of various Combat Units including Nobles, Knights, Archers, Handgunners and Cannon. English Nobles will gather their Forces and move on the Map in a strategic manner along rout lines of key settlements (and Naval Lanes). Combat is resolved in a tactical manner that includes individual combat between Champion Knights and Archers. The game, also, includes an eventual appearance by Joan of Arc.<br/><br/>NO KING OF ENGLAND can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

Sadly, there are other citizens who share your desires, and they plan to take the job first. The first one to acquire the cash gets the job.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to roll dice to travel around the board, trying to collect Relic cards from the corner squares, and then sell the Relic cards at the markets.  Gameplay is based on rolling dice for movement, and drawing an Action card at most squares.

Experience the lights, sounds &amp; fun of the greatest arcade games on show and own them all! With players playing, buying &amp; repairing cabinets the action heats up fast! Look out for power cuts, free plays, breakdowns and remember to empty your cabinets of all those shiny coins!<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Arcade-opoly is a 1(solo) to 4 player game where players dash around a classic video game arcade.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to buy and setup arcade games and begin to earn quarters from them. Your opponents will have to insert coins to play your arcade games should they stop in front them. Popular games will earn you double but don&rsquo;t let your games break as &ldquo;Out Of Order&rdquo; games will earn you nothing.<br/><br/>Players move around the arcade clockwise by first throwing both a black and a white die. You may only move with either dice, choose wisely which of the dice to move with!<br/><br/>Gameplay cards collected by landing on the Gameplay spaces can help or hinder you. Some cards will offer free games, free plays or free repairs. Other cards though will trigger power cuts, force you to play an opponents game, move with only with one die or even send you back to Level 1.<br/><br/>To win the game you must be the first to collect enough coins from your arcade games coin box and reach the target money amount of 70 quarters.

        "description": "Tripoley: A standard deck playing card game played with a special layout (or board) and poker chips. It is a modern version of the game of Poch. Each hand has three phases: &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Poker&quot;, and &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;. All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen. Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the &quot;Kitty&quot;. The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board). The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play. A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot. In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the &quot;Kitty&quot;.<br/><br/>Backgammon (Acey Ducey): a classic abstract strategy game where each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board.<br/><br/>Number Chek<br/><br/>Horse Race<br/><br/>Checkers: is an abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched (&quot;checker&quot;) board. Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc. Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn. A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.<br/><br/>",

After revealing the commands, players resolve actions while spending &quot;charge&quot; to activate weapons and gadgets as they go. The right commands can foil your foe&rsquo;s assault. Will you lure them under your claws? Outflank? Surprise attack? Strategic planning, anticipating your foe, and a bit of bold improvisation are key to victory!<br/><br/>",

The starting player asks the question on the card to the player on the left. If the player answers the question correctly, they earn the full point value of the card. If the player fails to answer correctly, the asking player may score half of the point value themselves, or ask the question of the player on the first player's left. If that player answers the question correctly, they score full points. If the player fails to answer correctly, the asking player scores full points (except for true and false questions).<br/><br/>Some cards are bonus cards. The asking player reads the cards and gives the points to the player on the left. These two players then exchange places. This eliminates any possible preferred table positions. The game ends at a predetermined time or when a predetermined point value is reached. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barbie: Bring the Bling Game includes 24 glamtastic rings. Take em, Wear em, Swap em. 2 Pinktastic shades included. Pinktastic Shades reveal a secret design that can be seen when sunglasses are on.<br/><br/>The object is to get at least one ring of each of the four Barbie icons to win. To play, put all of the rings face down in the center of the play area. The first player puts the Barbie sunglasses on and spins, following the instructions on the spinner. The sunglasses are only passed to another player when indicated by the spinner. The spinner may indicate passing the sunglasses, taking the sunglasses, drawing a ring or passing a ring. Any time a player thinks she has one ring of each of the Barbie icons she can say Bling. The other players take turns looking at the rings with the sunglasses on to see if she is right. If she is correct, she wins. If she is not, she puts one ring back in the middle and play continues.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Summary:<br/><br/>Neo-Hunt 3 is a round-based, multi-phase board/card game for 2-4 players.  Each player controls a team of three &quot;varans&quot; (large, humanoid reptiles bio-engineered for combat).  Players try to kill as many &quot;troopers&quot; and opponents as possible before one team is eliminated.  Opponents include the varans of other players as well as &quot;troopers&quot; (non-player game tokens) who occupy the game board and arrive at the beginning of each turn.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>Each player selects a color and takes all the pieces for that color.  Players sit on corners of the playing surface.  The game board randomly is generated by creating a 3x3 grid from the board pieces.  Each of the nine sectors of the game board provides various terrain benefits or penalties.  During the game a total of fifty &quot;troopers&quot; will deploy into various sectors and players may move their varan units into sectors.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns.  During turn setup, each player selects and plays four action cards.  Then play proceeds in player order, with each player in sequence executing their four played action cards.  Action cards are resolved in the order of priority indicated on their face; they may distribute damage tokens.  Damaged &quot;troopers&quot; are eliminated and varans with enough accumulated damage tokens also are eliminated.  After each player has taken their phase all &quot;troopers&quot; take automatic actions of either shooting at a visible varan or, if no varans are visible to them, by moving to a new sector.  At the end of each turn new &quot;troopers&quot; deploy onto the board if any counters remain.<br/><br/>The game continues until end of turn when there are no more trooper counters on the board or one varan team has all its members killed. When game ends, the player with most points wins. If tied, the one with most surviving varans, and if still tied, tied victory.<br/><br/>User Comments:<br/><br/>The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.<br/><br/>",

Players hold &quot;Varan&quot; cards, which represent a combatant reptilian humanoid controlled by the player.  Players also draw, hold, and play &quot;Action&quot; cards that drive the game.  Varan cards are always played on the table but begin play in the &quot;Cloaked&quot; (face down) position.  Varans remain &quot;Cloaked&quot; until play dictates otherwise, when they are turned face up and thus become much more vulnerable.<br/><br/>The playing surface is divided into Sectors which join in a central &quot;Battlefield&quot; Sector.  Play involves moving Varan cards between Sectors and playing Action cards to evolve maneuvers.  The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the other players' Varan cards.  Played Action cards and defeated Varan cards go into Discard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Elephant Gift Exchange is the most fun you can have playing one of the crappiest games there is. You know those lame Christmas gift exchange games you are always plagued with at Christmas parties. We give you a super charged, fast paced version of that crappy game but in a simple 5-minute game with hilarious present cards. Presents range from unused items from your families closet to gifts you actually never want to receive. You will spend more time laughing about what present you just had then you will playing the actual game. Additionally we include one blank card so you can add your own family members and terrible gifts to your game. Pass the cards, laugh with each other, and whoever has the winner gift &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the game once all the foolish presents are opened.<br/><br/>One card in the game is labeled as the &quot;Winner&quot; and one as the &quot;Loser&quot;. Roll the die, pass your crap however the die tells you to then, when the last player opens their present by turning it face up (unwrapped) the game is over. Whomever has the &quot;Winner&quot; card is the winner. If no player has the &quot;Winner&quot; card, then the player with the &quot;Loser&quot; card is just the big loser.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fantastic educational game from the multi-award winning Chimp and Zee range of games and puzzles. Each child plays the part of a princess, who needs to collect a pair of shoes, a tiara, a ball gown, and an invitation. Once all the items are collected, the player places them in their own coach, in order to be the first to go to the ball but each player needs to watch out for the wicked queen. The first player to collect all 4 cards and get back to their castle space is the real Princess. This game is great fun for children and easy for parents to explain. This game can help children learn through play. Easy to set up you can start playing in just a few minutes and everyone has a chance to win. Only takes ten minutes to play and is even great fun when it's not your turn.<br/><br/>Who's the Princess was created to help children with colours, shapes, matching, and co-ordination along with developing the ability to play together. The game is presented in a quality cardboard carton complete with carry-handle and glitter printing. This game is for 2 - 4 players and suitable for ages 3 years and over.<br/><br/>",

During the game, players place between one to three tiles per turn to build Hallways, Rooms, and groups of linked rooms called Suites to create an overhead map of the mansion. The Workers who successfully build and complete the most Rooms in the Mansion will win the game! To score points, players place Workers on the tiles they build to claim Rooms and Suites that are Under Construction. At the end of the game, points are scored for the total number of Rooms claimed by each player... one point each for Rooms that are Under Construction, and two points each for Rooms that have been Completed (meaning that every door in the Room or Suite is connected to a hallway, or all of the rooms are bounded by solid walls.) When all of the available tiles in the game have been placed the game is over and the player with the highest number of points wins. <br/> Every game is a unique experience as no two Mansion layouts are ever the same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>&quot;Many musicians, even those of considerable experience, frequently have difficulty in sight reading music and it is often necessary for them to play a selection a number of times before they can be assured of rendering it with accuracy. This is due largely to the fact that many musicians are not sufficiently familiar with the positions of the notes of the musical scale to be able to recognize instantly a given note from its position, which is essential in sight reading. This is especially true of beginners or persons inexperienced in reading music.&quot; This game aims to teach the notes of the scale through game play. Includes board, 48 cards and 16 playing pieces, four of each color.<br/><br/>The board has the treble staff and the bass staff running continuously around the board with the musical notes of the scale on them, with the name of the note in small letters. Players have four game pieces each. The object is to move through the notes of the scales to get all four game pieces to the W-I-N-S zone. The players turn cards to determine what letter of the scale to move to. At first they may need to refer to the names of the notes, but as the game is played, they will begin to recognize the position of the notes, aiding in their sight reading ability. Players may move any of their pieces, and may have to move backward in order to get to the note indicated. The first player to get all his pieces in the W-I-N-S zone is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to kill other players' &quot;varan&quot; and to eliminate &quot;trooper&quot; units (game tokens).  Play continues until only one &quot;varan&quot; remains or until all &quot;trooper&quot; units are destroyed.  If multiple &quot;varan&quot; units remain then scores are tallied to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>The game board is randomly created by assembling it from hexagonal sector tiles.  Players are given one random &quot;varan&quot; card and one &quot;trooper&quot; card; &quot;varan&quot; units are initially deployed in a hidden state.  &quot;Trooper&quot; units are then places sequentially on the board.  Players then draw a full hand of action cards and play begins.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Play proceeds in &quot;rounds&quot; during which each player gets a turn.  Each player's &quot;varan&quot; can make an attack upon a unit it can see, either &quot;varan&quot; or &quot;trooper&quot;.  Successful attacks deal damage (which may be insufficient to remove a unit).  Destroyed units are removed and scored.  Players also draw special cards and may play them, taking whatever action is described.  After the players have moved all &quot;trooper&quot; units then move or fire at visible &quot;varan&quot; units following a basic rule.<br/><br/>User Comments:<br/><br/>The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.<br/><br/>",

All the &quot;order&quot; cards for players are combined with one gray &quot;trooper&quot; order card; this deck is shuffled to determine phase order.  &quot;Trooper&quot; cards are randomly selected to make a trooper deck; 7-17 cards may be used (this will determine approximate game length).  &quot;Sector Tiles&quot; are then shuffled and randomly distributed into a circle form to create a random playing board.  Players then receive a random &quot;varan&quot; card and eleven &quot;action&quot; cards.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Play continues until all &quot;troopers&quot; are destroyed.  If a player's &quot;varan&quot; is destroyed they can resume with new &quot;varan&quot; but will suffer a score penalty.  On each player's turn they utilize action cards and move their varan into a new sector or attack any other unit they see.  On the trooper turn standard rules apply to move or shoot; troopers will only shoot at visible varans.  The game supports a few special status conditions which may occur.<br/><br/>User Comments:<br/><br/>The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.<br/><br/>",

A 78-card deck, elegantly illustrated and faithful to the sensibility of its 15th century origins, updated with modern gameplay in mind.<br/><br/>The Tarocchi family of games is a historical set of point-trick taking games, played in a series of zero-sum hands. Most in the family include a signature fluctuating team system where one bids for the high-risk, high-reward position of the single opponent to the other players, who form a temporary team for the duration of the hand. Players may additionally bet on a series of secondary goals, to achieve bonus points along with those for the hand itself. A game is played to a variable number of rounds in which each player deals a hand.<br/><br/>Marseille Sophistiqu&eacute; includes an introductory rulebook, containing historical game rules for<br/>-Baronetti, a simple 2-player introductory rules set that focuses on the basic point-trick principles, also good for fast games and appropriate for children<br/>-Scarto, a 3-player free-for-all<br/>-French Tarot, the classic 4-player, team-based trick taking game, with variants for 3-6 players<br/>-adaptations for 5-suited Poker<br/><br/>Free digital content extends these rules to include<br/>-Droggn, a 3-4 player game with a smaller deck, more forgiving to the opponent.<br/>-Hungarian Tarokk, a 4-5 player game with an advanced bonus system<br/>-Illustrated Hungarian Tarokk, a variant for those who have mastered Hungarian Tarokk<br/>-Rules variants reflecting some of the regional iterations of games<br/><br/>",

        "description": "George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are two of the most renowned figures in American history, but who would make a better President in 2016? In 1860? In 1792? Let the voters decide! Election! is an interactive family board game with a focus on America&rsquo;s greatest leaders.<br/><br/>As a player, you have been granted the power to manage a political party that is desperate for control of the White House. In addition to selecting candidates, you may also take advantage of external factors to influence the election in your party's favor. Should you stay positive by gaining the support of a popular activist or attempt to smear an opponent's image by revealing a scandal? Do you take the high road and try to win ethically or attempt to sabotage your opponents through dirty politics? Should you throw in the towel or demand a recount? Votes are all that matters as you navigate your way to the White House.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>1) Determine the Election Year: Each round, randomly select an Election Year card that lists the most important issues of that time in American history.<br/><br/>2) Party Nominations: Each player selects 1 of the 5 Presidential Candidate cards from their hand.  Players nominate a candidate based on ratings that show the card&rsquo;s overall polling strength of the issues being discussed.<br/><br/>3) Roll Dice to Determine Votes: Custom dice are rolled based on a candidate's rating. The rating corresponds to the important issues set on the Election Year card. Higher ratings often result in more votes.<br/><br/>Bonus) Red Tape and Public Opinion cards are wild cards that have the power to impact an election (for better or worse).<br/><br/>4) The player with the most votes wins the election and advances along the game board.  The winner is the first player to advance to the White House space at the end of the board.<br/><br/>After winning a series of elections with shrewd strategy and a bit of luck, the player who first advances to the White House space on the board wins the game and earns the right to be called Mr. or Mrs. President!  Mudslinging and dirty politics guaranteed!<br/><br/>",

These will be placed on player-colored plates onto a sushi-belt (the board) to feed up hungry guests. The guests - represented by guest cards and mostly with unique special rules - take place around the sushi-belt wishing for a variety of different sushi types.<br/>On turn, players can choose from different fixed actions like buying ingredients, making sushi or cleaning dirty plates. Or they can roll a die to perform special actions (for example changing plates places on the belt) or to activate events like new guests or moving all the plates on the belt one field clockwise.<br/>The game ends instantly when the last guest leaves the restaurant and the player owning the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Winning is a combination of dice rolls and decision making. The key to success is using your economic engine to fuel growth and strategically engage in battles to weaken your opponent and strengthen your dominance on the map. Victory points are gained through killing enemy population, building a city capital, being the peace maker, acquiring special events, and conquering enemy land.

        "description": "From the box:<br/>&quot;Learn about the exciting, mysterious and adventurous world of literature and the arts as you play this fast-paced quiz game!  Each card contains five clues.  Answer on the first clue and you earn five points.  If you answer after all five clues (including a picture clue), you still earn a point!  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&quot;<br/><br/>One player starts by drawing a card depicting a famous artist or work of art (concealing the picture on the front and covering the clues one the back).  He or she reads the first clue the player to the left.  If that player answers, he or she earns five points.  If not, the first player reads the next clue to the next player.  This sequence continues until a player answers correctly, earning a decreasing number of points depending on how many clues have been revealed.  The final clue is the picture on the front of the card.  Once a card has been solved, the player earning the points draws the next card, and play continues until all cards are used.  The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Authentic Professional Football Game, players use a stack of cards to simulate the plays in a football game. The offensive player chooses his play and then picks a card. Each card lists a result for all possible plays. The player checks his chosen play and applies the result by moving a football marker on a football field board. Downs, first downs and scoring work as they do in American football. Kicks (kickoffs and punts) are resolved by drawing one card for the kick distance and another for the return distance. When a play results in a penalty, interception or too-short field goal, another card is drawn to show the result. When all the cards in the stack are used up, a quarter ends. The deck is then shuffled and the next quarter begins. The second half (or third quarter) begins with a kickoff. As in a typical football game, the player with the most points after four quarters wins.<br/><br/>",
