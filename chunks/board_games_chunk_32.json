        "description": "The Weather expansion uses the value of the highest undrafted die to create a weather-related condition that will apply to the next round of play. This means that while the first round of the game will play normally, every subsequent round will have a weather effect that will provide emergent tactical decisions and opportunities for you as you farm.<br/><br/>The weather expansion board sits above the game board and the cloud meeple is used to mark the weather condition that is in play for the round.<br/><br/>Includes: weather board plus cloud and tractor wooden tokens<br/><br/>Note: This was a KS Exclusive mini-expansion and was FREE to KS backers. It will not be included with retail copies of the game,  but may be available directly from Motor City Gameworks in the future.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is dedicated to the memory of all of the GIs that, like Audie Murphy, did their duty during the dark hours of World War II, and that went &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;.<br/><br/>The 3rd US Infantry Division &quot;Rock of the Marne&quot; was one of the first divisions engaged in World War II. It fought in Sicily, in Italy (Salerne and Anzio landings), then in southern France, in Alsace, and finally in Germany, near the Czech border, where it finished the war.<br/><br/>The division suffered heavy losses throughout the war, as it was engaged in violent battles in Italy and in the Vosges mountains.<br/><br/>One of the bravest soldiers of this division was Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier of Second World War. He started the war as a private in the 15th US Infantry Regiment in 1943. By they time the war was over in 1945, he was a lieutenant with 38 medals, including the Medal of Honor. After the war, he became a Hollywood movie star and wrote an autobiographical book, &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, about his World War II experience.<br/><br/>Required expansions: Terrain Pack, Eastern Front<br/><br/>Recommended expansions: Winter Board, Campaign Book, Pacific Theater, Tigers in the Snow<br/><br/>",

Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.<br/><br/>This game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.<br/><br/>The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy). The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.<br/><br/>Risk<br/><br/>Players are given army units to place onto the map of the world. Players use units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers. Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>Europe is your battleground and enemy castles your target in this thrilling game of military strategy. Your tactics range from highly planned to hit-and-run, as you deploy your troops: Choose from Spies, Generals and Diplomats to carry out your battle plans. Call out your Marshalls, Reinforcements, the Admiral, and, just once in the game, your Hidden Armies. Now roll the dice to see who wins each battle.<br/><br/>",

These objective sets put you in cockpit of an Imperial Navy fighter, offer the allure of a Sith cult, or allow you to impersonate a deity with C-3PO in exchange for some native support.<br/><br/>&quot;The Echoes of the Force&quot; cycle draws to a close, and each of the affiliations of Star Wars: The Card Game explore the new possibilities and tactics offered by these cards. Whether you work with Jedi to protect the innocent from the dark side, or you dive deep into the slimiest schemes within Jabba's palace, you'll find the tools you need to make exciting new decks and explore new strategies.<br/><br/>The Force holds the galaxy of Star Wars together, but only you can determine which side you will fight for: Darkness or Light?<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 122-126.<br/><br/>",

The tiles are twice as big (i.e. four times bigger in area) compared to the standard tiles.<br/><br/>The expansion allows the Castles of Mad King Ludwig: Collector's edition to be played with larger pieces, especially convenient for solo play and conventions. For playing the game, the expansion requires the cards, card trays, and game pieces (player markers, coins, towers, tokens, etc.) of the base game.<br/><br/>The expansion contains two gameplay differences compared to the base game: <br/>1) The Foyer tiles (i.e. the starting tile for each player) of the base game have three entrances at both sides of the tiles. The Foyer tiles of the &quot;Colossal Moats &amp; Barbican&quot; expansion have three entrances on one side and four entrances on the other side, thus allowing more variation in the starting position.<br/>2) The optional Moats &amp; Barbicans module have different Barbican tiles compared to the base game: In the base game, the Barbican tiles are dual-layered and overlap the Foyer pieces such that each Barbican always has an external drawbridge entrance. In the Colossal expansion, the Barbican tiles do not overlap the Foyer tiles and thus allow a Barbican without an external entrance (depending on the orientation of the adjacent Foyer tile), again allowing for more variation in the starting position compared to the base game.<br/><br/>This expansion was available as a bundle with Castles of Mad King Ludwig: Royal Collector's Edition in the Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>",

So there&rsquo;s an obvious link between this card, the game and Boardgamegeek. Besides that, a jester is a funny and strange guy so this card also lets you do something funny and strange: The player who has the jester, is allowed to take 2 cubes from his supply in hands and drop them on the board from about 30 to 40 cm height. Where the cubes end, they will settle. The card can be combined with the base game, as well as with each and every expansion.<br/><br/>This card is a Boardgamegeek exclusive and will only be available from the Boardgamegeek store.<br/><br/>",

Contracts are auctioned in a special auction (as part of the Fundraise Operation); players bid in years to complete (lowest bid wins). A timepiece chit is placed on the Sunspot Cycle to mark the bid. Winning a contract grants a cash advance, and further rewards upon fulfillment (bringing the contract to the specified destination), including ongoing abilities. If late for delivery, players owe late fees and/or may default (inability to bid on contracts until the advance is repaid). Discarding a contract gives a player the  default chit - this gives them a VP penalty and the inability to bid on manned contracts.<br/><br/>The contract deck flips to gold-side when any player produces an Isotope, causing Isotope monetization.<br/><br/>A second Colonist queue (spaceborn) is available once you have a Colony Beyond Earth Orbit (BEO). Within your Faction, they cannot co-exist with earthborn Colonists (the Humans from Module 2). All Robots (including those from Module 2), are placed in the spaceborn queue.<br/><br/>Cybernetics icons on contracts are required to implant augmentations, which grant abilities to the Colonist they are implanted on. Augmentation chits are implanted onto Colonists and remain attached to that Colonist until Decommissioned or removed. A Colonist with one or more augmentations is an augmented Colonist. An Colocated augmented Colonist is required for the promotion Operation.<br/><br/>Anchoring a Bernal with a Dirtside matching your isostandard founds the isobank: Exodus contracts are activated. Isotope may be transfered to the isobank (adding to the isototal) to assist with a starshot, either during the game (desperation) or at game end. VP are given for contributions. A desperation starshot ends the game at the end of the current cycle; the starship must exit before game end or the commander suffers VP penalties.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Legendary Bahadurs is not a complete game, you need a Aristeia! Core Box to play.<br/><br/>This expansion sees the return of four of the greatest Bahadurs &quot;Aristeia Champions&quot; to the HexaDome. The famous commentator of Vissiorama and five-time Bahadur, Final Boss, has decided to return to the competition by gathering a team of old companions. Shona Carano, a remarkable swordswoman; Koorie Queen, the very first Bahadur; and Oberon, a support geist.<br/><br/>Shona Carano's game role.<br/>Shona Carano is a specialist in short-range combat, where she is quite lethal. It&rsquo;s a profile that stands out in scenarios where there are character clusters, or it&rsquo;s important to conquer and defend a Scoring Zone.<br/>Some of her tactics have the ability to execute free actions.<br/>Her Attributes are average, and her Defense is low, so she has to act quickly and take great care of Enemy Shooters.<br/><br/>Koorie Queen's game role.<br/>She is a harasser specializing in the hunting and incapacitation of support characters, or characters with a low Hit Points value.<br/>She makes use of the Hidden State only while performing Offensive Actions.<br/>Her Bounce Ability is perfect to finish off injured Enemies. In addition, it imposes the IStunned State.<br/>Koorie Queen&rsquo;s Defense and her Agility, in combination with her Switch, make her very elusive.<br/><br/>Final Boss' game role.<br/>This is a complete profile if there ever was one. Final Boss is an off-tank with stamina by virtue of his good Defense and his Automatic Ability i-Khol, with the ability to deal damage over a short range with his Attack.<br/>He has great Brawn and Agility values which give him the ability to activate his Switch and impose the IStunned State within short Range.<br/>You can impose the States Dazzled and -2U, which gives him a bit of control ability.<br/><br/>Oberon's game role.<br/>Oberon is a support character that works with our Tactics deck, and imposes a new State in the game: Silenced. Taking into account the Mulligan at the start of the game, and the cards &ldquo;I have a Plan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catch your Breath&rdquo;, it won&rsquo;t be difficult to get the desired Tactics with Oberon on hand.<br/>At the cost of discarding a Tactic, it offers the opportunity to add Yellow dice to any Roll of an Ally. This variant of Focused is extremely useful for anyone who uses &quot;!&quot;.<br/>As is standard with support characters, his Defense is weak and his Hit Points value make him a very fragile target.<br/><br/>The expansion introduces the Silenced State.<br/><br/>",

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Black Market, where anything is obtainable&hellip;if you can pay the price.<br/><br/>Black Market is the fourth expansion for Museum and adds a market system to the game where you may purchase Objects and Notoriety cards to complete your collections and harass your adversaries. For those of you looking to put a more aggressive emphasis on the interaction between players in Museum, this is the one for you!<br/><br/><br/>     Objects:<br/><br/><br/>The 30 object cards featured in the expansion are all from civilisations outside of the ones present in the base game. You&rsquo;ll know them by their rather unique appearance (Images coming shortly) and the fact that they only have one attribute! For example, there&rsquo;s the Viking Longship that will only sport a Navigation Icon or maybe the Terracotta army, the famous guardians of emperor Qin Shi Huang which only counts as a Chinese card? These and many more are purchased exactly like any other object and can give your collections a much needed boost!<br/><br/><br/>     Notoriety Cards:<br/><br/><br/>Museum has always had a pleasant level of player interaction, with each player concentrating on building up their Museum. With these new cards though, you can throw many a wrench in your opponent&rsquo;s plans! Purchased like an object card, they follow exactly the same rules as a standard notoriety card except their effects are much more aggressive. Steal objects, create counterfeits, and steal prestige right out from underneath your opponent&rsquo;s noses! The ends justifies the means!<br/><br/>All these new cards will be available on a separate market board . When cards first appear, they&rsquo;ll cost more but as they stick around for longer, their cost will go down. So, do you shell out right from the start or wait for a better price at the risk of having them stolen out from you?<br/><br/>The Black Market expansion includes 60 new Contraband cards (objects and Notoriety cards) as well as new characters, events and Notoriety cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Shaped like a cross, the ziggurat is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color. Discard those five tokens and replace them using the ziggurat markers.<br/><br/>Place a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. (Note, the tower is not part of this extension. Please use any other meeple from any other game.) The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All Tigris &amp; Euphrates rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Starting with the 2008 edition of Tigris &amp; Euphrates from Mayfair Games, the ziggurat has been included in the base game, along with a double-sided game board.<br/><br/>",

There, terraforming is already well underway, and millions of humans live alongside clones and bioroids in a handful of cities and nodes protected by transplas domes.<br/><br/>With sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards), Daedalus Complex explores the ways that life on the Red Planet is markedly different than life on Earth. On Mars, it requires a certain ruggedness to live and work. Simply traveling outside of the protected cities requires breathing assistance and protective gear. The shared hardships of survival have led to the de facto authority of the clans, and even though the Martian Colony Wars have ended, the tensions between the clans, the Martian Colonial Authority, and the corps remain high.<br/><br/>Mine these conflicts for change or profit with Daedalus Complex. Mars very much remains a semi-lawless frontier&hellip; and any given spark has the potential to ignite a much larger flame.<br/><br/>",

Through a series of linked scenarios, players discover the existence of a new power in the Frozen City, one who was old when the great city was still young, and who saw both its rise and its disastrous fall. Warbands will confront the Lich Lord's minions, race against his agents to seize possession of mysterious artefacts, and brave the perils of Frostgrave in search of his lair. Eventually, they will need to muster all their courage to venture into the depths of the city and face the Lich Lord himself. Not all wizards will seek to stop the Lich Lord, however, and full rules for giving into his corruption and following the dark road to becoming an undead lich are presented for those who crave power and immortality above all else. While the campaign presents many new threats against which wizards and their warbands must test themselves, including an expanded bestiary, it also offers additional resources, such as new henchmen that can be recruited and unique magical treasures that can spell the difference between survival and oblivion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translated from the French rulebook:<br/>You don't know? It seems that our dear Paladin has received a fantastic proposal. He is on tour with a series of conferences entitled &quot;My Struggles Against Evil&quot;. It is so famous, he was offered a caravan of luxury and in an interview with the magazine &quot;Adventures, Adventurers&quot;, he confessed he did not intend to resume his original post.<br/>Good news for you, right?<br/>Well actually ... not really. It's complicated getting rid of the righteous. As soon as the tent of the former paladin was deserted, not one, but two of his colleagues took up residence: a slender elf and a robust dwarf (sigh). Beware this rather incongruous duet ... their mind is as twisted as that of their predecessor and they seem equally determined to fight Evil (sigh ...).<br/><br/>This mini extension allows you to replace the two original paladins with two pairs of new paladins. Leave the original Paladin in the box and place the elf and dwarf pair on the tent at the start of each year.  The first person to cross the paladin line on the evilometer will get the elf.  If another player crosses the line, the less evil of the two will get the elf, and the other will get the more difficult dwarf.<br/><br/>The elf is only worth 4 points at the end of the game while the dwarf is worth 6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kickstarter version of Margraves of Valeria 4 bonus packs inside the game's box. These are Kickstarter Limited Exclusives and will not be available at retail. They may be available on the publisher's website, conventions, or the BGG Store.<br/><br/>Dragons Pack - 4 card pack adds 1 dragon per lair. Also includes a punchboard with 10 bounty tiles and rules card.<br/><br/>Citizen Pack - 8 card pack adds 2 copies of  4 new citizens with unique powers.<br/><br/>Reeve Pack - 5 card pack adds 1 new starter citizen card for each player.<br/><br/>Monster Pack - 4 card pack adds 1 new monster with unique rewards per lair.<br/><br/>About the game:<br/>Margraves of Valeria is a hand-building worker-placement game set in the fantasy world of Valeria. It's the fifth stand-alone game in the series and brings the familiar feel of the previous games (with icons, characters, and easy turns) while building on familiar mechanics you'd expect (off-turn bonuses, multi-use cards, and resource-management).<br/><br/>You are a Margrave, a military commander tasked with defending the land of Valeria and building magical Ward Towers at cities.  Knights in Valeria can be commanded by you or your fellow Margraves to slay monsters or activate locations in an effort to gain influence over the 4 Guilds: Worker, Soldier, Shadow, and Holy. As you gain influence, you'll cross thresholds that will earn you privilege tiles which give you bonuses.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you'll earn victory points based on how much influence you have over a Guild and how many icons you've gained of that Guild. The Margrave with the most victory points at the end of the game will be named a Duke or Duchess and given their own province to protect and grow!<br/><br/>Turns are deceptively simple as you only get to play 1 Citizen card from your hand. Each card can be played for action icons in the pennant (top-left), power text (at the bottom), or played face-down to perform one of the two actions on your player board (Recall your cards or Build a Ward Tower).<br/><br/>Key features include:<br/><br/><br/>    Hand Building - Much like deck-building, you are drafting cards into your hand increasing your powers, victory points, and options.  <br/>    Multi-use Cards - Each card can be used in one of four ways, leaving you a lot of decision-making room to execute your strategy.<br/>    Worker-Placement - Each time you move your Margrave or a Knight into a location, you activate the power of that location much like a worker placement game. <br/>    Shared Workers - The Knights on the game board do not belong to a single player (anyone can use them) so be careful not to setup your opponents with powerful turns.<br/>    Resource Management - You have limited storage spots on your player board and using them effectively (without wasting tokens) is key to winning the game. <br/>    Hero Tombs - As you send Knights into battle, they die glorious deaths and are sent to tombs where you can collect bonuses in a well-integrated mini-game.<br/>    Influence Track - Gain influence over the 4 Guilds by moving your markers across the tracks which will earn you more victory points at the end of the game for icons you collect.<br/>    Fantastic Art - As with previous Valeria games, the Mico has really outdone himself by creating a rich and dynamic world full of color and life.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The northern region of Sweden is rugged and full of snow-covered mountains that give way to lower foothills, heavily forested hills, dozens of rivers and an estimated 101,000 lakes. In the south, large lakes (some linked by canals) and widely cultivated plains stretch across the land. In the 1850s, Sweden began to build the national railway network. Sweden would soon rank among the foremost countries in per capita mileage of railroads. Will you develop the ferry lines along the southeastern shoreline, or instead risk the hardships of building through the rocky terrain of the North in search of greater gains? Railways of Sweden is an expansion map for Railways of the World, designed for 2 to 5 players. You will need the pieces from the Railways of the World base game or the Railways of Nippon base game to play it.<br/><br/>Railways of Sweden is a 2-5 player map expansion to the Railways of the World series. This map features lots of heavy mountainous terrain. This expansion will come with a sheet of snowy track tiles to be optionally used in the northern mountains of Sweden. It also has a variety of new Railroad Operations cards, such as New Mining Town, Mountain Engineer, Extended Ferry Line and Passenger Express. In addition, it includes new +50/+100 point tokens to be used with the Railways of Sweden score &amp; income track.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

But the most feared weapon of all needs no human guidance. It's a giant cybernetic tank called the OGRE.<br/><br/>The basic OGRE game gives one player a force of infantry and armor, and a command post he must defend. The other player has only one unit - but it's an OGRE. It's an even match. Advanced games allow solitaire or multi-player action, with OGREs on both sides.<br/><br/>In G.E.V., units from Ogre are carried over, with expanded rules for terrain.

        "description": "Each one of the six Colt Express: Bandits expansions allows the players to compete against the game itself, which is operating under the rules of that particular expansion. A new story is told each time as every expansion creates a specific goal and new actions for the bandit played by the game. That bandit may win, and if that happens, all the players lose. Thus you need to work together against this &quot;bot&quot;, while keeping in mind that in the end, there is only one winner &mdash; the richest bandit, of course.<br/><br/>In the Tuco expansion, Tuco does not want to meet the Marshal, his former friend, against whom he bears a grudge.<br/><br/>Tuco's Fire and Punch hit all the possible targets, included Belle. The Swap action swaps Tuco and the Marshal's places, while Tuco's Marshal action takes the Marshal away from Tuco. If a player plays an action that brings the Marshal to the same location as Tuco, he receives a Wanted token (worth $500). At the end of the game, Tuco's loot is worth $250 per bullet he has shot.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Her stealth suit, Joshua T1, allows her confuse her foes and infiltrate even the most secured locations.<br/><br/>Hoax comes complete with four miniatures - one is painted to reflect Hoax fading from sight while the other three are translucent, used to track her movement on the board while she is invisible.

Which one is the real Hoax?<br/><br/>In addition to the miniatures, Hoax also comes with a rulebook detailing the rules for invisibility, tokens for her equipment (as well as bonus tokens), and a custom scenario which throws players into a deadly game of hide-and-seek!<br/><br/>Keep your eyes peeled for Hoax, coming soon from Fantasy Flight Games!<br/><br/>Tannh&auml;user is a squad based tactical board game set in an alternate timeline in which WWI has never ended.

A new story is told each time as every expansion creates a specific goal and new actions for the bandit played by the game. That bandit may win, and if that happens, all the players lose. Thus you need to work together against this &quot;bot&quot;, while keeping in mind that in the end, there is only one winner &mdash; the richest bandit, of course.<br/><br/>In the Ghost expansion, Ghost has always dreamed of getting this valuable suitcase. Ghost's move always makes him get closer to the special suitcase. Ghost's Fire and Punch hit all the possible targets, Belle included. The Heist action makes Ghost get the special suitcase.<br/><br/>If Ghost has the suitcase at the end of the game, he wins, whatever the loot held by the other bandits.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While they are able to mount a solid offense, the Knights are shielded by a less than chivalrous defense. Coach Arthur Roundtable states, &quot;The football is our queen and we will protect it.&quot; Quarterback Lance Lott states: &quot;Yeah, well I'm the king! Protect me!

Despite an incredible offense, the Locusts have one of the lowest ranked defenses in the league. Coach Paul Ishtoff states, &quot;Our team puts points on the board. Period. You can't stop us on the ground or in the air. Unfortunately, our defense bugs me.&quot; Quarterback Rick O&rsquo;Shea, the mastermind behind their brilliant passing game, had this to say: &quot;We have a very simple formula for success. Our offense only has to put more points on the board than our defense gives away. Then it's all gravy!&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Milwaukee Monsters &ndash; The Monsters enter the league with the 15th ranked running game and the 6th ranked passing game. Despite less-than-stellar talent in running, the Monsters have one of the best passing games in the league. Coach Frankie Stein states, &quot;We definitely need to work on our ground game, but when the Monsters put the ball in the air, we are scary.&quot; Quarterback Wolfgang Mann could not be reached for comment. When asked about this, wide receiver Billy Phantom replied, &quot;Yea, sometimes he disappears for days at a time. By the way, did you see that moon last night? Beautiful!&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Springfield Spartans &ndash; The Spartans enter the league with the 23rd ranked running game and the 15th ranked passing game. Despite troubles on offense, the Spartans have the #3 ranked defense in the league. Coach Colin Toksho states, &quot;We rely on our defense to get us out of trouble.

        "description": "New 2018 expansion for Mythic Battles Pantheon<br/><br/>With Dionysus, we didn't want to create a combat-oriented unit, but rather a control oriented unit that represented opulence and chaos.<br/><br/>Let's start by looking at the power &quot;Orgiastic Procession&quot; which aims to simulate the arrival of Dionysus, accompanied by one of his procession. This power gives the player several troops who, themselves, have many activation cards. The goal is to support the notion of opulence, which is emphasized by the number of &quot;art of war&quot; cards that brings Dionysus, as well as a high number of life points.<br/><br/>The satyr children also help Dionysus controlling the map because they all possess the block talent. However, we don&rsquo;t imagine that it is by physical might they manage to block off their enemies; it is because the units in their areas are too busy drinking their wine and feasting.<br/><br/>The power of the satyr children makes it clear that Dionysus is not here to kill the opponents by fighting, but on the contrary, for them to lose themselves in the chaotic bliss of merriment. This power greatly disrupts an opponent's position and, in effect, offers significant control on the map to Dionysus.<br/><br/>If the satyr children can neither attack nor collect gems, we imagine it is because they are busy serving wine to all the units in their area. This is represented by their block talent, as we have seen above, but also by the Bolster talent of the troops and the intoxicating power of Dionysus. This power, meanwhile, can generate chaos in the opponent's cards by forcing him to discard cards from his deck.<br/><br/>Clearly, Dionysus can be a technical unit to play, due to his low mobility which requires careful placement on the map. Despite this, he is ubiquitous on the field and has the capability to disrupt the opponent's strategy. This, combined with the fact that he can send satyr children to bring him Omphalos (simulated by the talent gem collector), allows one to achieve victory by attaining Omphalos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 19th century, railway expansion across Australia suffered from inconsistent rail gauges as the colonies could not agree upon a standard. This lack of planning meant that different rail gauges must meet up at a station for passengers and cargo to switch from one line to the next before continuing on their journey. This break of gauge creates new challenges in rail line efficiency and new headaches for aspiring Rail Barons! Railways of Australia is an expansion map for Railways of the World, designed for 2 to 6 players. You will need the pieces from the Railways of the World base game or the Railways of Nippon base game to play it.<br/><br/>Railways of Australia is a large 2-6 player map. This map has several unique features: a new terrain type - towns; region borders; and rebound Railroad Operations cards. When built, a town becomes a Gray New City on the map. There are also Railroad Operations cards that automatically build each of the 10 towns on the map. Players cannot build across region borders unless connecting through a city, or using a 'Triple Gauge' Railroad Operations card. This expansion includes junction track tiles for use with the Switch Tracks mini expansion. These new track tiles display the 2 lines coming together in each configuration. Switch tokens are also included so that players can use the Switch Track mini expansion right out of the box.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You'll defeat mythic monsters and grab fabled magic items! Don the Death Mask and Achilles' Heels. Wield Thor's Hammer...or maybe the Magic Bassoon.

Joffrey Baratheon has been crowned king, and now sits the Iron Throne. Robb Stark has already been proclaimed King in the North, and Stannis plots from Dragonstone, brooding on a throne that should have been his. It is the calm before the tempest: war in Westeros is imminent, and above it all, the Dragon&rsquo;s Tail burns a blood-red trail across the sky.<br/><br/>Enter the War of the Five Kings with Across the Seven Kingdoms and the War of Five Kings cycle! As the Westeros cycle broadly followed the events of A Game of Thrones, so the War of Five Kings cycle moves forward to highlight the thrilling battles and intrigue of A Clash of Kings. Each House calls upon its loyal bannermen in this cycle, and a multitude of new Kings arise to claim the Iron Throne. What&rsquo;s more, Across the Seven Kingdoms begins to introduce effects based on the Summer and Winter plot traits, allowing the long-lived seasons of Westeros to play a more integral role in the game. With new King versions of Robb Stark and Viserys Targaryen entering the game alongside characters like Arry and Janos Slynt, this Chapter Pack is an explosive beginning to the War of Five Kings cycle!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An expansion for Zooloretto, given for free by Abacus at Spiel 2008 in Essen.<br/><br/>This expansion consists of 1 tile with a gorilla.<br/><br/>Use the normal rules for Zooloretto, except for one rule: the first player to fill his 6-space enclosure, takes the gorilla enclosure from the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The owner of the gorilla enclosure may once during the game place a drawn tile (which may be a coin tile) directly into his zoo instead of on a delivery truck. Keep track of usage by placing the spent coin on the Gorilla enclosure. The coin remains there until the end of the game and is not involved in the final scoring.<br/><br/>From Rio Grande's Website:<br/><br/>Gorilla is a small expansion for the award-winning Zooloretto and the folow-on game Aquaretto.<br/><br/>For Zooloretto, it contains a savings book for each player and job boards. Savings books can be used to earn interest during the game and to break ties at the end of the game. It also contains job boards, which encourage players to acquire specific animals for their zoos. At game end, players score additional points for having collected the animals shown on their job boards.<br/><br/>For Aquaretto, we have added three co-worker tiles: the Research Station, the Training Area, and the Technical Area. Players may take these tiles when they take co-workers to score more points. It also adds Trains to the game. Players can collect different train tiles to score additional points at game end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast paced tabletop miniatures game, Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team pits teams of elite specialists, ragtag zealots and hard-bitten veterans against each other in vicious skirmish battles to the bitter end. A single squad of well-trained and well-equipped warriors can tip the balance of a wider conflict &ndash; with Kill Team, you&rsquo;ll play through countless stories of your own devising that could alter the fate of the galaxy itself.<br/><br/>The Core Manual is a 208-page softback book which contains complete rules for choosing and constructing a kill team from 16 factions in the Warhammer 40,000 range (Adeptus Astartes, Deathwatch, Grey Knights, Astra Militarum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Heretic Astartes, Death Guard, Thousand Sons, Asuryani, Drukhari, Harlequins, Necrons, Orks, T&rsquo;au Empire, Tyranids and Genestealer Cults), along with background explaining the importance of kill teams to the wider battle for supremacy:<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>- Shadow War: this section of the book takes you through the roles of kill teams in the 41st Millennium &ndash; whether surgically removing an enemy commander or dangerous demagogue, desperately fighting their way through a battlefield to reinforce stranded comrades or finding themselves the last line of defence against an overwhelming force, every battle between kill teams tells a story of heroism and adventure;<br/>- Heroes All: every kill team is different, but all have certain features in common &ndash; each features a charismatic, cunning or domineering leader and specialists, skilled individuals who bring vital equipment and talents;<br/>- Theatres of War: the supreme commanders of the 41st Millennium have incredible military might at their disposal, and yet there are many scenarios in which the precise application of a small, highly trained force is appropriate. Thousands of war zones have seen drastic changes after a kill team incursion; this section describes but a few of the myriad different environments these small squads have battled in.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>- Core Rules: covering the basics of Kill Team, this section takes you through exactly what you need in order to play, explains how to interpret and use datasheets, and how to set up your battle. It takes you through Battle Rounds, which consist of Initiative, Movement, Psychic, Shooting, Fighting and Morale phases with annotated, easy to follow guides and photographs;<br/>- Fighting a Battle: here you&rsquo;ll learn how the structure of your game will be defined &ndash; deciding on a mission, setting up the battlefield, and deploying your kill teams. Included is an example Open Play mission &ndash; Covert War &ndash; which serves as an easy introduction;<br/>- Advanced Rules: this section adds a variety of optional rules for complexity and depth, recommended for use after players are familiar with the core rules. It includes different types of terrain, rules for climbing, mantling, leaping over gaps and covers damage received by falling from heights;<br/>- Killzones: these are environment-specific rules, adding danger and advantages according to the area your miniatures find themselves in. This section includes Sector Imperialis rules, which are designed for use with the scenery found in the box;<br/>- Missions: this section introduces 3 Open, 4 Matched and 4 Narrative play missions, showing you how to pick and choose elements from each to create your own games, the way you want to play them. It includes details of the Scouting Phase, in which planning, preparing and luck can dictate the direction of the battle to be fought. Each included mission features advice on selecting your teams, setup, deployment and victory conditions;<br/>- Kill Teams: this section takes you through building your kill team in a thorough and easy to follow manner, covering Open, Matched and Narrative play-specific teams;<br/>- Command Points: Matched play kill teams can be Battle-forged &ndash; this section describes the tactics specific to these teams;<br/>- Specialists: these are experienced fighters with certain abilities, split into 9 disciplines: Leader, Combat, Comms, Demolitions, Heavy, Medic, Scout, Sniper, Veteran and Zealot, each featuring 3 exclusive Tactics. These Tactics are increasingly powerful, and are unlocked by acquiring experience during a campaign;<br/>- Background information for each of the following factions: Adeptus Astartes, Deathwatch, Grey Knights, Astra Militarum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Heretic Astartes, Death Guard, Thousand Sons, Asuryani, Drukhari, Harlequins, Necrons, Orks, T&rsquo;au Empire, Tyranids, and Genestealer Cults. This section can be used to add character to your kill team, with name and characteristic generators, faction-specific Tactics, and even quirks for each of your squad members. Each faction also features datasheets and comprehensive wargear tables with points lists and abilities.<br/><br/>Campaigns<br/><br/>Kill Team can be played and enjoyed in one-off missions, but included are a suite of comprehensive optional rules for fighting multiple battles in a connected series, forming a narrative of covert battles fought alongside a greater war. This section of the book walks you through a Kill Team campaign: the victory conditions, how to select missions, gain experience and upgrade your team, deal with injuries, manage resources and even escalate conflict. This includes blank command rosters and datasheets which you can photocopy and use to keep track of your campaign.<br/><br/>On top of all this is a miniatures showcase, brimming with inspiration photos of kill teams and battle scenes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both expansions add structures you may purchase with Bohnentalern that match that structure. The more valuable structures allow you to bend the rules to your advantage in specific ways. Of course, the structures you've purchased count toward your final score, as well. For instance, the 4-Taler Bank (Rote Bohne) in High Bohn allows its owner to relocate one card in her hand at the beginning of her turn, which bends the rule stating that cards in the hand never may be rearranged; and the 3-Taler Nightbar (Puffbohne) establishment in Prohibohn allows its owner to alternate the bean type in each field, which bends the rule stating that each field must contain only one type of bean at a time.<br/><br/>The 36-card High Bohn expansion for Bohnanza is an updated release of the original Lookout Games edition, with some alterations to the building distribution.<br/><br/>The 24-card Prohibohn expansion for Al Cabohne is only for two players.

Soloman Kane<br/><br/>This expansion does make some modifications to the starting tile set, as well as providing two possible playing options for the expansion set.<br/><br/>When using The Duke: Robert E.

Allowing players to choose whether to accept the expansion tile in place of the corresponding core game tile when it is drawn from the bag.<br/><br/>",

The armies in these battles are very Macedonian in style, with a lot of mixing of unit types and capabilities, with the exception that, because of the terrain, reliance on cavalry is almost non-existent. The phalanx itself was still the army's anchor, although it was only a generation away from its initial comeuppance at the hands of a Roman army at Cynoscephalae.<br/><br/>To play Phalanx, you need a copy of The Great Battles of Alexander / Great Battles of Alexander, Deluxe Edition.<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

On one side, you find the fledgling Rebel Alliance, led by a few brave politicians and desperately fighting for the hearts and minds of people on countless planets. Opposing the Rebels stands the might of the Galactic Empire, a monolithic government ruled by the Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious.<br/><br/>Galactic Ambitions pits these two powers against each other in a struggle for the galaxy itself. Like previous deluxe expansions, the twenty-six new objective sets included in Galactic Ambitions fix the spotlight on two factions&mdash;the Sith and the Rebel Alliance&mdash;but every faction receives cards that push your decks in new directions. Here, you&rsquo;ll find an assortment of iconic characters to include in your decks, including Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Leia Organa, and Mon Mothma, Kanan Jarrus, and the Inquisitor from Star Wars: Rebels. Whether you&rsquo;re fighting to free the galaxy or to squelch any trace of resistance, Galactic Ambitions offers new strategies and cards to support new deck types.<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 217-230.<br/><br/>",

Its three infantry regiments traced their roots back to before the American War of Independence and through the American Civil War, leading to the 29th being called the&quot;Blue and Gray Division.&quot;<br/><br/>The 29th participated in the campaign in Northwest Europe from D-Day to VE-Day, and suffered over 20,000 battle casualties (the second-most of any U.S. division in the war) as it fought from Omaha Beach through the bocage to St. L&ocirc; and Vire, then taking Brest, onto the Siegfried Line, crossing the Roer, through the Ruhr, and to the Elbe&mdash;commanded the entire time by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt, one of the ETO&rsquo;s more controversial generals.<br/><br/>This Action Pack showcases ten of the varied, intense actions that the 29th Infantry Division engaged in from D-Day to October 1944.

Easily recognizable by lacking a Resolve value, a Lieutenant is an alternate version of an existing Enemy which, when eliminated, allows you to take a Reward card right out of the display. Most Enemies appearing in Mistfall and Heart of the Mists will see their Lieutenant version in the Sand and Snow expansion.<br/><br/>New opportunities to receive Reward cards call for (you guessed it!) more Rewards. And you will get a nice big cache of brand new General Rewards. I&rsquo;ve noticed over the last year that many of Mistfall fans wanted more cool loot, and besides bringing some to the Heart of the Mists box, you can now get an even greater number of new weapons, armour and arcane items to use against the Mists.<br/><br/>Sand and Snow will also feature a few new Allies, and a set of Special Event cards, drawn at specific times during the game, becoming essentially more permanent versions of Encounters. If you can beat them within a few turns of the game, you might be rewarded for your effort, and if you decide to ignore them, they will come back to bite you!<br/><br/>",

Orange flowers push the player interaction with their diverse scoring: depending on which you find first, you may want to gather them all for yourself or spread them around the table. There&rsquo;s also the Nasturtium, a potentially powerful (though situational) card that lets the player reorder their arrangement before scoring.

Despite a strong offense, the Black Widows are in danger of getting stomped on defense. Coach Harris Gray states, &quot;We spent all our money on offense. Our defensive squad is pretty much all volunteers.&quot; Nose Guard Mildred Dinkins had this to say: &quot;I just go out there every Sunday and do my best. Can I say 'hi' to my grandson?&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Columbus Cobras &ndash; The Cobras enter the league with the 10th-ranked running game and the 16th-ranked passing game. Not only do the Cobras enter the league with a top-ten running game, their defense stands at 9th in the rankings and is one of the most consistent. Coach Bobby &quot;Bam&quot; Boozell states, &quot;I'm so proud of our defense. That's a tough group of young men. They may not be the best out there, but we rarely have any surprises.&quot; As mentioned, the Cobras have a top tier running game, led by running back, Cole Kutz. Mr. Kutz had not released a statement by press time. Rumors report that he was out looking for a sandwich endorsement.<br/><br/>&bull; Scranton Scorchers &ndash; The Scorchers enter the league with the 7th-ranked running game and the 19th-ranked passing game. Despite an inconsistent offense, the Scorchers have a top eleven defense. Coach Gus Tufwin states, &quot;Right now I'm afraid our passing game blows. But our defense comes in like a hurricane, so hold on to your hats!&quot; Wide Receiver Buddy Fingers commented: &quot;Coach makes a lot of noise about our passing problems, but I'm quick as lightning, man, fast as the wind. I just have a problem holding on to the ball sometimes.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Toronto Thunder &ndash; The Thunder enter the league with the 17th-ranked running game and a bottom ranked passing game. Despite a weak offense, the Thunder have a top ten defense. Coach Hammond Ecks states, &quot;We're going to hatch some surprise plays that should have the other teams scrambling to catch us.&quot; Quarterback Cuba Sugar commented: &quot;I got the sweet moves, baby, but I'm not afraid to hang out there and take a lump or two myself.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The only difficulty is that the backs of the tiles will have different pictures, and of minor note is that the newer tiles are a little thicker than the old ones.<br/><br/>Note that the expansion will not work with the newer Drakon (Third Edition) because it has larger tiles (measuring 2.5 by 2.5 inches), and the 3rd Edition doesn't really need it since it already includes some of the expansion tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PROTEUS, the first expansion for Netrunner, also referred to as v2.1, was released 5 months after the initial release of Netrunner. It added a few interesting mechanics to diversify game play:<br/><br/>Runners and some Black Ops could now cause the Corp to accumulate so-called &quot;Bad Publicity&quot; counters. These counters worked like agenda points in that they could not be removed once you had one - but unlike agenda points, having 7 of them would cause the Corp to lose the game.<br/><br/>Runners were given a new Resource type that now gave Runners an edge that only the Corp had: &quot;Hidden Resources&quot; would enter the game face down and were not visible to the Corp until their ability was used; typically, this involved trashing the Resource.<br/><br/>Some things were also upgraded for the Corp. Many ICE cards featured abilities that allowed the ICE to become more powerful as things developed in the game - and with &quot;World Domination&quot;, the Corp could now win the game with a single Agenda.<br/><br/>Proteus cards were sold in 15-card Boosters and are now rarities, sought after by many collectors due to its limited print volume.<br/><br/>Official Publisher Synopsis from the back of the box:<br/><br/>For years the data fort had cycled idle, a derelict from a corporate war. When Max Forward lifted its address, he expected a cakewalk: the fort was old, unmonitored. But then it's not every day that a Runner faces a revolutionary security experiment...<br/><br/>Discover the product of the new tech Forward brought to light: ice capable of transmuting into completely different countermeasures; smart icebreakers that can rewrite their own code. Proteus. Whether you're Runner or Corp, expect a few changes.<br/><br/>Blurb taken from: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.netrunneronline.com/set/proteus/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.netrunneronline.com/set/proteus/</a><br/><br/>",

To prevent this from now on, they introduce the Referee Camel.<br/><br/>The game is played as usual. At the beginning of each Leg, the player to the right of the player owning the Leg Starting Player marker places the Referee Camel onto any free space of the Race track.<br/><br/>When a Camel unit ends its movement on the space of the Referee Camel, all Camels of that unit are asked to &quot;unstack&quot; and to line up next to each other on that space. The Camels are &quot;unstacked&quot; from top to bottom and are lined up in the same order from left to right. (Therefore, the Camel on top is placed on the very left at the edge of the board and continues to be the leading camel of the former unit.)<br/><br/>Once all Camels of the unit have been &quot;unstacked&quot; (or a single Camel has landed on the space), the Referee Camel is removed from the Race track and placed next to the Game board. It enters the game again at the beginning of the next Leg (see above).<br/><br/>This small expansion can be added to the Camel Up base game as well as the expansion Supercup.<br/><br/>",

Merchants can be a mixed bag, scoring points for adjacent Peasants but taking a penalty for adjacent Criminals. Unlike most skulls, this can cause an unwary player to actually lose points on poorly-placed Merchants. Keep your eyes on your money or you&rsquo;ll end up buried in debt.<br/><br/><br/>Merchants is a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.<br/><br/>This expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the Merchants. Merchants want to be next to Peasants but avoid criminals.<br/><br/>Adding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.<br/><br/>",

But it is not the wealthiest family who will win the game, instead it will be the family who has donated most wisely to the churches. <br/>This expansion of the game Hamburgum offers not only a different map with a new allocation of buildings, but also different rules for the donations and visiting the church space on the rondel. Other than in original Hamburgum, church districts do not exist, all donations have to be taken in a certain order, a church tax is implemented on the rondel, and ships give more victory points. The board uses historical views taken from original maps of the 16th century and is printed from both sides: Antverpia on the one side, and a new map of Hamburgum on the other.  <br/>New and beautifully illustrated church donations will come with the expansion, printed on thick cardboard. Other than that, the game material from Hamburgum should be used (real bricks, metal bells, coins etc.).<br/><br/>",

As interest in and accessibility of museums grew exponentially, many institutions underwent an intense period of expansion on both an intellectual and physical level, searching to grow their collections for profit and science.<br/><br/>You play as a curator of one such museum and it&rsquo;s your job to build the biggest, most coherent collection that you can in this game of collection and bartering featuring over 300 individual illustrations by Vincent Dutrait and authentic architectural facts. But it&rsquo;s no simple task!<br/><br/>Each player in Museum has a small collection of relics to get them started, after which, they will have to send explorers around the world to uncover others. These relics each have a value which is either the cost to add them to your museum, or how much they contribute towards adding other relics to your museum. &ldquo;Spent&rdquo; Relics are added to your reserve. You can withdraw them from it by exchanging them for an equal number of items; however, your opponents also has access to your reserve!<br/><br/>During the game you will be required to assemble different collections. These can be from different categories (war, agriculture, architecture, etc) or periods (Ancient Egypt, Rome, Aztec, etc). Patron cards will give you bonus cards for amassing certain collections. Explorer cards will allow you to hire famous archeologists to confer bonuses to your museum and event cards will provide you with some game changing circumstances that you&rsquo;ll have to work around, based on historical events!<br/><br/>All these different elements make compiling your collection an interesting and sometimes tricky experience! At the end of the game points are scored based on collections and their value and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Deluxe Editon holds all Museum Expansions<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The snake god tiles change the way you play Luxor significantly!<br/><br/>As long as one adventurer is placed on a tile, he unlocks a very powerful ability for that player to use every turn. The player has the ability as long as at least one of his adventurers is remaining on the tile. The player may chose to not use an ability on his turn.<br/><br/>During set-up these tiles replace the Osiris tiles of the basic game. So there are 4 abilities to gain during each play. How long will you stay on one tile and get the benefit before you move your adventurer off, to not fall behind...<br/><br/>The abilities:<br/><br/>- Play any card except the card in the middle of your hand.<br/><br/>- Place the drawn card anywhere on your hand.<br/><br/>- Disregard your played card and move one of your adventurers 1-3 spaces further<br/><br/>- Disregard your played card and chose one of your adventurers that does not move but activates the tile again, if he can.<br/><br/>Contents: 4 ability tiles<br/><br/>",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!<br/><br/>Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game: Aggretsuko is an expansion for any standalone title in the Funkoverse line-up that features the title character from the animated show of the same name.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From his youngest days, Tomrick loved throwing the bones. Four-sided, six-, eight-, tens-, even the dreaded twelve-siders... it didn't matter, so long as there was something to win or lose. Tomrick's problem came when his magical talents emerged. Suddenly, the dice had never thrown so well. Suspiciously well, in fact, and poor Tomrick's gambling days had come to an end. But all was not lost. After long study and many thousands of games played at the University's Causality Tower, Tomrick has emerged as the foremost Diceomantic authority in Arcadia (and gained a near encyclopedic knowledge of every game of chance known to mankind). No longer is Tomrick's good fortune restricted to just rolling dice. Why, his Grand Unified Gaming Theory posits that every living thing in the entire world is caught up in one great game, and that if you know the rules well enough, then you know just enough to break them in your favor.<br/><br/>The Tomrick expansion was a reward given out during the 2015 Dice Tower Kickstarter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Commonly called &quot;Unveilers&quot;, these magic-seeking ladybugs are as big as a fist but reputedly harmless, and are well-known among arcanists, treasure seekers, and other intrepid adventurers.<br/><br/>The Unveilers are attracted to magical emanations like flies to a rotting carcass. Spotting a cloud of these bugs is generally a good omen, but not everything that is imbued with magic is safe to dig up...<br/><br/>During your journey, you will certainly (Exploration card / random event) come across these ladybugs. When you do, you will put one of their miniatures into play on the Terrain card that you put in play after encountering this event. The ladybugs will remain there until you have either interacted with them (we won't tell you more, you'll have to find out for yourself) OR until you have dug to see what magical thing attracted them to the area. Then you will remove the mini and find out if you chose well&hellip; or poorly.<br/><br/>Will it be a powerful artifact? An arcane skeleton? A cursed object? A magical creature to fight or coax? All you have to do is dig to find out!<br/><br/>",

Perceval<br/>6. Morgana<br/>7. Mordred<br/>8. Camelot/Fort<br/><br/>This expansion does make some modifications to the starting tile set, including the creation of asymmetrical opposing forces. It also provides one alternate playing scenario for the game using the expansion tiles.<br/><br/>When using The Duke: Arthurian Legends Expansion you replace the following tiles in the core game:<br/><br/>Arthur = Light Stained Duke<br/>Merlin = Light Stained Wizard<br/>Lancelot = Light Stained Champion<br/>Guinevere = Light Stained Duchess<br/>Perceval = Light Stained Assassin<br/>Morgana = Dark Stained Duke<br/>Mordred = Dark Stained Duchess<br/><br/>The rulebook for this expansion provides one alternate playing scenario to incorporate these tiles and the Camelot tile into the game. This alternate playing scenario gives the player special advantages whenever their Arthurian tiles are moved into or out of Camelot while its on the board.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in &quot;rounds,&quot; with players taking turns to maneuver the ships in their fleets, attack opponent's ships, and defend their own fleet against enemy attack. A player's fleet is composed of randomly selected ships (Frigates, Destroyers, Battleships, Carriers, etc.) and boats (submarines), with varied attack/defense capabilities. At the end of each round, players receive points for each enemy vessel they have sunk. The game can end when a player achieves a specific point total, or when all opposing fleets are sunk.<br/>The game is of medium complexity. There are one additional expansion set, Modern Naval Battles III, available. The one major issue with the game is the lack of weapon cards (torpedoes) available for the submarines. This expansion set focuses on campaign play and adds new ships and action cards.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Modern Naval Battles<br/><br/><br/>Other Expansions:<br/><br/>    Modern Naval Battles III<br/><br/><br/>",

Robb Stark marches on Lannister holdings, even as Tywin Lannister menaces the Riverlands from Harrenhal. To the south, Stannis Baratheon lays siege to Storm's End and Renly Baratheon calls upon the might of Highgarden to break his brother's armies. Yet in the midst of these kingly conflicts, another drama unfolds far to the north. From Castle Black, the Night's Watch rides forth in a great ranging and ventures beyond the Wall to confront Mance Rayder and brave the fury of the wild. If they fail to defend the realms of men, the consequences could reach far beyond the icy heights of the Wall.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones: The Card Game &ndash; For Family Honor is an upcoming Chapter Pack in the &quot;War of Five Kings&quot; cycle that continues to follow the storyline of A Clash of Kings. Throughout this Chapter Pack, you'll find plenty of new cards that support the major themes of the cycle. New Kings and Crowns invite you to stake your own claim to the Iron Throne, even as other cards heighten the importance of loyal cards: the characters you can truly trust, the locations that would never fall, the events and tactics that you utterly control. Finally, For Family Honor introduces iconic characters to join the game, including Ser Edmure Tully, a House Tyrell version of Renly Baratheon, and Hot Pie.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to fill your region with powerful beasts, while stealing and smiting those of your opponents.<br/><br/>Battles takes all the physical pieces from the core game and gives you an adrenaline-filled competitive way of playing with them. In Battles, skilful stacking is even more important, as disturbing the tower means Alberick, the spirit of the volcano, rains down fiery lava damage on your beasts (and your beasts only)! So build carefully, or see your lead evaporate with one ill-timed collapse...<br/><br/>Primal Power enters your world though a deck of 16 unique NFC Battle Cards. Each player wields a hand of these cards, enabling them to invoke a whole host of weird and wonderful effects on the digital realm. Some are focused on attack, some will aid in defence, and some will manifest in much more random ways&hellip; Each Divine Creator chooses a digital avatar in the form of a Guardian. Guardians manifest your will in the form of lightning bolts, tidal waves and dirty great lumps of earth. They also have special, customisable powers that modify the game in interesting, strategic ways...<br/><br/>There is also a Legendary Beast: MAGMAAARGH the Cantakerous, an extremely grumpy old dragon with a bit of a beer gut and a ridiculous name. MAGMAAARGH brings an additional layer of strategy to the game once summoned by his special card. He's worth *a lot* of points if you have him in your region, but in order to keep him you'll need to feed him Star Energy. Leave him hungry for too long though, or let him take too much damage, and that temper will flair up and things might just turn ugly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He is a very large &ldquo;miniature&rdquo;, falling into the rare class of Gigantic Creatures.<br/>But you will get not only  the Devil, but also 3 bases of demonic Legion, another big farmhouse, ruin miniatures, a selection of tiles for flying and destroyed areas, some special GC dice, stat cards, and a scenario book. <br/>   Naturally the Devil fills an entire hex, and as he needs to empty a new one before he can move into it, he&rsquo;s great at destroying terrain and smashing aside whatever stands in his way. This is done with the special GC dice that have some different results from normal combat dice, including the entertainingly titled STOMP! More importantly, each of these results applies to all units in an area, instead of being allocated to individual units like normal combat. We&rsquo;ll get to combat in its own update. Suffice to say here that the Devil excels at killing everything.<br/>    When it comes to taking hits, all Gigantic Creatures suffer damage like multi-wound heroes. This means that a result that would kill a normal man will only remove 1 wound. And the Devil has 10. And he can only lose a maximum of 3 per turn. And that&rsquo;s after he ignores the first one because he gets an automatic shield result every time he is attacked.<br/><br/>",

Although the Conan game has a mountain of models, there were two specific things that some people (including us) felt we missed out. The first of these was villager models. Some Conan scenarios include villagers, and we provided tokens for them which work fine. But with all the other great models in the game, we thought that it would be even better if we could replace them with actual miniatures. So this is what we&rsquo;ve done.<br/><br/>The other missing miniature was the winged ape. This has become something of a celebrity in its absence, as well as a bit of a running gag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a second Adventure Module for Cutthroat Caverns that uses a 'choose-your-own-path' style book to overlay an exciting new dimension to the game. The first such book was introduced in the boxed expansion, Tombs and Tomes, and features a fun narrative in which characters have to make real decisions that will affect the outcome of the story, solve riddles, overcome traps, encounter familiar creatures in a whole new way -- and, importantly, will face new winning and/or losing conditions. The result is a slightly longer, but richer gaming experience.<br/><br/>The book comes with two all new Encounter Cards exclusive to this adventure, but fully usable in the core game as well. The Encounters are new 'Boss' type encounters that, when discovered in the core game's Encounter deck, will do something 'bad' to the party before being placed at the bottom of the stack to be faced as the final encounter.<br/><br/>The Adventures:<br/>Savage Arena...<br/>You and your party of adventurers are chained, neck to neck, as prisoners of Big Boss Gronkk. You must work together to survive a lethal coliseum of traps and monsters before the strongest among you earns the right to win your freedom.<br/><br/>Errand of Evil...<br/>Your mysterious employer sends you to the stronghold of his rival to steal everything you can, for among his treasures is the one relic that can restore his misshaped body. The relic can change form, so you need to bring all you find -- but will his secret be your undoing?<br/>(NOTE: If you can avoid it, don't read the Encounter card before the end of this book - for maximum fun and impact!!)<br/><br/>The book utilizes materials from the base game as well as Tombs and Tomes and Relics and Ruins. All materials are provided in the book if you do not own those expansions. (Copy the cards before playing - especially for Errand of Evil)<br/><br/>",

Each card grants the Survivor a particular Skill, usually associated with a specific weapon. When the Survivor reaches the next Danger Level, he gets to choose one of his normal Skills, and also one more Experience Card.<br/><br/>When you start a new Mission with that same Survivor, your Equipment and Experience reset normally, but Experience Cards are only discarded if the Survivor is eliminated for good. The Survivor begins the mission with his Blue Level Skill, as well as all Skills granted by the Experience Cards he gained so far. As he gains experience again, he will not get more Experience Cards for reaching a Danger Level he's already reached before. However, if he reaches a level he had not reached in a previous mission, he again chooses a new Experience Card.<br/><br/>This means that, in a normal game, a Survivor can only accumulate a maximum of 3 Experience Cards (one for the first time he reaches Yellow, one for the first time he reaches Orange, and one for the first time he reaches Red). However, if you play in Ultrared Mode, you might be able to gain even more Experience Cards as you reach levels beyond Red!<br/><br/>If you play with Resurrection Mode, the Zombivor version retains all Experience Cards as long as you're not eliminated. However, in subsequent mission you'll have to start as a Zombivor to keep the Experience Cards.<br/><br/>(While this deck was available separately it was also part of the Ultimate Survivors #1 box)<br/><br/>",

Each turn, they place tiles to enlarge the cathedral and create areas of a single color while placing builder pawns to gain advantages and control areas. In addition, players execute orders to move or remove builders, increase abilities, block spaces, or tear down previously built cathedral parts. There are four tile colors in the game. Players' goals are to create the largest possible areas representing a single color and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.<br/><br/>Basilica designed by Łukasz M. Pogoda was first published in 2010 and further developed by the expansion Festum Fatuorum in 2012. The new edition by Portal Games includes the base game with a revamped game board, premium custom-made wooden pawns depicting medieval characters, and the expansion, offering players a premium full game experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One to four players, each representing an ancient city/civilization thought to have been lost to the world, are now on Rome's doorstep vying for a place in the prestigious arena games.<br/><br/>Players have a very clear objective: Eliminate the opponent's champion. Champions start the game in the arena but are inactive and defenseless. They will not fight until the crowd is behind them. Each player takes turns drawing, playing and moving gladiators from their &quot;hand&quot; and assisting them with tactic chips.<br/><br/>Based on opponent's moves and play style, each person will need to adjust their strategies. Defend your champ, take over and hold the crowd favor areas, assault opponent's champion, cover deployment zones, eliminate tacticians to reduce enemy options, fight beasts to gain crowd favor, the list of tactical possibilities is endless.<br/><br/>Hoplomachus combines combat, tactics, chip (units) management, level progression (though crowd favor system), team play, player vs board, and so much more.<br/><br/>Legends of the Sand: These 15 chips include all new Gladiators AND Tactics for each of the 5 Cities that Hoplomachus has to offer. These will be the start of what will be the 'customizable' portion of the game. Gladiator and Tactic selections will be made before each battle begins!<br/><br/>Carpe Venatus!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>TO THE BRIDGE!, the ninth &ldquo;action pack&rdquo; for Advanced Squad Leader, focuses on the 1942 Japanese invasion of Burma and the crushing Allied defeat and retreat to India. Beginning with the December 1941 invasion of Thailand and ending with the disaster at the Sittang bridge in February 1942, TO THE BRIDGE! is the first of three planned Action Packs covering the campaign from the Japanese invasion to the Allied liberation. TO THE BRIDGE! features Japanese infantry forces against Commonwealth infantry supported by light armored cars and carriers: Burma Rifles, Gurkha Rifles, Indian Brigade, and various frontier forces. Plus a Japanese seaborne assault opposed by the Thai army supported by the Pattani Provinicial Police Force and units from the military academy.<br/><br/>TO THE BRIDGE! also includes optional &ldquo;Australian Balancing (Bidding) System&rdquo; (ABS) provisions for each scenario.

Shard Eaters are elementals with an appetite for raw power. Sunshards are a delicacy to the Eaters, and each shard consumed allows them directly to harness its pure energy. The Eaters then use the imbued light of the sunshards to repel the corrupting curse that is spreading throughout the Valley of Life.<br/><br/>The Shard Eater advancement has the lowest mana cost for a growth symbol in the game, allowing you to add a growth to your deck as early as the first turn. However, this early power comes with a longterm price of lowering your mana during future turns while it&rsquo;s in your field.

Conan, attacked at his house by the monster, wounded it mortally and pursued it into the square, where it rushed to its master, the Kordafan, and fell dead. The frenzied mob tore the Kordafan to pieces&hellip;&quot;<br/><br/>&ndash; Robert E. Howard, Appendices volume 2<br/><br/>The Overlord gains more of both swords and sorcery with the Kushite Witch Hunters. Its four distinctive miniatures, each of which comes with its corresponding unit tile, allow you to push the heroes to their limits with powerful spells and precision strikes.<br/><br/>As a powerful spell caster, the sorcerous Shubba can loose your vengeance upon the heroes with any spells you give him, and his concentration ability ensures that he'll never find his spell casting hindered by the heroes' interference.<br/><br/>Shubba's allies, Shafiah and Ghayoor, are skilled warriors whose attacks of two orange dice are deadlier than the heroes might expect. This is because they both have the precision strike ability which effectively allows their attacks to ignore the first point of a hero's armor. Meanwhile, their loyalty to the sorcerer is unquestionable, as both are willing to sacrifice themselves in his defense, if such a sacrifice should ever prove necessary.<br/><br/>The deadliest of the expansion's three melee warriors, Afari pairs his solid defense and brutal attack with the ability to counterattack. Whenever he faces one of the heroes' melee attacks, Afari can immediately retaliate by attacking with a single red die. While this attack isn't as powerful as a swing from his wicked blade, it still benefits from Afari's precision strike ability, and he can perform this counterattack multiple times in a turn&mdash;if the heroes are foolish enough to test themselves against his skills!<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     4 Plastic miniatures (Bodyguard (Shafiah), Afari the warlord, Bodyguard (Ghayoor), Shubba the sorceror)<br/>     4 Game tiles (non-lingual)<br/><br/><br/>Ageera appears in the Conan: Collectors Box.<br/><br/>",

These artefacts will now be corrupting your continent decks and have a chance to appear as cards are drawn. On top of their standard value and a domain, each object has a power that varies depending on which god it&rsquo;s dedicated to. You can use these powers to bolster your museum's Domain Collections or hamper your rivals.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not all however. Possessing these relics will cause you to earn &ldquo;Occult&rdquo; points. The player with the most Occult points at the end of game will score bonus victory points. On top of that, as soon as you gain 6 Occult points, you get to draw a &ldquo;Disciple of the Occult&rdquo; secret objective card (much like your Patron card) which will give you a chance to score even more points at the end of the game! Sounds good right? But beware, the Old One&rsquo;s power comes at a price&hellip;<br/><br/>Playing the most powerful relics of a value of 5 will attract the eye of the terrifying beings that linger behind the veil of reality, with calamitous effects for your museum. These cards act as a sort of double-edged sword. Using Dagon's most powerful relic for example will flood your opponents' galleries, rending parts of them unusable. However, the Old One will return to take his due, and some of your gallery space will also disappear into the depths...<br/><br/>The expansion contains over 40 new components, including object, character, Notoriety and Event cards as well as some different effects tokens, all contained within its own expansion box.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This would normally be used to ensure that Parasites do not land in a space with Humans.  Of course, if this item is in the hands of the Host or an infected player, it can be used a little more devlishly.<br/><br/>1 Sniper Rifle:  This ranged weapon allows players to target Parasites and Players up to 2 rooms away, and thus it is a very powerful weapon to defend yourself or attack another without the need to move to a more dangerous location.<br/><br/>1 Antidote: this is a one-time use injection. If this card is traded to an infected player, the player will be cured of the infection and be turned back to Human.  This can be very dramatic, since it can give a human team on the brink of defeat a way to fight back.<br/><br/>",

As the Black Templars attempt to recover the sacred relics of St. Camila, an Eldar raiding party from the craftsworld of Saim-Hann makes a desperate gambit to steal these relics for their own unknowable devices! War has overtaken the planet: the only question that remains is which side will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>Like the other War Packs of the Planetfall cycle, The Final Gambit adds new significance to planet type symbols beyond merely achieving victory. Every faction has its reasons for waging war in the Traxis sector, and when you fight according to those goals, you may find greater success than you would otherwise. Here, you&rsquo;ll also find a new Eldar warlord with her unique signature squad, as well as fifty-one other cards (three copies each of seventeen distinct cards) to enhance the armies of the other factions. Walk the secret Paths of the Eldar and make your gambit for victory!<br/><br/>",

The fourth Bohnanza expansion from Lookout Games (in a limited sales edition of 2500 pieces) puts you in the Bohnreich!  Plantations, villages, cities, fortresses -- and 3 to 5 generals, who want to bring these under their control.<br/><br/>The Bohnanza base game is needed. Using new cards in Bohnaparte, the Bohnreich is laid out; each player receives counters of his own color; and play then loosely follows that of normal Bohnanza, with a small difference: earned bean coins are not saved but are used to finance your conquests throughout the Bohnreich. At the end it matters only who has the largest part of the Bohnreich under control. Battling is accomplished using the numbers on the bean cards, which gives new significance to the formerly &quot;weaker&quot; bean types. Designer Hanno Girke describes the expansion set as &quot;Bohnanza meets Risk&quot;.<br/><br/>Includes 33 cards, 60 game markers, and rules. Graphics by Marcel-Andre Casasola Merkle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry is for deluxe edition of Tiny Epic Western, which also includes Kickstarter Deluxe Promo Pack.<br/><br/><br/>HOOK: Poker meets worker-placement<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION: The West is growing day by day, and you&rsquo;re looking to stake your claim. To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner! Yippie kay yay a!<br/><br/>",

The prosecution needs to prove Carmine's Mafia connections by revealing these Dossier cards while avoiding the powerful criminal activities such as &quot;Jury Tampering&quot; and &quot;Swim with the Fishes&quot; that the defense has shuffled into the deck.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes turns drawing, playing and moving gladiators from their &quot;hand&quot; and assisting them with tactic chips.<br/><br/>Based on opponent's moves and play style, each person will need to adjust their strategies. Defend your champ, take over and hold the crowd favor areas, assault opponent's champion, cover deployment zones, eliminate tactictions to reduce enemy options, fight beasts to gain crowd favor, the list of tactical possibilities is endless.<br/><br/>Hoplomachus combines combat, tactics, chip (units) management, level progression (though crowd favor system), team play, player vs board, and so much more.<br/><br/>Beast &amp; Master: These 10 chips include an all new Gladiator and Beast for each of the 5 Cities that Hoplomachus has to offer.

Despite a strong offense, the Marauders have a less than stellar defense. Coach Frank Merrill states, &quot;We&rsquo;re going to put up a heckuva fight this year. We don&rsquo;t have much support in the air department so you&rsquo;ll see a lot of emphasis on the ground game.&quot; Star running back Hugh Mungus commented: &quot;Just give me the ball.

Despite a weak offense, the Nighthawks have the #2 defense. Coach Mack Aroni states, &quot;Sometimes I get a little cheesed off at our half baked offense, but our defense? Boy are deze guys good. No meatballs on that squad.&quot; Defensive end Bubba Ganooj commented: &quot;We can take whatever the opposition dishes out. I&rsquo;ll mash up anybody who gets in my way.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Rochester Rockets - The Rockets enter the league with the 20th ranked running game and the 3rd ranked passing game. Despite an uneven offense, the Rockets do have a top ten defense. Coach Red Glare states, &quot;We have a really explosive passing game. Our new quarterback can really launch it.&quot; Quarterback Rocco Gibralter commented: &quot;Thanks to me and my arm, we have a pretty solid offense this year.

Many of the characters work well together, gaining greater efficiency the more of their allies enter play. Other cards provide Miskatonic University players reasons to focus solely upon the heroic investigators, rather than pairing them up with another faction and compromising their ideals. Altogether, Seekers of Knowledge looks to sound the bell upon a brand new school year full of optimism.<br/><br/>Finally, Seekers of Knowledge is more than another deluxe expansion; it's the first in a new release model for Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game. The game will shift away from monthly Asylum Packs to the release of a deluxe expansion (each with 165 cards, three copies each of fifty-five individual cards) once every four months.<br/><br/>",

In March 1944, the American 5037th Composite Unit (Provisional), part of the famous &quot;Merrill's Mauraders&quot;, attempted to block the advance of Japanese units, who were threatening the flank of the Chinese 22nd division. In the course of the battle from March 28 to April 9, the American unit was completely surrounded by Japanese forces in the small 6 hut village (called &quot;Maggot Hill&quot; by the Americans). The vicious fighting under horrendous conditions ultimately produced nearly 400 casualties for each side. However, the Japanese advance was halted.<br/><br/>Contents include a full color 16.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; Nhpum Ga mapsheet, 4 scenarios (A115, A116, A117, A118) and a 3 page background article.

On Atlantis, as new leaders rise up to answer the challenge, new powers also emerge to save the isle.

Can you break her curse and recruit her to your side?<br/>     The Harpies&rsquo;s Lair, in which three monstrous, birdlike creatures steal the resources and workers you need to build the Cosmic Gate. Can you defeat the Harpies and win back the treasures found in their lair?<br/>     Between Scylla &amp; Charybdis, in which the monsters that have long doomed sailors leave their narrow straight and terrorize the shores of Atlantis.

The goal of the game is to build the most successful empire, and points are scored for (amongst other things) owned provinces, explored territories, diplomatic relations, victories in wars, and secret objectives that have been accomplished.<br/><br/>The board game is based on the famous strategy game series by Paradox Interactive and captures the heart and soul of the grandness that makes the computer game so magnificent.<br/><br/>Includes solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in &quot;rounds,&quot; with players taking turns to maneuver the ships in their fleets, attack opponent's ships, and defend their own fleet against enemy attack. A player's fleet is composed of randomly selected ships (Frigates, Destroyers, Battleships, Carriers, etc.) and boats (submarines), with varied attack/defense capabilities. At the end of each round, players receive points for each enemy vessel they have sunk. The game can end when a player achieves a specific point total, or when all opposing fleets are sunk.<br/>The game is of medium complexity. The one major issue with the game is the lack of weapon cards (torpedoes) available for the submarines. This expansion set focuses on additional Action Cards, ship cards, and an &quot;Air Module.&quot; The Air Module adds squadrons of aircraft to the game.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Modern Naval Battles<br/><br/><br/>Other Expansions:<br/><br/>    Modern Naval Battles II: The Campaign Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Thus you need to work together against this &quot;bot&quot;, while keeping in mind that in the end, there is only one winner &mdash; the richest bandit, of course.<br/><br/>In the Cheyenne expansion, Cheyenne has traded her gun for a bow. Beware, as she is a better shot with her arrows, especially as they are poisoned. When Cheyenne uses her bow, all the targeted bandits receive a poisoned arrow. If they are not able to pick up an antidote before the end of the game, they automatically lose, no matter how rich they are.<br/><br/>Cheyenne moves faster than any other bandit. When she ends movement at a location where there are other bandits, she takes one purse from each of them.

It is named after the game TAMSK and offers new ways to play GIPF.  The TAMSK-potential can grant its owner an extra move during a turn.<br/><br/>A clarifying note from designer Kris Burm about the GIPF Project expansion Set #1 and the TAMSK potentials included with the TAMSK game:<br/><br/>As you maybe know, enclosed in the TAMSK box are 3 white and 3 black TAMSK-potentials. These are samples. You need a minimum of 3 potentials of each color to get a feeling of how they change a game of GIPF. The GIPF Project Expansion Set #1 contains 12 TAMSK-potentials; 6 potentials per color is the standard number to play with. The kit is meant to give players who like playing with the potentials the possibility to get more potentials without needing to buy a second game of TAMSK.

She's here to claim her liberty and gain respect by spilling zombie blood anywhere she chooses to call home.  She speaks freely about her past to any survivor she meets and improvises according to their reaction.

The outside threats led quickly to the establishment of the army as a political power base; the day of the military dictator was at hand, and the Republic was entering its death throes.<br/><br/>(from the publisher)<br/><br/>",

Follow the recommended command structure below, or just go with whatever works. There is no correct or incorrect approach as battlefield conditions make for very fluid situations.

In addition, it comes packed with a variety of mini-expansions that can be played with your other Steam maps. New Action Tiles &mdash; The Surveyor, The Midnight Express, The Local Payoff, and Corporate Charity &mdash; can be added to your games to change the dynamic of previous maps, while the Gray Market Goods expansion adds a level of mystery to your goods supply and creates dual goods.<br/><br/>Steam: Map Expansion #5 includes the previous mini-expansions that were found only as promos: Demanding Suppliers, City Growth Special Contracts, and the Five Way Town as well as more track tiles, new complex hard curve tracks, and a Universal Display board to be placed beside your expansion maps rather than having to play your expansion on top of the original board.<br/><br/>Finally, in addition to a box that's designed to hold all other Steam expansions, Steam: Map Expansion #5 includes an updated omnibus of all the previous expansions' rules with more in-depth examples.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since before Dark Stone was even discovered in the hills around Brimstone, Prospectors were a common sight around town and out on the trails; mining in the hills and panning for gold in the streams and rivers. When the Dark Stone boom hit, their number multiplied... by the hour.  Prospectors from all around flooded the area, looking to get in on a piece of the action. Once the town exploded and the portals starting tearing open, most fled in terror. Those that didn&rsquo;t either had nowhere to go or were too stubborn to let any creatures and demons from some other world steal their claim!<br/><br/>The Prospector is a new Hero Class that can be added to your games of Shadows of Brimstone. He is a strong close combat fighter and can absorb a lot of damage before being KO&rsquo;d. He also is the best around for collecting up Gold and Dark Stone, as his abilities allow him to earn double the amount found on most occasions.  His only real drawbacks are in having low Initiative and not being allowed to use Guns or Tech.  Includes Male and Female Prospector miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Prospector Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Prospector Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.<br/><br/>",

When drawing from the Encounter Bag, heroes will have a random chance of being invited into a guild. Each guild give you new powers and abilities that take your adventuring to a whole new level, but each guild has its own requirements which you must meet to use these abilities. These requirements are usually that you must have certain types of equipment equipped to benefit from being in the guild. This adds a new level of strategy when choosing what you will go into battle with. You may want to forgo using your awesome artifact sword to gain an extra die by using your Monk ability, or weild two axes with your Barbarian ability.<br/><br/>",

Gameplay-wise, many new flip and destruction effects enable many new synergies, also with cards from the base game.<br/><br/>In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.<br/><br/>Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.<br/><br/>Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is in fact a nearly totally different game, just sharing the included maps and counters (except the strategical ones).<br/><br/>The  game is from the series Cry Havoc with the same flavor of skirmish battle plus a grand strategical game.<br/><br/>On the strategical game, you move your armies (not always known) on the map of Palestine and then resolve combat and siege on the Cry Havoc boards.<br/><br/>There is also a roleplaying system included where you create your character (crusader or sarracen), start with a small castle and try to fight, negociate or wed your way through those dangerous times. The roleplaying system uses Cry Havoc and Siege for battle, but adds hit points, several attributes (diplomacy, honor, charms) and the possibility to advance all members of your troops in experience, from a tiny peasant to a strong sergeant or even be appointed knight. A very interesting addition to the standard game.<br/><br/>You require Cry Havoc, Siege, Le Château des Templiers and La Cité médiévale fortifiée if you want to play the strategical game.<br/><br/>Part of the Cry Havoc series.<br/><br/>",

The three modules are as follows:<br/><br/>1) Royal Decrees<br/><br/>This module offers ten cards which show a royal decree. These decrees can be fulfilled in a similar manner as the Public Objectives from the base game. The difference is that the decrees are fulfilled in game and can only be fulfilled by one player.<br/><br/>2) The Councilmen<br/><br/>This module adds a new kind of character who is offering a new symbol and bonus accordingly. If a Councilman becomes a citizen of your tableau, each Legal Text symbol is worth 1 point for every set of discounts of all four colors.<br/><br/>3) The Mystery<br/><br/>This module adds four new buildings to the game. These buildings not only offer the usual victory points, but also serve as one symbol of your choice for game end scoring.<br/><br/>",

Contains expansions Dangers &amp; Muisca and Dragons, Treasures &amp; Mysteries.<br/><br/>New challenges await you during your journey: swamps full of crocodiles, rushing rivers, a local tribe, dangerous dragons and areas covered with thick fog. You will also encounter mysterious temples and treasures that you can collect!<br/><br/>Both extensions consist of many modules that you can freely combine with each other!<br/><br/>The Treasures module provides new treasure chest tokens that may be spent to move your explorer up to 2 spaces. However, if you collect 4 treasure chest tokens, you win the game!<br/><br/>The Dragons module contains 4 dragon pawns each in different colors corresponding to the cards' colors. Dragons block the route of the expedition and do not allow passage in their vicinity. However, once you play a card whose color matches the dragon, you may move the creature one space, potentially moving it out of your way and blocking your opponents!<br/><br/>The Mysteries module introduces new, smaller terrain tiles with dark mists. They are placed onto normal terrain tiles to add areas of mysterious fog. Once a player stops next to a mystery tile, it's flipped over and the layout underneath becomes visible.<br/><br/>But it is not everything. Various new dangers await you on the terrain tiles.<br/><br/>Dangerous places are places with a skull symbol. They are found on many new tiles. You may move through these spaces, but you may not end your turn on them.<br/><br/>Mountains pass tiles include a narrow pass surrounded by impassable mountain terrain, allowing you to create their own shortcuts or bottlenecks if you wish (they also can contain a skull symbol).<br/><br/>The tiles with Water Vortex feature arrows that push your explorer one space further if you complete a card&rsquo;s movement on them.<br/><br/>Swamp tiles require you to play any card with a strength equal to the number of crocodile symbols on those tiles. So to enter a tile with one crocodile, you must play a single machete, paddle, or card with one coin. <br/> Shrines change the rules of the game a bit. They are placed out along the route to El Dorado, and players must stop at each one and collect all four artifacts before you can enter the gate to El Dorado and win the game.  Rather than be a simple race to the finish line, this forces you to stop at four checkpoints along the way.<br/><br/>Finally, the Muisca tribe is a deck of 8 cards that is placed next to the market board. Two cards are drawn from the top of the pile and displayed next to the market, increasing the card purchase options from 6 to 8. When you draw one card into your hand, you can play it and discard it as usual, or set it aside (max. 2 Muisca cards) and keep it for next turn. Thanks to this, you can use the saved Muisca card exactly when you need it most.<br/><br/>It's high time to start a new adventure full of dangers. Who will reach the gates of El Dorado first?<br/><br/>",

In the game, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies' supply lines and their forces will surrender!<br/><br/>During play, you control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces. Each major power has a unique set of cards with which to marshal its forces, which are represented by wooden army and navy pieces. After twenty rounds of play, the team with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>Quartermaster General: Air Marshal adds two entirely new mechanics to Quartermaster General.<br/><br/>Bolster cards are played directly from your hand at a time specified on the card, adding a whole new element of surprise and challenge to the game.<br/><br/>Your Air Forces provide an additional dimension to battle. Air Force pieces are deployed to the board through play of a Deploy Air Force card.

Though academic by nature, these crafty and resourceful medical men use their wits and experience to learn the weakness of their enemies, and then cut them to pieces in a fight. While keeping a steady hand and cool head under pressure, a Doc is an expert at bandaging up wounded comrades and cutting off unwanted growths... wherever they may sprout.<br/><br/>The Frontier Doc is a strong support character with the ability and resources to keep the Hero Posse in tip-top shape when it comes to Wounds, Injuries, and Mutations. Starting with the Doc&rsquo;s Bag, the Frontier Doc is never short on Bandages, and even gains a fantastic bonus when using them. His Field Surgery ability also allows for some much needed Injury/Mutation relief, without the need to find a Doc in Town or worry about it being botched! Of course the Frontier Doc is also no slouch when it comes to battle. Though he doesn&rsquo;t start with any weapons by default (just using his basic Combat to Attack), he can become a powerful hand-to-hand fighter, and retains the ability to use Ranged Weapons as needed.<br/><br/>Includes Male and Female Frontier Doc miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Frontier Doc Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Frontier Doc Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.<br/><br/>",

Players build shoreside forts to defend their colonists from attack and to score points. Forts allow you to put colonists in play, which in turn can safely build ships and buildings which provide abilities and points. Attacking allows you to chip away at your opponent's fort while gaining cubes which are used to build forts of your own. Your goal is to score 20 coins or get all of your colonists in play!<br/><br/>The anniversary edition of Island Siege contains:<br/><br/>Components and rules for up to four players! The original two-player game included red and yellow colonists. The Anniversary Edition also includes green and blue colonists as well as additional coins, cubes and other components necessary for four players.<br/><br/>The Ramparts and Coquina expansions from the first edition are now included with the base game.<br/><br/>Deluxe two-layer player imperial boards. The new imperial boards includes an island with a quarry to store accumulated stones and a port to dock your ship. The boards will be printed on a thick cardboard. Indentations keep pieces from shifting.<br/><br/>Two sets of Kickstarter-exclusive metal Campaign Coins (26 total)! These metal coins will only be part of the Kickstarter experience. The retail version of the game will include cardboard punch board coins.<br/><br/>",

Players can add 1, or 2, or all of them to their game:<br/><br/>Atlantikwall: This module lets one player play the German side on any existing Battle Map. The German player can transform a 2-player game into a head-to-head confrontation, or be added to any group of players (even solo). Includes a full set of unique German Specialists, German Items and Decorations, a set of Red, White &amp; Black dice, a player aid, a Resource card, and some additional Allied Specialists and Items.<br/><br/>Think of the German player as the Battle Map itself. It is up to him or her to &ldquo;activate&rdquo; some of the features of the Map, and to make life difficult for the Allies. He plays like all the other players, rolling dice to gather resources, and spending those resources to recruit Specialists and find Items. The main difference is that the German does not move: instead, he uses his Courage to draw cards from the &quot;Decorations&quot; deck, which give him special one-time abilities.<br/><br/>Battle Conditions: This deck of 50 cards reflects the unpredictability of battlefield conditions, whether it&rsquo;s from nature itself or the hazards of combat. Drawn at the start of each turn, they affect all players and supersede Sector attributes, offering a variety of effects like friendly fire or smoke cover. Some are good, some are bad, and some offer opportunities to be seized at the right moment. Beware of plane crashes, supply trucks catching fire or loss of morale!<br/><br/>Badges: A reprint of the 1st edition hard-to-find mini-expansion, consisting of 10 cards. Badges can be drawn at random by a Unit that obtains a &quot;Battle Cry&quot; RWB. They have a one-time effect (much like Items), usually helping their Unit obtain RWB bonuses or Awards more easily.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It has been produced in 4500 copies and here's the rules for this character:<br/><br/>4 AP - This specialist has done his work years ago; he talked to the builders and home owners and convinced them to adopt a fire security plan. On his advice smoke detectors and smoke exhausts have been installed, and emergency exits have been planned and marked clearly. Now these measures prove their worth: People are warned and can move out via marked escape routes, and smoke clears off the building.<br/><br/>Prevent/De-Smoke: Move a smoke token anywhere on the board for 1 AP per space. Movement must be on the shortest route towards nearest exterior door, playerʼs choice if alternative routes exist; Smoke passes closed interior doors at no extra cost. Smoke vanishes when outside the building. Moved smoke ignites immediately if adjacent to fire; if it moves on top of other smoke, it becomes fire.<br/>Prevent/Escape: Move a POI token (only if &quot;?&quot; side up) anywhere on the board for 2 AP per space. Movement must be on the shortest route towards nearest exterior door, playerʼs choice if alternative routes exist. POIs can open doors on their way for 2 AP; they will not use breached walls, ladders etc. (they use the escape route &quot;as marked&quot;). POIs moved outside of the building (=coordinate area) are revealed.

In this game, each player fields one of the hero teams, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards.

But this is Munchkin, so the solution we chose was to create a lot of really overpowered new cards. Why be a Super-Munchkin when you can be an Ultra-Munchkin? If a Half-Breed isn't enough, you can be a 1/3-Breed. And if a single Cheat card doesn't do it for you, you can Cheat With Both Hands!<br/><br/>There are also a lot more monster enhancers... and ITEM enhancers, too. There are several new low-level monsters to help you get those easy kills. Unless somebody takes that Sock Puppet and turns it into the Ultra-Rare Extremely Sneaky Sock Puppet With Extra Cheese . . .<br/><br/>Munchkin till you drop! Munchkin Blender -- just add players!<br/><br/>This is an expansion, not a stand-alone game. It is meant to be combined with at least one Munchkin game, and preferably two or more, with or without other supplements.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOtherThis set was updated as part of The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover but was never reprinted. Many of the updated cards are available, however, via Munchkin: Go Up a Level.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>This set is permanently out of print and has been superseded by Munchkin 7: Cheat With Both Hands, which has all the same cards but with the fantasy Munchkin color scheme.<br/><br/>",

When the word came out about the island sinking two destroyers and inflicting hundreds of casualties, it gave a nation inspiration and seemed to teach the Japanese that the Americans were not as &lsquo;soft&rsquo; as they anticipated.<br/><br/>But the island did fall.<br/><br/>As a contrast, few studies of WWII in the Pacific will even mention the Battle of Peleliu, an island of marginal value, which might not have been attacked at all, except those in charge expected it to be so easy. Major General William Rupertus, USMC - commander of 1st Marine Division - predicted the island would be secured within four days. The five battleships bombarding the beaches complained that they had &ldquo;run out of targets&rdquo; after a few hours. Both were very wrong. Due to Japan's well-crafted fortifications and stiff resistance, the battle lasted over two months, and has the highest US casualty rate for any battle in the entire Pacific war. (You&rsquo;ve heard of Tarawa and Saipan and Okinawa...and this was worse?) Against the Odds Magazine issue #43 will be a two-game set, called Islands of the Damned. The issue has two separate solitaire games inside:<br/><br/>Given Up for Dead covers Wake Island and Utmost Savagery takes on the lesser-known invasion of Peleliu. Designer Steven Cunliffe tackles both battles with innovative systems that challenges players to mix boldness with good tactics. They must gain objectives but minimize casualties...as the historical commanders would have liked to do.<br/><br/>The Islands of the Damned comes with 175+ large, full-color 5/8&quot; diecut counters, and two separate 17&rdquo;x 22&rdquo; full color mapsheets.<br/><br/>You will be commanding the American forces in each game, challenged with doing far better than the historical outcomes. Can you save most of your troops from the Islands of the Damned?<br/><br/>",

In other words, the extension covers more, but still not all of the German offensive part of the battle.<br/><br/>",

This time it is Leopard tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Jaguar tank destroyers filling out their ranks. Its 1st Corps makes up part of NATO&rsquo;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) along with BAOR while its 2nd and 3rd Corps stands alongside the US 7th Army in NATO&rsquo;s Central Army Group (CENTAG).<br/><br/>This box contains 10 new scenarios.

Each player who contributed takes their Build markers back and flips them over to the 5VP side, then the Ward Tower card is placed next to the Monster row. For each completed Ward Tower, the cost to slay any monster is reduced by 1 Strength or 1 Magic as a player chooses.

As an Antiquitect, the machine binds you to the present while you travel back through time to ensure the technological advancements of the world remain intact.<br/><br/>The dark energy fueling the Ancient Machine, called Vesper, is growing out of control, eroding the timeline and causing it to crumble faster than ever. Restoring balance is imperative; to do so, the Antiquitects must break their oath and create the Forbidden Machines &ndash; powerful contraptions they were sworn to never bring into existence!<br/><br/>Legacy: Forbidden Machines uses all the familiar rules and components from Legacy: Gears of Time and includes a new set of technology cards, many of them introducing the Activation mechanism. Players with the most influence over these technologies can activate them once during their turn to perform powerful game effects such as drawing extra cards, swapping influence cubes, gaining an additional turn, and many more! Several of the fundamental technologies introduce When Established game effects, giving a little boost to hatching your time travel plans when these technologies are established. Prepare for a whole new level of depth and strategy while you travel back in time to Build Your Legacy.<br/><br/>Legacy is a Eurostyle tabletop card game packed with strategic depth, tactical control, and meaningful choices. Each game is played in a fixed number of turns and features an interesting blend of familiar mechanisms such as hand-management, area-control, variable player order, and scaling victory point rewards.<br/><br/>Legacy: Forbidden Machines is not a stand-alone game, it requires the base game (Legacy: Gears of Time) to play.<br/><br/>",

Pushing papers his entire career, Donald quite enjoyed his calm, ordered, life.  Governments might come and go, but whoever happened to be in power always needed the civil bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Of course, Don noticed things were amiss instead of her usual nodding off while he gave his daily briefing, his Minister tried to have him for a light snack.  Which was terribly improper and impolite, and he with some reluctance had to cave her head in with a bust of Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>Now the weighty responsibility of organizing a new society rests on Don's soldiers.  Things have to be done properly of course, ammo requisitions, food rationing, sleeping arrangements and the like.<br/><br/>He does quite enjoy executing the unruly zombie constituents though.<br/><br/>Frank<br/>Frank is a laid back guy that used to repossess stuff that folks didn't make their payments on.  In his case, his specialty was cars, usually getting into them and driving off before the previous owners even realized what was going on.<br/><br/>Not usually a dangerous job, Frank still found it best to carry some protection with him on the job - his handy baseball bat has since saved him countless times.  He's got a fondness for loud Hawaiian shirts, and may make small sidetrips into stores looking for fresh ones to add to his wardrobe.<br/><br/>Rob<br/>After decades as an anti-intrusion expert, testing security systems the world over, Rob reluctantly retired to a life of idyll on a sunny beach.  The boredom was just getting to him when the zombies appeared, exactly what he needed to make a new start.  Rob doesn't feel old at all.

Every time a new adventurer enters the game by crossing over one of the Anubis statues, the player chooses one of the remaining mission tiles associated with that statue and leaves the rest for the other players.<br/><br/>Mission tiles award many points, but you have to discard the required tiles.

Jaime Lannister has been freed from the prisons of Riverrun and makes his way towards King&rsquo;s Landing as a captive of Brienne of Tarth. Jon Snow has turned his cloak and fallen in with wildlings, while struggling to keep his true loyalties secret. Robb Stark fights to reclaim the loyalty of his bannermen, Daenerys Targaryen lays her plans to acquire an army of eunuchs, and Davos Seaworth returns to Dragonstone with a dream of assassinating the red priestess, Melisandre. Though the violence of the War of the Five Kings has paused, the intrigues and plots behind the scenes have never been stronger&mdash;or more dangerous.<br/><br/>Return to Westeros with Guarding the Realm, a new Chapter Pack of the Blood and Gold cycle! As with the other expansions of this cycle, you&rsquo;ll be drawn into the events of A Storm of Swords. Gold has always been important in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, and the ways you earn and spend it will soon become more plentiful than ever before, as you contend with the new bestow keyword and new economic options for every faction. And of course, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to add iconic characters to your deck, including Gilly, a new version of Melisandre, and a bastard son of House Botley, Wex Pyke.<br/><br/>",

One to four players, each representing an ancient city/civilization thought to have been lost to the world, are now on Rome's doorstep vying for a place in the prestigious arena games.<br/><br/>Players have a very clear objective: Eliminate the opponent's champion. Champions start the game in the arena but are inactive and defenseless. They will not fight until the crowd is behind them. Each player takes turns drawing, playing and moving gladiators from their &quot;hand&quot; and assisting them with tactic chips.<br/><br/>Based on opponent's moves and play style, each person will need to adjust their strategies. Defend your champ, take over and hold the crowd favor areas, assault opponent's champion, cover deployment zones, eliminate tactictions to reduce enemy options, fight beasts to gain crowd favor, the list of tactical possibilities is endless.<br/><br/>Hoplomachus combines combat, tactics, chip (units) management, level progression (though crowd favor system), team play, player vs board, and so much more.<br/><br/>Blade's Edge: These 10 chips include an all new Champion AND Equipment for each of the 5 Cities that Hoplomachus has to offer. These will be the start of what will be the 'customizable' portion of the game. Champion selection and Equipment option will be determined before each battle begins!<br/><br/>Carpe Venatus!<br/><br/>",

Still, the Rebellion survived, adapting their strategies, tactics, and equipment to deal with the oppressive environment. A crucial part of their survival was tinkering with their airspeeders to withstand the killing cold of Hoth. Soon, you'll be able to outfit your Rebels with the same speeders!<br/><br/>You may be battling the Empire on the frozen wastes of Hoth, or you may be fighting on the surface of any other planet, across the thousands of planets that make up the galaxy. No matter where you are, there's always good reason for you to get a little air superiority. The Star Wars: Legion &ndash; T-47 Airspeeder Unit Expansion adds one T-47 airspeeder miniature to your Rebel armies. Along with the beautifully sculpted, unpainted miniature, you'll find all the unit cards and upgrade cards that you need to make the T-47 airspeeder a crucial part of your battle for freedom.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It contains 24 small expansions for 24 different games, from 21 different publishers.<br/><br/>The game rules are not included, but are posted separately on the publisher's web site, on each day from December 1st to 24th.<br/><br/><br/>     Catan Scenarios: Santa Claus - Give Santa Claus 1 wool as a gift and you can set him on any landscape to get a gift token for any Settlement or town (or 2 tokens on Santa's house).  If you give him 2 wool, he can expel the robber.  2 gift tokens can be exchanged for a resource.<br/>     Fields of Arle: Advent Calendar Expansion - Included are 3 German language tiles giving the following Abilities:<br/>         Torfbrandziegelei: Immediately (and only after building this Peat-Fired Brickworks), per Shovel you have, you may exchange 1 Clay and 1 Peat for 1 Brick.<br/>         Torfkraftwerk: When you build the Peat Power Plant (and only that once), you can remove any number of Moor Tiles from your Home Board.  For each Moor Tile that you remove via this ability, you receive 2 Food.  (Also remove the Peat from the Moor Tiles, if any.)<br/>         Viersp&auml;nner: 1 Triple Space for Vehicle Actions (bigger version: 1 additional Single Space).  Like Double Spaces, the Triple Space cannot hold tiles that are smaller than the space (e.g. you cannot place Linen there).  In the bigger version, you can cover both the Triple and Single Space with one tile of size 4.<br/>    <br/>     Colt Express: North Pole Station - Included is a single Train Station card.  At the end of the game, each Bandit gives his highest purse to the imp.<br/>     Las Vegas: The Slot Machine - Included is a seventh casino.  The slot machine is treated as the seventh casino, using the same rules as the other casinos, with the following three exceptions:<br/>         Dice placed on the slot machine can show any number, 1-6.<br/>         A player must place all dice of one number.  However, the number on the dice must be different than the numbers already on the slot machine.<br/>         If two or more players have tied for the most dice placed on the slot machine, the winner is the player whose dice have the highest sum.  If that players&rsquo; dice have the same sum, the player with the higher single die wins first choice.<br/>    <br/>     Bohnanza: Bean Market - Included are 48 quarter bean dollar (QBD) tokens.  At any time on your turn, you can buy exactly one card from the bean market.  These rules apply:<br/>         The front card on the bean market costs 1 QBD, the second card is 2 QBDs, the third card is 3 QBDs, and so on.<br/>         During the &quot;Trading and Donating&ldquo; phase, you may trade the chance to buy a card from the bean market to another player.<br/>         When you buy a card from the bean market, you have to plant it immediately.<br/>    <br/>     Loony Quest: Special Item - Included are 1 alternative score token, 1 alternative character token, and 4 bonus tokens.  A player who has a Ski tile may discard it during the scoring step and place his score token behind the score token of the nearest opponent on the score track.<br/>     Doctor Panic: Klaus Santa - Included is an exclusive and limited patient card.<br/>     Rokoko: The Festivity Dresses - Included are 4 Festivity Dress tiles.  The Festivity Dresses are manufactured like the normal Dresses.  However, they cannot be sold.  Once made, immediately and only this once gain Prestige Points.<br/>     Zooloretto: Skunk - Included is a single animal tile of a skunk.  The first player who fills his 6-space enclosure takes the Skunk enclosure as a bonus.  Once owned pay 2 coins to discard all tiles of one animal type from your barn as an additional action.

        "description": "Take command of the farthest reaches of the galaxy with the Rebellion in the Rim campaign expansion for Star Wars: Armada! Imperial and Rebel forces clash in the galaxy&rsquo;s most lawless regions, where the spark of rebellion has grown into a flame that threatens to destroy the Empire. These distant reaches are filled with vital allies and resources that may mean the difference between victory and defeat in the war for the galaxy.<br/><br/>Rebellion in the Rim allows two to six players to participate in a campaign spanning multiple fleet battles in which you will create a custom commander to lead your task force. Victory depends on developing your commander&rsquo;s abilities and working closely with your team to determine which side will control the fate of the Rim!<br/><br/>Each battle fought influences the control of a location on the campaign map, which in turn can provide critical resources to the winning side. Players must be careful about their strategy however, as the fate of each ship during a battle can carry over into later games, possibly resulting in permanent damage or the loss of heroic crew.<br/><br/>The Campaign Expansion also features campaign-based objective cards that can alter the rules of the game during a battle or introduce unusual elements like exogorths and gravity rifts, and some scenarios will result in unbalanced fights between fleets at unequal power levels.  Rounding out the expansion is eight new squadron cards featuring characters like Sabine Wren, Iden Versio, Lando Calrissian, and IG-88B.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Star Wars: Armada Core Set is required to play.<br/><br/>",

So you have set off for the ruins of the once-great city of Framsburg, where it is said Wormsbane, the legendary sword of Fram son of Frumgar, lies entombed with its master. You hope that this enchanted blade will be enough to conquer Dagnir and leave Wilderland at peace.<br/><br/>But Framsburg has been abandoned for millennia and a feeling of dread consumes you as soon as you set foot in cursed city. Perhaps Fram's sword is not the only thing you'll find hidden in the depths of the city's ancient keep...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Here's a villager who just can't sleep at nighttime, try as he might. The good news is that in his hazy non-sleep time, he learns if one or both of his neighbors was up during the night doing something. He's not alert to know if it was indeed just one of them or both, and if only one of them which one it was, but he knows if someone was up and about during the night. Each night. It might be a werewolf out looking for prey. It might be the helpful Seer who is trying to find werewolves. Or it might be any other number of nighttime active roles in the game.<br/><br/>Much more alert at nighttime is the Beholder. She wakes up the first night and sees who the Seer is! What she ends up doing with that information is anyone's guess, but hopefully she'll figure out how to help the village and prevent the Seer from being lynched by the crazed mob.<br/><br/>And then there's everyone's favorite numerically-aware goth, The Count. He's got his spreadsheet open, and he's, well, counting all night. He knows how many werewolves are on each side of him in the village because he counted. &quot;One Werewolf. Two, two scary hairy werewolves...ah ha ha ha. Three, three three evil lycanthropic werewolves...mwa ha ha ha.&quot;<br/><br/>Possibly the most mysterious creature of the night is the Thing (that goes &quot;bump&quot; in the night). This nasty, furry, slightly smelly creature is helping out the village by bumping people in the wee hours of night. What will those people do with the information garnered from the Thing? What is the Thing's ultimate purpose?<br/><br/>But not everyone is out to help people at nighttime. There's a new werewolf in town, though she's a little...sleepy. The Dreamwolf takes it easy, not bothering to wake up with the other werewolves unless one of her sister werewolves is killed. Then she's all about taking out her revenge on the village. Watch out!<br/><br/>Finally, the most feared night monster of all, the Bogeyman, rounds out the roles in Night Terrors. Take too long at nighttime and the Bogeyman gets to kill someone. He kills indiscriminately, with a winning condition that totally fits his role.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neshilim, the deposed despot has spent recent months uncovering what led to his downfall. It was the damnable cult and their peasant rabble&rsquo;s lust for change. Change? For good? What a waste of breath! No peasant would even know what &ldquo;good&rdquo; meant... yet they were the reason his colleagues now hung skewered on tall spikes, and he was on the run.<br/><br/>The Northern Vidal-Sis, in the vast open marshlands - where no one wanted to be, let alone live - had long sustained a small population of bandits, vagabonds, dissidents, and rabble from surrounding nations. Now and again those nations&rsquo; armies would try to hunt down the worst of them, only to inevitably fall to the bog itself. Clearing up the area had never worked out, despite repeated efforts.<br/><br/>It had taken weeks of tracking through the vast, smelly swamp to figure out which obscure hideout housed the cult among the random bandit groups. But he finally found it, and it was time to send a pigeon to that irritating halfling. Soon the cult would pay - one bit at a time.<br/><br/>The Hideout provides 5 scenarios, which are rather different from the Abyssal Rift main campaign. Should you manage to beat the cult, you'll secure a safe haven, at least for a time, allowing recovery and restocking. But the cult is relentless, so one day you might find your hideout being overrun. Never feel safe; remain vigilant.<br/><br/>The Hideout first appeared in the Gamer's Bundle in 2016 and appeared as a separate boxed edition in 2018.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "West Wall is one of the Quad series that SPI published - a grouping of 4 different battles of a war, using a set of standard rules with a separate set of exclusive rules for each battle. This Quad contained the battles of:<br/><br/>    Arnhem (Operation Market-Garden)<br/>    Bastogne (Bulge)<br/>    Hurtgen Forest (Roer river valley)<br/>    Remagen (Rhine bridgehead)<br/><br/><br/>As wargames go, these series were relatively simple and quick to learn and to play - playability was favored over chrome and complexity. Arnhem was actually released separately as a full retail product with mounted board.<br/><br/>",

Much like the previously-seen Executioners, Champions score points for connected skulls of a certain type. Connected skulls are those either adjacent to the Champion or in an unbroken chain of the same type. Each Champion is associated with a different group from the basic game. Connect as many of that group&rsquo;s skulls as you can to get the full favor of each Champion.<br/><br/><br/>Champions is a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.<br/><br/>This expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the Champions. Champions want to be next to groups of their supporters.<br/><br/>Adding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.<br/><br/>",

You are collectively building this transmission line, so step by step your power companies will not need to pay connection costs anymore between Cuxhaven and Stuttgart. Sadly, the construction of this transmission line is paid with tax money, so you must pay taxes to supply these cities with electricity.<br/><br/>",

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space. But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place. The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins. This set includes dozens of different variant rules gathered over the years to keep the game interesting.<br/><br/>Tante Tarantel (Aunt Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Auntie's path to certain death!<br/><br/>",

He knew...deep in his mind he knew. But he was tired of looking to the past. The future was much more bloody, and much more glorious...<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Hoss, a single figure expansion for Tannh&auml;user.

In his veins flows the blood of the ancients, and he wields their powers with ease.<br/><br/>Hoss is a frighteningly powerful individual, able to bend time and space to his will. His manipulation of reality gives him superior agility and his clairvoyant nature gives him the edge in combat.

When the dead actually rose, Dick hid in one of his own custom-made coffins for three days hoping to ride it out.  Reemerging in to a dead world and realizing that since nobody died anymore he was now the most useless man on Earth, Dick threw himself into the business of survival with the same vigor he displayed in building his one-man empire of the dead.  Dick's knowledge of anatomy, embalming chemicals, and obscure undertaking lore will prove invaluable to any group he joins.<br/><br/>Leroy (The Accountant)<br/>&quot;Be sure to itemize that, won't you?&quot;<br/><br/>Leroy always knew he wanted to be an accountant, and he worked hard to make his dream a reality.  The day he became a Certified Public Accountant was the greatest of his life.  All was well in his world of spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations until he went on a mandatory teambuilding exercise set deep in the woods.  The teambuilding exercise involved paintball and copious amounts of alcohol, and Leroy woke the next morning with a hangover and a Mohawk.  Unfortunately, the zombies chose that day to attack.  The sole survivor of his slaughtered team, Leroy traded in his paintball rifle for the real thing.  His transformation from mild-mannered accountant to cold-blooded killer has been nothing short of astounding.<br/><br/>Paul (The Reality TV Star)<br/>&quot;Ever been kicked by a giraffe?  They're nasty critters.&quot;<br/><br/>Discovered by TV producers during $2 Pitcher Night at his local bowling alley, Paul hit the big-time in the African Safari Journey reality show, leading his team to a fourth place finish.  His star rose as he starred in the inevitable sequels and reunions.  When African Safari Journey was cancelled Paul hit the skids, and was working as a short-order cook at a a local diner when the dead rose.  Taking charge, he led his terrified patrons to safety.  Paul doesn't have many useful survival skills, but people respond to his leadership skills and irascible persona.  The world needs a hero, and Paul is glad to play the part!<br/><br/>",

It was given away, with rules only in Polish, to participants at a Neuroshima Hex tournament during the game convention Pionek in Gliwice, Poland 2007-12-08.<br/><br/>The Mad Bomber is a single unit which belongs to no player nor army.  He starts the game on the center of the map.  If he receives any damage during a battle, he immediately explodes in the same phase, causing a point of damage to units in all 6 neighboring hexes (except headquarters).  He then will be drawn as the first tile by the next player in turn order after the one who caused the bomber to be hit, and that player can deploy him on the map again.  If more than one player hits him in the same initiative phase of the battle, then he is knocked out of the game.<br/><br/>The Mad Bomber II works slightly differently: he starts the game off the board.  Either player can then, by discarding a tile in addition to their usual discard, place the Bomber anywhere on the board.  Once he is eliminated, he may then be placed again by either player, as previously detailed.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Neuroshima Hex! 3.0<br/><br/><br/>",

Foreel stated, &quot;When you got a runner like me you don't need no defense no how.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; San Antonio Scorpions - The Scorpions enter the league with the 13th ranked running game and the 11th ranked passing game. The Scorpions have the 14th ranked defense. Coach Sal Minella states, &quot;We don't believe in putting our eggs in one basket. We prefer to spread the eggs around.

One or the other or both may be added.<br/><br/>Epochs: The solar system begins with no planets. A player may, instead of moving a Matter token or a Planet, create a Protoplanet. Later, a player may play a Proto Evolution card to turn the Protoplanet into a Planet. The first time the Acceleration space is reached, it triggers the Late Heavy Bombardment instead (all the matter on the evolution track fills the empty solar system spaces, and comets may appear. The second time the Acceleration space is reached, Acceleration occurs normally.<br/><br/>Frost Line: This line lies between orbits III and IV (it moves in or out if the Red Dwarf or A-Type star are used). The Low, High, and Final Evolution cards of the normal game are replaced by those in the expansion. Planetary evolution now tracks heat and cold markers. If using the Variable star token, players may spend victory points to vary the star's brightness a notch up or down; this moves the Frost Line accordingly.<br/><br/>",

To represent these eerie areas, the expansion includes brand new tiles with exciting new artwork&mdash;as well as a special, extra-large boss fight tile.<br/><br/>In fact, City of Ruin includes two massive new bosses&mdash;with bases so large they take up multiple squares. These powerful enemies have considerably higher stamina, can perform much more devastating attacks, and can viciously shove characters out of their path when they move.<br/><br/>In short, they&rsquo;re not to be trifled with. Weapons won&rsquo;t be enough to defeat them. Instead, players will need to be clever in how they use their environment to defeat these terrible foes. But, of course, the bosses aren&rsquo;t alone. City of Ruin adds three new enemy types and twelve new enemy miniatures to Resident Evil&trade; 3: The Board Game. Each one of these enemies is dangerous in their own right, forcing players to learn new strategies to escape or defeat them.<br/>Still, don&rsquo;t worry too much. You won&rsquo;t be without help.<br/><br/>To assist you in facing these terrible foes, City of Ruin includes new weapons, and new ammunition types for the Handgun, Shotgun, and Grenade Launcher.<br/><br/>",

These updated scenarios have not previously seen print in ASL form, although two have been available for download from the MMP website. They range from the beginning of World War II in Poland through the Russian offensive in the Ukraine across the Dnieper River, following the Battle of Kursk in 1943.<br/><br/>Turning the Tide&rsquo;s scenarios feature the forces of Poland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, France, Britain, Greece, Russia (and Russian partisans), and the United States all battling Germany. Scenarios take place in both night and day, winter and summer, and involve cavalry, motorcycles, air support, parachutes, and gliders as well as armor clashes and infantry battles. Most take place in the countryside, but there are actions in cities and towns as well as forests and mountains, and some involve seizing bridges over rivers and canals.<br/><br/>The majority of the scenarios can be played with just boards 1-5, and only two require a board that was not part of the original SL-GI system. None of these scenarios use overlays.<br/><br/>Whether you cut your teeth on Cross of Iron or picked up Beyond Valor for the first time yesterday; whether you prefer Matildas vs. PzKpfw IIs or T 34s vs. PzKpfw IVs; Turning the Tide&rsquo;s array of interesting scenarios has something for you.<br/><br/>Twenty-five years in the making, and a true labor of love from the original ASL grognard Jim Stahler, Turning the Tide is the penultimate step in converting SL-GI scenarios to ASL. We are already working with Jim on a follow-on scenario bundle to cover September 1943 through May 1945 to complete the ASL updating process.<br/><br/>A fairly complete list of all original Squad Leader scenarios and their ASL scenario numbers and publication data can be found at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://tacticalwargamer.com/boardgames/squadleader/squadleaderscenarios.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://tacticalwargamer.com/boardgames/squadleader/squadlead...</a><br/><br/>The scenarios in Turning the Tide are:<br/><br/>U14 Sacrifice of Polish Armor <br/>U15 Battle for the Warta Line <br/>U16 Under Cover of Darkness <br/>U17 Resistance at Chabrehez <br/>U18 Assault on a Queen <br/>U19 Hasty Pudding <br/>U20 Fighting at World's Edge <br/>U21 The French Perimeter <br/>U22 Road to Kozani Pass <br/>U23 Rehearsal for Crete <br/>U24 Traverse Right..Fire! <br/>U25 Breakout from Borisov <br/>U26 Bald Hill <br/>U27 A Winter Melee <br/>U28 Sowchos 79 <br/>U29 Night Battle at Noromaryevka <br/>U30 Swatting at Tigers <br/>U31 The Front in Flames <br/>U32 Disaster on the Dnieper Loop <br/>U33 The Bukrin Bridgehead<br/><br/>",

The players need the pyramids of both colors at the correct level to be able to buy them.<br/><br/>Divine Prescience (red/blue): Your opponent must reveal the Divine Intervention cards he will play during a battle, before you choose your Battle and Divine Intervention cards. If your opponent has the Prescience blue tile, the revelation of your Battle card and his Divine Intervention cards are done simultaneously.<br/><br/>Renewal (white/red): During the night phase, before the new Divine Intervention cards are dealt, discard as many Divine Intervention cards as you want and draw the same number plus one.<br/><br/>Disciple of Ptah (blue/white): Each pyramid you control gives you a temporary VP at level 3 instead of level 4.<br/><br/>",

Both had to give up to part of their lives to build a brand new future where they are the only masters of their destiny.<br/><br/>Fiddler left her native Ariadna after a clash with the authorities because of her strong activism. She sought shelter in a nomadic trade mission that offered her asylum in exchange for her engineering skills. There, she was able to transform her physical appearance and switch gender, but soon afterwards she felt the need to go further and take her modifications to a whole new level. Fiddler found in Aristeia! the best way to finance the physical changes that made her a lethal fighter on the sand.<br/><br/>Thanks to her Jackbots, Fiddler is a DPS with a touch of control that can be used both offensively (causing damage) and defensively (making it difficult to access the scoring zones).<br/><br/>Gaia is originally from Varuna. From a very early age, Gaia showed off her skills in robotics that led her to be a model student during her formative years. No one was surprised when she was the elected candidate to enjoy a scholarship in NeoTerra. Quite soon afterwards, she managed to draw the attention of the high spheres, who invited her to fight in Aristeia.<br/><br/>Gaia is a controller support that offers her team unprecedented mobility. She can also control her Enemies, hindering or nullifying their ability to move through her Gorgoneions.<br/><br/>In addition, this expansion brings a totally new mechanics for the Controllers and their Minions, their robotic devices that allow them to take their skills to the new level. This also introduces a new way of exercising control over the HexaDome. Fiddler brings the Jackbots; and Gaia, the Gorgoneions.<br/><br/>Coordinator and Aristeia! designer Jes&uacute;s Fuster expresses it this way &ldquo;Gaia and Fiddler take control to another level. These two engineers, but especially Gaia, provide a different, totally new mechanic that will create a huge impact among our players.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It expands all prior main games in the series, requiring elements from other games to play any of the scenarios. No map is included, only expansion game pieces.<br/><br/>Numerous articles and scenarios cover Spanish, Turkish, Russian, Greek, French, and Romanian plans in the WW1 era.<br/><br/>The product also features die-cut, mounted counters: 70 full size counters and 20 'small' counters. Among these is the Spanish Armada of the World War One era, the Ottoman Turkish navy, and the Austro-Hungarian building projects. There are also many variants of the Rio de Janeiro/Agincourt in livery of various nations accounting for other potential buyers.<br/><br/>Finally, there are also new &quot;advanced&quot; tactical rules by Karl Laskas, giving players the option to take a more detailed approach to combat. These new rules make use of existing ship factors, existing maps, and use a six-sided die standardized in the rest of the system for resolution. As a result, it integrates easily with the base games.<br/><br/>",
