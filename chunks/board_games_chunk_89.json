        "description": "User summary<br/>ジュエリー アントワープ (Jewelry Antwerp) (Juerii Antowaapu) is a Japanese game in which you conduct auctions as Belgian jewel merchants.<br/><br/>Player order for each round is determined by a blind auction using each player&rsquo;s supply of coin cards, then the cards that were used in the auction are exchanged between players.<br/><br/>In a four-player game the players who won the first and fourth positions in turn order would exchange their cards and the second and third players would exchange theirs. Thus those who have placed lower bids will have more coin cards to use in later rounds.<br/><br/>The first player begins by taking one of the available face-up jewelry cards and can either spend it to earn victory points or save it in their hand to use in combination with other cards in a later round. A maximum of two cards can be saved in hand between rounds.<br/><br/>Once each player has taken their turn, the round ends and the process repeats. When the jewelry card pool is being refilled at the beginning of each round and a beer card is revealed, new rules go into effect and continue until the next beer card is drawn.<br/><br/>Note: the game box closely resembles classic Japanese chocolate box, giving the game a strong retro feel for Japanese players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ベルギーの宝石商となり宝石のオークションをするゲームです。<br/><br/>コインカードを使った、ブラインドオークションでそのラウンドでのプレイ順を決めます。その後でオークションに使用したコインカードをプレイヤー間で交換します。１位と４位が交換し、２位と３位が交換します（４人プレイ時）。<br/><br/>１位のプレイヤーから手番を行います。手番では場に残っている宝石カードを1枚獲得し、宝石カードを消費して勝利点を得ることができます。消費せずに次のラウンドへ、最大で２枚まで残すことができます。<br/><br/>全員が手番を行ったら次のラウンドになります、宝石カードの補充の際にビールが描かれているカードが出たら、次のビールが出るまでの間、ルールに少し変更があります。<br/><br/>",

Players learn to count by twos and by fives as they tally the points they collect to win.<br/><br/>The entire deck is dealt out evenly to each player. Players then take turns drawing a random card from the player to their left when it is their turn trying to get and play matching pairs. Once all matching cards have been played, the player holding the remaining fairy queen card (which doesn't have a match) adds that card to their matches.

        "description": "You are the King's Master potion maker, but he's getting frustrated with your lack of progress in creating a special giant strength potion for his army.  So, you&rsquo;ve been commissioned by the King to create the magic potion or else.  If you are unable to create the potion for the King, it's off to the dungeon with you!  You know that it takes a lot of gold to purchase the special ingredients needed for the magic potion.  Each potion you create will be valued in gold pieces and if you can create and sell enough potions to earn a total of 220 gold pieces, you will have enough gold to buy the special ingredients you need to create the magic potion.  There are six potion types you can create and sell to other kingdoms across the land.  As your workers travel the land, they will collect potion ingredients that you can mix together to create any of the six potions.  These potions can then be taken to nearby kingdoms and sold for gold.  You can also use your workers to help in the potion creation process.<br/><br/>Victory conditions<br/>Sell enough potions in 15 turns to earn a total of 220 gp or greater giving you enough gold to purchase the required ingredients needed to create the magic potion for the King.<br/><br/>Losing conditions<br/>Fail to earn 220 gp within the 15 turns needed and go directly to the King's dungeon, causing you to lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Everybody is trying to be the first one to find a pair that rhymes, and the first one to do so claims the two cards showing the rhyming objects and places these cards in their victory pile.

Game play revolves attack and production cards. Attack cards cause an opponent to have their eggs, chicks or hens supply diminished. They can also send predators to attack them using the Special Ops cards. Egg laying and Upgrades allow you to expand your side's supplies and personnel.<br/><br/>Between both coops lies the Tufts. The Tufts are the area where the eggs roll from the coop and sit there till somebody is brave enough to send a chick down to retrieve them. Players send chicks down to guard the tufts and wait till they are &quot;filled&quot; and return them back to their egg supply.<br/><br/>A solo variant is included with the game. The In-famous Coop War of Gutterman's Gulch was an entry in the 2018 Mint Tin Contest.<br/><br/>",

The game allows solitaire play.<br/><br/>In this game, there are 55 cards numbered 1-10, and the number on the card equals to the number of that card in the game. Of these 55 cards, the deck is shuffled and thirty-five cards are placed on the table. Players take turns playing cards from their hand to remove cards from the table.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the players make a tableau of 35 cards, in overlapping skewed rows. Some are face up, some are face-down. (Place five of them in the first row. Then place next five cards in the second row, covering half of the previous row, sliding half of the card length rightward. Continue placing until the seventh row is made. By doing so, only the bottom (seventh) row is fully visible, and most of the cards are partially hidden by two cards of the next row.)<br/><br/>During your turn, you play a card from your hand to remove a fully visible card of the same value. Alternatively, you play two cards from your hand to remove a fully visible card whose value equals to the sum or difference of your two cards.<br/><br/>After you remove a card from the table, new cards can be fully visible. If there is a pair of fully visible cards of the same value, they are removed immediately. Continue this chain reaction until no pair is made.<br/><br/>When you can't remove any card by playing from your hand, you must spend a joker to remove any one card. All players lose the game if five jokers are spent and still you can't remove any card.<br/><br/>All players win the game when all cards are removed from the table.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Rescue the people trapped in the kingdom!

The players are considered as the winners if all the cards in the center are removed. Although you may not talk about the numbers in your hand, you may form a strategy based on the number of cards of each type and aim for a win by communicating with your fellow players.

No accepted English name has been found for it, but the words &quot;kręgle szachowe&quot; can be translated as &quot;chess bowling&quot; or &quot;chess bowling pins&quot;.<br/><br/>Lech Pijanowski, a Polish games expert, described it as a &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; known in Germany and Scandinavia.<br/><br/>The game is played between two players (termed White and Black), who sit opposite each other across a 9&times;9 checkerboard, which has a line drawn around the central block of 3&times;3 squares.  The source illustrates this board as having dark squares in each corner.  Each player has nine undifferentiated pieces or stones.  Initially, each player places one of his pieces in the corner square to his right, and the other eight complete a square with the first piece as its corner.  White starts, and play is then alternate.<br/><br/>Pieces move a single space, to any of the (maximum of) four diagonally adjacent squares.  Capturing is by custodianship, which is to say that an unbroken diagonal line of (one or more) enemy pieces, terminating with a friendly piece at one end of the line, will be captured if a second friendly piece is moved onto the space at the opposite end of the line.  [The source is silent on whether such a move can capture lines of enemy pieces in more than one direction].  Unusually, though, captured pieces do not vacate the board, but are placed elsewhere on the board on a vacant space chosen by the captor, with the restriction that the new space must be the same colour as that from which it was removed.  Thus, pieces will always remain on the same coloured square as that upon which they start the game.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to complete a previously agreed arrangement of ones own pieces in the marked central sector of the board.  Six examples of winning arrangements are:<br/><br/>&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || o&ndash;o   <br/>ooo || o&ndash;o || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;o&ndash; || &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br/>&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || ooo || ooo || o&ndash;&ndash; || o&ndash;o<br/>(where o represents a friendly piece, and &ndash; an empty square).  <br/>Arrangements involving more pieces are harder to achieve and will make for a longer game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each card has a static or variable point value as well as an associated ability. When a player plays a card from their hand, they choose to play it for either points or for ability.<br/><br/>Hemlock is played over a series of rounds. At the beginning of each round, 2 cards are dealt face down to the center of the play area. These are the conspiracy cards. Actions played during the course of a round can change the conspiracy cards, but there are always, and only, 2 conspiracy cards in a given round.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving clockwise, playing 1 card per turn from their hand with the goal of accruing the highest round-point total. The player with most points at the end of a round earns the privilege of examining the 2 conspiracy cards and then assigning them to 2 different players' courts (score piles).<br/><br/>The number of cards in each player's court is known to all, but the value of the cards are kept secret even to their owner until a specified number of cards is present in a given court. When this number of cards is reached, the game ends.

        "description": "Macau-Wars Variation<br/><br/>Macau Wars It&rsquo;s a major game variation of the Macau card game based on the Macau (card game) Macau Plawno Variation, still being in development on github.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>2 or more players are dealt 5 cards each; after that, the top card from the deck is then placed on the table. Play starts to the dealer's right.<br/><br/>The next card played must be of the same suit or the same value as the card on the table. For example, If a 7 of spades was on the table, the player can play a 9 of spades or a 7 of clubs or any other card that matches 7 or spades. If the player cannot play a card, he must draw from the deck.<br/><br/>Cards cannot be played in runs, i.e. 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs but a minimum of two or more the same value cards can be played.<br/><br/>When an action card is played, the player next (or previous depend on the action card) in the sequence must complete the action or add to it to pass it onto the next player in sequence. When down to a single card, a player must say &quot;Macau!&quot;. If a player forgets to call &quot;Macau&quot; before the next players move, the player must draw 5 cards. The winner of the game is the first player to have no cards; in instances of more than 2 players, gameplay continues until only one player is left with cards. In case of Macau Championships once the first player to have no cards wins and the game stops. The winner shuffles the cards and the new game starts. One point is then assigned to the winner.<br/><br/>For the avoidance of doubt: If the player plays King of Spades and King of Hearts with King of Hearts on top the next player will pick up 5 cards as the top card takes precedence in this case.<br/><br/>War<br/><br/>In this game, a scenario called a war and deception can be created when players consecutively play 'special cards' to make other players increase their card count.<br/><br/>War is started when 2, 3, King of Spades (to a previous player) or King of Hearts is played. Causing players to pick up cards. When a war starts, players can play any 2s and 3s as the suit and value are being ignored during the war. Players can also play King of Spades and King of Hearts regardless of the suit currently on the deck and value of the cards as long as they are 2, 3 or mentioned Kings. Queen of Hearts can be played anytime during the war to stop the war causing the player to not pick up any cards. In this variation of the game, players can often pick up as many as 20 cards (they all add up, e.g. 2+3+2+King of Spades+King of Heart=17).<br/><br/>When King of Spades is played the previous player must pick up 5 cards or play another action card (any 2, 3, King of Hearts, King of Spades (to a previous player)). After the previous player, the game goes back to the player who played King of Spades.<br/><br/>Any queen can be placed at any time on any war card regardless of the current suit. See below section for the action of each Queen.<br/><br/>Action Cards<br/><br/>2, 3, King of Spades, King of Hearts - War cards that cause players to pick up cards (2,3,5 respectively).<br/><br/>If a Jack or Ace is played, the player placing the Jack or Ace can call for a non-action card value (in case of Jack) or a suit (in case of Ace). The difference is that the suit is ignored and any Jack can be placed on any Ace, and any Ace can be placed on any Jack, therefore, ignoring the requested suit or value of the previous player.<br/><br/>Queen of hearts - stops the war and causes the player not to pick up any cards.<br/><br/>Queen of diamonds - the next person is skipped (also during the war).<br/><br/>Queen of spades - order of play switches directions (also during the war).<br/><br/>Queen of clubs - player can chose who play next (cannot chose her/himself) (also during the war).<br/><br/>If a 4 is played the deception part starts, and all the players must miss a go, unless they have a 4 (if they don't have a 4 or they chose not to play the 4, they don't pick a card from the deck), in which case they can add this to the original 4, and all players in sequence must miss a go, unless someone has a 4, in which case they can add this to the original 4 and so on. If no one else has a 4 then the last player, who put 4 plays as many times as there are 4s. For example, if there are four 4s after the last player played the 4, the player must play four times. Note: the last player will play four times against him/herself, that also include all the action cards which will apply to the player him/herself. The deception is when someone doesn't want to play a 4 but has it and can play a 4 after everyone said they don't/have a 4 causing this player to have more turns.<br/><br/>Joker replaces any card.<br/><br/>Open Cards<br/><br/>The more difficult version of Macau Wars (and any Macau variation) is a game played with open cards. That means that all the players cards and the draw deck is shown. This is similar to Chess where by knowing all the cards players must think about strategy and future moves. Open cards variation might take hours to finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For some reason you find yourself in Evil Manhattan, about to be attacked by a bunch of assassins. Luckily the assassins run through the streets in a relatively predictable way - can you alter their route so you can escape alive?<br/><br/>Each round starts by laying out the city streets as a grid of cards and placing assassins at the top and players at the bottom. City cards have the same street layout on the front and back, but the front (face-down at the start) has weapons that can make assassins more dangerous. After the city and assassins are laid out, each player decides what part of their body to protect. Then each player in turn can place blocking tokens to block off streets. After that the players can choose which weapon to defend against, and then the cards that aren't blocked are flipped over and the assassins go to work!<br/><br/>The assassins follow the streets towards the players, but take a turn whenever possible, following the rules of the Japanese &quot;amida kuji&quot; lottery system. When an assassin reaches a player, damage is calculated based on the weapons the assassin picked up, their preferences, and what the player chose to block. Repeat this for three rounds and - if anyone survived that long - the player with the least damage is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It's funny, totally different and politically INcorrect.<br/><br/>My Rotten World is an adult party game where you steal, dump, peek, barf cards to win the ultimate title of the Rotten Dragon. Our humorous illustrations bring the cards to life.<br/>To win, you must get rid of all of your cards, while holding on to the Rotten card. This proves you are the most rotten of them all!<br/><br/>Setup<br/>This game is for 2-4 players, ages &quot;18&quot; and over. <br/>Every player is dealt with five cards. The rest of the deck is placed face down. Keep space next to the deck for the discard pile.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/>The most rotten person starts the game and the gameplay follows a clockwise direction.           <br/>For your turn, you can play any card in your hand by putting it in the discard pile. You take the action that is on the card. If you don't have a card that you want to play, then you draw from the deck as your turn.<br/><br/>When you start the game, the rotten card can only be one of 3 places. In your hand, in someone else&rsquo;s hand or in the deck. During your turn, you will play a card in your hand and do that action. So if you think that one of your friends has &quot;the rotten card&quot;? You can &ldquo;steal&rdquo; a card or &ldquo;swap hands&rdquo;. If you think that the card is in the deck? You can play &ldquo;Grab Four, you whore!&rdquo; and take 4 from the deck in hopes of pulling the rotten card. <br/>What if you have the rotten card? It&rsquo;s time to try to get rid of all of the other cards.<br/>Maybe play a &ldquo;dump&rdquo; card and give your shit to someone else. Oh and remember, if you have the rotten card, it&rsquo;s best to keep a poker face<br/><br/>How do you win?<br/>You WIN when the only card you have left is the ROTTEN card.<br/><br/>To get the ROTTEN card: you will steal cards, draw cards, swap cards, grab cards, dump cards, burn cards and do whatever it takes to get&hellip;.and keep the ROTTEN card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To impress the judges, you'll gather gems to complete contracts for points and powers, and you'll vie over achievements which transform into trophies.<br/><br/>By hiring the right combinations of miners and backing them with carefully managed resources and planning, you're certain to undermine your competition. But be careful - if you mine too aggressively, you'll earn fault from the supervisors, which carries steep fines now or deeper penalties if ignored. And if you or your competitors mine too greedily, the reinforcements in the mine will start to break - when a mine tile loses its last reinforcement, it caves in, taking miners with it.<br/><br/>Combining resource management and efficiency planning with direct player interaction, Fault! is a truly unique hybrid of gaming styles. Whether you're skillfully navigating the maze of the mine to excavate carefully selected stones or wildly flinging dynamite and grabbing every exploded element, you're sure to unearth stories to remember.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a trick-taking game with 5 suits, each with 7 cards, and staggered values (e.g. 0-6, 1-7, 2-8.)  There is also one card showing a bow and arrow that serves as the start player marker.<br/><br/>Players must follow suit, and each trick has two winners.  The player that played the highest valued card overall will collect the cards, but does not become the start player for the next trick; rather, this honor goes to the player who played the highest valued card in the lead suit.<br/><br/>Players sort the cards they have won into piles by suit, always keeping the lowest value card collected in each suit on the top.  At the end of a hand, players are ranked and receive a number of points based upon this ranking.  The first criteria is collecting the most suits, and the second is having the highest sum among the lowest cards collected in those suits.  Additionally, the player who holds the start player card at the end of a hand is ineligible to score.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of players and the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

A 54-card deck includes five suits with 10 cards each, plus four special &quot;Caesar&quot; cards which create a plethora of decisions for clever players.<br/><br/>The suits are a representation of ancient Rome at its zenith: Wine, Bread, Games, Legions and Gold.<br/><br/>As in standard rummy, players start with a hand of cards and alternately draw from a face down deck. They can meld sets, and also meld runs in the same suit. They also discard a card from their hands at the end of their turn. As in 500 Rummy, the discards are overlapped and any number of cards can be taken from the pile instead of from the draw deck.<br/><br/>However, things are not so simple. For example, if Caesar debases the currency, any gold cards that have been melded are removed from play. This will prevent every 3-card meld with a gold card from scoring.<br/><br/>The other three Caesar cards require additional interesting thought-processes throughout each round of play -- and there is no telling which will appear, or when!<br/><br/>The first player to reach 100 points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An Age of Sword &amp; Arrow is a set of miniatures wargame rules for the ancient and medieval periods with an educational intent: the writers hope it will inspire students to learn about military history.<br/><br/>The game features DBX-style stands grouped into &quot;companies&quot;, which are the basic manoeuvre units of the game. Troops are classed by role (close combat or range), mobility (light, medium, or heavy), and type (infantry of cavalry), and rated for efficiency for various kinds of combat, and possibly further differentiated by various special rules. Combat resolution is through buckets of dice - the attacker rolls to hit, and the defender to save.<br/><br/>Army lists range from the Late Bronze Age to the Norman Conquest of England.<br/><br/>",

Assembled on the powerful chassis of the PanzerKampfL&auml;ufer III, it has become the most common walker in the Japanese arsenal. The second version is very similar to the original Ryu with its laser guns, but also has a machine-gun for close infantry defense. The third version, Ryu III, mounts two impressive rail guns, from Japanese design.

        "description": "Players compete to balance exploitation and conservation in an effort to save endangered species from the brink of extinction. To do this, players must accumulate money through the collection and selling of resources in order to then buy and conserve land. To collect resources, players must exploit the land, and potentially push species to extinction. Players take the role of advisers to the Minister for the Environment - choosing when to approve requests for resource projects (collecting resources for doing so) and choosing which companies to give the approved contracts to (owned by other players, or themselves - who also collect resources). The role of the Minister is to conserve species, therefore the adviser that enables the best conservation of species wins the game! The game ends when either 15 species are saved, or 6 are made extinct.<br/><br/>The setup for the game is always randomized: The lands are arranged at random, in addition to the location of the endangered species; The resource cost to improve the efficiency of exploited lands is randomized; and the resource cost to move species, create habitat bridges and recycle waste is also randomized.<br/><br/>The board consists of 4 separate land types (Plains, Oceans, Mountains, Forests) with 20 endangered species. Players compete to collect 6 different resource types: Food (from Plains), Oil (from Oceans), Metal (from Mountains), Wood (from Forests), Electricity (from Electricity plants - built anywhere) and People (from Cities - built anywhere). They do this by buying and exploiting the land: spreading out from a starting land to adjacent land tiles. The cost of land grows as more of it is exploited. Players must also pay the cost of Waste that is generated by exploiting lands and extracting resources.<br/><br/>A turn has two phases. Phase 1 involves: Approving resource projects (3 available each turn, drawn from a deck), Buying land, Buying/Selling resources, Upgrading lands and/or performing Acts of Conservation (building habitat bridges, relocating species, recycling waste). Phase 2 involves: Recycling waste at Recycling plants (built anywhere) and Paying Waste dues (mandatory).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can also pay resources to initiate the construction of the Symbols of Space or use your special God power. All of the above actions create powerful combos, making you more and more powerful.<br/> The game play is tricky: resources used in the Past expire in the Present and Future.

        "description": "This is a skirmish game for two small forces, each consisting of 1 to 4 sub-units, each in turn of 4 to 12 singly based 25mm figures, totalling up to 24 army points (AP) and controlled by a single player. Figures vary in cost between 6 AP and 2 AP. One figure of the most expensive mounted type or most expensive foot type present is nominated as the force's commander and one figure of each group is nominated as its leader.<br/><br/>Current skirmish rules split play into very small increments and use simultaneous movement requiring written orders. We split play into alternate bounds, each of which simulates the time needed by a warrior to observe, appreciate his situation, decide if he needs to continue a current action or to do something different and then do it, or to exchange blows with or shoot at an opponent. This is about 5 seconds.<br/><br/>As all men are not similarly quick thinking or quick to react, we randomly limit the number of figures that can shoot or be moved each bound, but not the exchange of blows by figures already in physical contact. Since complex group actions require orders that cannot be passed and obeyed in 5 seconds, they are made more difficult to achieve and are assumed to have been initiated during the previous bounds.<br/><br/>We distinguish between fatal and disabling wounds, but do not take account of wounds unlikely to affect combat in the short term, or distinguish the fates of men from those of their mounts. The winning side recovers its disabled. Those of the losers are assumed to be slain in the pursuit, except for knights who are ransomed.<br/><br/>Despite its simplicity, the resulting system is much more subtle than may be immediately apparent. The average player has memorised the battle rules part way through his first game, but tactical skill takes longer to develop. A game usually lasts less than an hour.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re resourceful, and at times you&rsquo;re shrewd. Your kind is the second most successful creature on this planet next to humans. To some you&rsquo;re a dinner item waiting to be grasped in hungry teeth and claws, to others you&rsquo;re a vermin, a harborer of plagues, a pest to be exterminated, but you&rsquo;re much more, you&rsquo;re a survivor. Survival can come at a high cost, even it means disposing of your fellow rats so that you can be the last rat standing, or crawling.<br/><br/>Contents: 20&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; neoprene board / 6 rat pieces / 120 plumbing tiles / 64 two sided trap pieces / 2 eight sided dies<br/><br/>Number of players: 2 &ndash; 6 rats can play this deadly game individually, or teams of 2 players or 3 players can be formed.<br/><br/>Objective: To be the last rat left on the board. When a rat is unable to move on its turn it is removed from the board.<br/><br/>Setup: All the players work together placing the plumbing tiles onto the board until all 64 white squares are filled up. After all the pipe tiles have been placed on the board players place their rat piece anywhere on the board that has a white dot in the plumbing. Players take turns going clockwise.<br/><br/>Plumbing Tiles: There are a total of 120 plumbing tiles. Only 64 of the 120 tiles are needed to fill in all the white squares. The tiles can be rotated to fit other pipes.<br/><br/>Players select and place the tiles on the board in any arrangement they want, but all the pipe ends must be connected to another pipe end except for the 16 pipes that end in a circle. There are 32 toilets that must be connected to a pipe. Players take turns placing one tile at a time until all 64 spaces are filled. It is possible not to have piping in every space and 3 blank tiles without pipes are provided to fill in those squares. If the pipes don&rsquo;t fit at the end players can rearrange them as a group to make them fit.<br/><br/>Toilets: Printed on the board are 32 toilets outside of the white squares. Each toilet has a number in it and these numbers are used to reference the placement of traps when the dice are rolled. A player can travel from one end of the board to the other through toilets. Traveling can only take place if there is not another rat or a trap next to the toilet. Traveling is always at the exact opposite end of the board on the same row from which a rat enters a toilet. Traps cannot be moved through a toilet.<br/><br/>Black Traps: Everytime the dice are rolled traps are placed on the board. Rats can never move onto or go across a trap. The two dice are rolled on each rat&rsquo;s turn. The two numbers on the dice determine the placement of the traps. There is a green die and a yellow die that correspond with the green and yellow toilets. So if you were to roll a yellow 5 and a green 2 then you would go to the yellow 5 toilet and move across until you line up with the green 2 toilet. Where those two numbers meet is where you would place a black trap. Then you would flip the numbers, yellow 2 and green 5 to place the second black trap. If a rat rolls double then only a red trap is laid. If a trap lands on a rat then the rat moves to another location. The rat can only move in a straight line from where it is being displaced. Black traps can be moved by any rat on their turn. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time in one turn.<br/><br/>Red Traps: Red traps are created when any two black traps are combined. This combining can be done when a black trap is placed on top of another black trap from the roll of the dice or when a rat moves one black trap onto another. Red traps can never be moved. They are permanent. No black traps can be put on top of a red trap. Like the black trap rats can never land on or go over a red trap.<br/><br/>Moving: Rats can travel more than one space at a time in a turn as long as it is in a straight line and not blocked by a trap. They can make a turn on their next turn. They can squeeze past another rat on their path, but cannot land in the same space of another rat. Rats can never land on or cross over a trap. Rats can hop in a toilet and travel to the other end (row), but only if it is not occupied by another rat or trap. They can only pop in on the first square at the opposite end. A rat must be able to move in their turn, or they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Moving Traps: A rat can choose to move a trap in place of moving plumbling tiles. There are different reasons why a rat may do this. One reason would be to clear a path for it to travel, another would be to try to trap another rat. If a rat moves a black trap onto another black trap it becomes a red trap which is permanent and cannot be moved. Black traps cannot be moved onto red traps. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time and a rat can move any black trap on the board. Traps cannot be moved through the toilets.<br/><br/>Moving Plumbing Tiles: A rat can choose to move 4 plumbing tiles in place of moving a trap on their turn. Only 4 plumbing tiles can be switched out, but only if there is not a rat or trap on the tile that is being switched out. The ends of the pipes on the tile being switched out must match any open end.<br/><br/>Rolling Traps on Top of Traps: If a trap is rolled on top of an existing black trap then it is turned into a red trap. If a trap is rolled on top of an existing red trap then the one who rolled the dice can place that black trap anywhere on the board except on an existing red trap, or rat. When ever a double is rolled on a clear space it is automatically a red trap and there is only one trap for that roll. If a double is rolled on top of a black trap it becomes a red trap with an extra black trap to be placed by the one who rolled the dice anywhere on the board except an existing red trap, or on a rat. If a double is rolled on top of a red trap then the one who rolled the dice can choose to place one red trap anywhere on the board or two black traps anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>Death of a Rat: When a rat is unable to move it is removed from the board. If after the end of your turn you are unable to move you are removed from the game. All the players pay silent homage to the departed rat and then continue the game.<br/><br/>End of Game: The game ends when there is only one rat left to move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;With the end of the 2nd. World war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.<br/><br/>The Americans, along with the British, began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and started a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first case occurred when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops. The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with three small tactical weapons known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies, and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.<br/><br/>In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb exploded over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.<br/><br/>In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korp. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in dark Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&quot;<br/><br/>Hot War is a wargame of miniatures past in an alternate world where the 2nd. World war becomes a third due to the postwar cold war climate.<br/>We add fantastic elements like mechs, Nazi black magic, among other things, in a simple game system focused on skirmish (few minis) for quick matches and that allow the player to have fun in full. Another point is that our main miniatures made for 3D printing and also allows the use of other companies' minis for the infantry units. (our intention is for very soon to launch the infantry units even for 3D printing). We are initially launching the fast rules with only two factions to set players in the universe and the game system. Our core book will be released in 2019/2020 with much more news, including the German / Nazi faction, which is not present in the fast rules.<br/><br/>In our fast rules, there is everything necessary for the player to start having fun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The once peaceful Aderstrom has become a world full of darkness torn apart by the violent struggle for dominance. Amid this darkness one beacon of hope has arisen. Thea, using the same power of the world&rsquo;s core, fights to redeem her world from the chaos that now prevails.<br/><br/>In Massive Core, players use a leader deck representing a faction from Aderstrom.  The players create a &ldquo;board&rdquo; using locations cards and leader cards to create a 5 x 5 grid.  They then battle each other by playing characters, some revealed and some unrevealed, and blasts to do damage to their opponent&rsquo;s forces and CoreTap.  If a player can do 24 damage to the opponent&rsquo;s CoreTap, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>Massive Core is a free print and play game released with a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).  The game will be crowd-developed with quarterly releases of official content.

        "description": "The usual No Retreat! Card and combat system is used, but the rule booklet is shorter than those of the NR Front series, as less special rules will be needed due to the smaller scope of each title. Each game will have its own set of event cards and Combat Tables. With usually not much than 50-60 square counters per game, with very low stacking, it&rsquo;s a series of quick-playing yet realistic affairs that favours the offensive-minded player.<br/><br/>Each game turn will be full of on-board challenges, plus the surprise of Events cards as players vie to win in one of two different ways.  In a skilfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and card-driven simulations, No Retreat! Battles stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of the challenges and limitations of WW2 Army or Corps commanders, while keeping the action fast and furious, keeping play downtime to a minimum for both gamers as the &ldquo;non-phasing&rdquo; player has ways to react to his opponent moves and attacks, putting some well-deserved sand in his well-oiled war machine.<br/> As in the latest No Retreat! Front series, Leader Cards are included in most battles, these cards will give each player special abilities inspired from the Qualities (or failings!) of the Commander-in-chiefs present at the Battle covered.<br/><br/>1942 Game - Battle Listings &ndash; Five Battles<br/><br/>Battle for Velikiye Luki: This Battle simulates the Soviet Offensive that  was executed against the Wehrmacht's 3rd Panzer Army during the Winter Campaign of 1942-43; with the objective of liberating that city as part of Operation Mars. Called &laquo; The Little Stalingrad of the North &raquo;  it saw a German Garrison desperately trying to break out of the embattled northern fortess. After a bloody see-saw battle, only a hundred defenders were able to escape. The variety of units fighting is quite bewildering : Ski troops, German Paratroopers, Panzers, Soviet Guard Divisions, rocket brigades, Estonian troops, Fortifications etc&hellip;<br/><br/>Battle for Stalingrad (Solitaire/Two-player): This Battle showcases the famous cityfight, one of the turning points of the war. The game will focus on the urban battle in and around Stalingrad. The Player will take command of the Axis forces assaulting the city; the game AI will control the Soviet defenders. Time is of the essence to achieve complete control of the city before winter! A hidden unit system will be used to simulate the low level of local battle intelligence and difficult terrain the attackers encountered battling through the blasted ruins of the city. The game can also be played two-player.<br/><br/>Battle for Gazala: This Battle covers the dramatic Afrika Korps counter-attack, lead by Rommel, against the prepared positions and minefields of the British 8th Army in North Africa, culminating in the capture of the Fortress of Tobruk and dramatic advance towards Egypt. Open desert terrain and quick movement abilities will make this a wild and woolly contest of will between the well-rained German Panzers plus their Italian Allies, and the British coalition troops of a dozen different nationalities. Special &ldquo;Tactical&rdquo; Event cards are used to put more detail into the battle strategies used by both sides&rsquo; units.<br/><br/>Battle for Guadalcanal: This Battle was the first major Allied offensive against the Forces of Imperial Japan. Surprised by the attack, the Japanese made three major attempts in 1942 to retake the position conquered by the US Marines around Henderson Field. A linked scenario will cover each attempt; Event card play can also influence the outcome of the seven major naval battles, but at a cost of precious resources and Victory Points. This is the first No Retreat! Game to cover the WW2 Pacific war, and effectively three games in one.<br/><br/>Battle for Dieppe (Solitaire): This small, quick-playing bonus Battle will put the player, controlling Canadian forces, against the insurmountable odds of gaining a foothold in the well-defended French town of Dieppe during one of the first Amphibious landing attempted by the Allies in Europe. The game AI will take gradual control of more and more German forces as time passes, so speed of execution of the mission is key. As with the Stalingrad game, the Enemy forces will be hidden at start, to be uncovered as the game advances.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The name NUBIAH results out of the woods german names 'NUss BIrne AHorn'.<br/><br/>The playing board is a grid of 5x5 stones. Every second stone is fixed leaving a movable row of neutral tokens between them. This results in 4 moveable rows on the board.<br/><br/>Each player gets a total of 9 tokens of which 3 are unnumbered and the rest has a number between 1 and 6. The players start shoving their tokens in the gaming board and try to push out the opponent's already placed stones. The clue about this is, that you only can insert a stone in a row if your total score supersedes your opponent's.<br/><br/>If you manage to put all your tokens in the board you win.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Influencer, players take on the roles of wannabe influencers, chasing moments in real life not for the experience but instead for the social power of posting them later. Not every moment will prove to be popular though, as players watch the trending topics change round after round. Whoever can build their timeline in a way that attracts the most followers by the end of the game is the winner &ndash; though regardless of the outcome, the players may find out they&rsquo;re all still wannabe influencers in the end!<br/><br/>Gameplay of Influencer is incredibly simple. Players collect cards resembling social media posts which have an image, a description, and different thematic categories (such as Gaming, Sports, Fashion, Health, Travel, etc.). Players draft cards from an open area each round with the final, unselected card becoming the trending topic (thematically this is to say that no matter what the players end up posting there is always something cooler than all of them&hellip; they are wannabe influencers after all!). After drafting players add a card from their hand to their feed (a row of cards in front of them). They then score based on chaining categories together (such as 3 Food posts in a row) and also earn points for matching the trending topic. As rounds proceed players remove cards from the end of their feed, placing them in their discard, making only their most relevant posts matter.<br/><br/>A casual, filler game, learned in minutes, Influencer is a lightweight experience that allows its designer, Peter J&uuml;rgensen, to play with humor and satire regarding a topic that many people can relate to.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But accomplishing this mission won't be easy, as the path is riddled with traps and other heroes who won't hesitate to get on your way to avoid you reaching your goal.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to get ten Honour or be the player with the most Honour after defeating all Creatures. There are several ways to earn Honour, such as defeating creatures, with Offerings, or special cards, but you can only reach Honour 10 after winning a fight.<br/><br/>To defeat a creature, you have to compare its strength to the hero&rsquo;s strength. The hero&rsquo;s strength is the result of adding the strength of the cards in your inventory with the temporary modifiers of consumables or certain actions. Another player can join the combat as an ally and his strength will also be added to the active hero.<br/><br/>During combat all players can play cards as Instants from their hand, Equipment from their Inventory or Consumables from their Backpack to tip the scales in favour or against heroes in combat.<br/><br/>If players win the fight, they will have to put the Creature in the graveyard, earn Honour and draw the amount of Rewards of the creature. The ally does not earn Honour, but draws an Order or Chaos card according to the Creature's alignment.<br/><br/>Heroes have to complete an equipment set to gain permanent skills, but there are powerful temporary actions that can be obtained when they do something good, drawing an order card or  something evil, drawing a chaos card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Games from the Deep, Dark Wood is a big box of four family friendly games inspired by The Gruffalo. The games are simple to learn, take about 10 minutes each and, despite being for ages 4 and upward, offer a great deal of fun for all ages.<br/><br/>The games feature The Gruffalo, Mouse, Fox, Owl and Snake and are new and original.<br/><br/>'The deep, dark wood.' Race to play all of the 6 Gruffalo cards you have been given. Join terrible teeth or rocks together to make a growing path through the wood. If you can't place a card then change it for a new one. The first player to play all their cards wins.<br/><br/>'What's a gruffalo?' Can you be the first to complete your gruffalo? Each player has ten Gruffalo tiles and a board to place them on. Turn over a card that shows a part of a Gruffalo and try to turn one of your matching tiles over. If you find the right part then add it to your board. If you are wrong then turn it back over and leave it where it was. Whoever turns over Mouse gets to choose which part everyone is looking for.<br/>It's surprisingly tricky to remember where the right tile is.<br/><br/>'His eyes are orange...' Earn Mouse tokens for scaring away the animals in this quick card game. Pick two cards or swap with another player to get the sets of three cards to scare Fox, Owl or Snake. Read out the phrases and earn a Mouse token. The first to get  five wins. 'He has knobbly knees, and turned-out toes, and a poisonous wart on the end of his nose.'<br/><br/>'Oh help! Oh no!' Hide five of your Mouse tokens in the wood. Flip the Gruffalo boards to make a big woodland scene. Turn over cards to find where to hide your Mouse tokens - rocks, the path, the stream and so on. Then throw your Mouse token onto the board.<br/>If it lands in the right place leave it there - if you miss take it back. The first player to hide all five mouse tokens wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The person telling the story can also choose to answer with &ldquo;Not Important&rdquo; if players start getting too far off track.<br/><br/>Mind Maze allows players to test their skills of deduction and investigation, and to get to the bottom of the mystery with as few questions as possible. Players take turns asking questions, and lose a point for every question they ask. Points can be gained by asking specific key questions which also help players to figure out the true version of the story. This encourages players to think carefully about the questions they ask and to work together.<br/><br/>In MindMaze: Jeunes Detectives (&quot;Young Detectives&quot;), the cards are aimed at a younger audience than the other games of the series. <br/>The questions are easier to answer, and also much more &quot;family friendly&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Tecumseh, a Shawnee leader from the Ohio country, and his brother, the prophet Tenskwatawa, have drawn together an intertribal coalition of Native Americans, with the village of Tippecanoe in the northwest Indiana Territory as its primary power center. This confederation of Shawnee, Lenape, Sauk, Miami, Pottawatomie, and other Native Americans, joined together for mutual aid and defense, is deemed a threat by the US Government, who decide it must be put down before it grows strong enough to resist white settlement of the Northwest Territory. Goals: The Native player must first gather and arm a coalition of warriors, and then lead a defense of the Tecumseh Confederacy&rsquo;s capital at Tippecanoe. If the Native player succeeds, the US may be forced to come to peaceful terms with the Tecumseh Confederacy and treat it as a legitimate political entity to be reckoned with. The US player must march and deploy a force strong enough to overcome Native defenses at Tippecanoe. If the US player succeeds, the Confederacy will be scattered and the Northwest Territory will eventually be settled by whites.<br/><br/>The game takes place in two stages: preparation and battle. The preparation stage is distinct for each player, but both preparation stages involve creating the deck that will be used to play the battle stage against the other player.<br/><br/>The game is a history-based deck-building card game. The main thing that makes it distinct from most such games is that the deck is built in-game by each player, and the two players each have a different method of building a deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Whenever a player completes a building or construction phase, he receives a pawn as a reward. If all the cards are on the appropriate parts of the building, the players have managed and repaired the damage in the city together. Whoever has collected most of the pieces, can boast of being the &quot;most industrious craftsman&quot; and wins the game. In doing so, we will train for a good look and promote skill and creativity. The great game material is also ideal for free play. A fascinating collection and assignment game with great 3D game material made of cardboard.<br/><br/>",

The maze walls (red lines) are impossible to pass and as they are rotating you can get trapped.

The order of other players is defined in a clockwise manner. <br/>Initially, the pawns of each player are placed at the first (Entrance - outer) zone of the maze.<br/><br/>Each turn is comprised of two steps:<br/>Step 1: The first player moves his/her pawns and then rotates the walls clockwise (by 15o)  <br/>Step 2: The rest of the players do the same.<br/><br/>The pawns can move only in one direction, either Radially or Peripherally, for as many fields as you wish until they are blocked by the walls of the maze or by an opponent&rsquo;s pawn. The walls (red lines) of the Maze are the natural boundaries of the Maze and you cannot overpass them with your pawns. You cannot overpass your opponent(s)&rsquo; pawns either.<br/><br/>Anytime that a pawn is blocked in every direction either by the maze walls and/or by opponent(s) pawn(s), you have to immediately remove that pawn from the current turn of game and pick it out of the board. Next time you play, place that pawn in a field of your choice back into the Entrance Zone and do not move it any further. You can move your pawn normally when your turn to play comes again.<br/><br/>The player who manages to reach the Escape Zone with all of his pawns first wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Funeral Games focuses on the dizzying and myriad wars of the Diadochoi, the successor generals of Alexander the Great. This comprehensive hex &amp; counter simulation showcases the 40+ years of conflict and intrigue between these titans of the Hellenistic world.<br/><br/>1-5 Players can choose to either play specific parts of the war, a scripted campaign as well as a sandbox campaign. The scenarios can be played in a few hours while the campaigns will take longer depending on the number of players and variant being played. Augury cards which dictate events and certain modifiers are placed in order of their occurrence in the scripted game, whereas the sandbox campaign has players randomize the Augury cards creating an absolutely wide open situation without the realities of history bearing down on the player&rsquo;s decision-making.<br/><br/>Funeral Games expands on the foundations presented in The Earth As Their Memorial and adds on a thin layer of chrome in order to abstract the myriad idiosyncrasies and shifting alliances throughout the wars of the Diadochi. The Operations of Antiquity Series is supported by obsessive and manic research into the logistic capabilities of ancient supply trains and the armies they supported.<br/><br/>What results is the first hex and counter, operational-scale model of the Diadochi wars allowing students of history as well as grognards alike to study the volatile realities of military campaigns in antiquity. Players will also need to manage/improve their holdings, building infrastructure or cultural landmarks if they wish to gain a decisive advantage against their opponents.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Violent Schoolmaster Tactical Series (VSTS) is a new take on combat from the prehistoric to the late 16th century. This Introduction Module allows players to affordably experiment with VSTS and allows players to re-fight one of military history, along with western civilization&rsquo;s most decisive moment, the battle of Marathon in 490 BC.<br/><br/>Emperor Darius I of Persia resolved to crush Athens for aiding the Ionian revolt by sending ships and other means of support. Greece, through the development of the city state and democracy created the hoplite phalanx in which each man must hold their space in a tightly packed linear formation packed with over a thousand men with spear and/or shield. The Phalanx in formation became a heavily armed juggernaut that would continue up until the Roman development of Legion tactics.  The Persians on the other hand used completely opposite arms and tactics, relying on speed, delay and missile tactics to harass an enemy, leaving the heavy combat to their cavalry.<br/><br/>Athenian democracy was tested as citizens debated what to do as Persians began to unload men, horses and supplies on the shores of Marathon. After 5 days of debate and noticing that the Persian cavalry was being reloaded onto ships for redeployment likely to ravage the rest of the Athenian suburbs, the Athenians decided to act offensively against the Persians while at a numerical disadvantage.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the battle, the Athenian center were pushed back but quickly rallied and outflanked the Persian forces before they could unload enough troops proficient at shock combat. Unable to delay and harass the Greeks by withdrawing and using ranged combat, they ended up getting totally slaughtered by the Greeks as they were completely ill-prepared for hand to hand combat with heavy infantry.  Driven back into the sea, the Athenians had achieved a major symbolic victory, managing to severely damage the Persian attempt at establishing a beachhead for a further invasion of Attica from Marathon. The Greek way of war had proven itself as superior to the Persian, which had been the dominant power in the region before this point in history, that all changed with Marathon.<br/><br/>VSTS is inspired by the PRESTAGS set of games from SPI, GBOH from GMT, and Battle Hymn by Compass Games. Wings of each army are activated by chit pull; the combat phase is also initiated by a chit pull followed by an ongoing melee phase after all chits have been pulled. While ranged combat uses a traditional CRT type mechanic, melee combat has players rolling a handful of d10s in search of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; against their opponent. dividing the number of dice thrown between all enemy units in front hexes. The base chance for hits depends on the morale of the units involved as well as facing, terrain, the presence of leadership, and more. Units absorb Disruption Points and as they do so, become progressive susceptible to Routing, automatically routing once they reach a level of DP equal to their SP. Exclusive Rules for Marathon are focused on recreating the various speculative conditions academics have argued about in relation to Hoplite combat, Phalanxes drift to the right when mobile, Phalanxes advance at variable rates towards an enemy, Locking Shields as a tactic to create a more shock-resistant Phalanx, as well as loose-formation rules for Phalanxes which allow for limited stacking combined with more maneuverable units. Many of these exclusive rules, if not all, will be present in the first full game of the series considering 4 Battles from Lacedaemonian (Spartan) history.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

And if at any point in a player's deck two cards or stacks of cards show the same number, these two cards (stacks) must be combined into one stack!<br/><br/>The round ends immediately when the first player has a display with six stacks OR the draw pile is empty. Players get points for the top card on each stack - but only if they have managed to collect all three colours!<br/>The game ends when one or more players reach 150 points.<br/><br/>",

The kids have specific sweets they want and arrive in a particular order. Whoever arranges their candy bowl the best wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player randomly gets 3 cards that you place facedown in front of you. After the game starts, you may not look at your cards again, except when cards are traded. Match the 3 Favorite cards better than your opponents to win!

In Sweet Dreams, players are adults trying to give away all their candy first on Halloween. In Trade-or-Treat, players are kids trading the candy they got from trick-or-treating.

What makes it interesting is that you and your opponent each have the option of controlling each other's pieces rather than your own on any given turn.<br/><br/>All 30 pyramids begin off the 5&times;5 board. Each turn, a player may bring a piece onto an empty square on the board or move a piece that is already on the board one space orthogonally. Larger pieces can cover up smaller pieces of either color; same-size stacking and smaller-on-larger stacking is not permitted. Pieces covering up other pieces are fair game to move orthogonally just like solo pieces. Players may make these moves with either their own color or the opposing color. A group of two or three pieces on the same square count as the top color for purposes of the five-in-a-row goal. It is possible for a pyramid to be temporarily blocked in due to its being surrounded on four sides by larger pyramids. Players are not allowed to directly undo an opponent's last move, but they are allowed to create a very similar board-state. For instance, if there are four yellow pyramids in a row and the active player moves a medium yellow pyramid out of line, the next player is not allowed to move the medium yellow pyramid back into place, but is allowed to bring an identical medium yellow pyramid from off the board into that square.<br/><br/>The first player to create a line of five in a row, diagonally or orthogonally, wins the game. In the case of two lines of opposing colors simultaneously being created, the active player wins.<br/><br/>Requires a 5&times;5 grid and 30 pyramids: fifteen each in two colors.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The King and his two Guards must try to defeat the three Assassins.<br/><br/>Each player can choose one of three actions each turn (Attack/Guard/Sleep), but must Sleep after using two other actions in a row. Additionally, no one can communicate. Only the King can choose to declare which action the King will play, but the King must be truthful. Teams score points based on the number of surviving members of their team. First to seven points wins!<br/><br/>味方の心を読み、敵の心を探れ。<br/>デッドオブナイトは、敵味方に分かれて心理戦を行うゲームです。暗殺者側は王の暗殺を試み、王家側は暗殺者の殲滅を図ります。敵の行動はおろか、味方の行動さえも知ることはできませんが、場の状況や相手のプレイスタイルをよく読めば、自ずとどんな行動を取るかが見えてくるはずです。各プレイヤーの個性を把握し、数手先を読むことができれば、勝利はあなたのものとなるでしょう。<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Whether you are Mennonite or not, you will find this game fun and entertaining!<br/><br/>&quot; The Mennonites play a game predictably called &quot;The Mennonite Game,&quot; in which people try and discover how they might be connected. For example, I might find out that you were my brother's roommate's sister's ex-boyfriend's high school teacher. The game that I have created is a card game inspired by the Mennonite game, thus the title &quot;The Mennonite Game Card Game.&quot;&quot; - Description by the designer<br/><br/>Each person begins with a Starter Card, which is you! The object of the game is to be the first to collect 10 Character Cards.<br/><br/>The Character Cards you acquire branch off of the Starter Card to form your character tree. The trick of the game is collect characters that benefit you, while also fitting into your character tree.<br/><br/>You gain characters by turning in Connection Cards. There are 4 different types, and a wild card that can be used for any one connection type.<br/><br/>The third type of card is the Event Card. These cards can be played at any time during your turn to draw cards, block someone's Character tree, remove effects, and much more!<br/><br/>",

First, you have to start looking for objects in Schemermeer, objects you'll need to beat the monster. Each turn you roll a die and can either move your pawn or attack a monster. Each monster in schemermeer is guarding an object. Beating the monster (also dice-rolling) grants you the object. When you have found the needed objects, go down to the underworld (game board under the table) and battle much more dangerous monsters to find the potion needed. With the correct objects, the potion and a little bit of luck, you can beat the final boss-monster.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "IGB&Oacute; is an abstract strategy board game that teaches sustainable thinking. IGB&Oacute; translates to 'forest' in Yoruba.<br/><br/>To begin, each player gets 36 &quot;seeds&quot; and 4 &quot;desert&quot; pieces. The game starts by flipping the IGB&Oacute; piece. If IGB&Oacute; lands face-up then the youngest player starts. The IGB&Oacute; piece can be used as a neutral seed by both players, but neither player can stack on top of it.<br/><br/>Next, players now take turns to place pieces on the board. Desert pieces prevent growth and can be used defensively/offensively during the game. The seed pieces are used to form IGB&Oacute;s.<br/><br/>An IGB&Oacute; is formed in the following ways:<br/><br/>Plant 5 seeds in a row, the center seed becomes the IGB&Oacute; trunk AND/OR:<br/>Plant two intersecting rows of 3 seeds, the center seed becomes the IGB&Oacute; trunk.<br/><br/>Methods of scoring a single IGBO:<br/><br/>The center of each shape gains another seed and becomes the stacked trunk of the IGB&Oacute;. Once an IGB&Oacute; is stacked and formed, the other seeds in the formation are turned over to signify that they have become roots. Players add more symmetric root branches to their IGB&Oacute; to take it to be a Double, Triple and Quadruple IGB&Oacute;.<br/><br/>The scoring is simple and works as follows:<br/><br/>Single IGB&Oacute; gives you 2 points <br/>Double IGB&Oacute; gives you 4 points <br/>Triple IGB&Oacute; gives you 8 points <br/>Quadruple IGB&Oacute; gives you 16 points<br/><br/>Another strategic element is the wind. Seeds that are not &quot;rooted&quot; can be blown in the wind and travel a maximum of 5 spaces on the board moving horizontally and vertically. This can be used to disguise your strategy to your opponent. On your turn, you may either plant a new seed or move two existing seeds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The War in Vietnam<br/><br/>The War in Vietnam is a map campaign representing the entire war at a strategic scale. These rules focus on quick and easy play, and are designed for 2 players, or solo play.<br/><br/>Forces on the map are considered to be unspecified until they are engaged in combat, at which point both players secretly choose the forces they wish to take, and then compare their results and roll off to inflict casualties depending on the types of units chosen. For example the US player might choose a Long Range Recon Patrol, who specialize in keeping a low profile and gathering intelligence, but can engage enemy forces if they desire. Meanwhile the Vietcong player has chosen Artillery. The players roll off and the LRRPs win the roll, spotting the artillery and forcing them to become &quot;locked&quot; as artillery so that other forces can engage them this turn and know what they're dealing with. The LRRPs can also choose to engage directly, potentially inflicting casualties on the artillery, but risk taking casualties if they do.<br/><br/>Each faction has 11 different types of forces to choose from, and the combinations chosen have different outcomes, making for 121 different types of battle. Artillery vs Armor, VC Screening Forces vs US Marines, Air Strikes vs Civilians, just a few examples.<br/><br/>Both factions track casualties and morale as a whole, and depending on their total casualties, their war support and morale will be effected. For example, too many US casualties will result in war support dropping and less troops will be deployed each turn. Rules for capturing cities are included, and they also have an effect on morale and war support.<br/><br/>The game ends when one faction takes over 60,000 casualties, or if the Vietcong hold Saigon for 4 turns in a row.<br/>A printable color map with hexes is provided, 9 A4 sheets in size (3 X 3), but the author recommends that you get a large color map printed and laminated at your local print shop.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When all players are ready, someone presses the Start button in the center of the base, which activates a blinking red light and suspenseful and anxiety-provoking music. Wait for it...when the red light turns green and the sound stops, all players try to press their trigger button as quickly as possible. If you're the last person to hit your trigger button, you get an electrical shock. As an added bonus, if you hit your button too soon (before the center light turns green and the music stops) you give yourself an electric shock.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: To have the quickest draw and the best timing of your opponents to avoid the shock.<br/><br/>Lightning Reaction: ReLoaded differs from the basic Lightning Reaction game in that this version allows player to adjust a variable shock control on the machine--to determine whether the loser will receive a shock of low, medium, or high intensity (although still only provided by three AAA batteries).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Halt the Hun!<br/><br/>Late World War One Western Front Skirmish Rules<br/><br/>Halt the Hun! is a relatively quick, simple skirmish game for 28mm figures set on the Western Front in late World War One (1918). <br/>Players use 10-sided dice to determine the results of actions including attacks &amp; panic checks. <br/>Each side - which can consist of one or more players - controls units of either Allied or Imperial German troops.<br/> You can build your own &ldquo;army&rdquo; using a simple system or use one of the premade battlegroups provided.<br/><br/>There are three PDFs provided with the game. <br/><br/>     The first is the rules set (25 pages plus a quick reference sheet). <br/>     The second contains army lists, unit cards, tokens, and templates (54 pages). <br/>     The third is a sample skirmish game described in detail with lots of examples of the rules in action (13 pages).<br/><br/><br/>The Halt the Hun! rules include<br/><br/>     a unique initiative system,<br/>     simple combat resolution,<br/>     rules for morale,<br/>     smoke and gas, and<br/>     special rules for officers, NCOs, chaplains, nurses, and tanks. <br/><br/><br/>The rules are packed with photos of figures from this period as well as contemporary recruiting posters. There are more than 100 unit cards included to create a wide variety of British, French, German, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Scottish, and American battlegroups; there are also sample battlegroups provided in three sizes for the British/Scottish, French, Germans, and Americans. <br/>Guidelines are provided for small, medium, and large skirmishes. <br/>There are scenario ideas as well as a 1-page quick reference sheet. <br/>Optional Event Cards are also included if you&rsquo;d like to add some interesting twists to your game (including strafing runs and calling in artillery).<br/><br/>Heed the call, assemble your troops, and head to the front! Halt the Hun! is a perfect excuse to get some of the wonderful figures available for this period onto your tabletop!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monster Wars is a micro wargame that sees two to four players taking command of armies of vampires, undead, werewolves, and hunters&mdash;fighting it out to see who will come out on top.<br/><br/>Monster Wars is heavily inspired by the Golden Age of Monsters&mdash;A.K.A. the black and white horror and monster movies that were made during the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Hence, you&rsquo;ll see that the game map and all monster art is portrayed in the traditional black and white style.<br/><br/>In particular, this game is a sendoff to the monster &ldquo;mash-up&rdquo; movies that were popular in the fifties. In these films, two or more popular Golden screen monsters were joined up and often battled it out by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>A micro wargame is an easy to learn, fast to play, and inexpensive game for fans of wargaming who may not have enough time for a full-blown kitchen table spanning battle.<br/><br/>A micro wargame can be played over a lunch break, on a train, on a plane, or just in the comfort of your own home when you have a free minute.<br/><br/>All the micro wargames consist of 5-10 printed sheets of paper: Including rules, 1-2 playing maps, and one sheet of counters.<br/><br/>",

The rules do not use a fixed figure scale, allowing players to adapt games to their individual collections. Both small and large scale actions are easily handled. <br/>The rules as written are designed for using 25mm to 28mm scale figures, but are adaptable for smaller scales. <br/> The rules are D6 driven with modifiers reflecting an increase or decrease in available dice.<br/><br/>The turn system is dynamic with players contending for control of each phase. <br/>The dice mechanics are a little different, but it is still best to roll high. <br/>Players must continually adapt as they will not know if they will move first or second, or shoot first or second. At times movement, shooting, and melee can even be suspended and skipped during a turn.<br/><br/>Leadership plays a part in the fight with leaders being able to get more from individual units when needed. This can come in the form of additional movement, a additional shooting, launching an unexpected assault or just inspiring men to fight harder.<br/><br/>If using individually based figures the rules do not require the use of markers of any kind, allowing for an uncluttered battlefield. If not using individually based figures players will need to provide some method of recording unit losses. Other than that no markers are needed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Not so much for the outcome (the defeat of the Sardinian-Punic, Carthaginian, and Iliese coalition by the Romans led by Titus Manlius Torquatus), but for the fact that this event represented, at the very least, the first sign of recovery by the Romans after Hannibal&rsquo;s climatic victory at Cannae. By regaining possession of Sardinia, the Romans were better able to control the western Mediterranean, and able to gain access to Sardinian wheat, which was used to feed their growing armies. One similarity between Hannibal and Ampsicora was that after their defeats, their cities of origin&mdash;Carthage and Cornus, respectively, were razed by the Romans.<br/><br/>A copy of Centuria is required to use this supplement.<br/><br/>",

For the last few weeks freed prisoners of theirs have been all over the local media net telling stories of midnight abductions, torture and the killing of other prisoners. The SSS know they are in a bad situation and to make matters worse they have abducted the planetary governor and are using him as a shield against retaliation from the growing resistance movement. They are holed up in an old planetary defense fort far up in the mountains to the west of the capitol.<br/>Mr. Johnson has tasked Black's Commandos with finding and rescuing the governor before he is killed as a propaganda piece by the Synod. Mr. Johnson has provided satelitte surviellance data about the fort and its defenses. He didn't say where he got this data from and we know better than to ask. The data seems solid but then again no intel is perfect. However, it is enough to formulate an ops plan.<br/><br/>This PDF provides a short campaign of 4 linked scenarios for the FiveCore Skirmish Gaming Evolved and its supplement Five Parsecs from Home.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Sarge fights to keep his team alive, Lucky keeps an eye on his rabbit&rsquo;s foot, Sweep never loses a soldier to a minefield... and no soldier takes a shot until the spotlight is on him. 12 men, 2 squads, 6 minutes, and no mercy: these are ARMY DUDES.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be played with the classic green army figures, and puts players in control of action movie-like squads filled with characters like &ldquo;Brick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sarge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hotshot.&rdquo;<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve been wanting to release a small-sides tactics game for a long time, said Army Dudes designer Drake Sherwood. The game is designed to be easy to learn and easy to play, but still offer a lot of tactical depth and decision-making. We wanted this to be a fun, playful experience with lots of replay value.<br/><br/>Players will have to stop by a dollar store or toy store to pick up some green army figures, and make use of whatever they have for terrain, said Sherwood. He thinks the game will have a nostalgic aspect for many players.

        "description": "Axe Age has been worked on for several years now.<br/><br/>Extensively play-tested, the system holds up well to both skirmish level and large scale battle level. <br/>The system uses d10s, and was designed with 25mm-28mm scale models in mind. <br/>In addition to extensive folklore research, we had a very good official/unofficial historical consultant with a lot of knowledge and practical ideas on warfare back in the day, and we actually listened to him. <br/>For this reason, the combat system is fairly realistic and plays well.<br/><br/>The game takes place in a dark age fantasy setting. Law and order have broken down and you, the player, are a small time warlord trying to carve out a kingdom for yourself. <br/>Multiple tribes, weapons, armors, and much more are the tools of your trade. The various tribes that make up your warband are all drawn from history and folklore, with special abilities and available gear that reflect this. Your warband can be made up of units from different tribes, or from only one, it's all up to you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Monsters haunt the wilds and prowl the outskirts of palisaded settlement and isolated steading alike. Huldrfolk, never easy neighbors, but generally peaceful if left undisturbed, now move to defend their sacred groves and to seize places once devoted to gods who now seem absent. Trolls and their ilk gather, marauders sweep brigands and more into their bands, and whispers abound of gaunt giant wolves and worse, glimpsed in the swirl of a snowstorm. And where such beasts and everlasting winter hold sway, the Frost Giants cannot be far behind ...<br/><br/>Ragnarok: Age of Wolves is a set of fun, fast-playing, and evocative rules that allow you to fight out the desperate battles and skirmishes of the Fimblvintr. It also includes a four-part campaign to take you through the struggle of one man trying to preserve something of his honor, his life, and the people and creatures who depend on him for survival. Finally, we have given you everything you need to expand the strife to include the other creatures and Sagas of the Ragnarok!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Escalade is a set of skirmish rules designed for keen Father Tilly players - and anyone else interested in seventeenth-century warfare. Escalade takes the basic mechanics used in Father Tilly and incorporates that extra layer of detail required for battles at the skirmish level. <br/>The rules feature organisation at the company level and focus on the role of officers and NCOs in low level engagements. Also included in the rules are a number of different troop types: those interesting and exotic units that are too small or rare to feature in most big battles. Players can field units of J&auml;gers, Sh&uuml;tzen, Sturmtruppen and Trabanten.<br/><br/>For the experienced Father Tilly player, Escalade contains several familiar features. <br/>Rules for movement, morale, shooting and combat have the same basic mechanics but with additional detail. <br/>The sections on terrain and scenario generation are also included plus a new section detailing mortars, incendiaries and other methods of mayhem and destruction. <br/>The popular &quot;war-tokens&quot; section is also included, this describes how players can use their existing Father Tilly tokens and apply them to skirmish games. <br/>And because of the more uncertain nature of skirmish games, the initiative system has been modified too.<br/><br/>Despite its similarities to Father Tilly, Escalade is a game that can be played on its own without any prior experience of other AB One games. <br/>Players of Father Tilly will already be familiar with many of its processes, however, new players will quickly find an easy to use, exciting and enjoyable system ideally suited to fighting skirmish level games in the seventeenth century.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ICE is our home.ICE is our world. ICE is corrupted. ICE is dying.<br/><br/>ICE is a mega-city. Ice is dying from within. Before our history began, the Gods created this world and seeded a civilisation that spread to cover the entire planet. They raised us up - the eight exalted families, they gave us a sun that would never dim, they gave us technology. Then they left.<br/><br/>Why they did so is a question that has had no answer, until now. For our sun is dying, the corrupted machines are spreading. But after eons away, the Gods have finally returned. To help us battle for survival?         Possibly.<br/><br/>In ICE players take on characters representing one of the exalted families born from the genetic seed of the ancient Kchemic Gods. They must work together (semi co-op play) as powerful agents of the Gods in mission-based scenarios to hunt down and defeat corrupted threats in the dying city. A clever AI mechanism in game will keep players on their toes as they try to zero in on the location of the final enemy. With many NPCs to interact with and city sectors that change position and purpose, no two games will ever be the same!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gridblock is an abstract card driven game, where players have to move on a tile grid and try to place markers in order to score victory points. Each player has a deck of six cards, which show a combination of movement points from 1 to 3 and one of six symbols. Markers may only be places, if the symbol on the played card matches the symbol on the tile their movement ends on. Bonus points may be scored if a player manages to place multiple markers on a single tile.<br/><br/>The game is played with the components of the Green Box of Games. The Meeple Mini Expansion is not needed to play this game.<br/><br/>Gridblock won the Best Original Game category of the 2018 Green Box of Games Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Rytec Interstellar Corporation and the Colfire incorporated mining companies both have claims to mineral rights on the planet Zapotec. The planet was initially discovered by a scout probe over a hundred standard years ago and promised untold mineral wealth to anyone willing to invest significant amounts of money in infrastructure and initial colonization. Rytec and Colfire both launched survey ships with an initial load of miners and some basic equipment. The mineral wealth of Zapotec was even more than initial scans indicated.<br/>Both Rytec and Colfire invested heavily over the next three decades and eventually constructed a space elevator together in order to save on transportation costs. At first things went well and miners and equipment flooded into the new colony. In the last few years a new CEO was hired at Rytec Interstellar, Joseph Halsey, and the corporation has become more aggressive in its mining and Colfire has filed numerous protests over claim jumping. Miners have gotten into fist fights with rival miners from both companies. Last month a full blown riot erupted at the space elevator when Rytec personnel insulted a group of Colfire truckers. The final straw was when armed Rytec security personnel seized the lucrative ruby mine #59 on the shores of Lake Nazca.<br/>Rytec has hired Parker's Panthers to seize the remaining mines and raze the Colfire Incorporated executive compound. Colfire has hired the Regiment to secure its assets from Rytec's extremely hostile takeover attempts.<br/><br/>This PDF provides a complete campaign of 12 linked scenarios for both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II.

        "description": "Johnson's Rock is a planet in the Signus system and is rich in heavy minerals and industrial gemstones. The Olepak Corporation sponsored the first colonization efforts in an attempt to exploit the natural resources of Johnson's Rock. Olepak invested heavily in infrastructure and tranportation costs for miners and their familes to relocate to Johnson's Rock. In the past two hundred years the Olepak Corporation has steadily erroded the pay and rights of the workers in order to maximize profits and increase mining quotas to fulfill increasing demand for raw materials, especially metals and industrial grade diamonds. The workers have endured a stagnation in pay and an increase in workhours to the point where the average worker works 70+ hours a week in horrific conditions. Olepak Corporation has also instituted a company store policy and most miners are indebted to the Olepak Corporation for the next decade just to put food on the table and a roof over their families heads. Mining on Johnson's Rock is extraordinarily hazardous and miners have a 10% death rate per year. The mining families are trapped on world and sons an daughters with no other options hire on with the Olepak Corporation as miners or support staff. In the last few months miners have begun protesting their treatment and many mines have temporarily shut down due to strikes by miners. The Olepak Corporation hired thugs to break the strikes and more than a few arms as well. A few ringleaders for the miner's groups have been found murdered or dead in a mine shaft and no one has been charged with the crimes. In the wake of the deaths, the various mining groups have hired the Thunderbolt Division with the promise of a percenage of the profits if the miner's take over operations themselves. The Olepak Corporation in turn has hired the Regiment to squash the rebellion and push the Thunderbolt Division off planet.<br/><br/>This PDF provides a complete campaign of 12 linked scenarios for both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II.

The Ysgard system contains a Bifrost Bridge and could be used as a base of resistance by the Synod or their allies.

The Synod Security Services have a tight hold on the Planetary Administrator who will not agree to any treaty as long as the SSS is onworld. The Planetary Administrator needs to have total deniability and suggested to Mr. Johnson during the treaty talks that if the SSS were no longer a viable threat that he would seriously consider signing the treaty. The intel that Bravo Squad acquired during their last visit to Ysgard was significant and has allowed Mr. Johnson and his team to formulate a plan to undermine and weaken the SSS and at the same time winning the loyalty of the people of Ysgard.

Whether xeno-archaeologists or other scientists trying to understand them, or looters searching for treasures they can turn over for a quick buck, these adventurers are trying to recover as many relics as they can.<br/><br/>Relic Worlds Showdown uses the Showdown miniatures rules by innacle Entertainment to recreate skirmish battles in the Relic Worlds universe. In it, players find artifacts and other treasures left behind by long-lost alien civilizations. But the characters must be careful, as these alien races also left behind traps, and fierce monsters remain that will prove a deadly challenge to your faction.<br/><br/>In these pages, you will find rules for turning your Showdown game into a Relic Worlds one, and the faction information for the pirates.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A simple procedure is used to assign individual models several ratings, including Assault, Shoot, and Quality.  Models' size is determined by the physical base size of the figure, and is divided into seven categories (each category other than Normal has an assigned Trait).  A relatively simple method is then used to calculate the model's cost in points, and players take (roughly) the same number of base points for their army.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, round-robin style.  Games have a pre-determined length and end when the time is reached (or when all but one player concedes).  Games have pre-determined objectives with associated points; alternately, victory can be determined by remaining model points.  During their turn, players have several options available for each model, depending on the model's individual Trait(s).<br/><br/>The game is distributed as a rule book only.  Models used during play can be derived from nearly any source, as desired, and may be of almost any scale, though 32mm through 400mm bases would by typical.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Two teams (or individuals) must try to guess the most popular answers given by the British public when asked everyday, but entertaining, questions.<br/><br/>The players split into two teams.  One full game comprises three single money rounds, two double money rounds and one final Big Money round.<br/><br/>The single and double money rounds are the same - the teams race to give the first answer, and if they don't come up with the top answer, the other team can try to beat the first team's answer to win the chance to play or pass.  Then the playing team tries to give all the answers that feature on the card, until either they finish the card, or lose three lives.  If they lose three lives, the other team has a chance to steal by supplying one of the remaining answers.<br/><br/>The big money round is the finale, and each team nominates one player to represent it.  This round is a quick fire round - the players have to write down an answer to five of the cards, and win points for answers that are on the card, with bonus points for getting the top answer.<br/><br/>The teams add up their points and see who is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players choose generic units and customize them using a Fantasy traits list.  <br/>Most weapons and equipment is abstracted into simple to use Fantasy Traits for the units.<br/><br/>The mechanics are straight forward, streamlined, and easy to learn.  <br/>Rampant Swords uses a d6 dice pool vs. a target number to resolve most actions and mechanics.  <br/>Failure to activate moves play between players.  <br/>The game moves quickly and rapidly.  <br/>If you are familiar with Rampant Sun, Lion Rampant, or Rampant Hordes you will have a core understanding of how these rules function.<br/><br/>Victory in Rampant Swords focuses on completing mission objectives.  These are randomly generated prior to the game and come complete with twists and turns to make every gaming experience unique.  In addition, the rules have campaign rules for linking game results together into a larger campaign.<br/><br/>Rampant Swords is ideal for experienced gamers and new players getting their feet wet.  Speed and ease of play were the priorities in the design process without sacrificing decision making.  <br/>In Rampant Swords models do not always perform exactly as intended so the &quot;Friction of War&quot; will force players to react accordingly.<br/><br/>Enjoy your Fantasy adventures with Rampant Swords!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Amaze-A-Tron is an electronic board game with eight variations that revolve around a hidden computer-generated maze. The board consists of a five-by-five grid of squares numbered 1 to 25.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the &quot;Opposite Start&quot; game variation, the computer selects a starting square (identified by number) for each player. The players then race to see who can get through the maze first and reach the opponent's starting square, through trial and error. The players alternate taking turns moving through the maze. A player can move through any number of squares until the player runs into a wall, at which point the other player gets to take a turn.<br/><br/>There are two solitaire maze games and six two-player games. In the &quot;Blind Alley&quot; variations, the maze includes dead-ends that force a player to backtrack to get back on the correct path. In the &quot;Back to Start&quot; variations, when a player runs into a wall the player's pawn is returned to the starting square, adding a memory element to the game. In the standard &quot;Maze&quot; game, both players start on the same square and are racing to reach the same destination square.<br/><br/>The plastic game board features a two-digit LED readout, red and green LED's (which correspond to the color of the opposing playing pieces), and a storage compartment for the four playing pieces (plastic pawns and start/finish space markers). A 9-volt battery or AC adapter is required.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Also Team versus Team, with one (1) point scored for Low Ball and (1) point for the team with the lowest total. A number of other game variations are possible.

You're one of these cultists and your goal is to make the biggest offering and be saved from the lockdown.<br/><br/>PQltistes contains 55 cards: cards numbered 2-10, with two 2s, three 3s, etc. and 1 police card. Shuffle these cards, then spread them out face down on the table. On your turn, choose a card and turn it face up. You can stop here, collect all the cards you've revealed, and end your turn, or you continue turning cards face up. If you reveal the police card or a card with a number that's already face up, you must gather all face-up cards and three face-down cards from the table, shuffle them, then place them wherever you want on the table. Your turn then ends.<br/><br/>Some cards when revealed give you the ability to peek at a face-down card or swap a card in your collection with a card in someone else's collection.<br/><br/>When five or fewer cards are face down on the table at the end of someone's turn, the game ends. Each card is worth 0-2 rolls of toilet paper as depicted on those cards. Additionally, you score points equal to the number of which you have the most tiles, e.g. if you have four 8s and three or fewer of each other number, you score a bonus of 8 points. In case of a tie for most tiles, you score the lower value.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most rolls wins!<br/><br/>",

Whilst the mechanisms are very different to my other rules sets the idea of making them as fast and fun as possible remain the same, even though missile armed warships are by their nature immensely complicated<br/><br/>I am making this set of rules FREE. 2 reasons for this.<br/><br/><br/>     1st I am using them as an introduction to my other rules sets which are all a lot of fun to play and very cheap to buy!  So download for nothing and if they peak your interest check out my other rules sets  put &quot;Dawn Gaming&quot; in the search bar and see what you like, many of them have a free sampler and I cover a number of interesting periods in history.<br/><br/><br/>I am not going to go into great detail about these rules.... they are free!  Just download the whole set.<br/><br/><br/>     And the 2nd reason is that they are not exhaustive, I have put stats in for a number of Soviet and US ships subs and aircraft but this is certainly not an exhaustive set of data.  <br/><br/><br/>If people like the game I may do additional data sets (for free) but you can probably knock your own up anyway.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer / publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1922 Arkham, Massachusetts, A Letter from Herbert West, Professor at Miskatonic University<br/><br/>Dear Friend,<br/>It has always been rumored that there are tunnels running under the campus of Miskatonic University. Long have students and faculty alike speculated about the strange possibility that these tunnels exist--and yet no one has ever proven their existence. Many have speculated that the tunnels were originally built for use by the faculty more easily and quickly move about campus, but I hardly believe that to be true. Others think it is a remnant from the Civil War--something the south had dug. Again, I disagree. Further, students have whispered about a far more sinister origin for the tunnels.<br/>This is the theory I agree with. My research and investigation into the case brings me to the conclusion that the tunnels were made like a labyrinth--something once used by a cult to summon and harness unimaginable horrors from another world. Now, it acts as a prison for those secrets. That is why I need you. I have found an old and incomplete blueprint which reveals the entrance to the tunnels.<br/>That&rsquo;s where you come in. I want you to go down and investigate, find clues to what happened there, and map out the tunnels for me.<br/><br/>Welcome to One Page Cthulhu. A simple and easy 1920s horror role-playing-game you can play with a single sheet of paper. Perfect for a plane ride, hotel room, or anywhere else. You can even compete with your friends to see who can get the most clues and solve the mystery of Miskatonic University.<br/>Based on the same system as One Page Dungeon, One Page Cthulhu takes your solo roleplaying to the streets and locations of Arkham. This version of the system introduces sanity rules, investigation, and Lore Points. Additionally, it offers a new and frightening way to level up your character.<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

Originally inspired by the little colored sticks used for route-building in games like Settlers of Catan, the piecepack matchsticks provide a wide variety of options beyond (but including) network and route building.<br/><br/>The matchsticks come in 4 suits and 6 lengths that correspond to the suits and values of the piecepack. Each stick's length represents a relationship between the grid squares on the back of a piecepack tile- from &quot;null&quot; cubes that represent a single point in space to &quot;5&quot; sticks that represent the full diagonal length of a tile.<br/><br/>The matchsticks can be used for many different mechanics including: <br/>-Connections and pathways<br/>-Walls and barriers for area enclosure and maze building<br/>-Spatial mechanics that go &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; of the square grids that define many piecepack games<br/>-Resource tokens that match up with piecepack suits and values<br/>-Additional movement tokens for games that require more pieces of one type than a single piecepack can provide<br/>-And as many other uses as a designer can imagine.<br/><br/>Like the piecepack, the piecepack matchsticks are a public domain game system, which means that anyone is free to make and even sell a set without paying royalties.<br/><br/>",

All over the world scientists are working hard to find a cure and a vaccine for this unknown virus. At the same time governments try to contain the pandemic, using tests and various measures. Who will be the first to succeed in this race against this common threat?<br/><br/>This roll and write is designed to be playable with nothing but printed sheets, pens or pencils and two d6 (preferably with pips not numbers). The number of players is in theory not limited, but since the active player gets a small bonus, with more players, the active player's dice roll should be shared with others.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The active player rolls 2 dice and uses both to fill the four areas on the player sheet. The other players may use one of the die results. The four areas are Virus analysis, Research, Tests and Flattening the curve. In order to analyse the virus, players have to fill the area with polyominos based on the die result. The other areas are filled with numbers according to rules, that are slightly different from area to area. For each area there's a specific goal that must be achieved in order to win the game.<br/><br/>",

A port of peace and happiness.<br/><br/>This is not the dawn of the mythical age.<br/><br/>Our stage is the 13th century. Europe&rsquo;s marine navigation technology was developing. The East Indian route was still outside reach, nevermind the route through the Gibralter Straight in the direction of England-France.<br/><br/>The pioneering development of this route came by the fleet of Genoa, a rapidly evolving city. The merchant vessels that sailed from the Republic did not head west immediately, but rather swung left from the Straight of Messina, striking the Aegean Sea, the Black Sea, and the Eastern Mediterranean. They buy spices and dying agents from Islamic merchants, and then bring them to the Flanders to make a profit: beautiful Flemish textiles.<br/><br/>There are no dazzling golden sheep and no exciting battles with monsters, but in search of &ldquo;the wealth that is right there,&rdquo; the traders pursued their dream of adventure through  grueling voyages.<br/><br/>You are responsible for either the prestigious Spinola family or the Doria family, and aim for economic development of the family through maritime trade. There are 10 harbors beyond Naples, Antioch and Barcelona. Keep your fleet intact, rich in cargo to gain rights of trade at ports of call.<br/><br/>The opponent is not only the enemy. Local merchants are also rivals. Align your ship&rsquo;s progress with the shifting importance of the regions and deliver trade goods and victory to Bruges.<br/><br/>Using a regular deck of cards, some cubes, and a couple simple boards, players will use hand management and fortunate draws to outpace their opponent's trade.<br/><br/>",

With motives by the renowned children's book illustrator Antje Damm, MeterMorphosen is finally introducing a memo game for children that is more challenging than the usual memo games as its pairs consist of two different motives. When you find everyday items like carrots, a clothespin or soap on the sturdy memo cards, the question is: What is this? With the matching second card, these every-day objects are transformed into animals: a sausage becomes a dachshund, and a popsicle unexpectedly turns into a penguin. The 24 pairs of What is this? promote associative thinking and thus support intelligence development through effortless play. This memo game is not only an assembly of marvellous ideas, but also an encouragement to examine the world more closely, to get creative and to use one's imagination.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Life is Rolling Stones is a life simulation game that takes place over each player's &quot;Junior&quot;, &quot;Adult&quot;, and &quot;Senior&quot; stage.  Each player has a starting character card, and will, after rolling, place a die in each of 4 colors on it: red (passion), blue (logic), yellow (lust), and green (harmony).  Each player also receives a hand of cards which represent their aspirations, and these cards will grant the player special in-game abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>The game takes place over 3 rounds, each with 3 turns.  Players draft turn order, with those going later receiving certain bonuses, and then draft life events from a public pool.  In addition to the chosen card, each player will have one life event &quot;happen&quot; to them from a blind draw.  Each round will also feature an event that will affect each of the players.<br/><br/>Much of the game centers around &quot;tipping&quot; the dice.  For instance, if a card is to be placed into a player's tableau, you must try to place it next to the card that currently has the corresponding die on it; the die is then &quot;tipped&quot; onto the card, changing its value accordingly.  In the game's theme, the higher the value of a die, the more fulfilled a player is in that aspect of their life.<br/><br/>After 9 rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Their Building Site.<br/>2. Their Exploration Site.<br/><br/>We have learned from our missteps on earth and on mars we are doing it right, everyone has equal say! This means when a player builds, all players must build in that way. Of course, the new world also values individuality and artistry, so all players may also equally express flexibility in their decisions. Surely, this should be easy for you!<br/>Happy building! Oh, and watch out for underground gas pockets!<br/><br/>Each turn the active player will choose two areas to fill-in on their Build Site<br/>1. A private area that only they fill-in.<br/>2. A public area that all players must fill-in.<br/><br/>When players fill-in enough of their grid to match the shape of a polyomino Building Card they own, they may discard that card to gain the benefits and points it offers. Plan accordingly because your space will become more limited as the game unfolds!<br/><br/>Players will also find themselves using Redirect Cards to manipulate the areas they are required to fill-in to their advantage.<br/><br/>But that's not all! Each player has been issued a Mars-Rover! The spaces you decide to fill-in on your Building Site will dictate its movement through the exploration site. This will gain you valuable resources, but watch out for gas pockets!<br/><br/>The game's end is triggered when a player no longer has space to fulfill their Building Cards. At this point all players may spend their remaining resources to build whatever last few buildings they can!<br/><br/>Tally your score with your private objectives, subtract points lost due to gas pockets, and the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Welcome to Mars!

Soldiers engage in combat seeking specific rewards.<br/><br/>Practical rewards often cause betrayal and secession and end the era of loyalty and justice. In such an era, you must become one of the leading aristocracy. Form an army stronger than anyone in an arms race, for the war will bring in troops and mercenaries owned by other aristocrats.<br/><br/>Only players can see their units targeted for the competition, so it is fun to have a psychological battle with such bluffing or bargaining.

The Caught on Tape game is a hilarious, laugh-out-loud game that's not about winning &mdash; it's about not losing! Pull a piece of tape to spin the randomizer, which will combine two words into a unique category for the round. Players then take turns, quickly shouting out terms that fit within that category. The challenge might be to name irritating celebrities, or embarrassing hobbies, but if players draw a blank or take too long to answer, their opponents get to place a piece of tape on their face! Get ready for loads of laughs as players get stretched lips and wacky eyebrows. The first player with 5 pieces of tape on their face loses the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your Mission (should you choose to accept it) is the first Deluxe Box, including four themes that won't self-destruct:<br/>&bull; Improvising Secret Agent is a master of physics and chemistry who can combine materials in unimaginable ways to escape from the most dangerous espionage assignments.<br/>&bull; You Meddlesome Youths bought a van, adopted a dog that sounds like he is trying to talk, and started a detective agency with some high school friends.<br/>&bull; Long Shot Astronaut and their crew face everything that can go terribly wrong in space, thinking on their feet while floating in zero-gravity.<br/>&bull; Not-So-Super Hero is fighting villains alongside heroes gifted with extreme strength or speed, even though they are basically just really good at a hobby like archery or martial arts.<br/><br/>Every round, each player gets three story elements to secretly distribute and a far-fetched problem to solve, all coming at random from the four themes. You'll try to give the other players elements that might help to solve their problems, but they don't actually want your help.<br/><br/>Before you look at the three elements you receive from others, shuffle in two random elements from the deck. Choose just three of those five possibly-helpful elements to use, trying to avoid those you suspect came from the other players, as you improvise and share a hilarious story that solves your problem.<br/><br/>You'll earn one point for each element you contributed to another player that was used in a solution.

        "description": "A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures. Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out. At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value. If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on. This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players. The victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>From inside front page with User Summary:<br/><br/>This book represents &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table : Sara &quot;Thorina&quot;&quot; in the LOST WORLDS combat book games and is playable, with all other LOST WORLDS books.  Each book is unique and has its own special qualities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fate vs The Devil is a solitaire card game that features set collection as the key task during play. This coincides with careful hand management and deck building on your part.<br/><br/>During this game you represent Fate, who is in a race against the Devil to collect the most souls from the medieval place known as the realm. Collecting cards to place in your crypt will earn you those souls. At the end of the game, soul points are calculated to determine the winner.<br/><br/>The Devil is a game-controlled opponent that only maintains a crypt and discard pile; whereas, you maintain the equivalent, along with hand cards and a player deck.<br/><br/>Aside from providing you with soul points, realm cards can serve you in other ways, such as acting as currency to purchase more cards, or as a way to perform special actions. Card purchases are made from the realm or from the Devil, with the latter requiring a higher premium.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Morgan.<br/><br/>This game places gamers at the heart of the infamous Panama Rose combat arena, with Panama Rose being the first in a planned series of Fightdromes. Players take on the role of competitors who fight it out to determine which of them is superior. Before starting a game, players agree how to be declared winner: by playing until one player is out of cards, or by being the first player to reach an agreed number of &quot;fame&quot; points. Each round is referred to as a bout, and playing for &quot;fame&quot; points involves a series of bouts.<br/><br/>Each player has their fighter's digital consciousness (known as a stack) placed in an engineered or augmented body (known as a sleeve) for each bout. Your card deck will be customized depending on which combination of stack and sleeve you are using. Competitors must then kick, punch, and grapple their way to the top, attempting to outwit their opponent, place killing blows, and become the champion of the Fightdrome.<br/><br/>",

In Heroic Echoic, you collect echoic cards and use them to bid for superhero cards. The aim of the game is to be the first to win 5 heroes, but each hero you win before that gives you a power to help you win more, so it's worth taking risks to win heroes early.<br/><br/>You're thinking 'Do I have more echoics for The Chemist than she does? I've seen her pick up a few. Hmmm but look how shifty she is. Maybe I can bluff and make her think I've got more than she does and she might as well not bother!' Then when the bidding begins, you'll be shouting things like 'BIFF!' and 'BLEUGH!' and 'SPLAT' and 'AH HA!' across the table and wondering how it came to this.<br/><br/>There are 88 echoic cards and 27 hero cards. With thousands of different combinations of powers that you can try out or take on, each game plays quite differently, ensuring maximum replayability.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the 15th and 16th centuries, the struggle for control of Europe seemed to have reached its peak. The Great Powers, using mercenaries gathered from all over Europe, have torn her to pieces. The borders of the Great Powers were constantly changing, and cities were passed from hand to hand like hunting trophies...<br/><br/>In this strategic game, players need to build a common Game Area out of City Tiles and establish control over cities to gain more Victory Points.<br/> Key features: <br/>1) In the Core Game uses 42 unique City Tiles. Each City has 4 ways to connect to other Cities. Therefore, in each game, the players create a new Game Area.<br/>2) Instead of the usual resources (wood, stone, iron, etc.), the game uses mercenaries: Infantry, Shooters, Cavalry and Artillery. Each type of mercenary has 3 levels - the higher the level, the higher the ability of the unit. In total, there are 12 Unit Tokens in the game. Tokens have two sides and can be placed secretly. This creates huge opportunities for bluff and tactical combinations. <br/>3) The main way to obtain Unit Tokens is to create Political Ties between cities. The more complex the Political Ties, the more and better the Unit Tokens the player receives. This process is like playing Domino. Additionally, Unit Tokens can be bought or obtained free of charge upon conclusion of Alliances.<br/>4) The gameplay is divided into 5 Phases, which reflect the main aspects of the politico-military life of the Renaissance rulers and are consistently repeated in each Round. All phases are interconnected: the decisions made by the player in each phase have a definite influence on his subsequent actions. The strict sequence of phases allows players to carry out long-term planning. <br/>5) Each phase consists of several special actions available to all players. On a turn, the player cannot perform more than one action in a row. After each action, the turn is passed to the next player. All this speeds up of the gameplay, removes downtime and ensures high interaction between players. <br/>6) The competition of the gameplay depends on the skill of the players and their intentions. Usually errors are not critical if you are playing with players of your level. You can make up your failure to do some things by successfully doing others. <br/>7) The game can be completed in the First Round if at least one player can gain control of 5 or more Cities around their Capital City. Otherwise, the Round becomes the Final when there are fewer cities than the players.<br/>8) Victory Points are calculated only at the end of the game. Victory Points are awarded for different tasks, so there are different ways to achieve Victory. <br/>9) The Core Game (2-4 players) is a well-balanced strategy, with a simple and clear gameplay that can be easily mastered by casual players. However, the results of the game depend on the skills and experience of the player. <br/>10) Expansions increase the number of players to 5-6, and increase the depth and asymmetry of the gameplay.<br/><br/>The game has adjustable gameplay complexity, modular design, high replayability and interaction. The game is especially suitable for players who like mechanics Tile Placement and Area Control.<br/><br/>",

Each ADVENTURE GAME STARTER SET contains ten paintable plastic action figures in the standard 25mm size, a set of non-toxic water-based paints with instructions and brush, and a complete set of fast, playable rules for playing out your own fantasy adventures.  Even the gaming die is included. (For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&quot;<br/><br/>Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.<br/><br/>Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.<br/><br/>The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.<br/><br/>The Woman Warrior - &quot;the adventures of a young woman warrior and her friend as they do battle with Bandits, Kobolds (small fierce dog like creatures), giant Bugbears, and a huge fearsome Ogre, in a quest for treasure and glory.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Designed for print-and-play, Shieldwall is an easy to learn and teach system that you can utilize for any collection of miniatures. A 17 page pdf includes:<br/><br/>- Rules for creating an army.<br/>- Six scenarios that can be played alone or as campaigns.<br/>- Print-and-Play deck of Special Event Cards. <br/>- A complete magic system.<br/><br/>Army Composition<br/>Armies are composed of 12 units total - a variety of infantry, skirmishers, missile troops, cavalry, generals and monsters. The game is model agnostic - so the number of models in these units is entirely up the players.<br/><br/>Scenario Forces<br/>There are six scenarios included in Shieldwall. Once players decide on which scenario to choose, they randomly generate a force from their army dependent on the rules of the scenario. S<br/><br/>Combat<br/>Units roll a number of dice dependent on their type, and results of 5 or 6 indicates a HIT has been scored on the enemy unit. Once a unit accumulates three or more HITs at the end of a turn, they are eliminated.<br/><br/>Special Event Cards<br/>The friction of battle is represented in Shieldwall with a deck of Special Event Cards that can be printed from the pdf. During a game, players will draw hands of cards and then play them to modify attacks, execute special maneuvers and cast powerful spells<br/><br/>Magic System<br/>The magic system in Shieldwall is directly tied to the Special Event Cards. Players can wield the powers of Order, Chaos, Life and Death to scatter their enemies from the battlefield. Shieldwall assumes every army has wizards steeped in arcane knowledge or clerics beseeching the Gods for miracles, so you are never penalized for not bringing a wizard. However, if you choose to, you can make your General an Arcane Master which unlocks additional spell effects if you play cards associated the proper school of magic that the general has pre-chosen.<br/><br/>So raise your shield, lower your spear, and join the ranks of the SHIELDWALL!<br/><br/>",

Six historical and hypothetical battles are presented in this Scenario Pack, including:Soviet Intervention in Baku: When ethnic strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis went out of control in early 1990, Soviet troops were called in to bring order to Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. This Scenario is a night street battle between Soviets and a crowd of well-armed Demonstrators.<br/><br/>Crackdown in Latvia: In January of 1991, the Soviets sent troops into seven different Republics in an attempt to end nationalist movements. In this Scenario, Soviet Special Forces fight Latvian police for control of the Interior Ministry building, in a battle that was televised internationally.<br/><br/>Other Scenarios cover Black Berets in Lithuania, Vigilantes in Azerbaijan, and Ethnic Strife in Georgia. There is even a Scenario for what might have happened if the Soviet military had tried to kill Boris Yeltsin during August's failed Coup.

        "description": "Cuddly Cockroaches is a player elimination tabletop card game, inspired by the game maker&rsquo;s real-life cockroach infestation that happened during the quarantine of Spring of 2020.<br/><br/>In Cuddly Cockroaches, players are neighbors in an apartment building with a Cockroach problem. Every turn starts with more cockroaches getting added to the game. Some cockroaches have special abilities that make them more desirable roommates - but they are also worth more points. The goal is to be the last apartment standing with less than ten roach points.<br/><br/>During a turn, players can use their cockroaches to infest their neighbors' apartments or play supply cards like bug spray or Exterminator to kill their roaches and send them to the basement. If a player has more than ten roach points at the end of their turn, they&rsquo;ve lost the game! Losers turn over the apartment mat to reveal they&rsquo;ve been fumigated, and their roaches scurry off to remaining apartments. The last apartment standing wins!<br/><br/>Infesting is the central mechanic in Cuddly Cockroaches. To infest, players pick a target neighbor, select any number of roaches from their apartment to infest with, and roll a die. To successfully infest, the dice roll has to be higher than the total value of roach points they&rsquo;re infesting with. If successful, those roaches get sent to the target neighbor&rsquo;s apartment. Roll equal or lower than the point value of roaches chosen for an infestation, and those roaches stay in the player&rsquo;s apartment. Either way, the player attempting the infestation gets to draw a supply card.<br/><br/>Infesting challenges players to gauge their odds as they gamble to get rid of roaches. Bet conservatively, and risk the chance of getting fumigated before your neighbors over time. Take too much of a gamble, and risk never getting rid of your roaches. Supply cards can pass roaches from your apartment to your neighbors, add points to your dice roll or actions to your turn, or kill roaches and send them to the basement. But the only way to draw supply cards is by infesting, so players are rewarded for playing aggressively. Players get two actions per turn, any combo of infesting, playing a supply card, and shuffling their hand into the deck, and drawing three. Just like a real-life roach infestation, it&rsquo;s a losing battle of bugs - but a lucky roll can be a game-changer!<br/><br/>Be a good neighbor, and share your roaches!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Agincourt is a simple game designed for the novice wargamer that allows you and a friend to control the opposing armies involved in the battle to see if you can change history.<br/><br/>While the game is aimed at the introductory level player it includes more complex rules such as ranged combat and blocking terrain effects.<br/><br/>The English victory in the 1415 battle of Agincourt crippled the French army and the nobility at its foundation. Unfortunately for English King Henry V, his son did not capitalise on the victory he bought with so much blood. Both these factors played a big part in extending the &lsquo;hundred years war&rsquo; for another 4 decades.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s your first day at Potion school! Can you mix and match the elixirs to create the most magical brew?<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Group all of your Blinks together to create your bubbling cauldron. The game begins the moment you do!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each turn, rearrange your Blinks in an attempt to create matches. A &ldquo;match&rdquo; is 3 or more Blinks of the same color in a cluster. Matched Blinks get replaced by new colors. Sometimes, new colors will immediately create a match, and these matches will cascade one after the other if you position your Blinks correctly.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll notice as you make matches that your Blinks will begin bubbling - this shows how alchemically activated each Blink is. Each time a Blink is matched, it increases in alchemical power, which causes it to bubble more and more intensely. Eventually, after 10 matches, a Blink can become a Bomb.<br/><br/>Bombs appear as spinning points of color. To activate a Bomb, click the Blink. This will cause an alchemical explosion, turning all adjacent Blinks to the color of the bomb, and automatically creating a huge matching cluster.<br/><br/>But be careful - Bombs only last a few seconds before they revert back to their basic form. If you miss it, you&rsquo;ll have to power up that Blink again.<br/><br/>If you are playing with 12 or fewer Blinks, it is possible to end up in a situation where no matches are possible. If this happens, simply triple-click a single Blink to change its color, potentially creating a match.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION<br/>Alchematch has no explicit goal, and can be played endlessly!<br/><br/>VARIANT RULES<br/>Alchematch can be played by a stricter set of rules for greater challenge. First, place 12 Blinks in a 3 x 4 rhombus formation, with distinct rows and columns.<br/><br/>During gameplay, instead of moving Blinks freely, you must instead break off rows or columns of the rhombus and re-attach them to the opposite end. You may rotate the rows or columns, but must always maintain the overall shape. This requires you to think spatially to make matches each turn.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes three scoring chips at random from a selection of twelve and assigns them point values of +2, +1, or -1.  These criteria will look at the number of intersections of certain combinations, such as A strips crossing B strips, or red strips crossing other red strips.<br/><br/>The first player begins by playing one of their strips.  The second player continues, placing a strip such that it intersects the first strip.  Each player will then place one additional strip in turn, which must cross at least one strip, and may not make an intersection of more than 2 strips.<br/><br/>Once this is complete, each player calculates their sore.  They then communicate to their opponent how many times in total their three criteria were triggered, and how many total points were earned.  They only report these 2 numbers in total, and not broken down by each of the three criteria.<br/><br/>A three-minute deduction phase of the game then begins, as the players try to deduce which three scoring criteria the other player has in which slot.  If a player attempts a guess and is wrong, their opponent secretly looks at one of the unused criteria.<br/><br/>If neither player guesses correctly, the crossing pattern and scoring results remain, and the players play additional rounds as necessary (up to 4 total rounds) with the same scoring criteria and their remaining strips, until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>",

Did you get in the time machine? What kind of sound do you hear then?<br/><br/>It's a game where you freely say the sounds you imagine and match up ideas! The game is in Japanese and English, with illustrations, so playing with foreigners is easy. Discover fun new expressions!<br/><br/>There is no wrong answer for sound effects. Feel free to express your own sounds and have fun!<br/><br/>There are themes for actions, like 'broken vase' and themes like 'falling in love' or 'riding in a time machine'. It is a fun game to show your individuality. Hitting the right card for other people's sounds is exciting too.<br/><br/>The game has 30 cards with themes written in Japanese and English, and 30 cards with illustrations of movie scenes. A player makes the missing sound effect from the theme, and the others try to pick the matching scene card as fast as they can. The game is very simple to learn and play. Children can play as easily as adults, so it is a good family game.<br/><br/>花瓶が割れた？タイムマシンに乗った？その時、聞こえる音ってどんな音？<br/>イメージする音を自由に言って、みんなで当て合うゲームです！<br/>英語にも対応しています。外国の方と遊んでも表現が変わって楽しい！<br/><br/>ここは効果音が消えた映画館。<br/><br/>なぜなら、音をつけるのはアナタだから！<br/><br/>お題カードの場面の音を想像して、自分で好きな音をつけましよう！<br/><br/>他のプレイヤーはイラストカードからどの場面か探してタッチしましょう。<br/><br/>カルタ形式のゲームなので、ルール簡単ですぐに遊べます。<br/><br/>お題カード、イラストカードは30種類あります。<br/><br/>子供から大人まで楽しめるゲームなので、ご家族にもおすすめです。<br/><br/>効果音に正解はありません。自分の音を自由に表現して楽しんでください！<br/><br/>「花瓶が割れた」などの擬音語や、「恋に落ちた」「タイムマシンに乗った」などの擬態語のお題もあり個性がでるのが楽しいゲームです。<br/><br/>他の人の音を当てるのも、わいわい盛り上がりますよ。<br/><br/>簡単なルールですぐに遊べる、コミュニケーションゲームです。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

They only have 15 days (rounds) left.<br/><br/>The players gain victory points by turning in sets of resources described by their thesis cards, which are unique to each player and to be kept secret as long as possible. Each thesis emphasises three of the five available resource categories: Science, Magic, Components, Flesh and Energy.<br/><br/>To gather resources, they have to build a laboratory which transform, splits or fuses resources or teleports them all over the place. The players vie for space and race against time to gather the right material in a chaotic card game with a modular playing field and engine-building elements.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of three phases: In the first phase a player adds a tile to or modifies a tile of their laboratory to give it more functions, like turning certain resources into others, duplicating resources or fusing certain resources into more resources of another kind. A smartly planned lab can set of chain reactions to create lots of the wanted resources from any kind of original resource.<br/><br/>In the second phase, they can choose to either feed a new, randomly determined resource into their lab, or let resources in the lab go into the next stage of a reaction.<br/><br/>In the third phase, they can turn in resources gathered in their lab for points or special action cards, which can help them or hinder other players through various bonuses. Turning in resources for points reveals a players thesis to other players, so they can better try to sabotage their labs.<br/><br/>After fifteen rounds, the player who turned in the most relevant sets for their thesis wins. There are multiple strategies to build a functioning lab with their own risks and rewards, and until the last turn there can often be dramatic changes in the score.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Card suits are referred to as the voices, which encompass five categories (evolution, hedonism, reason, science, and shadow). These categories help distinguish associated card text.<br/><br/>A session of Shadow Oracle consists of two segments, the game segment and the esoteric segment. The game segment is necessary for performing the esoteric segment. However, the esoteric segment is not necessary for a full game experience (the game can be played strictly on its own).<br/><br/>The game involves building three columns of cards before a game-ending trigger occurs. If the game segment is completed successfully, a follow-up procedure narrows down the cards used in the esoteric segment. The final step involves reading and interpreting the card text. The card text draws on the wisdom of non-hallowed disciplines to provide insight for your decision-making conundrum.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Since the Mount Rainier eruption, you have been cut off from the outside world, trapped in the wilderness with beasts of terrifying strength and ferocity.<br/><br/>CAN YOU SURVIVE THE SASQUATCH ATTACK?<br/><br/>Your objective is to survive the longest while exploring for resources. But the threat of a Sasquatch attack looms in the trees...<br/><br/>A survival game for two to four players. Combine two decks to play with up to eight people.<br/><br/>-- Description from the publisher.<br/><br/>Gameplay: players start with an alarm card (that they can use once to escape a Sasquatch), and two other cards in-hand. The cards are resources that you can use to fend off a Sasquatch attack.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw a card. Then you have the option to: draw a second card, trade one of the cards in your hand with one of the cards in the discard pile, or end your turn. However, if during your turn you drew a Sasquatch card or two, now you have to deal with it! Hopefully you have the resources you need in hand in order to either flee from or kill the Sasquatch(es).<br/><br/>If you kill a Sasquatch (by discarding javelin cards), you keep the Sasquatch card near you as your score and you get to take any item from the discard pile. If you flee from the Sasquatch (by dropping rations, sounding your alarm, or using torch cards) then the Sasquatch card(s) get  shuffled back into the draw pile.<br/><br/>If you cannot flee from or kill the Sasquatch, then you have been killed and you are out of the game. The last player remaining in the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The player who played the highest on-suit card (or trump or supertrump) takes all the cards played this round.<br/><br/>Set aside all 9s played each round. When all four 9s are played, the hand is over. At the end of the hand, discard any cards in your hand, then add up points for the cards you collected by winning rounds.<br/><br/>If your score was positive, advance your token in the Cold War track. Then, if any player has negative points, take the lowest score and add it to the World War track. If any player reaches the end of the Cold War track, they win. If the World War track reaches its end before any player wins, everyone loses.<br/><br/><br/>99 is a postcard game sent to Board Game of the Month Club subscribers in the February 2017 package.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls an avatar moving around an ever-shrinking grid of tiles representing a nodes on company&rsquo;s network, such as email servers or security cameras. When you move onto a tile, you hack the node to extract a token of information secretly worth 1, 2 or 3 points. Once all of the company&rsquo;s secrets have been looted, you steal from each other instead.<br/><br/>With each move, tiles are tagged for suspicious activity and eventually shutdown, leaving gaps in the network and limiting your movement. When you move onto an occupied node, you are forced to share information with those players, surrendering your hard-won tokens. Your spoils are only secure after you logout of the system, either by running out of possible moves or waiting until the network gets small enough to slip out.

        "description": "暗夜之光 (&quot;Light in the Dark&quot;) is a tactical board game that supports 2 to 4 players. The story is set in a parallel world of medieval Europe. In this world where swords and magic exist at the same time, one player plays the role of a dark legion headed by vampires to control the powerful dark night creatures invading the human world, and the other player plays the human guard and leads the heroic royal knights to defend the kingdom of Italia Border town.<br/><br/>Players form a legion according to certain rules (both sides have the same number of troop recruitment points to form a legion with equal total strength), deploy troops on the map, and command them to fight. The types of troops in the game are very rich. Players need to make various adjustments according to the characteristics of the troops and combined with the terrain, and reasonably issue various instructions such as attack, active defense, retreat and rest. At the same time, each player constructs his own battle deck, and players can use these battle cards to greatly influence the battle.<br/><br/>【Victory conditions】<br/><br/>1. If the Dark Legion destroys the human town within 12 rounds, the Dark Legion wins, otherwise the Human Guard wins. <br/>2. At any time, repel all opponent forces, then our camp wins. (In &quot;Light in the Dark&quot;, victory is calculated by camp. As long as a camp meets the above conditions for victory, all players in that camp are deemed to have won the victory together.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>《暗夜之光》是一款支持2〜4人的版图战术游戏，故事背景设定在平行世界的中世纪欧洲。在这个剑与魔法同时存在的世界中，一方玩家扮演以吸血鬼为首的黑暗军团，统御强大的暗夜生物入侵人类世界，另一方玩家扮演人类卫队，率领英勇的王家骑士团保卫伊塔利亚王国的边境小镇。<br/><br/>玩家根据一定规则组建军团（双方拥有相同的部队招募点数，组成总实力相等的军团），在地图上部署部队，并指挥他们进行战斗。游戏中的部队种类非常丰富，玩家需要根据部队的特点，结合地形进行各种调动，并合理下达攻击、主动防御、后撤休整等各种指令。与此同时，每位玩家分别构筑自己的战斗套牌，游戏中玩家可以使用这些战斗卡牌极大影响战局。<br/><br/>【胜利条件】<br/><br/>1.黑暗军团在12回合内摧毁人类小镇，则黑暗军团获胜，否则人类卫队获胜。<br/>2.任意时刻，击退所有对手部队，则我方阵营获胜。（在《暗夜之光》，胜利以阵营来计算。只要某阵营达成上述胜利条件，则该阵营的所有玩家视为一起赢得了胜利。）<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quick Play Pro Hockey was designed by Michael Owens to quickly and accurately replay N.H.L. seasons, playoffs and any kind of tournaments the gamer wishes.  Each game takes a few minutes to play, which allows for many games to be played in a short period of time.<br/><br/>Game play is activated by two standard dice (of different colors or sizes) read separately.  For instance if the red die is 4 and the white die is 2, it is to be read as &quot;42&quot;, or if the red die is 2 and the white die is 1 to be read as &quot;21&quot;.  This gives thirty-six different possibilities from 11 to 66.  If you are familiar with APBA games, it is read in the same fashion.<br/><br/>The basic steps are:<br/><br/>     Select Visiting and Home teams<br/>     Determine &quot;Base Score&quot; (including normalization) for each team<br/>     Determine Scoring Chance range and Home/Visitor Chance ranges and enter them on your scoresheet<br/>     Determine Close Game Factor difference and select the applicable CGF range<br/>     Record CGF details on scoresheet<br/>     Start game<br/><br/><br/>When playing the game, you roll two dice. The first dice will be used for time management based on a timing chart. The combination of the two dice will then be used to determine if a scoring chance takes place. If a scoring chance takes place, then another roll of the dice will determine which team has the scoring chance. Once a team is determined, a third roll will be matched against a scoring table to determine the outcome of the scoring chance.<br/><br/>The game consists of three periods and the team with the higher score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

A good memory helps to sort everything and find pairs.<br/><br/>The youngest forest pro starts and takes the top search card and looks at it. The task is now to find the matching forest card. The forest card has the search card printed small as the solution. So you have a check if you are right. You now go with the search card to one of the forest pieces. Lift up the forest piece and look underneath to see if the matching card is underneath. If the forest cards are still hidden under the forest piece, you may uncover them- They remain face up underneath. If you find the matching card, you get to keep it. The forest card is now placed in front of you. If you have six different forest cards, you can use them to lay a tree. If you don't find the matching card in a passage to the forest piece, it's the next player's turn. The search card goes back face up next to the search card pile. The next player moves to the next pile with Klaus the mouse. The game ends when 3 trees can be formed. The player who has the most search cards in front of him - that is, who has successfully found the most pairs - wins the game.<br/><br/>",

However, players must be careful how they create each equation based on its location. Producing an odd or even sum in the wrong location, turns said sum into negative points! Over eight rounds, players roll dice, write operands and operators, utilize gameplay bonuses, and ultimately collect their victory points into a final score. The player with the highest final score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each cards carries various romantic lines (all in Japanese), that the players ought to speak as they play, such as<br/><br/>&quot;Don't let me go&quot;<br/>&quot;I'm glad to see you&quot;<br/><br/>However, the game is designed for any adult players, not simply opposites.<br/><br/>The red deck has 12 cards numbered from 1 to 12 (and this player starts), the blue deck has 11 cards from 2 to 12. If the blue player can get the red player to play all 12 of their cards first, blue wins. Otherwise, blue loses.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player may draw one card from their deck, up to a hand limit of five, or play a card to the table.<br/><br/>Along the bottom of each card is a set of numbers, one for blue and one for red. These say what card can be played after this card. For example, the blue 5 can be followed by a blue 2,3,4 and 6 or by a red 4 or red 6-12.<br/><br/>As players go through their deck, they must carefully decide which cards to hold and which to play, in order to push more cards out of their opponent's hand.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Players win by capturing 3 of their opponents' monsters, or through eliminating each other player by reducing their HP to 0.<br/><br/>Players share the same 100 card deck. Each turn, a player may perform three actions: playing a monster from their hand, performing a union (combining two monsters to make one stronger monster), and capturing another player's monster using a grimoire (which works in a rock-paper-scissors fashion depending on the opposing monster's type). There are also relic cards with various effects which may be played at any time.<br/><br/>Afterwards, monsters may attack the other players or each other. All monsters have different stats such as health, strength, defense, and special abilities. Monsters who attack become Rested and are defenseless against attacks by other monsters until the player's next turn.<br/><br/>",

You have been resettled from the Hub to a promising location and it is now your duty to follow the Committees&rsquo; directive to ensure this settlement prospers. Should you be successful in your endeavours, you will be granted an official &lsquo;Thank You&rsquo; from the Committee. Best of luck!<br/><br/>In Volunteer Exile Programme players take the role of a Pitizen &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; to manage a new settlement in the wasteland (consisting of a tableau) in order to try and earn the approval of the Committee.<br/>Each turn they follow the Committee&rsquo;s directive and attempt to perform as many actions as they can or wish.  The directive will include actions such as:<br/> &bull; Draw a card into your hand,<br/> &bull; Play a card into your Settlement or the Directive,<br/> &bull; Discard a card from your Settlement or the Directive,<br/> &bull; Place a Raider,<br/> &bull; Eliminate a Raider,<br/> &bull; Move a Pitizen<br/><br/>Adding locations to the settlement will provide the player with bonuses for building and attacking.  Attracting Pitizens to those locations provide additional bonuses to the settlement and to the wider wasteland.  Attracting Raiders, however, removes all these bonuses and renders the location usefulness.<br/><br/>As players are adding to their settlement, the directive and moving Pitizens and Raiders, the availability and usefulness of the available actions will change as well as limits on useable Pitizens, Raiders and your carry over hand size.<br/><br/>The game continues in rounds until the Committee approval process is triggered when a player meets one of the end-game objectives set at the start of the game.  The players then sum up their Action points, their Settlement value plus any Raiders they eliminated and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Frontier Valley you will hire workers, learn about their abilities and employ them as farmers to produce goods on your land, as craftsmen to make the building material you buy with your produce and as townsfolk to make use of your new facilities. You will need to make sure to make good use of the land so you are the player to better satisfy the market's demands. But beware: one misjugded applicant, one thoughtless land lease or one greedy building project could be all that is needed for the luck to turn towards your opponent!<br/><br/>Frontier Valley is a two-player 18 card game of deduction, market manipulation, building structures and powerful one-time actions. Each round you choose one worker card from your hand to use. This might sound easy, but as in Hanabi, you do not see your own cards, only the ones of your opponent, so make sure you make the right pick even when you do not have perfect information! You then use this worker as farmer to plant new crops and thus changing the price of produce on the market, as builder to erect new structures (if you can sell valuable goods) that bring victory points or as townsfolk to use powerful one-time actions on your already standing buildings. Then you will have to give your opponent some hints of her choosing toward the cards in her hand. Will you manage to outsmart your opponent by manipulating the supply of farming goods such that you always have the most valuable produce? Will you be able to hire a sought after seasoned architect to build the most impressive town buildings? Whoever has the buildings with the most victory points in total will be the winner of Frontier Valley.<br/><br/>The game features a beginner mode for learning the interactions of hints, the type of workers there are and the market dynamics. Once you played this at least once, feel free to add the one-time actions of townsfolk to the game for added complexity and challenge.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is a puzzle to solve and a race to solve it first.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Players take turns placing tiles on an imaginary invisible grid of three by three (3x3) with the goal of connecting the lines on the tiles. You want to connect the lines of your color around the outer edge of this imaginary grid. And at the same time preventing your opponent from connecting theirs.<br/><br/>As you place a tile, if there are tiles on the table, you must place it adjacent to another tile, horizontally or vertically. As soon as there are three tiles in a row or column, this sets the outer limits. The end result should be a three-by-three square of tiles.<br/><br/>As you play, you could do other actions instead of placing a tile, like rotating a tile, switching place between two tiles or replacing a tile. In addition to these four actions (placing, replacing, rotating and switching) you may always lock a tile at the end of your turn.

Two players, Red and Blue, share a set of tiles, red on one side and blue on the other.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlace or flip tiles, but not bothPlayers take turns placing or flipping tiles starting with Red. You either place one tile with your color showing or you flip one or more enemy tiles to your color. You never both add and flip tiles in one turn. If you have a placement or flip available you must do one of them. Otherwise you must pass until you do have a move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTile placementYou can place a tile adjacent to an enemy tile or adjacent to nothing. You must never place a tile adjacent only to your own tiles. You must never place a tile that reduces your number of groups.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTile flippingFlipping a tile must accomplish two things. It must decrease your number of groups and decrease the total number of groups - yours plus your opponent&rsquo;s. Flipping is not mandatory, unless part of a multiple flip sequence (see below).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMultiple flip sequenceWhen you flip a tile, and while it&rsquo;s still your turn, you may be required to flip additional tiles. If it&rsquo;s possible to flip any tiles subject to the preceding section, &quot;Tile flipping&quot;, which are adjacent to a tile flipped earlier in the same turn then you must flip one of them. If it&rsquo;s still possible to flip more tiles adjacent to tiles flipped earlier in the same turn, you must flip another one, and so on. Your turn concludes when no more tiles adjacent to currently flipped tiles can be flipped. Tiles can be flipped in any order in a multi flip sequence. Which tiles get flipped in a multi flip sequence is not necessarily predetermined. Sometimes a player has a choice.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tObject of the gameThe game concludes when there are no more legal moves available. NOTE: Tiles can still be flipped after the board has filled up. The object is to have the most tiles on the board when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of the game is to either accumulate $1 million in winnings or match all six &quot;Big Deal Lotto&quot; numbers on their card.<br/><br/>Each player takes one score card that has three lottery games on it: Triple Play, 4-Play and Big Deal Lotto. They are then given $40,000 to start play.<br/><br/>Through rolling a die and moving around the board, players can play various lottery games in an effort to accumulate the $1 million goal, or earn or lose money on event spaces (i.e. - Auto Accident, Pay College Tuition, Inheritance, etc.). On each of those spaces, the amount won or lost is determined by the number they roll after landing on the space. If a player cannot afford to pay a penalty, they can either pay what they have or pay nothing and miss their next turn, but no player is ever eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>In Triple Play, a player pays $400 to the bank and chooses one of the Triple Play number sets on their card and roll three dice up to three times trying to match those numbers. If successful, their winnings are based on how many turns it took out of the three to match the numbers. If they are unsuccessful, they win nothing and their turn is over.<br/><br/>4-Play is the same as Triple Play, but with higher payouts, and the player rolls four dice up to four times. They also pay $500 to play it.<br/><br/>Big Deal Lotto requires a $1,000 payment, and the player rolls one die. If the roll matches a number on their card, they cover it with a chip and and are on step closer to winning.<br/><br/>Players may also join in on another player's lottery by being the first to shout &quot;Big Money&quot;, but risk paying that player if they are unsuccessful in the lottery being played. There is also an &quot;Investment&quot; space where players can put up between $1,000 and $10,000 in an effort to multiply their winnings.<br/><br/>For a longer game, winning requires a player to both acquire at least $1 million, as well as match all six of their Big Deal Lotto numbers.<br/><br/>",

Their objective is to take down Dr. Moreau, a brilliant but mad scientist who retired in a lost island to carry out atrocious experiments on humans and animals in an effort to create, in his lab, a super-being.<br/>The game offers an unprecedented approach to traditional board game-play where technology, in the form of a very intuitive Web-APP, is introduced. Besides performing many random game functions a new very exiting feature was created: the Map Maker. As the game progresses the A.I. will indicate which new Map-Tiles are to be added to the Map Puzzle. This way, players will have to re-adapt their strategies according to the configuration of the map. All maps will be different and the chances that you will play a map twice is highly unlikely. Besides this, the Web-APP allows players to play (each with their own board game) remotely and in real-time. <br/>Character and weapons upgrades, an underground labyrinth , over 50 weapons and inventory items, many actions to chose from, Attack / Defense tactics, the need to manage physical as well as internal resources and a compelling story-line are the main ingredients of this cyberpunk horror cooperative board game that is the first of an incredible trilogy where the line that separates humans from animals is blurred.

The details and the nineteenth-century style allow players to immerse themselves in a romantic atmosphere, bringing them back to the era of the origins of mountaineering.<br/>The rules of the game, on the other hand, have been revisited and are introduced by a story, with the aim of making the game not only fun but also educational.<br/><br/>It is a kind of goose game with 80 stages. <br/>At each stage the player can be favored or penalized by the rules of the game: she/he can stop, proceed or even retreat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player picks a dice and whoever gets the highest value wins.  Seems fair, but in fact you will always be able to pick a dice with a better chance of winning-no matter which dice you friend chooses first!  If you play 'best of ten rolls' you'll be the champion almost every time.  The dice are not weighted, they roll perfectly fairly.<br/><br/>The secret lies in their unusual numbers.<br/><br/>Non-transitive dice set discovered by Dr. James Grime of Cambridge University. This set has ten dice, two each of five different colors. When rolled singly, green tends to beat red, red tends to beat yellow, yellow tends to beat blue, and blue tends to beat purple. So you might think green is the best die and purple is the worst. But here is the twist: purple beats green, so there is no best! Even stranger, with two of each color (ten dice total), the order of which color beats which reverses direction. The set of ten includes color instructions and a cloth bag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Win in one turn at any time. You&rsquo;re never out of it. Features a novel scoring system.<br/><br/>Air Master is a unique Push Your Luck game, where you fly your way to victory by navigating favourable winds.<br/><br/>But catch the bad ones, and make no progress, or even be blown backwards!<br/><br/>Note the ones that work and find the easy routes to lift the SAVVY crown.<br/><br/>Occasionally during the game, strong headwinds occur, and any gains are lost.<br/><br/>In the final rounds, tropical storms can wreak havoc, and force you further back from where you started.<br/><br/>You have options though, of sitting out potential storms by backtracking, and waiting for it to pass. Or to backtrack at certain stages, and check out alternative flight paths.<br/><br/>You can see the wind strengths you face at each moment of your turn, represented by numbered playing cards.<br/><br/>Taken into consideration with the accompanying wind chart, which shows which cards have already been played, you can see before you call, the success of any choice you make.<br/><br/>The combination of chart and numbered cards make it a very exceptional, and accurate weather forecasting mechanic. Outcomes are based on known probability before you make a call and not random luck.<br/><br/>After each successful forecast, you can call again, and your plane can keep moving forward. However, you must judge when it&rsquo;s time to bring that part of the journey to an end, as a subsequent wrong weather call will blow you off-course, and lose the progress you have just made.<br/><br/>Misjudging the weather for first calls on turns in the closing stages, equivalent to heavy storms will force your plane back, up to five rows from original starting positions.<br/><br/>There are also random squall areas where you must backtrack a row if wanting to shelter.<br/><br/>Being in the lead is not a given for success. Your progress is never certain, planes can go forwards, and backwards too. Any player can go on a run at anytime and win the game in one turn.<br/><br/>Due to the high average call success rate, (over 75%), it&rsquo;s very easy to rack up quick points, but you have to put your main focus on when to stop and bank those gains.<br/><br/>Air Master is a non-confrontational game, apart from tactically leaving difficult weather cards for the next player to deal with. However, you are still competing against each other to hit the winning line first. Risks have to be taken, but when?<br/><br/>This is a simple game with odds judgement that will tax even the brightest minds, and levels of addiction that compel you to get involved with other player decisions.<br/><br/>You may find yourself encouraging players to go for it, when really you want them to blow out and drop points. Oh there&rsquo;s humour alright.<br/><br/>But when the same players then go on long winning runs, you actually want them to succeed. There&rsquo;s a natural impulse to take interest in other players turns.<br/><br/>Then there&rsquo;s your playing style. Are you an odds calculator who plays the  percentages?<br/><br/>(If you&rsquo;re into maths and probability, this is right up your street, and you will find good methods of play).<br/><br/>Or are you an instinct player who gets the feel of the cards and plays accordingly?<br/><br/>(Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see a lopsided number chart, and know a change is coming).<br/><br/>Or never mind all that, you feel lucky and call whatever comes into your head; it's your day right?<br/><br/>( Only when all the luck is with you!)<br/><br/>Or should you play a mix of all three?<br/><br/>Air Master is a game where you sometimes have to step outside your comfort zone, no matter what your base impulses are. <br/>Have you got the nerve to go against your natural instincts if it may win you the game?<br/><br/>So  back to the game, do you play, or pass and give the next player something to think about? No thanks there!<br/><br/>Get it wrong and there are penalties. Get it right and you&rsquo;re on a roll.<br/><br/>Correct calls win points. Fifteen will win it. You can be nearly there, and then start dropping back.<br/><br/>Can you handle the sympathy?<br/><br/>Then there is the fantastic help from your fellow players.<br/><br/>If you want to follow it, dream on &ndash; you&rsquo;re in the wrong game.<br/><br/>Banter has no boundaries here, and some of the advice on offer would make your progress very backward indeed.<br/><br/>Sometimes you will remember a game for the laughs you had, the winner is irrelevant,  well nearly. That&rsquo;s how game sessions go.<br/><br/>Lots of humour and constant dilemmas. &lsquo;&rsquo;Air Master&rsquo;&rsquo;is a one-off rollercoaster.<br/><br/>For 1-6 players, aged 8 and upwards, and a playing time of 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>The solo mode is limited by the number of plays through the deck. Ten minute playing time.<br/><br/>All age groups can understand the easy game mechanics, and many game plans can be devised, from simple hunch and feel, to varying degrees of mathematical strategies.<br/><br/>Experienced pilots judge the moments well, win more and earn the SAVVY crown.<br/><br/>Components: Game board, number chart, Duo board, 36 playing cards, 6 planes, 6 position markers, 1 squall disc, 1 crown, 35 markers.<br/>1-6 players, 8+, 30-60 mins.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Setup: Look through the cards and note the first number from 10 to 14. Place the blue squall disc on this same number on the game board.<br/><br/>Place a plane and position marker on the zero row for each player.<br/><br/>Place the SAVVY crown on the Win row.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards and put one card aside face down. Lay the deck face down and turn over the top card and place beside it. Cover this number on the chart using the green marker.<br/><br/>(When the deck is depleted during the game, shuffle all the cards, including the card put aside, except the last turned up card, which becomes the new starting point).<br/><br/>How to Play: Choose a player to make first call as to whether the next card is higher or lower. There is a smoother game flow experience if one player manages the cards.<br/><br/>Choose a player to manage the number chart.<br/><br/>After each successful call, move the marker one row forward. If you then make an incorrect call, the marker  is returned to the plane, and no progress has been made.<br/><br/>After successful consecutive calls, you may choose to stop, and move the plane forward to join the marker.<br/><br/>After unsuccessful calls, the turn is ended, and play moves clockwise.<br/><br/>Rows 0-3:<br/><br/>You may call again after an incorrect first call, one Free Go per turn.<br/><br/>You may pass your turn on rows 1-3 without penalty.<br/><br/>Rows 4-9:<br/>  <br/>At the start of your turn, before calling, you may choose to change the top card. However, move your plane and marker back a row.<br/><br/>You mass your turn without penalty.<br/><br/>(If you change the top card and then pass, you will have moved back one row).<br/><br/><br/>Rows 10-14:<br/><br/>If you make an incorrect first call, move your plane and marker back to row 9.<br/><br/>You may choose to change the top card but move your plane and marker back a row.<br/><br/>You may pass on your turn but move your plane and marker back a row.<br/><br/>(If you change the top card and then pass, you will have moved back two rows).<br/><br/>If you change the top card and then make an incorrect first call, you move back to row 9.<br/><br/>Blue disc: This represent a squall. If you elect to stop when on one of these rows, you move back a row.<br/><br/>If you want to pass or change the top card, and that action puts your plane back to a blue row, you move back another row.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the Win area claims the SAVVY crown.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The goal is to either reach one of the two designated fields at the opponent's base line without the piece being eliminated in the next turn; or to eliminate all pieces of the opponent.<br/>A piece always moves exactly three orthogonal steps, with turns being allowed. If a piece reaches an opponent's piece's field, it captures that piece. Players can re-introduce captured pieces of the opponent on certain fields on the grid, but these pieces are marked; if they are captured again by their original owner, they are out of the game.<br/><br/>",

Ships travel between adjacent planets on the grid, which expands as more planets are discovered. The planets of your color are your home planets.<br/>Medium pyramids are ships, which you use to travel from planet to planet making deliveries and establishing stations. You control three ships of your own color.<br/>Small pyramids are goods, which are the commodities being picked up and delivered by your ships. The inhabitants of each planet desire goods of their planet&rsquo;s own color. When you deliver a good to each of your home planets, you establish stations there.<br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to establish 3 stations, one at each of your home planets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Monkey Spank! game, one card is placed face up in the center of the table and players are dealt the remaining cards face down. Players simultaneously reveal the top card from their decks and try to find the symbol in common with their card and the center card. Which ever player is first to yell out their matching symbol (for example, &quot;ball gag!&quot;) places their card as the new center card. That player then reveals the next card in their deck and all players repeat the process. The first player that runs out of cards in their deck is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A key player in the Central Powers, Austria-Hungary and its territorial ambitions represented a match to the tinder-box that become World War I. <br/>The Hapsburgs, namely Emperor Franz Josef, dreamed the dreams of conquerors. Ever an expansionist, Josef&rsquo;s latest conquest was Bosnia-Herzegovina. And it was a Bosnian Serb that assassinated Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia followed on 28 July 1914. On 1 August Germany declared war on Russia, the protector of the Slavs. Within a few days Austria declared war on Russia, then on Belgium on 7 August. By the end of 1914, Austria-Hungary and Germany would be at war with France, Britain and Japan, and later, following the attack on Serbia, Montenegro. There were setbacks in the campaign against Russia in Galicia. The Austrian army had more success in 1915, and by the middle of 1916 had conquered Serbia and Montenegro, pushed the Russians back from Poland and by the end of 1916 a combined German-Austrian-Bulgarian attack knocked out Romania. The Austrians also had to face Italian attacks on the South Tirol and the Isonzo River. It was the success of British and French reinforcements, reaching the Balkans and Italy, that forced the Austrian Emperor to sue for peace in October 1918. On 29 October, as the Austrian Army fell back from the Piave River, British and Italian aircraft fired into the fleeing columns. <br/>The Austrian armistice took effect on 4 November 1918. <br/>A total of 1,495,200 Austro-Hungarian soldiers died during World War I.<br/><br/>Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL I and all preceding GWASL modules are required to play.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Polish Legion &ndash; Kostiuchnowka, Ukraine, June 8th 1916<br/>     Bread Not Blood &ndash; Radoszyce, Galicia, November 20th 1914<br/>     Brzo, Brzo! &ndash; Radoszyce, Hungary, November 17th 1914<br/>     Polish Hill &ndash; Kolki, Hungary, July 4th 1916<br/>     To The Very Last Hour &ndash; Przemysl, Galicia, March 20th 1915<br/>     Cossack Terror &ndash; Buczacz, Hungary, June 8th 1916<br/>     Opportunity In Bukovina &ndash; Okna, Austria-Hungary, June 6th 1916<br/>     The Rojische Bridgehead &ndash; Rojische, Ukraine, June 9th 1916<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Command an elite group of death-defying spaceships desperately harvesting energy from a dying star before it explodes in this game of orbital mechanics. Utilizing a unique spiral gameboard inspired by the ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (previously reconstructed and released by the same game designer, Zach Horton), Supernova requires you to make tough choices, as all of your ships must share the same energy allotment, and it is never enough to power them all at once.&nbsp; The more you power, the fewer Boost Points each one receives, restricting its maneuverability.&nbsp; This is a high-stakes tradeoff, as the star's gravity pulls all of your ships ever closer. You'll need to boost your orbits to keep from burning up.<br/><br/>Ships move in a counterclockwise spiral toward the star at the center, while the star releases energy bursts (cubes) that travel clockwise toward the edges of the board.&nbsp; The core of the game lies in the interactions between the energy cubes and ships as they collide.&nbsp; Different types of cubes behave differently, but all are dangerous and all are valuable if you can capture them.&nbsp; Clear and yellow cubes can be stored and used as energy to perform special actions, while yellow and red cubes count as victory points at the end of the game.&nbsp; These energy cubes serve as your primary obstacles, primary goal, in-game currency, and victory points.<br/><br/>Players take turns deciding how many ships to power and then moving each one according to both gravity and Boost Points.&nbsp; Ships can form special formations to help protect them, block your opponents, and collect energy cubes.&nbsp; After players have taken their turns, each round ends with a &quot;star action&quot; that moves the cubes on the board and releases new ones.&nbsp; The sequence of star actions is determined by randomly drawing cards when you set up the game.&nbsp; Thus every game is completely different.&nbsp; Players can only see the star cards for the current and next rounds, and therefore have limited information about future conditions.&nbsp; Despite this element of long-term uncertainty, however, there is no other luck in the game.&nbsp; Players have complete control over the outcomes of their actions.<br/><br/>Supernova is relatively easy to play, but exceptionally difficult to master, as it asks you to think in spiral rather than linear geometry.&nbsp; The game's mechanics offer many possible ways to achieve your goals, but far more options become available when you begin to work with rather than against the spiral: sometimes the most efficient path from A to B is the long way around...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Antonio Vivaldi would have composed the oratory Juditha triunphans devicta Holofernis barbarie to celebrate this great victory.<br/><br/>In Corf&ugrave; 1716 you will find 12 Venetian combat units, divided into 6 German Mercenary units, 3 Italian infantry units and 3 Ultramarine infantry and 20 Ottoman combat units, divided into 4 Janissaries units, 9 Kapikulu infantry and 7 auxiliary Serhaddkulu units representing the regiments and units employed during the siege. <br/>There are two Morale chits for a total of 34 pieces, 2 d6s, a map, 9 Special Event Cards and the rules.<br/><br/>The map represents the area where the battle took place; it is used to register the orders and the consistency of the two armies. <br/>The map is divided into Area, where to deploy the units and where the actions take place during the 20 turns. <br/>There are the Combat Tables, with the result of the Combat and the Morale Track, which registers the Morale level of the two armies and the Turn Table.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Because the alien experts don't know what humans were actually like, they can infer results that might be based on complete nonsense. Because YOU are the expert, however, no one can say &quot;You're wrong!&quot;<br/><br/>The scoring in the game inspires collaborative storytelling.

        "description": "This is a mashup of chess and checkers.  Set up a normal chess game but with 8 checkers on each side where the 8 pawns normally go.<br/><br/>The chess pieces move, attack, and capture as they normally do, including castling.  The checkers move and capture (jump) as they normally do, diagonally.  Checkers that reach the other side get kinged.  If a checker can jump another checker or chess piece (or double or triple jump etc.), it must jump those pieces.  If your checker must jump your opponent's piece(s), but you're also in check, you must get out of check instead of jumping with the checker.<br/><br/>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king either by an attack from a chess piece just like in chess, or threat of being jumped by a checker piece that the king can't avoid.<br/><br/>I invented this game and the first time I tried playing it (about 15 years ago), I didn't think it would be any fun, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It broke my brain as I mixed the two games in my head.  I had to play chess while making sure my chess pieces weren't lined up in such a way that they could get double jumped!  I also liked the fact that I could force moves on my opponent by placing pieces in position to be jumped by one of their checkers.  Let me know if you find any rule collisions that I have missed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players try to resolve who is the murderer by working out who was with the victims. It is possible that one of the players is the killer or an non-player character (NPC).<br/><br/>The villa is represented in the game by an eight-sided cube. Each side has a transparent window and internal walls with doorways. The player pieces are put inside the cube and during the game it is turned about. The pieces move around, some to one room, some to another.<br/><br/>As players are moved around, they can collect evidence cards from a corresponding plan of the villa. Each player has alibi cards face down in front of them that they can look at. By meeting up in different rooms, a player can see cards held by other players or NPCs.<br/><br/>A murder takes place at 9pm, and each turn is ten minutes in the game. On the hour, another murder, then a third until the game ends at midnight.<br/><br/>The players must try to deduce who is committing the murders and with what weapon, where and when. As the game progresses, players can make their claim by passing and becoming the start player. They score points if they identify correctly the hidden info for each crime.<br/><br/>Finding the murder weapon in the room is very hard but possible too.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Billions of years ago&hellip;<br/>Mars was a flourishing planet teaming with life and vast seas. As the magnetic field over Mars weakened, radiation began to dry up the seas and solar winds caused the atmosphere to deplete. This in turn reduced the planet&rsquo;s ability to maintain heat. After centuries of research, Mars&rsquo; leading scientists have developed a way to slow the depletion of oxygen and the cooling of the planet; however, it&rsquo;s too little and far too late. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the planet becomes completely uninhabitable. In this harsh environment, the few remaining races of Mars dangle from their last thread of existence.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Each player will represent a leader of one of the remaining races of ancient Mars. They will struggle to maintain the morale of their populace, while helping to keep the planet survivable for as long as possible. Players will also need to maintain control of lands to provide food, water and other resources&mdash;a task which may require force. Players will take turns placing multi-use cards on action spaces. The action space chosen will determine which part of the player&rsquo;s card is activated (political, civil, or military). As the game progresses, players will expand their influence to gain more powerful actions, develop technologies to help combat the planet&rsquo;s condition, gather resources to help keep their populace happy, and train armies to maintain their lands and resources. Each race is equipped with a unique ability allowing for various approaches to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When a player erects a barrier, they earn a gem of that color.  In lieu of placing a normal barrier on their turn, a player may also pay a gem to place a special barrier of the corresponding color.<br/><br/>If through either type a barrier placement a player creates a 1x1 isolated space, they may earn a bonus gem.<br/><br/>One round ends when one of the players cannot place an additional barrier.

The game has polyhedral dice in different colours (d6, d10, d20). Players are alchemistic hedgehogs who go around collecting dice on their spines, to deliver them to their storerooms and laboratories. Each hedgehog has their own circuit, moving dice around in a way similar to mancala games.<br/><br/>The dice are then combined to make more and more creatures, which earn the hedgehogs gold coins and victory points. By combining different sets of d6 dice, the hedgehog gains certain d10 dice. Then, combining those in sets earns d20 dice, which lead to the most rewarding creatures.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the hedgehog with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>A sensational new game woven by drafting dice around a mancala, mixing them to complete formulas and build up victory points!<br/><br/>You are a hedgehog alchemist. Every day you deliver magical materials to the Alchemist Guild for a rich old age.<br/>Your small hands are not enough, so you can carry the materials around by sticking them into the needles on your back. Collect snails, frogs, and small dragon materials and deliver them to the guild to earn gold coins.<br/><br/>After delivery, turn around again and return the materials one by one to the storage. Mixing the colors of the dice is the key to acquiring new materials (dice). To get an orange frog (decahedron), you need red and yellow snails (hexahedron) and so on! The guild will give you gold coins when you deliver the materials you have acquired. After delivery, store the rest of the material (dice) in the storage.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ballen met Stieren players make their own selection and draft action cards. Then, they draw a hand of five cards from their own decks of bulls and action cards. Taking turns, they play a bull and an action card in order to execute an attack or defense. The game is won by the first player to score five goals, or the player who has scored the most goals at the end of the game. You also win immediately if your opponent gains three red cards.<br/>A few tactical effects of your actions: when you gain a red card, you have to keep it in your hand, reducing your options from five to four.<br/><br/>In Ballen met Stieren, almost anything is allowed, including matchfixing, sliding and headbutting. However, you do risk penalties from the referee or the VAR.<br/>Tactical options: substitutions, using different bulls, counter, etc.<br/><br/>In total, there are 28 different action cards in this game, which can make the difference in combination with the attack and defense power of the bulls themselves.<br/><br/>As they say: the ball is round, the meadow is filled with holes, you never know how the ball rolls or how a cow catches a hare. In short: be ready for a lot of soccer humor, fun and suspense...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>(The description from the publisher uses various Dutch proverbs that do not translate well to English.)<br/><br/>",

Who will resist until the end?  <br/>A card game for everyone with an engaging mechanism, from 4 to 10.<br/><br/>Each player is given five tokens of the same color.  The oldest player shuffles the cards well and places the deck in the center of the table.  The objective of the game is not to remain at the end of the round with the lowest card in hand.<br/><br/>Starting with the player to the right of the one who shuffled the cards, and proceeding counterclockwise, each competitor draws a card from the deck, observes it and keeps it face down in front of him.  The player who drew the card first begins and, based on the value of the card drawn, he can decide: to keep the card, because he believes it is a high card;  &bull; to exchange a card that he considers low with the player to his right, who cannot refuse to accept the trade, unless he is in possession of one of the highest five cards (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), which he must reveal to block the trade. The round continues counterclockwise and ends when all the competitors have made their trades. The last player of the round (the one who shuffled the cards) can decide whether to keep the card he drew (or received from an exchange), or he can make the exchange himself by drawing a card from the top of the deck.  Once the play has been made, he reveals the card and invites the other players who have not revealed theirs to do the same.  At this point the player who owns the card with the lowest value among those revealed pays a token.  If two or more players have the same lowest card, they pay one token each.<br/><br/>The game continues by playing another round in the same way.  The deck is shuffled in turn (counterclockwise). * When a player loses all five tokens in his possession during the various rounds, he leaves the game.  The others continue to play until there is only one player left, who is the winner of the game.  If, at the end of the game, there are two players left with only one token and, at the end of a round, both have the same card, neither of them pays a token and we proceed indefinitely.<br/><br/>If, at the end of a round, at least two players discover a Jolly Cat, none of them pays a token and the players eliminated during the previous rounds will be able to return to the game with a token!<br/><br/>",

He then gives him a clue by briefly recounting the fact or describing the situation he imagined, avoiding pronouncing the emotion or making too explicit references to it (otherwise the turn is blocked and we proceed with another heat).<br/><br/>Immediately afterwards, the other players try to guess the emotion felt by the narrator, placing a vote-token on the board, near the square that represents the emotion that each one believes has been experienced and chosen by the narrator.  You can use them for voting tokens of value 1, 2 or 3 depending on how convinced one is of one's intuition.  Players vote one at a time, starting with the player to the right of the narrator.

One of the main sections of the book covers a number of the major battles of the period and provides scenarios for such battles as Fornovo, Pavia and Ceresole. The historical scenarios provide player with army lists for each battle, maps to allow players to set up the terrain and show deployment areas and also provides special rules specific to each battle. Using these scenarios players can explore these famous battles and compare their efforts to the historical outcomes of the day.<br/><br/>Another prominent section of this supplement covers mercenary units and generals. Here players can really get into the spirit of the Italian Wars by hiring famous mercenary units to include in their armies. However, players will have to bid against their opponents to get the best units and must be prepared to lose their favourite unit to the highest bidder. Each of these renowned mercenary units will have its own profile and special abilities so generals will be keen to include them in their armies.<br/><br/>What is also included in this supplement are rules for solo play. Solo play allows players to fight battles on their own against an opposing army which is controlled using the solo mechanism, a mechanism that will be trying equally hard to destroy the player&rsquo;s army as the player is trying to destroy their opponents. Using the solo play rules players that are new to the game have an enjoyable and interesting way to familiarise themselves with the rules processes before trying the game out against their wargaming friends and opponents.<br/><br/>The last main section of the rules covers the Da Vinci inventions. Those with an interest in the Renaissance period will be familiar with the marvellous and evocative drawings of strange craft that have endured through history. These fantastical and improbable creations are given &lsquo;life&rsquo; here and players can now include them in their armies if they wish (and can of course purchase the models such as the Da Vinci Tank from Alternative Armies). But don&rsquo;t worry, these inventions are unlikely to over-power more conventional forces. They are sometimes as unstable as they look, often providing more amusement than fear as they break down or crash out of the sky. Enjoy!<br/><br/>To complement these weird and wonderful inventions is a new breed of soldier trained specifically to fight them. Armed with new weapons, new tactics and near suicidal bravery, Renaissance warfare really is entering a new phase of destruction and brutality.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, for a little extra period &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; there is a section that deals with blessings and divine intervention. Commanders can call upon whichever religious authority their army ascribes to for a little &lsquo;extra help&rsquo; when it really matters. No guarantees of course - but if successful, the results can be most entertaining.<br/><br/>And finally I have included a section that answers some of the frequently asked questions that players have about the Furioso rules. Hopefully this will provide extra clarity and clear up a couple of points that escaped my attention first time round.<br/><br/>So as you can see, this supplement contains both serious and silly elements. I hope players enjoy both as I found both aspects equally entertaining when writing and testing out this supplement.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It's intended for non-gamers, beginners, and family gamers.<br/><br/>The players are cyclists who participate in the cycling race Tour de Pyramide which runs through the French mountain chain Pyramide Montes. The height differences are challenging even for the best cyclists in the world and many are the cyclists who fail to complete the race.<br/><br/>A deck of standard playing cards is used in the game. Players draw cards to move (luck), negotiate slopes (basic probability calculation: draw one card and pay or draw a second card to pay less at the risk of paying more), catch up (basic probability calculation: basically Black Jack), overtake (basic probability calculation: basically Black Jack), and take their chances with an event table (luck). The players also have 10 stamina tokens which represent their physical endurance, and they need them to negotiate slopes and redo movement. A player who can't negotiate a slope is out of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player manages to complete three laps. That can be a rather difficult task, so if no one manages to complete three laps, the player who has reached the farthest wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The players are dealt five cards with the first player receiving six. The person with the Heart 4 begins the game, and must first play a single number, at least two identical numbers, or at least three ascending numbers that include the Heart 4. Below are the general rules for the cards that can be played.<br/><br/>1. Single number (2 is biggest, 3 is smallest, Jokers are sometimes used).<br/>2. At least two same numbers of differing suits. Example: Heart 3 and Spade 3.<br/>3. At least three numbers in ascending order, the suit does not matter. Example: Heart 3, Spade 4 and Club 5. Note that playing 2 (the biggest card) followed by the 3 (which is the smallest) is invalid in this case since it is not ascending.<br/><br/>Notes: <br/>1. The combination 4-4-5-5-6-6 can also be played, and the same suits do not apply.<br/>2. Occasionally players can be extremely lucky and have six sequential cards, such as 4-5-6-7-8-9.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europe is in turmoil! The emerging Prussian Kingdom under Frederick the Great moves to expand and consolidate its power at the cost of Austria while the Franco-British struggle for global primacy has already engulfed Spain and leads both nations to seek new allies on the Old Continent. Will Russia and the Ottoman Empire, two seemingly disinterested parties, continue to watch from afar or will they join in this struggle for the dominance of Europe?<br/><br/>Ancien R&eacute;gime is a major expansion for Coalitions, a  game of negotiation and alliance-building for control of Europe. It comes with a new distinct game board, a 7th playable nation (Spain), and a variety of new components and mechanisms. This is not a standalone expansion; it requires some components from the Coalitions core box.<br/> Up to 7 players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the immense Seven Years&rsquo; War. <br/> Like in the Coalitions core game, the Ancien R&eacute;gime Expansion uses the Wheel of War mechanic to make downtime non-existent, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The twist is each player takes control of a cat and dog team who live in the same house, they have different goals but a combined score.<br/><br/>Players roll 2 dice and assign one to their cat and another to their dog for that turn (purr points and paw points). Using these they traverse the board, pick up, drop off, give and take toys, steal toys from other pets and even increase the value of their toys. Whenever a pet tries to steal from another, dice are rolled to determine the 'reflexes' and 'stealth' for each to determine whether the theft was successful or not.<br/><br/>Special Actions linked to each number on the die allow players extra abilities which are slightly different for the cats and dogs so pay close attention when assigning your dice to each pet. Special Actions can allow diagonal movement, move toys on the board, add new toys to the board, increase or decrease the value of toys by flipping the token or take a cat nap to save Purr Points for use later in the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In a battle of wits, will you be the one to create the most populated island?<br/><br/>Players play cards from their hand to develop or destroy islands. In Manitou, you play cards of your own color as well as of your opponent&rsquo;s color which creates a unique aspect of gameplay. Specialty cards (Whirlpools, Lighthouses, and Bridges) add an additional strategic element enabling players to take either an offensive or defensive posture.<br/><br/>After all the cards are played, the winner is the player with the single-most populated island. An island is one or more cards of the same color which share at least one adjoining edge. Each card has a number in the center representing its population and the population of an island is the sum of all the cards that make up the island.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seesaw is a Draughts-inspired elimination game, played on a hexhex board of size 4 or 5. Each player needs, in their own color, a large number of stackable tokens and tiles.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>In Seesaw the players command opposing armies of soldiers that can promote. Your army starts out as a single soldier in the bottom corner. This soldier stands on a tile of your color. This tile is your initial promotion area, and it will evolve as you deploy more soldiers. Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on.<br/><br/>The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size: <br/>(i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards and even-sized stacks move backwards, and <br/>(ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size.<br/><br/>This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>On your turn, you must either move a stack, or place a new stack.<br/><br/>1. Placing a new stack: <br/>A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell with a tile of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each time you place a new stack you first place a tile of your color on that cell. A cell with a tile on it is not considered empty, but tiles never count toward stacks-size.<br/><br/>2. Moving a stack:<br/>You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemy stacks, depending on its size.<br/>The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size. A stack may never step onto a cell containing a stack of its color.<br/><br/>2.1 Noncapturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions (&quot;forwards&quot;) or to the 3 downward directions (&quot;backwards&quot;), depending on the parity of the size of the stack. Up and down have their standard meanings for games where players sit on opposite sides of a board, like in Draughts and Chess.<br/><br/>2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a noncapturing move. However, if yet an enemy is in range immediately after you have captured (counting only the steps left over), you must capture again.<br/><br/>3. Promoting: Your odd-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to your opponent at the end of your turn. Your even-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to you at the end of your turn. When a stack promotes, you add 1 piece to it.<br/><br/>The object of Seesaw is to capture all your opponent's soldiers. More precisely: If, at the end of your turn, your opponent has no stacks on the board, you have won the game.<br/><br/>",

They will need to try to make it as appealing as possible, with a long track, plenty of locomotives and interesting scenery. Because at some point they will have to show the railway inspector just how good their railway is.<br/><br/>Every round players draft one card for every player. They can either play this card for it's effect or discard it for &pound;2. Played<br/>cards are either added to a players tableau or just used for some special effect like visitors to the railway.<br/><br/>The tableau is made up of track cards and complimentary cards tucked behind those cards. Players aim to be the first to have at least 5 track cards and a tucked locomotive so that they can play an inspector card to end the game.<br/><br/>Every body adds up the victory points on their tableau to discover who has the best heritage railway.<br/><br/>",

At their heart stride the Rubricae, implacable warriors who level salvo after salvo against the foe, marching at the command of the mighty Sorcerers who rule their fractured Legion. Around them come shrieking herds of Tzaangor, chanting cultists, twisted war engines, and immense beasts whose very presence triggers madness and mutation.<br/><br/>Led by the towering figure of the Daemon Primarch Magnus the Red, these sanity-blasting hosts surge into battle to work the will of Tzeentch.

At their core, the Thousand Sons&rsquo; mastery of sorcery means they fight a war of flesh and blood, but also of psychic mastery &ndash; only the strongest enemy psykers can hope to match their potency.<br/><br/>This 96-page book will give you everything you need to launch a crusade of eldritch terror across the galaxy, and make the most of the myriad units available to you.

        "description": "ムーミンボードゲーム： ニョロニョロフェスタ is a Japanese game based on characters created by Finnish children's author, Tove Jansson. Nyoro Nyoro is the Japanese name for Hattifatteners.<br/><br/>One day, a hoard of Hattifatteners suddenly appears in Moomin Valley and starts causing trouble. But when a witch teaches valley residents how to deal with the intruders&mdash;and also a way to get their hands on some treasure&mdash;an even bigger ruckus ensues.<br/><br/>Players catch the Hattifatteners and exchange them for treasure cards. The player with the most points from their collected treasure cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Players can exchange as many Hattifatteners at once as they wish for a big payout in treasure&hellip;but if they are too greedy and capture too many Hattifatteners or if they have been forced by other players to catch Hattifatteners, their fate will be ultimately left up to the roll of a die. The player who takes a risky gamble in moving around the Hattifatteners might very well end up being the winner!<br/><br/>The game is a mix of a sugoroku (or a &ldquo;snakes &amp; ladders&rdquo;-esque board game) and a battle to collect Hattifatteners. On each turn, a player rolls a single die and moves forward the number of spaces corresponding to what was rolled. If a player lands on a space with a Hattifattener, he or she may move one of the Hattifattener pieces on the board (either from the Hattifatteners Island or within the Moomin Valley).<br/><br/>When moving a Hattifattener from the Hattifatteners Island, the player rolls a die and moves a single Hattifattener the corresponding amount of spaces to the number rolled.<br/><br/>Eventually, players will move into the Moomin Valley and catch the Hattifatteners.<br/><br/>In some cases, a player may land on a &ldquo;Go to Hobgoblin&rdquo; space. He or she moves his or her player token to the Hobgoblin space and draws a card from the Hobgoblin card stack.<br/><br/>In other cases, players may land on the A, B, or C spaces which enable them to immediately enter the Moomin Valley.<br/><br/>When in the Moomin Valley, players roll the dice to (1) move a Hattifattener and then (2) move their own player token. If a player lands on the same space as a Hattifattener, they can capture it. Some spaces may have multiple Hattifatteners.<br/><br/>After capturing Hattifatteners, players try to move to the Treasure Card space in order to exchange their Hattifatteners for treasure cards. A player can only draw from the Treasure Card stack if they roll the die to a number greater than or equal to the amount of Hattifatteners they have currently captured. If successful, a player draws the same amount of treasure cards as the amount of Hattifatteners they hold.<br/><br/>Treasure cards have differing point values and movement events.<br/><br/>",

And should you get your sister that heat-seeking butterfly cleaner she has always wanted? Well, now you can practice finding that special something for your special someone.<br/><br/>The Perfect Gift is a family-friendly party game for 2 to 6 imaginative players.<br/><br/>Each turn, one player is the lucky recipient. They select one card from their hand to represent the theme of the gifts that they wish for. The other players choose two further cards from their own hand to create an anonymous three part description of a gift - perhaps cute 'n cuddly boa constrictor slippers, or an oversized chocolate-coated snapping turtle. The players all discuss and debate the merits of each gift, and then the recipient chooses which one they would most like to receive. Whoever created that gift gets a point, and the next person becomes the recipient. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Thus they were in music, song and dance, to enjoy the meeting. In the rhythmic base of this musical species, the whole game is developed, that is to say that during a game everyone must repeat this sequence to accompany the game.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: Create a sequence of calls and audible responses (with onomatopoeia) without losing the rhythm that all the players do (key of candombe).<br/><br/>A card is dealt to each player in full view of all, which will have a gesture with a sound that will represent it. Once everyone has gotten into the rhythm of candombe, the game begins.<br/><br/>The rhythm must never stop!<br/><br/>",

In these 50 pitch-black riddles, bizarre stories are gathered around interesting ways to celebrate your eternal rest. And the most chilling thing about these stories: they really happened that way. Adventurous, funny, sometimes quite illegal - and 100% true! To match this theme, the coffin-shaped cards of the &quot;black stories: Ab in die Kiste!&quot; come in a high-quality box in coffin look, which makes the puzzle stories look even scarier.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>The card set contains 50 tricky, pitch-black puzzle cards for teens and adults to solve by asking clever questions. Cracking black stories together with friends is the most fun. One player, the bidder, takes a card from the deck, reads the short story written on the front of the card. On the back of the card, the master finds the answer, which he of course keeps to himself. Now the guessing people have to &quot;ask&quot; themselves the solution to the story. The questions should be formulated in such a way that the master can answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. A spooky and fun guessing game for small and large groups - can also be played digitally.<br/><br/>",

This is the only way to create the most gifts of chocolates and emerge as the winner.<br/><br/>The winner here is the player who was able to give away the most boxes of chocolates to his fellow players at the end. To assemble the perfect selection, you must follow the instructions on your order cards. But beware: you need imagination, a good eye and a lot of dexterity to create the perfect chocolate variation.<br/>    <br/>At the beginning, each player receives order cards on which certain praline arrangements are depicted. The players now have to reconstruct these on the moving playing field, following 4 swapping rules. Once you have completed an order, the order card is gift-wrapped and you may give it to one of your fellow players.<br/>    <br/>When one of you has given away his last order card, the game is over. However, the player who finishes first does not automatically win. It is much more decisive to whom he has given his praline creations - and whether he has also received plenty of gifts from the others. So it remains exciting for everyone until the points are counted.<br/><br/>",

You can stack your cards to increase their combat score.<br/><br/>In Battle Ace, face-down spare cards form a playing &quot;board&quot; area and the two armies (hearts and spades) are shuffled then placed in two face-up rows at either end of this &quot;board&quot;. A card or stack is then moved by the player on alternate turns.<br/><br/>Players choose just one action on their turn: Move, Stack. Attack, Pack<br/><br/>The game ends when either a king is killed/taken or a king reaches the opponent's back row. Bonus points are awarded for either of these.<br/><br/>The players add up the melee abilities (face-values of number cards, King/Queen/Jack = 10) plus any bonus points from achieving a win condition. Highest total wins.<br/><br/>Variations: There are optional rules for jokers, adding dice, campaigns and much more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Grande Guerre is a miniatures wargame designed for entire large battles of the age of Continental linear warfare during the 18th Century.<br/><br/>The rules abstract details the brigade level into combat factors and modifiers. When brigade bases contact one another, the infantry/cavalry combat system combines all actions troops took within musket range of one another, including skirmishing, musketry, and charges, while artillery can also fight at a distance  Simple but accurate mechanics allow players to concentrate on command decisions and the direction of troops, including grand tactical movement of reserves, rather than wade through the minutia of battle or numerous or complicated rules.<br/><br/>Players usually take the role of wing commanders, directing a few divisions, each of several brigades.  <br/>Many battles, such as Rossbach, can be played with one player per side. <br/>The game rewards historical formations and tactics, while allowing more gifted commanders to innovate within the capabilities of forces during the wars of Spanish and Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years War (in Europe). <br/>This game inflicts battlefield friction on the execution of command decisions. Each nation&rsquo;s troop types have historical characteristics that place them in the proper balance with the other forces of their era.<br/><br/>These thoroughly playtested rules are written primarily for the Seven Years War, but have an intrinsic module for the War of Spanish Succession, with just enough adjustments to cover the differences in tactics and operation while keeping most of the same basic rules.  Further expansions may cover the Great Northern War.<br/><br/>If players want to fight all of an 18th Century battle, rather than with some battalions or want to worry more about deployment, concentration of force, combined arms, and the commitment of reserves rather than where might skirmishers be, or when to change from column to line, La Grande Guerre is the game to play.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/>1. Determine initiative.<br/>2. The army with initiative moves each brigade or battery until all selected units have moved.<br/>3. Resolve all active player combats. Conduct general risk tests.<br/>4. The reacting side moves.<br/>5. Resolve all combat for the reactive side. Conduct general risk tests.<br/>6. Check for victory conditions.

So it's up to you if you want to risk playing your &quot;leftover pizza&quot; card when the category is &quot;Stuff that you can fix with glue&quot;. On the count of 3 everyone places their chosen cards face down. Whoever has played the most must reveal their selection and justify why each card fits the category. The other players all vote whether the selection is acceptable or not. If the majority vote yes, that player gets a point for each card as normal, but if the majority is no, they get no points for that round.<br/><br/>All used cards are discarded and everyone redraws to 7 for the next round.

Will the aliens help or pose an additional threat?<br/><br/>Escape Adventures is played in two phases: First, the players have to piece together a two-sided, round puzzle. Than they begin to solve puzzles. Some of them require to turn the whole puzzle around, as some important information is only found on one of the sides.<br/><br/>A booklet contains the story of the game that develops as players solve more puzzles. To see if they solved the current puzzle correctly, players use special puzzle tiles to see if their solution forms a continuous line of a specific color.<br/><br/>The game aims to bring the experience of an Escape Room to the home of the players. It can be played multiple times as no material gets destroyed while playing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 戦国ブリッジ (Sengoku Bridge), a trick-taking game, the players discard cards from an initial hand in order to draft special powers or conditions that will define the hand.  (Cards discarded are shuffled and redistributed so that players have the same number of cards in hand.)<br/><br/>Some powers allow a player to choose the trump suit, for instance.  Another power gives a player the Joker, the highest card in the game, which they can play regardless of if they could have followed suit.  Yet another power allows that player to never need to follow suit. There is another power that if a player can reveal a hand of cards that all share a suit, that suit immediately becomes trump.<br/><br/>Tricks are not worth any points, but collecting certain ranks is.  The player with the most points at the end of a hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It contains cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters, items, sentences, names of food and drinks.  Players take cards and shuffle them to form a deck, and this deck is used for the game.<br/><br/>In each round, one of a team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many words from the cards as possible in 60 seconds.<br/><br/>There is way of showing in one side of the card and word on the other side of the card. One player turns around top card and has to show or tell the word in a special way (i.e. only by hands and no words or by using only words starting on K,P or S). If the team guesses they get the card as a point. If nobody can&acute;t guess the word and time is up, next team plays.<br/>If the preprepared deck runs out the team with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And then invaders&mdash;the &ldquo;Umayyads&rdquo;&mdash;attacked with never-before-seen giant, bipedal robots. A neighboring league of interstellar merchants, the Hansa, never allowed the Castilians and Umayyad invaders to find peace. The arrival of Clan Goliath Scorpion settled their conflict, and gave Valencia a central place in the Scorpions&rsquo; new Imperio.<br/><br/>Touring the Stars volumes consist of a color cover depicting an orbital view of the subject planet, a short history section, a small number of RPG tracks tailored to the planet, a rules annex detailing optional rules for games and scenarios set on the planet, a color world map and a hexed Battleforce 2 map.

If it weren't for the evil wizard ... and the wicked witch ... and that treacherous court marshal!<br/><br/>You all get one character card face down in your hand, four cards are placed next to each other and also face down in the middle of the table. Always present are the prince, the princess, the good and the evil witch, as well as the good and the evil wizard. Who else is added depends on the number of players.<br/><br/>Depending on which card you are currently holding, you have a certain goal for your turn. The prince and princess want to get married, of course. The evil witch wants to cast a spell on the princess, the evil wizard on the prince. But their respective good versions try to prevent this. If they don't succeed, the court marshal laughs up his scheming sleeve. If the seer sees through the traitor's evil intentions, he has fulfilled his mission. And the court jester? He wants to stage a spectacular wedding.<br/><br/>The game is played over several rounds. In each game round, a character card is dealt to each player. Depending on the character, the player pursues a certain game goal. For example, the prince wants to marry the princess and vice versa.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get the most points, and you get one point for each Portal (number card) Opened (in front of you at the end of a round), as well as some bonus points. Each player is dealt 14 cards and then cards are passed until every player has one Magic (Ace) card. Then each players particular Magic card is played down to show their suit. Each turn you may play one card in front of you. God (face) cards are special action cards that let you take the action listed on it when you play it. Portals may only be Opened if the suit matches your Magic card. Once a Portal is Opened, you may Open Portals of others suits matching that Portals numbers too. And if you play a Myth (Joker) card in front of you, you can then Open Portals matching that Myth card too. A round ends once all God cards have been played.

The players have to find out 10 details per case: Who was the perpetrator? What was his motive? What tools did he use? And what exactly happened? However, before the cases can be solved, the players have to follow the perpetrators from one city to the next. In order to find out where and when the perpetrators will appear next, the players must carefully analyze the 50 case cards and solve puzzles. If the players need help, they can use clue cards. At the end of a case, the players take the solution card to check how many details they have correctly determined. They get one point for each correct detail.

Armies around the world are sending out their personnel, weapons and ammunition in order to combat this invasion. Your military division is ready to receive instructions. You have to rely on a network of civilian and military communication to locate the UFOs. Time is of the essence and you must speed to the last spotted location, hopefully with enough ammunition to either shoot them down out of the sky or hunt the down aliens that are on the loose! THE FATE OF THE EARTH IS IN YOUR HANDS!<br/><br/>Inspired by Jon Meitling's Palm Island, Invasion is the hand held solo game where you try to shoot down the UFOs and then hunt down any surviving aliens. Rotate and store cards to increase your military&rsquo;s ammunition, speed and efficiency. When you have enough, you can shoot down an UFO or hunt down a an alien. The further you progress, the more likely that UFOs or aliens will appear.<br/><br/>With &ldquo;ON THE FLY&rdquo; embedded variant technology, you can increase the challenge of the game or simply add variety to the game without having to add any cards. The variants are found in the top right corner. As head of a military division, your goal is to shoot down as many UFOs and hunt down as many aliens as possible At the end of the game, you will tally your score by the icons in the top left corner.<br/><br/>",

The winner of a trick take a face up display card into their Showcase row, while the loser takes the top card of talon into their hand unseen. Then another display card is dealt. After thirteen tricks, in the second phase, the last thirteen tricks are played out exposed using the previously won cards in each's Showcase row.<br/><br/>There are several unique constraints that guide the flavor and strategy of the game: Phase 1 is played &quot;All trump&quot;: a player has to follow suit but if they can't and play another suit that card automatically wins.  Only these ruffed tricks count as points in the first phase. In the second phase, the player with the least points in the first phase gets to choose trump (among any of the four suits, no-trump, or a repeat of the all-trump of the first phase).  All tricks count 1 point in the second phase. The other interesting constraint is that if a player leads a suit that the other player has in their showcase row, the other player must follow suit. Otherwise they may play any card.<br/><br/>",

These three figures are plush representations of &ldquo;Teuber&rsquo;s Robbers&rdquo;: three characters named Chief, Lucky, and Bert, who together are the personifications of the robber in Catan. The robbers were originally envisioned to be hapless and ultimately harmless characters who are constantly being vilified by the people settling on Catan.<br/><br/>As with the Catanimals, the rules of a scenario using these plush figures was made available, although in this case the rules were only made available in the German language from the Catan website.<br/><br/>Rules: <br/>In a 3-4 player game, only two of the plush robbers are used.  In a 5-6 player game, all three of the plush robbers are used.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, none of the plush robbers are under the control of any player. A player may take control of one of the plush robbers if they have one of their hand cards stolen as a result of robber movement.<br/><br/>Once all of the plush robbers have been claimed, whenever a player has one of their hand cards stolen as a result of robber movement, the player having their card stolen may take a plush robber from the player stealing the card. If the player stealing the card does not have a plush robber, they may take a plush robber from any other player.<br/><br/>A player with control of one plush robber has their hand limit increased by three cards (they do not lose resources unless they have more than 10 cards, instead of the usual 7).<br/><br/>The robber may not be moved to any hex where there is an adjacent settlement or city belonging to a player with control of two plush robbers, unless that player is in sole possession of the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to capture the most points by matching cards and building stacks of cards. While regional rules may slightly alter how the game is played, some standard rules apply.<br/><br/>To gather a card from the table, players play a card from their hand which matches a table card in number, or matches the sum of two table cards (if the player has a 9 in their hand, they can gather a 5 and 4 from the table for example). Additionally, cards can be stacked (built) and taken as a stack on the next turn, but only if the player has the stacked number in their hand (for example, a 7 could be built onto a 3 to create a 10, allowing a player with a 10 in their hand to gather the whole stack on their turn). Face cards have no value and can only be gathered using matching face cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, if a player plays a card which matches several cards, stacks, or sums of individual cards on the table, the player may take all those cards. For example, if a player plays a 10 and there is on the table a 10, a stack of 3 &amp; 7, and individually a 6 and 4 the player may take all of those cards as their 10 matches the first individual card, the total stack number, and the sum of the individual 6 and 4 cards.<br/><br/>If a player can not gather a card, they must 'drop' a card onto the table from their hand. If all cards are removed from the table, the player who removed the last card immediately scores 1 point and proclaims 'Suipi!'. The other player must then drop a card to continue the round. &quot;Suipi&quot; is played over 3 rounds, with each round ending when both player's hands are exhausted. Cards on the table remain there between rounds. At the end of the 3rd round, when cards run out of players hands', any cards remaining on the table go to the player which completed the most recent match.<br/><br/>Points are scored per round as follows:<br/>Most cards = 3 points<br/>10 of Diamonds = 2 points<br/>2 of Spades = 1 point<br/>Most Spades = 1 point<br/>Aces = 1 point each<br/>Each Suipi = 1 point (scored during the rounds)<br/><br/><br/>     Note: depending on the village the game is learned in, scoring may be slightly different<br/><br/><br/>",

Shortly thereafter, to seal their alliance, they turned against the various independent realms of the Periphery. Over the next twenty years, the so-called Reunification War would rage, claiming more lives than the savagery of the Age of War before it, all to realize House Cameron's dream of a united humanity--at any cost.<br/><br/>Historical: Reunification War describes the first grand military campaign of the newborn Star League against the collected realms of the Periphery. Covering each of the four major campaign theaters in detail, this book provides a hard look at the formative years of the first Star League, and the fateful decisions that led them to usher in a new Golden Age for mankind by unleashing their armies against its most far-flung worlds.<br/><br/>",

The title includes up to a maximum of four players, who can however choose from the most iconic villains of Gotham City: Bane, Joker, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler and Harley Quinn.<br/><br/>Each villain will have a Criminal Plan to carry out, developed in different missions (such as taking control of specific territories or making certain results with the dice). Achieving a certain number of objectives will activate the character's special powers, giving the player various advantages during the rest of the game.<br/><br/>While the villains compete for the districts of Gotham City (following the traditional RisiKo dice-rolling mechanic!), our hero is not standing idle. When five 1's are rolled during a turn, Batman goes into action, clearing one or more territories on the board and wreaking havoc in the fight for control of the metropolis. Especially in the initial stages it will not be easy to watch, but it will always be a great emotion to swoop into our opponents. It will be less pleasant when it's our turn to face the Dark Knight, but that's part of the challenge too.<br/><br/>In addition to conquering all of Gotham, you can take home the game by completing one of three objectives, common to all participants. However, every time a criminal empire is definitively defeated, the player who accomplished the feat can choose to eliminate one of the conditions.<br/><br/>",

The game is based on the idea that workers (warriors) and resources (livestock) are two sides of the same coin.

In addition, the dominance of the colours over the area makes the management of your warband very difficult.

On your turn, you choose a number of workers to send to a given space. One worker occupies the space, triggering it's  while the remaining workers flip over to become the depicted resources. These resources can then be sold on a variable market, allowing you to buy skills, more workers, and Estates, which are the main source of victory points.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points after 3 rounds (short &amp; solo games) or 4 rounds (long game) is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Display cards are placed into a row in front of each player known as their showcase (&quot;la vetrina&quot;). Winning showcase cards gives you points, but at a cost: it if a player leads with a card matching a suit of a card in your showcase, you must follow suit for that trick. Moreover, cards from your showcase may only be used to follow, and your opponent sees your cards. For the second ten tricks, once the talon is gone, you play out your hand and showcase. Preparing  your evolving hand to win more points overall is a cerebral conundrum.<br/><br/>Some unique features include that in the first half it's easier to lose tricks than to win them (since phase-1 is played &quot;all trump&quot;: any card of an off suit wins). Simultaneously, the showcase allows the leader to determine if their opponent must follow suit or not-- so for connoisseurs of trick games there are new interesting puzzles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In Magpie, players play as a magpie who is collecting items (Sticks, Eggs, Worms, Seeds, and Shinies). Each of the players has a hidden bonus card that will enable all players to score points for certain collections. The players will also have a plus or minus value for the Shinies, which are totaled to provide a score.<br/><br/>Further, the magpie players are also fighting for control of the 6 areas. They may instead of destroying the hex space to gain a resource, write in their own player symbol. The player(s) who have the most symbols in each area will score points.<br/><br/>Magpie forces up to four players to really gather in tight as they will all be playing off of the same sheet. Wild interactions will occur and you may wonder if your friends are bird-brains or actually clever.<br/><br/>Also includes a solo player variant where the player is against Martha Magpie and her love for Shinies!<br/><br/>Magpie plays 1-4 players in 30-60 min; Language independent components!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

By occupying settlements in battles, players gain points that they can use to develop their army and settle free territory. Each nation has its own characteristics, so on the road to victory, everyone must use a slightly different strategy. The winner is the player who has the largest territory at the end of the game, but the victory can be sided with the occupation of a strategic place or the size of the army.<br/><br/>",

In turn-based battles you compete against the game as a team of 1-4 players (5 players with the optional Overlord mode). Random elements in the game setup and during the game always present you with new challenges, even if you play the same missions multiple times.<br/><br/>The expansion features fresh retirees and missions, an additional team of retirees hunters and an all-new Overlord game mode. The Overlord game mode is optional. With the contents of the expansion, you can continue to fight the game together. The new pensioner hunters can be freely combined with those of the basic game.<br/><br/>In the future everything will be networked - including retirees. Their countless high-tech implants and prostheses form a gigantic computing network, in the depths of which an artificial pensioner intelligence - or R.I. for short - goes unnoticed. - grows up, who seeks revenge on the youth-mad society because of miserable care conditions and a lack of respect for old age. As an overlord, a player takes control of the masses of retirees and, equipped with numerous special skills, competes alone against a team of retired hunters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantasy monster pet deck builder.  Create the ultimate team of monsters, beasts, and cryptic to compete in pet competitions. Collect pets, companions, and abilities of different elements and combine their powers to win the most trophies.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a deck of ten starter cards, and a starting pet. Your pet stays out on your player mat, ready to compete using its Beauty, Brains, and Brawn stats! Each turn, draw 5 cards from your deck. Some cards will add points to your pets' Beauty, Brains, or Brawn statistics.  Others have money that let you buy more powerful cards or pets from the marketplace.  Cards can also contain abilities that let you improve your hand, improve your pets, or sabotage your competitors! All cards also align to one of four elements. By pairing cards of the same element, you can activate even better abilities and add extra pets to your game board to help win competitions. After buying cards, placing pets on your mat, activating abilities, or any combination of those things, place your hand in the discard pile, and draw a new hand.  As the game progresses, your deck will grow more and more powerful!<br/><br/>Once the pets on your player mat, with the assistance of any cards in your hand that turn, have enough Beauty, Brains, and Brawn, go claim your prize! Each trophy has a unique combination of statistics required to claim, and once you've claimed a prize no one else can claim the same one. Trophies also give you victory points to win the game.  But be careful.  Once your pets win a trophy, they retire and you will need to purchase new ones for the next competition.<br/><br/>Play until all the competitions are claimed, then add up victory points from your trophies. Be strategic: some cards, including pets, also contain victory points that count towards victory. So don't assume the person with the most trophies is always the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During the Building Season, you can place and upgrade the buildings on your clan board. The Harvest Season lets you gather much-needed resources based on which buildings you have. Finally, the Raiding Season allows you to attack your opponent's clan, or attempt a quest through simultaneous action selection.<br/><br/>The key to victory is to outthink your opponents and send your Warriors where they can earn the most Renown, but be careful not to leave your precious buildings unprotected.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 1793, and France is in the throes of bloody revolution. Every day the Committee of Public Safety carts dozens of aristocrats and royalists to the hungry guillotines. But a mysterious hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, has been rescuing dozens of condemned Frenchmen and their families, whisking them away to the safety of England. Nobody seems to know who he is, for he and his League of supporters are masters of cunning and disguise. But can they continue to outwit agent Chauvelin and his guards who are determined to stop them?<br/><br/>Based on the novels of Baroness Orczy, this card game sets each player a secret identity and a different win condition. The Scarlet Pimpernel and his League try to rescue as many prisoners as possible, against Chauvelin and his agents for the Committee for Public Safety who try to execute the condemned. Depending on the player count, there may also be a corrupt guard, out to make as much bribe money as possible, or a tricoteuse (knitting woman) who simply aims to be near the heart of the violence.<br/><br/>The game is played over a maximum of seven rounds, corresponding to seven prisoners to be rescued, each with unique rule variations so that no two rounds are the same. Within each round, players must simultaneously place face-down cards containing coins, pimpernel flowers or swords at one of two potential rescue locations. Once all cards have been played, the location with the most bribe money (coins) is where the rescue attempt takes place, and at that site the fate of the prisoner depends on whether there are more swords (executed) or flowers (rescued). Players must use bluff and cunning to deduce the identities of the other players, then work with their allies to swing the outcomes to their favour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A folder of four game plans with dice and figures. Games for young schoolchildren, which introduce children to the world of animals, evolution and European birds. When they play, there is room for creating their own stories.<br/><br/>The folder is laminated on 2 mm thick cardboard and has a size of 98 x 34 cm when fully unfolded. The package includes a bag with a wooden cube and 4 figures and a set of chips made of hard cardboard.<br/><br/>The Poaching Game is a cooperative game where a team plays against poachers who steal animals. The goal is to secure a given number of animals on all continents and free the stolen animals from poachers. Players travel the world and save an animal when they enter a field with the particular animal. However, there are also hordes of poachers on the route, over which you have to win in dice fights, otherwise the animal will go into captivity. The tension in the game can be increased by putting more animals in captivity at the beginning. The game plan with the animals is set in a real map, so non-violent learning about the continents and their animals is ensured.<br/><br/>The Bird Game is a contribution to refreshing our birds knowledge. Players travel in concentric circles to a nest. You overcome cats in battles and run away from a storm, hawk or ornithologist. To enter the next circle, the player must collect 4 tokens, which you get when entering the squares with birds.<br/><br/>In Evolution, players run freely around the game board and on evolutionary accelerators you gain and exchange different parts of the body in exchange offices. The goal is to collect the body parts for the animal you choose and bring it to its field. At the end of the game you have the honor to describe or draw a monster in which you would evolve using all the body parts you have collected.<br/><br/>Crazy Animals is a simple game in which children compose torn sentences about animals in Czech and English. This is how sentences like &quot;I am a green giraffe singing in the fridge&quot; are created.<br/><br/>",

Each triangle has one or two numbers inside.<br/><br/>On his turn, each player first put a pawn in a small triangle of his choice, then draws a card and answer the same number of questions as the number in the triangle. If the answer is correct, he puts a triangle tile in notch and moves to another triangle otherwise it is the turn of the other player.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players put all of the triangle tiles of his color on the board or all the 36 triangle notches are occupied.<br/><br/>Every tile gives you 10 VPs. If you shape a hexagon with the same color you take 30 additional VPs. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

They will be traveling around their city sheet completing tasks with dice rolls. Certain areas require the  player to be an Airship while other tasks require the player to be an Automaton. Further still, there are two spaces that can be used by either.<br/><br/>Players will have to move each turn, 1 space as an Automaton or up to 2 spaces as an Airship. They will use their dice to Convert, move an extra space or two, or activate their area of the City. Players also gain powers and create combos by completing tasks in the City.<br/><br/>Opportunities arise for players who are playing quickly to trigger a bonus by moving back into Area 1 of the City which allows all players to Convert, but the triggering player to earn a special bonus.<br/><br/>The game plays over 12 revolutions of the City sheet. Each revolution will last a number of rounds determined by the players. Will they play fast? Will they play slow to do all of the actions? The choices are plenty!<br/><br/>Scoring is done for each area with the players having a grand total at the end. The winning Automaton will have to master the clock as well as plan ahead each time focusing to maximize areas so they can outscore their rivals.<br/><br/>Airships and Automatons can be played solo or with up to 4 players. There are suggestions for how to combine the airships and automaton cards, but with this print and play format, players can create any number of combinations they choose. Additionally, printing out a set of cards for each player allows them to choose their own combinations and see if their own skill can beat their opponents when using the same Airship/Automaton combination!<br/><br/>Get ready to roll and write in this all new Steampunk game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Coordinate your ships and their crew to claim and extract everything they can from these asteroids and return them to Earth for the biggest profit. The more you control the supply of one type of resource the more money you can make. But watch out for other competitors who want to expand their asteroid mining empires too!<br/><br/>Asteroid Empire is a 9 card game that puts rival CEO's of asteroid mining start-ups against each other to make the most profit. Can you make the most money and expand your space mining empire?<br/>The aim is to be the mining start-up with the most money once all of the nearby asteroids have been mined and the game ends.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of rounds in which players can explore or mine each asteroid. The player with the start token goes first, once they have placed a ship their opponent gets to place a ship and play continues to alternate until both players have placed all their ships (to either explore or extract) and the round ends. Once a ship has been placed in a round it cannot be moved or returned to the players hand. At the end of each round both players will retrieve all their ships and the start token is passed to the other player who will then go first in the next round. The remaining asteroids are not shuffled and left in the same order.<br/><br/>Once the last asteroid is claimed to be mined then the game ends and the materials extracted can be counted to determine who generated the most income. The income each resource is worth depends on how many cards of that resource each player has and is listed on each asteroid card with that resource type.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "W&oacute;dz plemienia (&quot;The Tribe Chief&quot;) is a very interesting adventure game that will attract everyone. You have to prove that you are the best candidate for Chief of the Tribe.<br/><br/>A true leader must be resourceful, well-planned, charismatic, and committed to trading. Candidates take a test to select who best meets the above criteria. In addition to entrepreneurship and strategic skills, the character and talents assigned to your character are also important. In addition, your village is struggling with the adversities of nature, and fate brings surprises and opportunities that are worth taking advantage of.<br/><br/>THE COURSE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The game takes place over the course of the year, and the passage of time is the movement of the pawn along the path of time. During each month, all players go through 4 Phases:<br/><br/>PHASE I - GROWTH<br/>In this phase, all players successively: multiply their inventory, take 1 inhabitant, and take the crop from their crops.<br/><br/>PHASE II - TRADE<br/>During this phase, all players buy or sell their 4 inventory tokens. Additionally, whoever has a purchase can go to it and sell tokens there, regardless of the general trade.<br/><br/>PHASE III - CONSTRUCTION<br/>In this phase, players can perform one of the three actions: set up a crop, build a store, or train a buying staff.<br/><br/>PHASE IV - FATE<br/>In this phase, the players roll the dice. Whoever gets an odd number of spots skips fate. Whoever has an even number of spots - he draws the &quot;Fate&quot; card for himself and is used to write it. If having a specific character trait gives you extra prots, it is written on the card and then we follow this notation.<br/><br/>The description of the actions in each phase is additionally written on the board.<br/><br/>After the end of the 4 Phases, we move the time pawn to the next month and start the queue again.<br/><br/>MAGICAL NIGHT<br/>When the movement pawn reaches the MAGIC NIGHT space, we read aloud what happens to the entire village. The record on the card applies to all players. If the holder of a character trait is treated specially, it is recorded on the card.<br/>After following the instructions on the Magic Night card, move the pawn to the next month.<br/><br/>EXCHANGE<br/>If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to pay something to the other, but he does not have the appropriate amount, he returns the inventory tokens to the bank, exchanges them for $ and pays the opponent. If one player has to give the other an inventory token, but he doesn't have one, he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 for 1 inventory). If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to give the other a citizen token, but he does not have one, then he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 per 1 inhabitant).<br/><br/>CORONATION<br/><br/>After the time pawn reaches this space, the points are scored<br/>individual players.<br/><br/>",

Orders can vary from a &quot;no meat burger&quot; to a &quot;special nico burger&quot; that includes tomato, cheese, lettuce, meat, and a bun. The deck also contains &quot;volume up&quot; cards that only add a single component such as onion or cheese. Watch out for tong cards which will force you to use the slippery tongs to fulfill the next order rather than your hands! Much like Jenga, the game ends when someone topples the burger tower. That player loses the game.<br/><br/>In addition to the balance mode, the game also comes with two 2 player modes, Nico Burger Cooking and Nico Burger Sandwich<br/><br/>Nico burger cooking is a speed variant in which players reveal several order cards then race to build and wrap up the burgers with the included paper wrappers. The fastest player wins.<br/><br/>Nico burger sandwich is a checkers/chess like variant played on the included paper board where players move their markers a single space orthogonally in an attempt to capture opponent's pieces by &quot;sandwiching&quot; an opponent's piece between two of their own.<br/><br/>",

The higher your priority, the more likely you are to be given permission to hunt that animal. Next, you all take turns placing your hunter meeples on the 6 different hunting areas. Each hunting area has different animals with different point values. If you have the most hunter meeples in a hunting area, you get to shoot first!<br/><br/>A final roll of the shooting dice determine whether you hit your animal or not! Each hunter meeple you have in the area is an extra shooting dice you get to roll. Will you play it safe? Or risk it for the big haul?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Building on the innovative gameplay of his Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series, designer Rick Young has reimagined the best parts of FAB to introduce a new game system: Battle Command. The goal of the Battle Command system is to provide a fresh and engaging way for various conflicts across different eras to be fought with minimal time wasted on setup and complex rules, making this both a great introductory system for new and veteran players alike. <br/> Each Battle Command volume includes TWO different games in one box. Volume I brings players to the forests of the Battle of the Bulge, and the sun, heat, and sand of North Africa during Operation Crusader. The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty, and time of play. With a low total counter count and density, these quick playing (though still realistic) simulations present players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted, and movement has been streamlined.<br/><br/>For those who prefer to use a paper map, or who would like to be able to set up both games side by side, we are including a double-sided paper map along with the double-sided mounted map. This is for those of you who have 3 friends who would like to play, or play at conventions, or just plain prefer a paper map.<br/><br/>Battle Command (BC) is a refinement and simplification of the old Fast Action Battles (FAB) game series. Those familiar with the FAB games will recognize that the scope is the same, with higher echelons, artillery, events, and combat assets that can be assigned as available. FAB however was rules intensive and procedural, and those elements have been streamlined in the BC series. Most players do not need to pick up the rulebook after the first turn or two, as everything you need to play has been printed on the map, including a flow-chart with extended sequence of play so that no turn segment will be overlooked, and your attention will be placed solely on the battle at hand. Special rules needed for each event are printed directly on the event cards, so you can play them and forget them without having to refer to the rulebook.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Two Rulebooks<br/>220 playing cards (110 per game)<br/>1 double-sided mounted map (34&quot;x22&quot;) with one game on each side<br/>1 double-sided paper map (34&quot;x22&quot;) with one game on each side<br/>2 counter sheets<br/>4 Player Aids<br/>2 dice<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

To that end, it is important for you to co-ordinate your strategies since Cerberus may wake if the strategy shifts. An awakened Cerberus head will attack to re-capture the souls it has collected, but you can possibly send it back to sleep.

After the dice have been rolled, players take turns shouting words that fit a topic. For example, if the topic is PIZZA TOPPINGS, you might shout &ldquo;Pepperoni&quot; or &quot;Olives&quot; or &ldquo;Anchovies&rdquo; BUT you can&rsquo;t shout a word that begins with any of the letters showing on the dice! When you shout a valid answer that the referee approves, you get to take a chip.<br/><br/>But be quick with your answers (like, two seconds max), because if the referee feels you're taking too long, they can ring the Awk-Word bell on you and you'll be out for that round! You'll be totally buggin, but don't worry, you'll be able to play again in the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues until each player has been the referee three times, and if you have the most chips, you win! Booyah!<br/><br/>Perfect for groups of friends, families and 90s lovers, it's suitable for ages 13+, 2-7 players and has an average 15 minute gameplay.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The animals in the Arctic are bored. That's why polar bears, seals, ice gulls and even the odd orca have arranged to play a fun little game: floating on the ice floes.<br/><br/>So without further ado, the animals jump around happily on the ice floes and try to form the largest possible groups with conspecifics. The orcas help where they can and the other animals pass the time cheerfully in the icy Arctic Ocean.<br/><br/>In this fun card game by author Martin Schlegel, 2-6 people aged 8 and up must have good eyes.<br/><br/>In each round, the aim is to find the best possible place for the newly revealed card in order to form the largest possible groups of animals of the same species.<br/><br/>How is the game played?<br/>At the beginning, 2 cards are placed in the middle, whereby it does not matter whether their islands fit together sensibly or not. The remaining cards form the draw pile.<br/><br/>Then turn over another card, place it in plain sight for everyone to see, and start a 1-minute countdown.<br/><br/>Now the &quot;let the heads smoke&quot; phase begins:<br/><br/>Which of you will find the best place for the new card? You should make sure that as many animals of the same species (polar bears, seals, ice gulls) as possible come together on the newly created floes.<br/><br/>If an orca can be seen on both maps, the points are doubled.<br/><br/>Within the 1-minute countdown, everyone now looks for the best place for the new map and you all note down the highest possible score.<br/><br/>At the end of the minute, you compare the numbers and whoever has the highest number of points has to prove that putting on the card also brings in the corresponding number of points.<br/><br/>If this is successful, the person receives 3 extra points in addition to the number of points he or she has written down; all others receive the number of points they have written down.<br/><br/>If this is not successful, the person goes away empty-handed; all the others receive their points and the card is discarded.<br/><br/>In the game instructions you will find 2 more variants: One where you outscore each other by calling out the scores, another with an hourglass. The scoring remains the same in both cases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",
