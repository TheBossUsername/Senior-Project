Where others recoil at the sight of travelers, Uzumaki is often the first to greet them and offer them warding runes and medicines in exchange for stories of the world beyond his clans&rsquo; hallowed forests. Social, skilled, and savvy, he is ill-suited for the more solemn life his clan&rsquo;s spirit-haunted trees offer.

Aim to drop your own cargo at the most valuable stations, while also having an eye on where the Ghost train is headed, and what your competitors are up to!<br/><br/>If at the end of a turn all the stations of one colour have cargo, then those stations are scored. All players can earn points for their cargo, and the player who triggered the scoring gets a coin. Once all 10 coins have been taken, the game ends and the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Good Little Trains is the first product of a new collaboration between the co-designers of 'Elysium', 'Costa Rica, 'Pyramids and 'Professor Evil and the Citadel of Time'.

After that, everyone draws 5 cards from their deck and the player to the dealer's left begins.<br/>When it is their turn, players draw a card and then play any number from their hand to the middle discard pile, face up. The card they play must match the one in the middle, either by its color or the expression on the ghost's face.<br/>If the player has emptied its hand (playing all its five cards), he-she may draw 5 other cards and continue its streak.<br/>When the current player is unable to discard a ghost from its hand, the turn is finished and the next player plays.<br/>The game contains Rainbow ghosts that can be played at any moment during the player's turn to change the color of the pile to the player's choosing.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his ghosts win, to get rid of a ghost, match the color or expression of the current top card of the pile. If nobody can play cards anymore, the player with the fewest cards wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "5 Stack is an exciting chip stacking game with the perfect mixture of strategy and chance. 5 Stack is simple enough that a 5-year-old can play it and interesting enough to captivate the seasoned board game veteran.  Proudly made in the USA, components include a game board, coloured wooden chips, dice, scoring pad, and instructions.  Designed by Jackson Robinson, and published by Kings Wild Project.<br/><br/>To set-up: Players all get 25 chips in their colour plus a single gold coin, and dice are rolled for a random set-up that adds five chips per player to a 6x6 game-board.<br/><br/>To play: In clockwise order players take turns to: (a) move a chip or a chip stack of their colour in a straight direction on the board; (b) place a new chip with the location determined by a dice roll. The game ends when someone has played all their chips and cleared all chip stacks under their control.<br/><br/>To win: The aim of the game is to score the highest number of points.  Points are scored by clearing a stack (when a stack under your control reaches 5 or more chips, with gold chips being worth 5 instead of 1 point each).  Your final score is the total number of &quot;cleared&quot; chips minus any of your unplayed and uncleared chips at game end.<br/><br/>",

Their tokens go into a bag that is drawn and played from on each Player Turn. Then, players select a Guild to represent, and take turns drafting their Agents, Items, Scrolls and anything else useful for the Game. This creates their personal inventory to create their dice pool as the game evolves.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, players will increase their Agents and Inventory's power and influence in the game. Each die bought makes your Guilds ability to resolve threats, respond to morale loss and fight the horrors of the dark! Players dice are bought from the cards they drafted at the beginning of the game as well as a few public Agents players can recruit from.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a player's turn, they pull a token from the Threat Bag and add it to the city space furthest from Wayword. As each city space fills up, threats begin flooding closer and closer to the city of Wayword. Along the way, Civilians may be injured, cities and locations may be destroyed but the real threat comes from foes reaching Wayword. If Wayword collapses, all the players lose. The Threat Bag also includes the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, who may get so fed up with his Troop's ineffectiveness, that they show up to cause their own brand of trouble! On top of all of that, the variable Scenarios in game may affect any aspect of play, from doubling Threat Bag draws to letting threats and foes move further towards Wayword but faster.<br/><br/>As Guilds build up their Agents and Inventory, they will defeat these baddies, stop these threats and rescue these Villagers. All of these things are worth Popularity Points (Victory Points) from the people of Wayword. If players confront and defeat the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, the game comes to an end and Wayword can rest easier!<br/><br/>",

Next, shuffle the deck, deal each player 5 cards, and set it face down. Draw 1 card and place it face-up in the centre of the playing area. The player left of the dealer has the first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, a player may place any card held on an open side of any card on the playing surface that create a 4 letter word, in a grid that expands in any direction, which scores the player points on the card played. If multiple words are created by the play, the card's score is multiplied by the number of words made. Thereafter, the player may play additional card, up to all 5 held at the beginning of the turn. The total score earned on all cards played is multiplied by the number of cards played, as a bonus. All cards played during a turn must be linked by at least one side. All words created must be found on the &quot;4 Letter Word List&quot; card.<br/><br/>To end a turn, the player draws cards to replenish his or her hand to a total of 5. If a player is unable to play even a single card, the turn is forfeited. Play continues clockwise until all cards have been placed.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Additionally, it has managed to power down all of our weapons systems onboard the U.S.S. Frontiersman. Usually, such a malfunction would be little more than a minor setback. It may even prove a useful piece of scientific and engineering research as the crew works on solving the problem and figuring out why the anomaly effects out ship in the first place.<br/><br/>However, things seem a bit more dire for us at the moment. The anomaly was right on the outer reaches of Kornathian space and we&rsquo;ve been set adrift near one of their war parties. They have no desire to stop and discuss the situation or work out terms of peaceful negotiation. Instead, they have opened fire upon us.<br/><br/>I, as the commanding officer of this ship, can not simply let this be. I have men and women aboard I need to protect. As such, we will continue to work on fixing the warp drive and powering up our weapons, all the while we will fight off these unwanted attacks. It seems our choices are either to get the warp drive back up and running, so we can light jump out of here, or defeat the capital ship that is leading the war party against us.&quot;<br/><br/>Charge Stations! is a science fiction roll+write game where a single player takes command of the U.S.S. Frontiersman. It is up to the player to repair the ship all while fighting off incoming attacks. This is done by rolling handfuls of six-sided dice (D6s) which represent the ship&rsquo;s crew members and assigning them to various tasks around the ship. All you need to play is a pencil, some dice, and this book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a miserly store owner, you want to provide the least amount of sausage in your hot dog buns as possible while still displaying the most enticing hot dog in the market. After all, you don't want to be left with unsold product. By using clay as the bread and different lengths of wire as the sausage, you will design five different hot dogs for your store, some of which may not even have a sausage at all! Then your fellow store owners will snake draft the sausages from other stores that they find enticing. At the end of four choices for everyone, the contents of the hot dogs are revealed. Those owners who held back or had the most unsold sausage lose points, and finally the positive points from everyone else's sausages are added up. Beware the very short sausages: those are great decoys, but worthless for scoring!<br/><br/>",

Each player may place a maximum of: 1 Linebacker, 1 Defender, and 1 Attacker. If, during the game, all 3 tiles a player draws are Instant Action tiles, he may use the Player Substitution rule. If he chooses to do so, he discards one of his drawn tiles and takes 1 of any of his Football Player tiles (placed next to the pile) in its place. He then continues his turn. During the course of the game, a player may make as many Player Substitutions as he has Football Player tiles. If a Football Player tile is removed from the board, it goes to the discard pile of the player who placed it on the board. If more than one player uses Futbolists during a game, each player marks the Futbolist he plays with a spare HQ damage token.<br/>You can still use the Unlucky Draw rule when playing with Futbolists.<br/><br/><br/>    Note: You cannot use Futbolists while playing Factions: Dancer, Mephisto, Death Breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Przed rozpoczęciem rozgrywki, każdy gracz może umieścić odkryte żetony Futbolist&oacute;w obok stosu żeton&oacute;w swojej Frakcji*. Każdy gracz może umieścić maksymalnie: 1 Liniowego, 1 Obrońcę i 1 Atakującego. Jeżeli podczas rozgrywki wszystkie 3 żetony, kt&oacute;re dociągnie gracz, będą żetonami Natychmiastowymi, może skorzystać z zasady Podmiany Zawodnika. Jeżeli się na nią zdecyduje, odrzuca jeden z dobranych żeton&oacute;w, a w jego miejsce bierze 1 dowolny ze swoich żeton&oacute;w Futbolist&oacute;w (umieszczony obok stosu). Następnie kontynuuje swoją turę. W trakcie gry, gracz może dokonać tyle Podmian Zawodnik&oacute;w, ile żeton&oacute;w Futbolist&oacute;w posiada. Jeżeli żeton Futbolisty zostaje usunięty z planszy, trafia na stos odrzuconych żeton&oacute;w tego gracza, kt&oacute;ry wcześniej go na tej planszy umieścił. Jeżeli więcej niż jeden gracz korzysta z Futbolist&oacute;w w czasie rozgrywki, każdy oznacza Futbolistę, kt&oacute;rego zagrywa, zapasowym znacznikiem Wytrzymałości Sztabu.<br/>Grając z Futbolistami wciąż można korzystać z zasady Pechowego Dociągu.<br/><br/><br/>    Uwaga: Nie można korzystać z Futbolist&oacute;w podczas gry Frakcjami: Dancer, Mephisto, Death Breath.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Real sea battles<br/>Admiral is a board game with the sea, sailboats, clear and very cool mechanics, a pirate addition and paintings by Aivazovsky. A great example of how an incredibly addictive board game turns out from a small number of details, which can be played both together and four, or you can even combine two boxes and play with a large crowd. The game has basic and complicated rules, scenarios and a pirate add-on.<br/><br/>Detailed study of the movements and combat actions of the ships, of course. Everything is simple: for each turn you have two cards common to everyone: the number of possible moves in different wind directions, and the state of the sea (when the wind is weak, ships can generally drift, and when strong, accelerate several times). The goal of the game &mdash; almost like in checkers &mdash; is to knock out all opponents from the field. There are guns and boarding for this!<br/><br/>As in a classic naval battle, ships from one successful shot do not sink, but lose their mast. The larger the ship, the more guns it can shoot, attacking or defending. Moreover, in order to shoot, you need to stand sideways to the enemy, and in order to board, go to his cage and press side to side, like real ships. But boarding allows you not only to injure or sink an enemy ship, but also to capture it by transferring your mast to it! (Remember that only your ships must remain on the field to win?)<br/><br/>Logical repair rules<br/>You can return the ship to your fortress to restore its masts instead of moving forward. But a fortress cannon is spent on each mast, which means that if an enemy sailboat approaches from the side of the fortress, where there are no more guns, he will be able to attack the fortress! Well, strategists and tacticians, are you ready for sea adventures?<br/><br/>",

Your ultimate challenge? A brutal battle against the formidable Dragon Slayer Ornstein and the fearsome Executioner Smough.<br/><br/>But success in this perilous realm hinges on one vital element: teamwork. Co-operate with your fellow Unkindled as you venture into locales once bathed in golden light, now lost to shadows. Your enemies are dangerous, their attack patterns and weaknesses waiting to be uncovered.<br/><br/>Alas, death is not the end &mdash; but the price of failure is high. Should one of your characters meet their demise, the game presses on, but with a heavy price. The entire party must return to the bonfire, each encounter resetting, and the odds growing ever more challenging.<br/><br/>",

The Carthaginians have three armies and the Romans four, the strengths of which are tallied in a chart off the map to save having a lot of counters. These armies are manouvered around the 17 regions of the map of Italy in a simple I go - You go framework, undertaking different actions including ravaging (for the Carthaginians) and combat.<br/><br/>The combat rules are straightforward and simple with a few interesting tweaks such as ambushes. In many cases conflict is restricted to skirmishing between the forces but  chance may cause a larger battle to occur. The Romans have to strike a balance between not risking having their armies utterly destroyed in battle by the wily Hannibal whilst not allowing the empire to become demoralised if the Carthaginians are allowed to ravage the land unimpeded.<br/><br/>The game, given to Society of Ancients members as part of their subscription in 2008, consists of a 20 page A4 rule-book with colour covers, a simple but adequate map and 36 counters which you need to cut out yourself.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to collect cards with the appropriate colors to complete Buntb&auml;r the bear's festive raiment.  The title is a bit of a pun as &quot;buntbar&quot; means colorful while &quot;Buntb&auml;r&quot; would sort of mean color-bear.  Actually, not just bears, but 12 different animals are featured.  The animals are sad because all of the colors have been pinched.  Collecting cards is their way of finding them again.<br/><br/>",

It is meant as a bit of fun and is in no way endorsed by Days Of Wonder, any Railway Company or the UK Government.<br/><br/>After playing Dave Millard&rsquo;s great UK expansion we collectively decided that it played very well but lacked a certain modern Britishness. The Ticket To Ride games exemplify an idealised 19th century railway system, not the crud we have today. In the UK news a week can barely pass without some train problem or transport minister making an arse of himself. So we decided to put our not so serious heads on and invent an expansion to Dave&rsquo;s unofficial map to bring back those elements we miss from our modern railway system.<br/><br/>Warning, if you have no sense of humour and have no idea of the calamities we have on our railway network you may just not get it!<br/><br/>Some example card:<br/><br/>     Incompetent Contractors: Tunnel built where not needed. Treat route as having 1 tunnel (can be used to counter &quot;Competenc Contractors&quot; instead)<br/>     Pending General Election: Suddenly money can be found to counter any problem. Cancel any other card played on you.<br/>     Government Meddling: Remove a route placed by an opponent and replace route with your own (you must have the cards to build the route)<br/><br/><br/>",

For example, you may have to read the following joke in a Siri voice:  &quot;The person who invented knock-knock jokes should get a no-bell prize.&quot;  Your team scores if you get the opposing team to laugh! Bad jokes have never been funnier.<br/><br/>Adults Only: This game contains mature content and is designed for ages 17+. It is not intended for children. Trust us on this one. Encouraged to be played with 2+ players.<br/><br/>Each player starts every round with 3 Joke <br/>Cards and 1 Delivery Card in hand. Before a new round, draw fresh cards and put the old ones in a &quot;used&quot; pile. <br/>Players take turns trying to make the opposing players laugh by reciting 1 of the 3 Joke Cards in their hands.<br/>After the joke is told, the 5-second &quot;Quiet Period&quot; begins. The joke teller counts down on their fingers. The opposing players must not laugh during the &quot;Quiet Period&quot; in order to win the point. If they laugh, the joke teller wins the point. If the opponents don't laugh, they each get a point.<br/>The first person to get 11 points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Thaxx is easy to learn with fast paced game play for ages 6 and up.&quot;<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll the dice. You either add a coin to the number on the board that is the sum of the dice or add two coins to the respective numbers. (e.g., if you roll a 2 and a 3, you could place a coin on the two and a coin on the three, or place a coin on the five)<br/>You may also use one of the numbers to remove one from your opponent's board and place it on your own. (e.g, take from your opponent's 3 and put it on your two). <br/>There are no sixes, sixes do nothing. In fact, rolling double sixes requires you to remove one of your own coins. Otherwise, rolling doubles allows you to go again.<br/>The first to cover all his/her numbers wins.<br/><br/>",

You possess absolute power, giving your whim the force of law and drawing the people of the realm into your majestic presence as ants are drawn to sweet, pure honey.  Unfortunately, you are not the king.  You are one of the ants.<br/><br/>The object of It&rsquo;s Good to Be the King is currying the most favor with the king by providing the most important elements for a series of events to honor him.  During the course of each game, the king demands that seven events be held for his pleasure.  These include such diversions as parades, hunts, feasts, and tourneys.<br/><br/>In order to do the royal bidding, players manage their hands in order to collect the things necessary to satisfy the king&rsquo;s demands while preventing the other players from doing the same.  Use care when getting rid of your cards, since what is useless for the Tourney may be vital for an upcoming Feast!  The player who has the most royal favor at the end of the seventh round of play is the winner.<br/><br/>Each set includes a Court Deck of 80 cards, a Chartulary Deck of 10 cards, and an instruction sheet.  It&rsquo;s Good to Be the King is suited for 3-6 players who do not mind backstabbing their opponents.  This fast and fun game of court intrigue and chicanery will be on store shelves this June, so round up some friends and prepare to be royally entertained!<br/><br/>",

The game ends after the sixth tournament, and the manager with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Before each tournament there is a travel phase where the managers simply move their two players (one amateur, one professional) to the next city by rolling the dice, possibly resolving events on the way. When a player reaches a city you can decide in which of the four quarter finals to place him, provided the tournament isn't already full.<br/><br/>When all players have arrived at the location the tournament begins. The winner of each match is determined through the best of 5 sets. A set is won when a players manages to roll a 6 (professional players have two on their dice, amateurs only one). The winners of a match advance to the next stage which is resolved in the same manner.<br/><br/>After the final match, the four best players receive prize money according to the prize table and can also collect one marketing contract each. Those can be cashed in after a tournament to obtain additional money, either individually or in matching sets while sets are much more valuable.<br/><br/>",

The game Brautkraut takes this tongue twister to the extremes as each of the game's 66 cards depicts two of the following four items:<br/><br/><br/>    Blau (blue)<br/>    Kraut (cabbage)<br/>    Braut (bride)<br/>    Kleid (gown)<br/><br/><br/>There is one pile, on which players place cards from their draw decks. On a turn, the active player has to say aloud, what was on the now covered card, and the one, the previous player just put on top of this. After having said this, he reveals one card from his/her draw deck and covers the top card.<br/>You have to check the arrow on each card telling you the order of the parts of the word, which have to combined into a compound noun, and if the next one is the same or not. When ist is the same, the player has to say &quot;bleibt&quot; (remains), when the new word is different, he has to say &quot;wird&quot; (changes into) between the nouns.<br/>For example, a player might say &quot;Brautkraut wird Blaukleid&quot; and p&ouml;aces his topmost card onto the &quot;Blaukleid&quot; card. The next player has to start now with &quot;Blaukleid&quot;, continuing with the now visible card ...<br/><br/>Additional confusion comes from three extra cards that circulate between the players and change the linking word from &quot;wird&quot; into the similar sounding trio of &quot;traut&quot; (weds), &quot;klaut&quot; (steals), or &quot;braut&quot; (brews).<br/><br/>If a player makes a mistake, she must take all cards played since the previous mistake. Whoever gets rid of all her cards first wins.<br/><br/>",

As a result, the game is not very &quot;nitty gritty&quot;, like Battletech, but takes a higher-level view of action.

Failed collectible cards games are the preferred stock, but anything roughly card shaped can be thrown into the mix.  Players draw and play as they see fit, telling a collaborative story and trying to come up with an excuse to claim victory.<br/><br/>There are a few guidelines:  On a player's turn, that player fills his/her hand to 7 cards, then plays 1 card...and does anything else justifiable by cards in play or in hand.  Additional cards may be played (even out of turn) whenever they seem appropriate based on their title, effect text, flavor text, cards in play, and any cards just played.<br/><br/>For example, a player might play &quot;Smoking Man&quot; (X-Files CCG), giving you an excuse to play &quot;Smoke&quot; (Magic the Gathering CCG).  Another player discards your smoke with &quot;Wind&quot; (Towers in Time CCG).  The next player takes a turn, adding &quot;Bad Tequila&quot; (Deadlands CCG) and &quot;Desperate for Air&quot; (Aliens Predator CCG) to the smoking man, then eliminates him with &quot;blankout&quot; (Cranium Promo) due to drug overdose.  The controller of the smoking man tries to save him with &quot;A Second Chance&quot; (Wheel of Time CCG), but is thwarted by your &quot;Unanswered Prayers&quot; (Imajica CCG).  His hopes of winning with &quot;Be a Winner at Al's Tobacconist&quot; (a business card) are dashed.<br/><br/>",

Roll too hard and you'll give a free shot to your opponent - too soft and you might score on yourself! With fun, fast-paced gameplay, Brass Ball &amp; Nerves of Steel is an addictive diversion that everyone will want to play again and again.<br/><br/>This game combines bowling and tic-tac-toe.  One side has 3 brass balls, the other 3 steel balls, and you try to roll your balls into the holes on your opponent's side.  There is a nice combination of risk assessment and dexterity: the farther up the opponent's side you get your ball to go, the more points -- the rows of holes score 1, 2 or 3 points.  If you miss and it rolls back into a hole on your side, it counts for your opponent's score.  And if you roll off the far side, your opponent keeps the ball to roll and score on his own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siebzehn, the number 17 in the German language, is the ultimate competition &ndash; The Race of All Races. Nine different races of mythical creatures compete for supremacy. Each mythical race is represented by a team consisting of six numbered pieces. Two to nine players control the teams, which maneuver around the board in a counterclockwise fashion. The rules of Siebzehn are simple, but the continuous discovery of new strategies amidst the constantly evolving environment is complex, captivating and magical.<br/><br/>Each team proceeds such that a higher number piece can never pass a lower number piece, and the number 1 piece advances only if no other team pieces can move. Pieces move forward and diagonally in the straightaways and forward only in the turns. The object of the game is to eliminate other races and control the one race that eventually conquers all. Players eliminate opponents from the board by one of three methods:<br/><br/><br/>    Circumnavigate the board and pass the highest number piece of one or more opponents with the 1 piece of one of your teams. This is known as a cataclysm and some teams will be eliminated or altered.<br/>    Pass an opponent's 1 piece with the highest numbered piece of one of your teams. In other words, one team passes an opponent's entire team. The team that is passed is eliminated.<br/>    Control the most advanced 1 piece in games that reach the end of the 17th cycle, known as the siebzehn cycle.<br/><br/><br/>The concept of a race around a large track is central to the essence of Siebzehn, but the game is not a model of any known race. Several racing games involve familiar competitors such as horses, chariots or cars &ndash; then there is Siebzehn, an imaginary mystical race in which the competitors are famed creatures of myth and legend. As the teams travel around the board, they must persevere through careful movement and placement, calculated blocking of their own and opponent pieces, opponent blocking effects and injuries, dice probability considerations and consequences, and new unexpected ways of seeing the board.<br/><br/>For an inspiring and exciting gaming experience, discover the land far beyond the familiar and influence the fates of mythical creatures in Siebzehn: The Race of All Races!<br/><br/>",

Play it while waiting for friends to show up (the rules allow others to be dealt in as they arrive) or play it to wrap up an evening of heavier gaming. Civilization games are usually strategic and deep; this is a tactical game of back-and-forth as you grow your civ and others knock it back.<br/><br/>In the Civscape card game, you will add Buildings to the Skyline of your city, discover new Technologies that are added to your City&rsquo;s Timeline, establish new systems of Government, carefully balance your Resources and race against your rivals to build Wonders and Statues.<br/><br/>Each city-state is constantly pushing the limits of what it can sustain: a city grows larger than its technology supports, fields more military than it has resources for, and comes up with more plans than its current system of government can implement. Even as you expand your own city, you can cause trouble for other city states, subjecting them to calamities, disbanding their military, forcing them to choose new leaders, or seizing the crown of the Emperor.<br/><br/>You will play one of nine cities: Athens, Carthage, Corinth, Ephesus, Pella, Rome, Sparta, Syracuse or Thebes. Each city has 10 other corresponding cards, with a unique Wonder, Statue (great leader), other Buildings, Technology, Government, and Events. Prior to gameplay, each player selects their City and its cards, which are mixed together into the overall draw deck. Choose sets of rivals like the Peloponnesian War (Athens vs. Sparta and Thebes), the Punic War (Rome vs. Carthage), the League of Corinth (Pella &amp; Corinth vs. Ephesus), the Sicilian War (Syracuse vs. Carthage) or one of the other suggested scenarios.

By default you can Mad-Lib your way through target generation, but if you'd like a few suggestions to get you going (all contributed by fellow backers), grab this bonus deck!<br/><br/>'Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination' is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

Now, Olaf's farm &mdash; the last one in the valley &mdash; has been struck by an earthquake. Dwarf Olaf sends for you, his grandchildren, to help him rebuild his farm and find his lost animals. He promises to reveal the biggest secret of the fallen city to the one who helps him the most.<br/><br/>Farmer Olaf is the first &quot;no.table&quot; family tabletop game (or so the publisher seems to think), which means it can be played comfortably on a big or small table &mdash; or on no table at all. The unique box design allows discarding and storing cards while holding it in one hand or being attached to a belt. Other advantages include starting or stopping game in seconds, quick save/quick load game ability, burst card dealing, quick independent release, and rules storage that doubles as a displayable cheat sheet. The maximum number of players is determined by game boxes used (with  four additional players for each game box).<br/><br/>In Farmer Olaf, players perform four farming activities to gather green cards with points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Farming activities include sowing and harvesting a field, milking a yak, making wool from alpaca, and making ham from a boar. Each player receives five cards at the start of the game and one card on each subsequent turn. Players try to collect appropriate cards for farming actions. For the most part, there is a shortage of buildings and animals needed for production. This means that in order to increase their chances of winning, a player needs to engage in trade with others. There are no limits of how to structure trades: from traditional 1-1 card exchange to more exotic deals like leasing or deferred payment. The game is carefully balanced as, for example, the best cards are steam machines that can be used only to sow and harvest a field. However, to do that one needs a fertilizer that can be obtained only by cleaning a boar pen or cowshed.<br/><br/>Simple rules and design (no text and no numbers on cards) allow children aged 5+ to participate in the game when playing with adults. The most demanding part is being a game master and managing cards in the box, thus the overall 10+ age rating.<br/><br/>",

One player controls Red (Heart and Diamonds), the other controls Black (Spades and Clubs).<br/><br/>The special feature of the game is a set of circular sockets. There are three groups of cards<br/><br/>A = Facets = King, Queen and Jack  <br/>B = small cards = 10, 9, 8 and 7 <br/>C = Ace<br/><br/>The figures (group A) capture all the small cards (group B). All small cards (group B) capture the Ace (group C). The Ace captures all the tricks (group A).<br/><br/>Inside the group of figures (A) there is also a circular hold: the King captures the Queen; the Lady captures the Jack; the Jack captures the King<br/><br/>Within the group of small cards (B), the catches are not circular but hierarchical: the 10 captures the 9, 8 and 7; the 9th captured the 8th and 7th; The 8 captures only the 7.<br/>But there is a compensation that makes each piece interesting: all pieces can move 2 squares, but the 9 can move 3 squares and the 8 can move 4 squares. The 7 moves 3 squares and has the particularity of capturing the Jack (and not being captured by him).<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by reaching the last line of the opponent's side with one of these three pieces: a King, a Queen, or an Ace.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Who will be the first to find the ingredients she needs?<br/><br/>In Im gro&szlig;en Zauberwald, players have to pull different items from between the trees of the enchanted forest without getting stuck. Each player starts the game with three recipe cards, each of which show seven ingredients you must collect; players lay out these cards in a row in front of them. The game board consists of a copse of 17 trees, and the wooden cubes representing the ingredients are scattered within the circle formed by these trees.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she chooses one of the spell cards she holds. This card indicates both how far the player rotates the trees on the game board &ndash; ideally moving desired ingredients close to hand &ndash; and how many ingredients the player can collect that turn. As soon as she's finished turning the board, she says &quot;Go!&quot; and all players start using their wooden rakes to pull ingredients into their &quot;basket&quot; in the corner of the game board. When the active player has collected the proper number of ingredients, she tells everyone to stop collecting.<br/><br/>Players then check their baskets to make sure they collected the right things. First, if the active player has collected the wrong number of ingredients, she must return an ingredient for each number she's off. Second, if a player's ingredients all match ingredients that are desired on her leftmost recipe, she places those ingredients on that card; any remaining ingredients are placed on her next recipe card. If a player grabbed any unneeded ingredients, she returns them along with one ingredient from a recipe card per error.<br/><br/>The first player to complete her three recipe cards wins! If all players have used their spell cards without someone winning, then whoever has completed the most recipes wins, with the number of ingredients collected serving as a tiebreaker.<br/><br/>",

Then they each program three moves on their side of the board.<br/><br/>The first player reveals their first token and carries out the move, then second player carries out their first token, etc. If you choose the install gate, you must choose one of your tokens and place it face down on your install gate; if you choose movement, you must move one of your tokens one space in that direction.<br/><br/>If you move or install on an opponent's token, you capture that token; on future turns, you can use that token to program moves, but you can't place it on the board. If you move or install on your own token, you stack them; on future turns, if you move a stack of at least two tokens, you can jump an empty space with some of the tokens, leaving at least one token behind.<br/><br/>If you remove all of the opponent's tokens from the board, you win.

A spinner at the base of the contraption directs the action of players at they attempt to collect small plastic colored hoops of varying values from the end of a plastic chute, using a unicyclist.  The unicyclist moves around a circular 'trapeze' wire by manipulating the angle of the circle using handles which are attached to the device.  The plastic chute in which the hoops are placed is located at the top of the contraption; gravity replaces captured hoops at the chute opening.  Hoops are worth 10 (red), 50 (black) or 100 (blue) points, depending on the diameter of the hoop hole.<br/><br/>There are two settings on the contraption - 'EASY' and 'HARD'.  Players have the opportunity to acquire opponents' hoops during the game if they manage to get the unicyclist to collect hoops when on the 'HARD' setting.  Hoops equal to the value collected by the player on that turn are taken from opponents in any combination.<br/><br/>If either hoops or the unicyclist fall from the contraption during a player's turn, they are penalized.<br/><br/>When all hoops have been collected from the chute by the unicyclist, scores are tallied and the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The player who makes the most money during 12 months being the winner.<br/><br/>&quot;As there are seven breeds of fowls, there should be seven players, but a lessor number can play if a corresponding number of breeds are taken out of the pack first, leaving in only one breed for each player.  Fowl Feed cards also must be one short of the number of players.  All the accessory cards are left in.<br/><br/>&quot;The accessory cards are introduced as they affect the game and add greater interest to it.<br/><br/>&quot;With seven players the whole pack is wanted, consisting of 35 fowl cards, 14 accessory cards and 12 sitting cards&quot;.<br/><br/>The game seems to be of Australian origin.

The deck is placed on the table, one card is drawn and placed next to it, this will be the beginning of the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;. Players then take turns.<br/><br/>A players turn consist of:<br/>&bull; Draw three cards from the deck,<br/>&bull; If possible form a word using the cards from your hand and placing it before you,<br/>&bull; Place one of his remaining cards to the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each player during his turn adds one card to the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;, this way the &ldquo;tape&rdquo; becomes longer. If a player needs a certain letter to form a word but doesn&rsquo;t have them he can take them from the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;, he also takes the remaining letters following the one he took.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; card &mdash; a free card. Can replace any letter in played word. You can take the &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; card used by another player by replacing it with the letter it was used as. &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; cannot be placed on the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Prize cards can be played together with a word if the word fits the cards criteria (for example, is a piece of clothing, none of the letters repeat). The prize card increases the points for that word and can give a player some extra possibilities.<br/><br/>When a player &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; (has no cards left to play at the end of his turn or only has prize cards), the round ends and points are counted. Points for a players word are calculated based on the letter cost of that word (each letter is worth a certain amount of points) and prize card used. The cost of letters that remain on the players hands is deducted from his point total. It is possible to get a negative result due to this.<br/><br/>Points earned during a round sum up with points gained on previous rounds. The game is played until one player earns the necessary amount of points to win (the amount of points should be decided before starting the game). The first one to earn them is the winner.<br/><br/>This game contains: <br/>&bull; 102 letter-cards; <br/>&bull; 14 prize cards;<br/>&bull; 4 &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; cards; <br/>&bull; Game rules.<br/><br/>More about cards<br/>A letter card, apart from the letter also has its cost shown (how points a player gains from using it in his word) and the number of cards in the deck with this letter.<br/><br/>A prize card has: an icon, conditions to play this card and the prize that it gives. The icon shows what the card requirements are. There is also a more detailed explanation on what needs to be done.<br/><br/>",

The little Inuit need to pack up and rush home as quickly as they can. However, their journey back is fraught with many dangers. Heavy snow and strong winds make it difficult for them to find the shortest route back, the ice beneath them could break apart at any time, and hungry polar bears are lurking nearby! Using clever planning and a keen memory, can you be the first to navigate your Inuit across the ice floes and back to the safety of their igloo?<br/><br/>In Polar Rush!, seven ice floe tiles are placed together on the table to form the game board. On each ice floe are seven different animals or items found in the arctic. Movement tiles are spread out face down on the table. On a turn, a player reveals a number of movement tiles one at a time based on the number rolled on the die. If he reveals a &quot;seal&quot; and a seal is adjacent to his current position, he must move his Inuit to the &quot;seal&quot; (even if it means he must move backwards); if a seal isn't nearby, he doesn't move.<br/><br/>The floes also feature special characters that can help (or hamper) a player's movement, so with clever planning your movement can be quite successful. For example, if you move to a sled, your next move doesn't need to be to an adjacent tile &mdash; but if you reveal a &quot;crack&quot; tile, you can separate the game board to create a water gap between the floes. The only way to cross this is to reveal a kayak tile. The first person to get his Inuit home wins!<br/><br/>Polar Rush! includes simplified rules for Inuit as young as five as well as more complex rules for older Inuit.<br/><br/>",

But even so there, flowers of the trick-taking game had quietly and gallantly flourished!<br/><br/>Kan is the short form of the Kankei(relationship). At first, Kankei team and Non-Kankei teams are determined by dealt cards and the fight  against each other for the 16 picture cards(Each A, K, Q and J). Friends in earlier rounds could be opponents for the next deal!<br/><br/>A deal consists of ten tricks. Trumps are determined each deal. For each individual case, each player should try to guess what in other  players hands and then try to help each other according to game-rules using the cards in one's hand.<br/><br/>If Kankei team wins, they will play same team up to 3 deals. At 2nd and/or 3rd deal of same Kankei team, they can decide trump suit from definite information.<br/><br/>At Go-nin-Kan (or 5 hands Kan), Kankei team consist of two players against Non-Kankei team with three. If a player plays as a dealer, the game becomes easier and smooth. (At official tournament, always six players play.)<br/><br/>You can play less than five players with Variant rules.<br/><br/>For four hands, Damari-Kan (quiet Kan, two against two).<br/>For three hands, Ganbari-Kan (bearing Kan, one against two).<br/><br/><br/>    Japon Brand version<br/><br/><br/>The special deck of the Go-nin-Kan from JAPON BRAND featured Japanese four seasons as suits (Spring: Night cherry blossom. Summer: Beech leaf. Autumn: Apple fruit. Winter: Snow crystal). As picture cards, the Japanese summer celebrations Neputa(sleeping-purging) and Mushi-Okuri(worm-purging) are illustrated. In addition, this set includes marker cards for displaying examples of playing situation.<br/><br/>We wish for you to experience Japanese and/or Tsugaru soul!<br/><br/>",

First to collect $500 wins, and has an opportunity to collect $1,000 more in the bonus game. Most money over several rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The first three editions were based on the CBS run and had the &quot;Jokers &amp; Devils&quot; bonus round (used for most of the show's first 18 months), where players must make three &quot;spins&quot; of Joker-Joker-Joker and avoid any Devil card; the first spin won $100, the second $300 more and the third $600 more, for a total of $1,000. (The show itself awarded prizes of increasing value for each spin.)<br/><br/>The fourth edition, titled and based on the 1979-81 children's spin-off Joker, Joker, Joker, used the &quot;Face the Devil&quot; bonus (like the last 12 or so months of the CBS run and the entire 1977-86 revival) which featured &quot;spinning&quot; dollar amounts to reach $1,000 or more before revealing a Devil. (On the show, reaching $1,000 won an additional prize package usually valued between $2,000-$3,000; in the game, the player wins $5,000.)<br/><br/>",

And for God's sake: watch out for the hungry thieves who don&rsquo;t hesitate to steal all coins in order to get the coveted tomatoes for themselves. Fortunately, a couple of cops are whirling around trying to chase the thieves. Who will earn the most tomatoes in this funny and foolish card-game, full of confusion and bluffs, and most importantly&hellip; about the beloved tomatoes!<br/><br/>Each player receives 12 cards, which can be coins, thieves, or cops. Each player plays all cards in four columns (face down!), belonging to one of the four displayed Tomatomats &ndash; after everyone has played all cards, the cards will be revealed and the effects executed, in this order: Cops remove thieves (of the same color); thieves remove coins (of the same color); coins might bring tomatoes! Only the player remaining with the highest value of coins may receive the corresponding Tomatomat.<br/><br/>The game ends after 3 or 4 rounds (depending on the number of players) &ndash; the player with the most Tomatomat-stars is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Guests assume their roles and stay in character throughout the party in an attempt to solve the murder.  All guests are given information to read privately which reveals their motives and hidden pasts. A lively cross-examination should ensue.  All players must answer questions truthfully, but are not required to provide more information than asked.  An exception is the murderer who may lie freely. Accusations are made at the conclusion of the final chapter, the winner being the player who guesses the author's solution correctly.  The setting of this particular mystery is Rome in the year 1985 where an American citizen has been found dead in one of the catacombs. The roles in the game are the son of the deceased, the son's wife, the wife's parents, the secretary of the deceased and the   lawyer of the deceased. A 33 and a third phonograph record is included to provide a sense of atmosphere.<br/><br/>",

Maybe credit unions, food co-ops, people parks! The Daily News and mail bring many challenges.<br/><br/>The players begin the game as self-employed, but through cooperation they can transform their properties into co-ops and eventually discover that by doing this, they can win the game. But it isn't an easy feat. Devalued currency, strikes, injuries, inflation, raised taxes and other expenses try to hinder you. The Power, the town's anonymous capitalist, strives to put a monopoly on all enterprises. Players must be loyal, generous, entrepreneurial and far-sighted to succeed in making the whole town cooperative, to make the town into OUR TOWN.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to learn to cooperate in a board game and at the same time learn useful things about economy and civic life. We have from early on learned to compete, and there are few teaching tools in the relationship between children and adults to teach other approaches.<br/><br/>",

Hand in destinations that you pass by or land on.  If others land on your destination, you may hand in your card OR force them to add another destination from the draw pile!<br/><br/>You move by rolling a special 6-sided die; instead of a 6, it contains the word 'SUBWAY' -- rolling that allows you to jump to one of YOUR stations.  Otherwise, move the number rolled without changing your direction, as that can only change when on a junction station.<br/><br/>As well, many of the stations have a signal on them to follow: amber (pick up another destination), green (usually good, useful cards), or red (frequently bad - adding destination, or flinging you to an end of the board).

High bid plays the questions, while ties cancel out. The total number from the bids is multiplied by $10 and becomes the prize for the round (for example, 4-3-2 would be worth $90), although choosing a Double Pot category doubles the amount available (maximum of $220). Once a player answers a set of questions correctly and has at least $140 (the show required just $90), s/he may try to go to the board.<br/><br/>The board contains four colored rows (Red-Green-Yellow-Blue) and three amounts ($20-$30-$40); the player in control calls out the money and color (i.e., &quot;Forty on the Red&quot;) and can buy as many boxes as possible until either matching or not having enough to buy appropriately, with one catch: a column is closed when three of its boxes are picked. Matching awards that prize's value to the player's score, and the first to $5,000 ($4,000 if only two people are playing the questions with an emcee) wins.<br/><br/>If the first three picks of a game match, that player wins the prize and a jackpot which starts at $100 and increases by $100 each time it is not won.<br/><br/>From April 1973 until the show's end in June 1974, the format changed to matching pictures; the first player to get three matches won the game and $5,000 in prizes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the Arduin Role-Playing system by David A. Hargrave. It's described as a game like Poker with unusual twists.<br/><br/>There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords &amp; Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.<br/><br/>The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one &quot;Up&quot; card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The &quot;Up&quot; card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new &quot;Up&quot; card.<br/><br/>A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.<br/><br/>The components are a bit flimsy. Two medium quality shrinkwrapped decks stashed in a cotton bag, a photocopied rules set and a white fold-up box with a label glued on. The retail is $14.99<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gone Birding! Video Adventure in Bird Identification is a niche boardgame directed at the birdwatching/birding community that combines board game action with real-world bird identification skills.  It includes:<br/><br/><br/>      A two-hour video containing 10 separate games<br/>      18&quot; x 24&quot; fold-out gameboard map of North America with 100 different renowned locations for birdwatching marked on it (National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, etc.)<br/>      51 &quot;Hotspot&quot; cards that match up with the map and describe the location along with a list of several different bird species that can be found there<br/>     48 &quot;Surprise&quot; cards that describe a variety of seasonal events such as a cold front pushing migrating birds in great numbers to a location or other unpredictable events that effect how many birds you might spy, like winning an expensive new spotting telescope.  <br/>     18 &quot;Rare Bird Alert&quot; cards that send you off to a different corner of the map chasing after an especially unusual sighting of a bird species<br/>     1 Novice Helper Card<br/>     40-page Identification Guide -- instructions and answers to each of the 10 different games on the VHS tape<br/>     Trip List Pad  <br/>     Video Trip Field Notes Pad<br/>     6 glass playing pieces<br/><br/><br/>There are three different skill levels accommodated by the game: &quot;novice&quot; where, for example, just identifying a bird as a &quot;hawk&quot; is an acceptable answer, &quot;birder&quot; where you must get the exact species named like &quot;Red-tailed Hawk&quot; and &quot;Expert&quot; who must provide not only the species name but also the Latin scientific genera &quot;Red-tailed Hawk, Buteo.&quot;  This lets people of all ages and bird identification abilities play together.<br/><br/>To play the game, 6 Hotspot cards and 1 Rare-Bird Alert cards are dealt to each player.  The group must decide which season in which to play the game as different seasons produce different numbers of birds at the various Hotspots.    Then each player must plan out her route on the gameboard to visit the 6 Hotspots in their hand.  Players start at the Hotspot closest to their actual real-world location.  Then players watch the first Video Trip.  The video is paused between trips while the players write down their identifications of the 10-12 different species shown on their Video Trip Field Notes pad, in order of the bird's appearance.  Video &quot;hosts&quot; tell you where in the country you are and what season it is before the trips begin, which helps skilled players pare down the possible choices of species.  The video can be replayed if players need more time to work on their IDs.  After everyone is satisfied with their identifications, they read them aloud and one player checks the IDs with the answer section of the instruction booklet.  Players get a point for each correct ID they make.    Then, taking turns clockwise, players move their tokens around the board one Hotspot space at a time and announce the number of species they can add to their Trip List as determined by the card's &quot;species table,&quot; which varies according to season.  If you end up having to visit the same Hotspot more than once in order to get to another Hotspot card, you'll receive a smaller number of points for each successive trip.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, a Surprise card is drawn and read aloud.  It may affect all, some or none of the players.  You can also play a Rare-Bird-Alert card against one of your opponents to send them off their planned course chasing after the bird listed on the card.<br/><br/>The game ends after six Video Trips and six rounds on the gameboard are played.  Points on players Trip Lists are then tallied and the player with the most number of species on their Trip List wins.<br/><br/>As a final note, bird taxonomy and nomenclature are constantly changing as scientists learn more about avian species.  This game specifies that their answers are based on the 1983 American Ornithologists' Union &quot;Check-List of North American Birds&quot; which is of course now, in the year 2006, significantly out of date.<br/><br/>",

Players can protect their own game pieces by forming &quot;Blocks&quot;, and the player who occupies &quot;Center Space&quot; has special privileges.<br/><br/>The game ends when a base is captured, and players then add up their points. The player with the highest score wins (which is often not the player who has ended the game by capturing a Base).<br/><br/>&quot;Match&quot; play involves playing 3 games, with the person who has the most match points winning the Match. Match points are awarded for each game won, and for having the most total game points. It is highly recommended that CORX be played in matches, as that adds another strategic dimension to the game. Because the winner of a match is determined by who has the most &quot;match points&quot; (instead of whoever wins 2 out of 3 games), players need to assess the &quot;big picture&quot; before making the decision to end a game.<br/><br/>Corx with dice works best with 3-4 players. Corx without dice works best with 2-3 players.<br/><br/>",

The board contains pictures of 20 animals. When a player puts a pawn on one of these, it is registered by the machine.<br/>The console can make the sounds of the 20 animals, and most game ideas use this. The sound of one animal sounds, for example, and the first player to put a piece on the corresponding picture scores, for example. The console also functions as a die, so some roll and moves are also included. The &quot;Olympiade&quot; mode combines the scores of various games to determine an overall winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

Each player has different locations to visit, but they share vehicles &ndash; and going faster won't necessarily be better. By answering questions about the geography of Germany, players can earn extra points.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board that shows a map of Germany, with several cities connected by roads. At the beginning of the game, each player receives six destination cards. Two car pawns are placed at the start location at the center of the board.<br/><br/>Now, the players take turns moving one of the cars one space along one of the roads. If a player moves a car onto a city, a player who has the matching destination card may play it. If the destination card is played, the player whose turn it is gets to answer a question asked by the tiptoi pen. If he answers correctly, he gains one point; if he answers incorrectly, his left neighbor gets a chance to answer the question correctly for one point.<br/><br/>Next to cities, a car can also end on an intermediate space, which may have a special meaning:<br/><br/>    Swift ride: The player gets to take another turn.<br/>    Question: The player gets to answer a question from the tiptoi pen for a point.<br/>    Joker: The player gets to play one of his destination cards, as if the corresponding city has just been visited (which also triggers a question from the pen).<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when a player has played all his destination cards; that player scores one point. A final question follows which allows all players to score additional points. Then, each player adds the number of destination cards played to his points. The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

The players take the roles of animal dictators who will stop at nothing to gain absolute power over the global Farm.<br/><br/>This is a negotiation game for 3 to 5 players that's based on the concept of forced cooperation. On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand &ndash; they are divided by the will to win.

At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends.

        "description": "&quot;After the king&rsquo;s death, your country is at civil war, and the mayor of your town seeks the most powerful conjurer to lead the troops against rival armies from neighbor towns. You know that if you could prove yourself worthy of leading these troops, fame and wealth would follow. By assembling the most powerful army of mythological creatures equipped with rare artifacts, you will beat the other conjurers in town.&quot;<br/><br/>During the twelve rounds of &quot;Conjurers&quot;, the conjuring players and their assistants struggle to gather sufficient resources to purchase powerful items and magical artifacts. Simultaneously, they need to build up their armies of mythological creatures in order to wage war against increasingly powerful beasts and rivaling conjurers alike. The conjurers will have to fight at the mythological battlegrounds of Olympus Mons, Valhalla, Shangri La, Garden of Eden, and Duat in order to force the defeated creatures to be summoned to future battles at the conjurers' demand. Time is of the essence, each turn is valuable, and faulty decisions can cost you dearly.<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; takes place in a mythological universe and is a game of priorities and strategy, which allows for a high degree of diversity from game to game. So buckle up, and prepare for an intense and challenging experience from start to finish.<br/><br/>Game description:<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a strategy board game based on five different mythologies: The Biblical, the Egyptian, the Greek, the Japanese, and the Norse. The objective is to collect the highest number of points, which are all counted by the end of the game, after round 12. Points may be gathered through creatures, artifacts, and resources. A player may choose a strategy of striving for one or more of various point bonuses, such as an Abundance Bonus, which is unlocked by controlling a large number of creatures within the same mythology by the end of the game. It is therefore possible to disrupt the plans and strategies of the opponents throughout the game &ndash; if you succeed in figuring out their strategy.<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game, which consists of 4 phases, each with 3 rounds. At the start of each phase new actions are unlocked. The primary actions are to:<br/><br/>&bull;    gather resources<br/>&bull;    buy items and artifacts<br/>&bull;    hire assistants to get more actions<br/>&bull;    attempt to gain control of a mythological creature by defeating it in battle<br/>&bull;    collect feed for your creatures<br/>&bull;    sacrifice creatures to gain resources and optimize your army<br/>&bull;    duel the other conjurers<br/><br/>Each player starts with one conjurer figure, one assistant figure, and three level 1 creatures in their armies. If a player allocates the conjurer figure or the warrior assistant to one of the mythological battlegrounds, he or she may choose any creature, level 2 &ndash; 5, from the given mythology and fight it. If the player defeats the creature, he or she collects it, and it becomes part of that player&rsquo;s army. A conjurer can only bring three creatures from the army into each battle. The fighting creatures are chosen at random after the player has declared which mythological creature he or she is attempting to defeat. Optimizing your army is therefore vital if you wish to try to collect the higher level creatures.<br/><br/>Please note that &quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game; the battle sequences are rather brief, and it is the strategic decisions on point combinations and player interaction which is at the heart of the game. Good luck, and enjoy.<br/><br/>",

But the story of the game is more satirical than actually criminal. The game is worth buying at least for the illustrations on the cards: very vividly depicted representatives of the Russian criminal world.<br/>Also the cards have classical card suits on them. So you can play classical card games with one of the decks, if you want to.<br/><br/>The game consists of two decks - fighters and property. Each card has a toughness value. If the toughness of the fighter is higher than the toughness of the property, he can capture it and become it's guard. The owner of that fighter becomes the owner of the property. Another player can try to seize neutral property or someone else's property by attacking the guard. All fighter cards have different special abilities on them. At the beginning of the game players assign trumps. And during the game only the trump suit can use card abilities. When at some point of the game any player possesses a curtain amount of property he is declared the winner and the game ends.<br/><br/>Русское описание:<br/>&laquo;Большой куш&raquo; &mdash; это игра про рейдерские захваты 90-х, которая выполнена в потрясающем &laquo;блатном&raquo; антураже и с весьма узнаваемыми персонажами. Стиль игры, скорее, сатирический, нежели реально криминальный. Её стоит купить хотя бы ради иллюстраций на картах: столь колоритно изображены представители отечественного криминального мира.<br/><br/>",

Other victory conditions include maxing out resources (water, oxygen, carbon) and supporting life in multiple star systems.<br/><br/>Each turn players create, or expand, star systems, collect resources, and try to stall the expansion of other players' systems. Each turn you can play 1 negative action on another player and 2 actions on themselves.

They really like seashells and, as everyone knows, you can never have too many seashells! They have learned to grow new arms and tentacles, so they can always grab just one more shell. Help them transform correctly, and collect as may sea treasures as they can carry.<br/><br/>In the Aqualiens board game each player receives one of the four cute aliens. Transparent cards and goal cards are placed in the center of the table, so everyone can reach them. Lay the transparent cards with arms and tentacles on top of your alien card to complete the task, but make sure to use as few cards as possible! The quickest player to grow and collect everything that's needed, according to the goal card, wins a victory crystal.<br/><br/>When the players are already good in playing with basic rules, they can try to make the game more complex, by adding some extra rules. In addition to arms and tentacles, the players have to collect a certain amount of seashells on the card of their alien. Note that if some player stops the round by saying &quot;I'm ready!&quot;, and it turns out that the task is made incorrectly, then the player loses one victory crystal! The first player who receives 5 victory crystals wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each game by itself is a straight forward operational simulation of each theater, and all 3 games share the exact same rules allowing for easy integration. Units are divisions for the Germans and Division to Army sized for the Russians.<br/><br/>DAMOS is a brand new, unique take on operational scale WW22 combat. With almost 0 player downtime, DAMOS is highly interactive between possible reactions, combat postures, and other mechanics. DAMOS takes many well-known wargaming conventions and repackages them into an all-new take on the most familiar conflict in wargaming that force long-time grognards to rethink their normal instincts.<br/><br/>Army Group South covers Von Rundstedt&rsquo;s extended trek towards the Caucasus. AGS had the largest theater of operations and the highest expectations placed upon them compared to the other Army groups. While assisted by the Hungarian and Romanian armies, the best executed armored breakthroughs only went so far once the fuel trucks could not keep up with the Panzers.<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 6/10<br/><br/>SOLITAIRE: 6/10<br/><br/>PLAYERS: 1-2, up to 6 players with AGN and AGC.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Unlike Jacks, Five Stones games require only pebbles or tokens.<br/><br/>The game may also have been played with astragals, or sheep knuckle bones, but instead of being used as randomizers for wagering they're used in place of stones for tossing.<br/><br/>Five Stones requires only a handful of small stones, although many variants use stylized tokens instead of stones.  The stones or tokens normally have irregular or cubic sides to allow scattering in a small area.<br/><br/>In Korea 5 small octagonal prisms or polyhedrons are used, in the traditional Jewish variant 5 cubes are used, but the only real requirement is 5 irregularly-shaped pebbles.<br/><br/>Typically the game involves casting the stones and then tossing one stone in the air and picking up another and catching the first before it strikes the ground.  In some regional variants the stones are caught on the back of the hand, either for scoring or during play.<br/><br/>Related to: Knucklebones<br/>Re-implemented by: Jacks<br/><br/>",

In a round, each player starts with 8-10 topping cards in hand; thus, each round consists of 8-10 tricks. The lead player in a trick plays one topping card to the table, then each player follows, with no requirement to follow suit. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and the person who played that card collects the topping cards one-by-one, placing those cards in separate stacks by topping type on the table in front of him, with the most recently played (and collected) cards on top.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player decides whether to score for one of his order cards in hand. For each topping shown on the order card, the player scores only the topmost topping card, scoring zero points if that topping is missing. The player then discards the order card.<br/><br/>The game ends after five rounds or at the end of a round in which at least one player has scored his third order card.

Doctors compete with each other to treat patients using whatever tools they are able to acquire. Players also have the ability to hinder their fellow doctors in the middle of surgery or just agree to play a round of golf while the patient expires. Patients will begin to stack up fast... both cured and killed. Add em up at the end to determine who among you is the best doctor under the worst conditions imaginable.<br/><br/>Players start with a handful of tools which they quickly put to use when the first patient is revealed. Once the patient is flipped doctors must quickly determine if they can attempt the surgery using the tools they have in their hand.<br/><br/>During surgery other doctors can attempt to hinder the procedure by playing whoops cards which can increase the cost of surgery or steal tools or patients right out from under you.<br/><br/>The length of the game is variable depending on how many patients you want to attempt to treat. This is determined at the beginning of the game. After the last patient has been cured or killed the game is over and doctors count up their living patients subtract the ones in the morgue and arrive at a final score.<br/><br/>",

The Policeman wins if he lands his helicopter on the Bank Robber's car (thus capturing him). Spinners are used for movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SPOOF is the classic game of BLUFF but with forfeits.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;Everybody conceals a number of Spoofing disks in their hands and holds them out in a closed fist.  Then you have to guess the total number of disks held out by all players.<br/><br/>It sounds straight forward enough but the other players will, quite naturally, be intent on stitching you up.  Crafty bluffing and double guessing are the order of the day.  You'll need to be sly, cunning and fiendishly sneaky to stay ahead.<br/><br/>Make the wrong decision and you'll have to take a dreaded forfeit card and face the consequences!  You'll find yourself Sumo wrestling, eating dry biscuits off a plate on the floor without using you hands - or worse...&quot;<br/><br/>Players hide between 0 and 3 disks within their hand and then take it in turns to try and guess the total number of disks held, taking it in turns to make the first call.<br/><br/>A player that guesses correctly is eliminated from the game and a new round starts.  Play continues like this until there is only one player remaining.  That player is the loser and spins the spinner on a penalty wheel to select a category of forfeit. The actual forfeit is determined from drawing from 5 different categories of cards.<br/><br/>",

Wacky cards are shuffled and placed facedown within reach of all. On your turn take a Wacky card, place it face up in front of you and read it aloud to all players. You then do the wacky thing - and if it's marked as an Always card you repeat it every turn; if it's marked as a Whenever card it will be whenever someone else does a particular thing.<br/><br/>The object is to be the player who gets the most points for doing wacky things over an agreed number of rounds. Add up the points on each player's cards - highest points wins.<br/><br/>",

The Emperor has chosen you to build perfectly suitable ponds, so the carps can reach their highest potential. To do so, you must assign each Koi colony its proper place.<br/><br/>In each round, players have to cooperate assigning a different group of carps splitting the pond. It&rsquo;s important to optimise the area to shelter the most colonies.<br/><br/>In turn you need to build the perfect home to the colony.<br/><br/>First, determine the perfect pond rolling the 3 dice. These dice show you the exact number of nishikigoi you must have inside a pond area when it&rsquo;s closed.<br/><br/>To shape the pond, each player must play a Pond card (placed partially other cards) in turn order until a pond area is completely (the wather lilies line is closed). To do so, the card can be partially placed over other cards in play (never underneath).<br/><br/>When the pond is closed, if the exact number of nishikigoi of each colour matches the dice, remove 5 of the played cards and put them at the bottom of the deck. The rest are set aside to show you have built a perfect pond area.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards have been played. There is no more space in the imperial pond and it&rsquo;s time to evaluate how well you have done.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The recruiters with their sounding coins come to town and try to recruit new soldiers for the mercenary armies, which are being excavated everywhere. You hope the recruiters will be successful because they work on your behalf.<br/><br/>Ernst von Mansfeld is a tactical dice game for 2 to 4 players and is divided into the 2 consecutive phases recruiting and conquering. <br/>In the recruitment, the players try to win as many and powerful soldiers as possible for their mercenary army. This requires tactics and clever consideration of the risk, as the player who dares to reach the required dice value with fewer dice than his competitors may try his luck first.<br/>In the second phase, the players have to compete with their deployed armies against each other to conquer different valuable provinces. The smart use of your own troops as well as the correct anticipation of the tactics of the opponents are necessary to secure the provinces and to enter history as the most successful mercenary general.<br/><br/>",

King Stink cards can steal a player's loot of monsters and gross stuff, allowing for plenty of quick, silly play. When the cards run out, tally up the points&mdash;whoever collects the most gross stuff wins!<br/><br/>~from publisher's website<br/><br/>In Ick: The Game, players get a hand full of cards, set down a house card (if they have one) put crap in it (adding as many objects as they can), and cap it off with the monster that belongs with the last object placed.<br/><br/>For example, player A has six cards on his turn--A house, a band-aid, fish bones, rotten veggies, maggots, and the monster known as Slimon. He lays down the house card, followed by all of the item cards he has except the maggots. He can either end his turn or place the maggot card and the Slimon monster card to prevent other players from claiming that stack with their monster (except it's still not safe from the one monster that can take over any house). Players earn points based on the objects in the claimed house; the first player to 100 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the 1920s, anthropologists, explorers and adventurers found a curious spiral-tracked game being played by the Baggara Arabs of the Sudan &mdash;Li'b el Merafib, &ldquo;The Hyena Game&rdquo;.  In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.<br/><br/>It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.<br/><br/>Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.<br/><br/>By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.<br/><br/>",

It was sold with all components packed in plastic zip-bag.<br/><br/>The point of the game is to collect as much money (in-game currency called Talars) as possible and cause other players' bankruptcy. Each player represents one shipping and delivery company, and pawn is considered as a truck (TIR). After finishing a lap, player gets money for transported goods. When starting a new lap player may declare &quot;taking special cargo&quot; - which gives bonus money after full lap, but can be easly lost, when doubles are rolled. During the game player may buy the roads he/she passes. When the route is complete (player bought all roads of the one color - for example: H1, H2 and H3) each road separately may be upgraded (3rd class road, 2nd class road, 1st class road superclasshighway). Player collects money fees for passing his/hers roads from another player. Unlike in Monopoly Tranzyt's board is elliptic. There are also shortcuts, and special areas (AutoService, Bridge, Tunnel, Ferry, Parking, Fuel Station). When moving player throws three dice (two regular, and one special with only one dot) - when dot is rolled, some random events happen. Evens are listed in the center of the board.<br/><br/>",

The best architects in the two neighboring villages show up at the dry river bed and will try to join the two towns together with a series of huts.. The first who manages to do so will become the architect of the year.<br/><br/>Each player receives 15 huts of his/her color, 4 yellow pawns used as guards in order to protect some of the huts. and 1 red pawn and 1 tactic sheet which contains the plan for the game seen from either side of the board.  Each player secretly sets up his huts on a tactic sheet. Once both players have done this the tactic sheets are exposed and then the huts are transferred from the tactic sheet to the board.<br/><br/>Each player has two possible moves on his turn. He may either build a new hut or he may attack an opponent's hut.<br/><br/>In order to win an architect must establish an uninterrupted chain of 6 huts between the 2 dry river beds or an architect can also win if his opponent has no huts on the game board.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Abacus wood box series.<br/><br/>",

The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the &quot;A&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the &quot;B&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.<br/><br/>Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).<br/><br/>RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.<br/><br/>The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.<br/><br/>",

It's important to note that you can not rearrange the cards in your kitty pile during play or at the end of the game. That's why you need to pay attention the the cards you grab while you're playing. You're trying to build kitty piles with the following features:<br/><br/>* Card pairs adjacent to each other that add to ten. A pair that adds to 10 is called a Tomcat.

Each face card in a sequence like this is called a Jellical Cat. (worth two points)<br/>    * An unbroken chain of black cards that adds to thirteen. This is called a Black Cat.

The entire battle only takes about 60 seconds to play. However, the game offers a player most of the tactical choices available to Napoleon in 1815. The player represents the Emperor with historical factors like defensive terrain, Prussian reinforcements, support from reserve formations, and the Imperial Guard contained in the rules.<br/><br/>In 1815 Napoleon said the chances for a successful outcome were 6 in 10. During a typical One-Minute Waterloo session the player faces similar odds.<br/><br/>This companion game to the previously released One-Minute Bulge is a free Print &amp; Play game with a single 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map, eight playing pieces, charts, rules and a few markers.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players are taking turn in selecting a man or woman to make a move to. They fulfill the needs of their target by playing cards from their hands. Afterwards, there is an added push your luck element by guessing the required &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;handsome&quot; factor from the randomizer deck. IF they are successful, some VP is awarded, and the target goes up to the next level (more needy), making them harder to be approached next time. The empty slot below him/her is then filled with a new one at the end of the round.<br/><br/>The game also features a little bit of take-that mechanism to ruin other player's relationship.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Wahai Pejuang Cinta !!!<br/>Kini tiba saatnya untukmu maju bertempur di medan cinta.

        "description": "Plan a route to complete your own secret mission before the other players do. Your explorer needs to travel over roads and sandy plains, through woods and rivers, to arrive at the next coordinate using the most efficient or tactical route. Once arrived, you'll receive a new coordinate or clue where the treasure on that rout can be found. But watch your opponents explorers! They will try to sabotage your activity with fallen tree trunks, damaged bridges, or other obstacles. Given the right action cards and perseverance, you could be the first to accomplish your mission and reach the greatest treasure of all: Victory!<br/><br/>There are several ways to play the game. The following variants are possible:<br/><br/>Basic Game<br/>The basic game is played with 2 to 4 players and 2 explorers per player. Each player can move one explorer on his turn. The die thrown depends on which type of land the explorer is standing on. Changing type of land results in ending the players turn. During each players turn, action cards can be collected by moving to one of his own marked coordinates, Reaching a marked coordinate, a new coordinate and action card is received. The action cards are a collection of information, obstacle and help cards. Ending a route means saving the coordinates and the treasure belonging to the route. These coordinates and the treasures are the key to accomplish your own secret mission first.<br/><br/>Young players<br/>To play the game with young players, the game can be played with only one explorer and without using the hiker. All other rules are the same as in the basic game.<br/><br/>Teams<br/>This variant can only be played with 4 players. The 2 players sitting diagonally opposite each other are working together as a team. Both players work on one mission together. Each player will use a set of two explorers.

All of them being from the fourth year, or the fourth season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment<br/><br/>Attackers will have the Aussie Gridlock, an Operator who is very sturdy, and able to fortify an area she has control over. Danish N&oslash;kk can explore the area for her team without ever being caught. Amaru can be the element of surprise as she can get downstairs with her Garra hook, but does not forget the point of the game is shooting well. Kali&rsquo;s explosive spears are excellent when you want to destroy barricades from an entire room.<br/><br/>For defenders, Mozzie will be a nightmare for opponents who rely on their tech a little too much as his parasites will be able to capture opposing drones. Warden can snipe at long range quite easily, and is hard to take by surprise as he is immune to being Stunned or Located. Wamai can forbid thrown gadgets to be used with his Mag-net system. Goyo deploys Volc&aacute;n Shields. When destroyed, those explode into a fire, halting the opponent&rsquo;s progression, and potentially dealing some damage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triplexity, and its sisters Triple-Triplexity, Duple, Double-Duple, and Monotony, were created in 1984. The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.<br/><br/>The designers describe the game:<br/><br/>&quot;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.<br/><br/>&quot;It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.&quot;<br/><br/>From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):<br/><br/>&quot;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies.<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries.<br/>Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game.<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game.<br/>It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times.<br/>DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly.<br/>In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position.<br/>From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.  <br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!)<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play.<br/>In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years.<br/>Have fun.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance.<br/>After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid.<br/>The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now.<br/>So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seems to be a variation of Yahtzee, themed for the track &amp; field event--the Decathlon.  Each player rolls four blue dice and two red dice five times in succession, locking in only 1 red die and any number of blue dice each turn.<br/><br/>The blue dice constitute the event (e.g. if you can get three 1s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the first event, the 100-meter run; if you can get two 3s and two 4s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the 8th event, the pole vault).  Fail to qualify for one of the first 9 events (not matching one of the necessary patterns with the blue dice) and you can use your rolls as one leg of the 10th event, the 1500-meter run.  In essence, these are free failure rolls.<br/><br/>The red dice, summed together, are your score for the particular event.  So, if you lock in three 1s and any other blue die, after four rolls, you have rolled all 5 red dice.  If your red dice are 6, 5, 5, 3, and 4 then you score 23 for the 100-meter dash.  Any event with a score of less than 15 means you aren't Olympic caliber, so you don't even get to peg your score on the board...<br/><br/>Speaking of which, that's the &quot;peg&quot; part of the name.  There is a cribbage-like board where players peg their event tallies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game belongs to a series of 4 games by Scandecor, which come in a square plastic board (Play Cavalry, Play Balance, Play Ecology and Play Numeric).<br/><br/>This game is played on a 12x12 board and each players has 9 dice as playing pieces. These dice look like normal 6-sided dice, but 2 sides of them are free. The are 2 types of dice, odd and even dice. Odd dice show 1-3-3-5 on their sides, even dice 2-4-4-6.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to win the most points, which are given for capturing opposing dice. You can also win points, when you succeed in bringing an own dice to the opposite corner of the board.<br/><br/>At the start, the 9 dice per player start in one corner of the board and they show 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5 on top. When a die moves to an adjacent empty space, its value is not changed, but a die can also be used to jump over another, if the value on top is within a range of 1 to the jumping die. Then a die can be turned to change its initial value.<br/><br/>The game is rather slow developing, because it takes some time, until the dice approach each other on the large 12x12 board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ghawar, located in Saudi Arabia, is the world's biggest oil field. Set to this background the players represent members of the royal family and try to locate good sites for new oil wells, find and deliver the different oil qualities and ship them to their base camps.<br/><br/>However, the oil field is so huge that the players have to memorize where which oil quality is to be found. Moreover, the competing players are likely to interefere with the player's intentions.<br/><br/>To win the game, it is mandatory to collect oil qualities of different kinds, always keeping an eye on the ever changing prices. Balancing this will help !<br/><br/><br/>From the Boardgame News annoucement.<br/><br/>As for the game play, Ghawar is a pick-up-and-deliver game with a roll-and-move mechanism on top of a memory element. On a 13x13 game board, 36 oil platforms are laid out in a 6x6 square with one empty space between each pair of platforms. Players seed these platforms with 36 coloured &quot;oil stones&quot; with nine cubes in each of four colors.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling two dice and placing one of their five oil wells on the unoccupied platform at this location in the grid; if a player rolls 2-5, for example, she can choose row 2, column 5 or the other way around. Once all the oil rigs are placed, the second half of the game begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either rolls a die to move the truck, train or both vehicles a number of spaces equal to the die roll or moves one of the oil rigs to an adjacent location, most likely covering an oil stone previously exposed.<br/><br/>If a player's truck starts or ends its movement by an oil rig and doesn't already have a load, the truck's owner can lift the oil rig and buy the oil stone underneath it, paying the rig's owner the current value of the oil.<br/><br/>You can't purchase oil stones that aren't covered as there must be a well in place to bring the oil to the surface. You must bring the oil to your side of the board to deliver it before you can pick up another oil stone with the truck.<br/><br/>When your train ends its movement by an empty platform the train picks up the platform so that you can carry it back to your camp. At the end of the game, players lose points based on their relative standings in the number of platforms collected.<br/><br/>The game ends once all the oil stones have been delivered. If any player has failed to collect at least one of each type of stone, that player loses the game. Players still in the game score points for each oil stone they possess, for having more of their favored type of oil than anyone else, for collecting barrels, and for having lots of money due to sales. If you have the fewest stones of a type, less money than anyone else, and fewer platforms than someone else, you'll lose points. The player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By early 1917 British Empire forces had pushed the Ottoman Turks out of the Sinai to a line near Gaza. If the British could break that line, it would open the road to Jerusalem, and after that Damascus. A hastily prepared attack in March was repulsed. After a month spent bringing forward artillery and supplies, the British were ready to try again, going &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; on 17 April.<br/><br/>Gaza 1917 uses the Fire &amp; Movement system. The movement and combat systems are designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Historically, the Turks eked out a victory, but it was a close call. In this game, the British have numbers, quality, and firepower on their side, while the Ottomans have excellent defensive positions, superior leadership, and time. The player who best utilizes his strengths and is prepared to capitalize on opportunities will prevail.<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>    Level: Regiment/Brigade<br/>    Hex: .75 miles (1.25 km) <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Now, it is possible for everyone in your family to enjoy all the fun and excitement of one of television's newest and highest rated shows with the new home version of &quot;The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime&quot; game. Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board. The tension and excitement builds as players race to be the first to figure out the clues and solve the word puzzle, but beware of the stinger. With one sting you can lose a valuable, and possibly, a game winning turn. So gather your family and friends around and enjoy the newest and exciting game you will ever play.<br/><br/>User review:<br/><br/>The game is played by two players or teams while one additional player acts as gamemaster. The players play three puzzle phrases and the one with more money is the winner.<br/><br/>To begin each puzzle phrase, the gamemaster uses console to show the players which letters of the alphabet are contained in the puzzle phrase with one additional false letter called &ldquo;The Stinger.&rdquo; The gamemaster uses the wipe-off board to indicate the phrase missing its letters as one would in the game of Hangman.<br/><br/>A player may choose two letters from the console to have those letters placed in their proper positions on the wipe-off board by correctly guessing a clue word. The gamemaster  shows the number of letters there are in the clue word on the wipe-off board and then places them one at a time until one team guessed the word. Guessing the clue word gives the right to have a chance to guess the puzzle phrase.<br/><br/>When choosing letters from the console, money is added to the jackpot: $25 per letter during the first puzzle phrase, $50 per letter in the second, and $100 per letter in third. Should the player choose The Stinger with either choice the player may not guess at the puzzle phase and the game continues with a new clue word. The jackpot is won by guessing the puzzle phrase.<br/><br/>While promoted on the show (albeit with a different box during Season 1) and mostly faithful to it, the home adaptation turns the show's giant computer and keyboard into a dry-erase board and a set of plastic tiles (later cardboard letters). The bonus round is not present, either, instead awarding the Million if a player or team wins all three rounds in a game. Further, only 48 puzzles are present, allowing for just 16 games.<br/><br/>Notably, the game also included a contestant application, which is somewhat amusing since the game was given to couples who appeared on the show.<br/><br/>",

They are appreciated for their playful personalities, their outgoing, loving dispositions and their even tempers.  The Pug is one of the oldest breeds of dogs and has flourished since before 400 BC.  China is the earliest known source for Pugs, where they were pets of the Buddhist monasteries in Tibet.  Highly intelligent, they can be a bit willful if they sense they are stronger minded than their human companions.  The Pug&rsquo;s reason for living is to be near their people and to please them, and their personalities make them a family favorite.<br/><br/>PUG-OPOLY IS A GAME OF TAIL-WAGGING FUN!<br/>COLLECT YOUR FAVORITE PUGS AND PLAY HARD!<br/><br/>Increase your rent by buying Toys for your dogs and upgrading them to Big Bones.

The Beta can be moved either 1 or 2 squares, also in any direction. The Gamma can be moved 1 or 2 squares, laterally only. The Delta can be moved 1 or 2 squares, diagonally only. The players take turns, with each player moving 1 of his or her pieces each turn. Any piece can capture any enemy piece within range by moving into the enemy piece's square and removing the enemy piece. When an Alpha is captured, all its companion pieces are also removed. The surviving Alpha wins. As in many other multi-player games, temporary, unspoken alliances are unavoidable.<br/><br/>The playing components are of unique designs. The playing pieces are hardwood and the roll-up playing board is printed on cloth-backed vinyl. The game is packaged in a nylon drawstring carrying case.<br/><br/>",

If only one player has a valid token on the card, the puppy is adopted by the owner, adding at the end of the game the victory points indicated at the top of the card. If several tokens are placed on the puppy card by different players, the puppy is cuddled, producing the effect shown at the bottom of the card. Adopted puppies are replaced in the same number by other cards. The winner is the one who, at the end of three rounds, has the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you roll two dice, and can use each die to move a different ship --you have the option of moving only one.  Some of the orbit spaces are obstacles and cannot be occupied.  You destroy an enemy ship by landing on its orbit space.  Hyper-jump spaces connect the orbits to each other.  The Planet spaces give you cards, which come in three types; collect one of each or three of a kind to build another starship.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Gameboard 21&quot; x 17&quot;<br/>4 Dice<br/>21 Resource Cards<br/>20 Starships<br/>1 Rules sheet<br/><br/>",

Each player takes the role of specialist in one of four stocks represented in the game, and does his or her utmost to increase personal wealth by trading these four stocks while performing all the &quot;market making&quot; duties that a specialist in a market performs:  Maintaining an order book; executing orders; keeping track of personal and brokerage accounts; and refreshing the quotes as the stock trades.  Refreshing the quote requires adherence to strict stock market rules that prevent price fluctuations of an unruly nature, and if this game doesn't give you a feel for what it's like to perform this very niche role in a stock market, then you'll just have to get hired for the real job!<br/><br/>",

Each player places their piece on the matching spot on the woodland board. Spread the time tiles with the written and digital time face up. Put the big analogue clock within reach.<br/><br/>Play: Each player in turn rolls the die, moving the number of spaces clockwise around the track. If you land on a clock with a question mark, everyone calls out 'What's the time Mr. Wolf?', and you pick up a tile. Read the phrase and digital clock, then move the hands on the big analogue clock to represent what was read on the tile. Turn over the tile to the analogue image, if it matches the big clock, place the tile on one of your player board spaces. If the image and analogue clock does not match, return the tile back to the pile. In both cases it is the next players turn, going clockwise.<br/><br/>If you land on the wolf picture, 'feed' one of your clock tiles on your player board to Mr. Wolf, if you have one. Again it will be the next players turn.<br/><br/>Continue until one player has filled in their player board (if you run out of tiles to draw, return the tiles from behind Mr. Wolf).<br/><br/>Second way to play if experienced is to play with only the player boards showing analogue clock faces. Set up is only making a stack with the tiles, again with the written and digital time face up.<br/><br/>Each player in turn draws the top tile to see if it will match any of the analogue times showing on their board. Turn over the tile to see if they match, if so place it on the matching image on your board, if not return it with written and digital time face up. In both cases play passes to the left.<br/><br/>Continue until one player has filled in their board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Short Order Hero is a devious, cut throat, challenge for friends wanting to flex their master culinary chops. The story behind the game is that you are one of five short order cooks working in a greasy diner. The owner of the diner tells the crew that at the end of the night he can can only keep one cook. You are working your rump roast off serving up the best you can, but your competition is doing their best to sabotage you. Can you win out and secure the job?<br/><br/>Find out if YOU can become the Short Order Hero!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Win the game by competing against other players to be the best short order cook. The Short Order Hero wins the game by scoring the most Recipe points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Five recipes have been ordered, the tickets are available for each player/cook to make. Each cook is dealt 7 Ingredient cards. Cooks in turn, lay down all of the required ingredients, thus making the recipe. In addition a cook can add spices and seasonings to their food to make it better, OR add hairs and cockroaches to their opponent's made recipes to make their food worse.<br/><br/>Cooks can play as many cards from their hand as they wish, but their turn ends once they draw a card from the Ingredients deck.<br/><br/>Each recipe is worth different point values, the added ingredients can either increase or decrease the total point value.<br/><br/>The cook with the highest total recipe value from all their made food is the Short Order Hero!<br/><br/>",

When the judge, the player chooses a category (many suggestions are printed on the board, but there is also a &quot;choose your own&quot; option).  Then, the judge takes five cards from the deck of letter cards (each contains a single letter--no duplicates).<br/><br/>At that point, the judge turns over the first letter for all to see.  When someone thinks of an item within the chosen category which starts with the appropriate letter, they blurt it out.  As soon as the judge hears an answer to their liking (know thy judge), he slams the hammer down and awards the card to the person who shouted the answer.  That player moves forward on the movement track.  After five letters are completed, someone else is the judge.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get all of your tokens around the board and back home while avoiding the traps set by Dick Dastardly. This is a game for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>You roll the dice and move a token the exact number shown on one die, and then move another (or the same token) the exact number shown on the second die. If you land on a trap space, that token goes back to their start space. If you land on the same space as an opposing player, you send that token back to their start space. You can land on a space another of your tokens occupy without ill effect.<br/><br/>This game is related to The Magnificent Race, though one is not a reprint of the other.<br/><br/>",

Sets consist of anything between 1 and 9 pieces, and each player can hold exactly 11 (behind a screen). The active player draws a piece and has to discard another piece into the middle of the table. A player can also choose to pick up pieces from the table, but whenever s/he does that, another player may remove a piece from the game (making it impossible to complete that particular set). A round ends when either a player only has complete sets, or when the tiles are exhausted. Then points are scored. Complete sets mean many points, incomplete ones, only a few.

Each port offers a particular ship upgrade that will assist players in their quest to find and keep the treasure (e.g. Cannons at Harbour Grace, Ice Breakers at Cupids Harbour, Telescopes at Pouch Cove).<br/><br/>The rest of the board starts the game face down--hidden in the bay are three lost islands (where you can find treasure maps) and Kelly's Island where Peter Easton (the Pirate Admiral) had his secret base and (according to legend) left buried treasure when he left for warmer climes. The first player to find, or steal all three treasure maps and reach Kelly's Island gets to dig up the treasure--at which point the game switches to a treasure run with every other player attempting to steal the treasure off them.<br/><br/>Most of the bay cards contain icebergs, which block your movement if they come up in the wrong places, and three shipwrecked mariners who will join your crew if you find them and rescue them--increasing your fighting strength.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ウィキッド・ラビリンス (The Wicked Labyrinth) is a bluffing card game from Japan, produced by the makers of The Wicked Forest and features the distinctive illustration of anime artist Gekidan Inu Curry (劇団イヌカレー).<br/><br/>The publisher says: <br/>You are one of the young men participating in a ritual and you enter a labyrinth inhabited by a witch with a bull's head. In order to escape, you must explore the labyrinth's &quot;corridors&quot; and collect the &quot;soul fragments&quot; of those who have entered the labyrinth in the past. However, depending on the &quot;corridors&quot; you explore, you may have to take in the &quot;witch's stain&quot; which is a negative point. You will have to explore many corridors to collect more soul shards than anyone else and escape the labyrinth.<br/><br/>Each year, only a select few are allowed to return from the ritual.<br/>The chosen young people who have just come of age enter the labyrinth. The labyrinth is said to be inhabited by a witch with the head of a cow. Those who return are honoured as heroes. And the next day, some of those who had disappeared in the labyrinth would return. All of them have the gift of heroism and will later achieve some success.<br/><br/>The game features<br/>Explore the corridors of the labyrinth and collect the &quot;soul fragments&quot;! Only the player who has more search pieces than anyone else can search.<br/><br/>However, only the player who holds more search pieces than anyone else will be able to search, and in addition to the search pieces, he can also hold the &quot;sign of the witch&quot;, which is a negative point. If it is held by another player, the searching player must take back the negative witch's stain.<br/><br/>The value of the soul can be increased by collecting soul pieces of the same colour and leveling them up. So collect as many points as you can and win!<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>The player becomes one of the young people who participate in the ritual and explores the &quot;labyrinth&quot; where the witch with the head of a cow is said to live. In this game, you have to explore the labyrinth one corridor at a time to collect the soul shard tokens. In order to do so, the player has to reveal more pieces than anyone else in order to be entitled to explore the corridors. (The player who reveals the second most pieces also gets the right to explore.) However, depending on the corridor explored, the player may have to take a negative point, the &quot;Witch's Stain&quot;. You will have to explore many corridors and collect soul shards tokens while avoiding them. With the collected soul fragment tokens, you can achieve the &quot;oracle card&quot; and get more points to escape the &quot;labyrinth&quot;!<br/><br/>あなたは儀式へ参加する若者の一人となって、牛の頭を持つ魔女が棲むという迷宮に入ります。脱出する為には迷宮の中にある「回廊」を探索して、過去に迷宮に入った者の『魂の欠片』を集めます。しかし、探索した「回廊」によってはマイナス点である「魔女の穢れ」を引き取る必要があります。それらを避けながら沢山の「回廊」を探索して誰よりも多くの『魂の欠片』を集め迷宮を脱出しましょう。<br/><br/>その儀式から帰還できる者は、毎年決まってヒトリだけ。<br/>成人を迎えたばかりの選ばれし若者が迷宮へと入っていく。 その迷宮は牛の頭を持つ魔女が棲むという曰く付きのものである。 帰還した者は英雄として称えられる。 そして、翌日にはその迷宮で過去に消えた者も数名戻っている事があった。 それらはいずれも英雄としての才能を持ち、後に何らかの成功を収める事となる。<br/><br/>【ゲームの特徴】<br/>・迷宮にある回廊を探索して、『魂の欠片』を集めよう！ただし、探索ができるのはだれよりも多く探索駒を握ったプレイヤーだけ。<br/><br/>・探索駒の他に、マイナス点である『魔女の気配』も一緒に握る事ができる。それが他のプレイヤーによって握られていたなら、探索を行うプレイヤーはマイナス点である魔女の穢れを引き取る必要がある。<br/><br/>・同色の『魂の欠片』を集めてレベルアップすることで魂の価値を上げる事ができる。そうして得点をたくさん集め、勝利せよ！<br/><br/>【ゲームの概要】<br/>プレイヤーは儀式に参加する若者の一人となり、牛の頭を持つ魔女が棲むという「迷宮」を探索します。 このゲームでは「迷宮」にある「回廊」を１つずつ探索して『魂の欠片トークン』を集めます。その為には、誰よりも多くの『探索駒』を握って公開する事により、「回廊」を探索する権利を得ます。（２番目に多く公開したプレイヤーも探索の権利を得ます。） しかし、探索した「回廊」によってはマイナス点である「魔女の穢れ」を引き取る必要があります。それらを避けながら沢山の「回廊」を探索して『魂の欠片トークン』を集めましょう。集めた『魂の欠片トークン』によって『神託カード』を達成し、より多くの得点を獲得して「迷宮」を脱出しましょう<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late summer of 1777, the British master plan to sever New England from the rest of the rebellious American colonies had come unhinged, leaving John Burgoyne's Northern Army dangerously isolated. In an attempt to break through American defenses to reach Albany, New York, Burgoyne launched his army at the American defenses on Bemis Heights. An American screen dispatched by Benedict Arnold clashed with the British advance in deep woods, triggering an afternoon-long fight fed by reinforcements for both sides. The battle ended in stalemate, as good as a defeat for Burgoyne, but might have tipped in his favor.<br/><br/>Saratoga uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>     Level: Battalion/Brigade<br/>     Hex: 352 yards<br/><br/><br/>",

Players draw &quot;quest&quot; cards which state a dice value, the reward for rolling at least this value, and the penalty for rolling less than this value. After a card is drawn, all players simultaneously play &quot;event&quot; cards that modify the minimum dice roll needed for success. The current player then rolls the dice and collects a reward/penalty, depending on the outcome.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;Renown is a moderately lengthed, stand-alone card game for 3-8 people. As bold knights errant, players struggle to outdo each other in perilous quests for the sake of glory and honor. Fortune favors the bold; only one knight can gain enough renown to become a legend.&quot;<br/><br/>Game website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://nicholaskay.com/games/games.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://nicholaskay.com/games/games.html</a><br/><br/>",

There were dozens of entries and the judges whittled them down over three rounds to find the game that best leveraged the dice in a fun new way. That winner was 9-Shooter Quick Draw by Ryan Strong.<br/><br/>As you might expect with a game about a gunfight in the dusty streets of an old west town, the rules for 9-Shooter Quick Draw (9SQD) are dead-simple.<br/><br/>Each player gets 3 gunslingers, 3 action cards, and 1 set of Square Shooters&reg; dice.<br/><br/>Both players reveal a gunslinger and face it so their opponent can see the poker hand printed on the card.<br/><br/>Both players pick up their dice and shake them in their fists until one player shouts &quot;DRAW!&quot; They both roll their dice and the gunfight begins.<br/><br/>You're trying to roll the poker hand on your opponent's gunslinger card and you can lock in any of your matching dice at any time, but after that first big roll, you can only re-roll unlocked dice that have...<br/><br/>The same number (Aces, 4's, Kings, etc...)<br/><br/>The same suit (Hearts, Clubs, etc...)<br/><br/>If you have no matching dice, you can only re-roll a single die of your choice.<br/><br/>If your opponent catches you rolling mismatched dice, you have to stop, give him a hard look, and re-roll a single random die to re-set.<br/><br/>BTW, Jokers are wild so they can be any number and suit you like.<br/><br/>That's it. You both keep rolling as fast as you can until one of you locks in all of the dice to match the other's gunslinger card. That player shouts &quot;BANG!&quot; and your gunslinger is dead! Lose all three of your gunslingers and the town's undertaker is gonna be one busy man.<br/><br/>Hey, quiet down, I hear ya. What about those action cards? Well, if you think you're ready for them I'll clue you in, but these cards are for the experts. It ain't easy dividing your attention between rollin' dice and readin' cards.<br/><br/>Each action card says when it can be used and what the effect is when it's played. You flip out the card and call out the name, then your opponent has to stop everything and do what the card says. That might mean waiting for you to get in some extra rollin', or maybe having to unlock one die.  Ouch!<br/><br/>Some of the cards are there to help you, too, like letting you re-roll mismatched dice or canceling the card your opponent just played on you.<br/><br/>They don't call it the Wild West for nuthin'!<br/><br/>",

Sounds nutty, but it&rsquo;s true.  Anyway, WoW is a game; any hints of simulation are just that, hints, although everything in the game is based on what actually happened.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a hoot, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long to play &ndash; about 90 minutes - and is much in the spirit of what the game industry calls &ldquo;Euros&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game may be played by one or two players.<br/><br/>CAVEAT&hellip; and a Word on WoW&rsquo;s  Genesis<br/><br/>No game designer in his right mind would ever think of doing a game on this subject. I, to be sure, am not of the Right-Minded tribe.  The origins of this game arise from a statement I made on Consimworld that there is no subject about which one cannot design a game. Consimworld being what it is, it took about 38 seconds before a half dozen &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;  Prove it!&rdquo; statements followed. The result was a folder entitled &ldquo;The Richard Berg Game Design Challenge&rdquo;, wherein dozens of titles were suggested. These were narrowed down to a half dozen Prime Time Possibilities by a panel of judges who, from that half dozen, chose this subject as &ldquo;ungameable&rdquo;. Me? I would have thought The Children&rsquo;s Crusade would be a lot more difficult.  But I have accepted that challenge, and this is what comes from such public foolishness.<br/><br/>",

Each of the 81 squares contains random numbers from 1 to 12, not including 2 or 7.<br/><br/>On each turn, players roll two dice, add up the numbers and mark a corresponding number with their color. If a 2 is rolled the the player loses the turn. If a 7 is rolled the player may place a marker on any spot on the board (this is the only way to mark a 1).<br/><br/>If a player marks his or her color on three numbers in a row&mdash;either vertically, diagonally or horizontally then they score! Most points wins.<br/><br/>Each player gets one point for each chip on the board, three points for each tic-tac-toe in a mini 3x3 grid, and five points for each grand tic-tac-toe (Three mini tic-tac-toes in a row&mdash;horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>The game was created by David Jisa, a Wisconsin teacher who uses games in his classroom to help motivate students. Roll-It Tic-Tac-Toe lets students practice their addition skills and develop problem-solving strategies.<br/><br/>Roll-It Tic-Tac-Toe comes in two versions&mdash;one with colored chips and 8 game boards and another with colored markers and game sheets. The game is for 2 to 6 players ages 7 and up.<br/><br/>",

Because yuppies are hell-bent on &quot;having it all,&quot; this game tests those players on accumulating wealth and everything else life has to offer.<br/><br/>The players roll the dice and move around the board following directions on the squares.  The first player to achieve seven Yuppie goals wins.  Just a sample of these goals are: getting a marriage partner, a fast-track career, and more than $150,000 in the bank.<br/><br/>",

Jim Dunnigan, then aged 25 and described in the game's &quot;designer's notes&quot; as a history major in the School of General Studies, had already designed 1914 and was at the time working on Origins of World War II, but was asked to take time out to work on this design.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, Radicals and Administration.  The map features eleven tracks for each of the political subgroups in the game (e.g. Black Students, Moderate Strikers, Alumni, Harlem Community).  The objective for the players is to have the most influence, determined by the positions of markers on these tracks, for their side by the end of the twelfth turn.  During a turn, players deploy abstracted units representing their political leverage onto the tracks to 'attack' the other player's units (as tokens, Dunnigan suggests small pieces of paper colored red or marijuana seeds for the Radicals, and blue bits of paper or capsules of Seconal for the Administration) and so move the markers towards their 'end' of the tracks.  The 24 Contingency Cards add some randomness by taking or giving units of wherewithal to one player or another.<br/><br/>SPI sold photocopies of this game supplement for a couple of years after its start.  They are hard to find now and command a high price.<br/><br/>",

Each of the eight types of cards has a value on it as well as a special ability. Each player chooses one card from their hand, then they reveal these cards in clockwise order from the starting player. Players then do this again two more times, leaving them with one card in hand.<br/><br/>Your score for the round is the sum of the value of the card in your hand and the value of the cards you played. Normally the player with the highest score earns 5 points, with the players in second and third earning 3 and 1 points respectively &mdash; but if a player has played two &quot;Pandora Cat&quot; cards, then the player with the lowest score earns 5 points! If two players have each played two &quot;Pandora Cat&quot; cards, then scoring is normal, whereas three players having done this reverses the score once again.<br/><br/>Rotate the start player position each round, and complete multiple rounds until a player has scored at least 12, 14, or 16 points in a three-player, four-player, or five- or six-player game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subtitled &quot;Simple Air To Air Combat in the Jet Age&quot;.<br/><br/>From the rulebook introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;These rules are intended to provide a very simple and fast-moving wargame using any scale of modern aircraft models available at present, in conjunction with a hexagon grid. The size of grid will obviously depend upon the scale of models used.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To keep the game simple, much of the fine detail of air combat technology has been left out. Modern air combat is highly technical, but there is insufficient hard evidence to suggest the precise relative position of technology and pilot skill. Most writers on the subject are at pains to point out that the pilot's skill is still a significant factor, and it the skill of the player, rather than the technology that I have tried to emphasis here. Obviously, technology cannot be ignored, and in most cases I have tried to reflect the main differences in generic types of weapons and aircraft. Feel free to tinker if such detail that is available is insufficient for you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules have designed with the wars of the 1960s and 1970s specifically in mind. They therefore exclude some of the more spectacular weapons developments of recent years.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is mainly 2-dimensional, although there is a simplified height- band system to represent general operating heights. A fully implemented 3- D system would be much more complex to operate, and a lot slower in play, and for that reason has not been provided here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is intended to accommodate medium numbers of aircraft, and a single player should have no difficulty in handing 3-5 aircraft at once using the basic rules. The campaign rules are a different matter, however, and there is a separate section on those.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Wort Genie, two players (or two teams) compete to find the secret words of the opponent first. There are about 100 cards, each with 6 words on it, one placed vertically, the others horizontally (crossword-like). The players each take one card secretly. On their turn, they can ask the opponent for a letter. As answer they get all occurrences of this letter in a coordinate system, just like the one of &quot;Battleship&quot;. Then the next player can ask a letter. If they think, they know some words, they can guess them before asking for a letter. If correct, they can guess another word, until they are wrong or decide to ask for a letter. To help the players, all words on one card are related to the same theme. The first player to find all words on the opponent's card gets as many points, as the difference to the number of correct words the opponent has found out is, e.g. if the looser has found four words, the winner gets two points. Play proceeds until one player has ten points.<br/><br/>The English version of the game is called Battle Words. It was published by William Maclean's Games.<br/><br/>",

The Combat units represent Regiments/Brigades/Divisions and there are Headquarters for the Russian. The RULES folder has the back page containing the Set-up and Command Control Table(Russian) while on the REVERSE side are the Turn Record Track/Combat Results Table/Terrain Effects Chart. Players may want to make copies of these Tables/Charts prior to play to facilitate their use while allowing the RULES to be made available for consultation. <br/> The Japanese player goes first with the following Sequence of play: 1.Supply Judgment phase; 2.Movement phase; 3.Combat phase, after which the Russian follows THIS Sequence of Play: 1.Command Control phase; 2.Supply Judgment phase; 3.Movement phase; 4.Combat phase. The Russian's Command phase is intended to represent the ineptness and confusion amongst the leaders of that side's forces. There are Special Rules for Japanese Artillery(allowing Bombardment from NON-adjacent hexes), Cavalry, tracing Supply along the RAIL lines, and Fortifications. There is only 1 Scenario beginning February 27 through March 16, 1905 with TURNS representing 1 Day.<br/><br/>This is another of the company's easy and concise games which they managed to produce at a time when most other companies were intent on more extensive and intensively detailed gameplay. THAT would only drive up the COST, and not only monetarily but in TIME consumed by players having to LEARN sheer volumes of Rules in order to begin to play.  <br/>  <br/><br/><br/>",

(If a stick slides onto other colors later as the tower tilts and wobbles, that's okay, but you need to match when placing!)<br/><br/>If any sticks fall off the tower on your turn, collect them and place them in front of you. When all the sticks have been placed onto the tower or when the tower falls over, the game ends immediately. If you caused the tower to fall, you don't collect any of the sticks, but you do score five points (which isn't good). Every player scores one point for each stick in front of them.<br/><br/>If anyone has eleven or more points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Stick Stack Cool Black is a new version of the origin Stick Stack game.

The population has centered to seven metropolises. Players are truck drivers trying to earn money by transporting goods from city to city, through the dangerous deserts where battles with bandits can be fatal.<br/><br/>The first player to save enough money to buy out his truck is the winner.<br/><br/>The name of this Finnish game is &quot;Battletruck&quot; in English. While probably a completely domestic design, it was almost certainly inspired by the 1982 film of the same name, as well as other post-apocalyptic road movies popular at the time, such as the Mad Max series.<br/><br/>",

As players gain followers, they are granted prayers and miracles that help them overcome the ever-present temptation of sin.<br/><br/>Although Faith and Redemption represents a fallen world, redemption is always possible and forgiveness is never more than a prayer away.<br/><br/>Faith and Redemption is a multi-part roll-and-move Christian game that differs from the traditional approach towards religious games. Most other Christian games are either trivia or simply Bible versions of existing games. Faith and Redemption strives to create a unique experience based on the teachings of the Christian Bible.<br/><br/>Players begin first by collecting animals before the Great Flood destroys all mankind. The number of matching animal pairs they collect are then traded in for prayers, which are used to combat sin throughout the rest of the game. Players then embark on the journey of a lifetime; trying to navigate their way through the trials and tribulations of both the Old and New Testaments.<br/><br/>Along the way, the players gain followers and grow in spiritual power, fighting valiantly against sins such as temptation, greed, and vanity. As the power and influence of the Devil grow, so too does the power of God, resulting in the triumphant coming of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. In the end, the player with the fewest amount of sin conquers Satan and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each game is a race to determine the correct set of properties.<br/><br/>The game is played with two sets of cards. There is a set of twenty target cards, that each show two shapes. These cards are aranged in a square. Then, four cards from the code deck are drawn. Each of these cards show a single shape. The players must now find the card that has the same shape as the first card, the same colour as the second card, the same fill as the third card and the same size as the fourth card. If a player thinks he has found the right card, he puts his finger down on the matching target card. If his guess is correct, he gains a number of the code cards as a reward. If his guess is wrong, he loses a card he has gained before.<br/><br/>Halfway through the game, things will get a bit more complex. The target cards are flipped over, and now show shapes in secondary colours. From now on, in order to determine the colour for the target card, the players must mix the colour of the shape on the code card with the background colour of the code card.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are too few code cards left to create a new assignment. The player that has gained the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The idea of Blockade predates Amazons.<br/><br/>At the beginning, both player place their moving and one neutral token on the board. Each subsequent turn, a player must move his token to an adjacent empty space. Then, he places a neutral token on the board trying to surround his opponent. The players wins who manages that the token of his opponent cannot move anymore.<br/><br/>On the first move, a restriction applies for both players. Neither the moving nor the blocking token may be placed in a marked area in the center of the board. Together with the slightly irregular board, this is supposed to cancel out any first move advantage.<br/><br/>",

However, they have to get back to their graves in time, always in danger of losing their bones to the watch dog or their fellow skeletons.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board depicting the graveyard. Each player's skeleton has to travel a round course, collecting party event cards on the way. No skeleton can return before a certain amount of party events have been collected altogether.<br/><br/>The skeletons are moved with cards, which can be either played as movement points or as actions. Movement points can be used to move the player's own skeleton or the graveyard's dog. The skeletons loose a random bone if the dog encounters them. Actions can for example result in one of the other players loosing a bone or a special movement of the player's own skeleton. The actions also typically have some prerequisites, like having a leg remaining, or being within a certain distance of another skeleton.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for the position in the race back to the starting point and for collected party events. Winner is the skeleton with the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game represents a cooperative marketing strategy by Hawaiian Punch (the drink) and Play-Doh.  It may have originally been available by mail for UPC symbols, but that is unverified.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is a simple childrens' spinner and move racing game.  Each player chooses a color, taking a clay pineapple and a plastic &quot;Punchy&quot; figurine or that color. They take turns spinning and moving down the linear path toward the finish line.  The twist is that the movement token is actually the piece of clay molded into a pineapple.<br/><br/>Players may land on a color, which gives permission for the opponent of that color to SMASH the player's pineapple with their Punchy. Other squares are &quot;safe&quot; or give further movement instructions.  A smashed pineapple may still advance to the finish line, unless it gets too flat.  Some squares call for a &quot;Size Check&quot; and if the pineapple (of flat remnant of one) exceeds the borders of the square the player must reverse directions to remold their pineapple at the start.  There are also a few squares that allow remolding along the track.<br/><br/>The average game sees most pineapples getting smashed at least once or twice. The winner is the player arriving at the finish line first.  Gameplay may last as little as 10 minutes (depending on the dexterity of the players with the Play-Doh mold).<br/><br/>",

On each card is both a number from 1-26 and a letter from A-Z.&quot; &quot; Which card should you play and do you play it as the number or the letter? Win rounds by being the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand. Score points by adding up the values of your opponents' remaining cards. Included is a custom card holder that forms two stacks of played cards - one for letters and one for numbers. The card holder's indicator designates the direction of each stack. Play a card from your hand - making sure it matches the direction of play.&quot; If you can't play a card, draw one. There are also Bomb cards, which make the next player play 2 cards (play when you think they can't!) and every card has the possibility of being a wild card, based on the colors of the discard and matching a small 2 colored circle on each card. <br/><br/>Interesting family card game with some tactical play possible.<br/><br/>",

Turn the top card face-up and place it near the starting cards. If anyone spots an item &mdash; or multiple items &mdash; that appears on two or three cards, she yells out the combined sum of all items that appear on two or three cards. For example, if three bananas appear on one card and two on another, yell out &quot;Five!&quot;; if in addition one pear appears on a card and one pear appears on another, yell out &quot;Seven!&quot; Each player can yell out at most one number, and whoever first yells the correct sum claims one of the face-up cards, then replaces it with the top card of the deck. Whoever claims the most cards wins.<br/><br/>With younger players, you can lay out only two cards at a time to keep the sums smaller and minimize the calculation; with older players, keep four cards in play, possibly adding more cards to the deck to make the game last longer.<br/><br/>",

But courage alone is not enough! Skill and intelligence are also required for the rescue operation. Only the player who catapults the knights safely into the castle and is the quickest to solve a tricky task will rescue the princess and conquer her heart.&quot;<br/><br/>In Burg Drachengold players use a catapult to launch their knight tiles one at a time into Gold Dragon Castle, which is created from the box bottom; this structure contains four rooms, three of which are occupied by a joker, a wizard and a dragon while the fourth is empty.<br/><br/>Each knight tile has on one side a capital letter or a two-digit number. Depending on the room where the knight lands, the players must perform a different task: add the two numbers, say a word beginning with the letter, just say the letter or number, grab the dragon from the tower on the board, or shout &quot;Long live King Fex!&quot; The player who does this first wins the knight tile, and the first player to collect four knight tiles wins the game.<br/><br/>Burg Drachengold includes more than a half-dozen variants that can be used individually or in combination.<br/><br/>",

Before the game begins, the players use plastic molds to cookie-cut &quot;Grubs&quot; out of the dough and place them into a mutual pile. The racetrack consist of two side-by-side plastic tracks with a finish line at one end and two plastic plungers (shaped like tree stumps) at the other (one for each player's track).<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll the die to either race or chomp a worm. If you roll a 1-4, you place the number of grubs indicated into your tree stump and press down the plunger. The dough is mashed and forced out the base in a continuous worm shape over the track. You attach a wheeled worm head to the tip of the dough and add side wheels as needed to support your worm's body. Thus the worms get longer and longer as the race progresses. If you roll a Mr. Chomp, you take a bird shaped device, chomp off the head of your opponent's worm, then place the chomped segment into your tree stump to move your worm ahead. Your opponent must then reattach the plastic worm head to the remainder of his or her worm segment.<br/><br/>The first player whose worm grows the entire length of the track, crosses the finish line, and takes the checkered flag is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.<br/><br/>&quot;Year 5 - Shadow Tactics adds 6 operators to the base game. All of them being from the fifth year, or the fifth season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment<br/><br/>For attackers, we have Iana with her Gemini Replicator. She creates holo doubles and sows confusion among enemies. Ace, from Norway, is a demolition specialist who can crumble floors and ceilings, making some spaces impassable. On top of that, this season sees Zero return! Zero as the famous (or infamous!) Sam Fisher himself&hellip; With his Argus cameras, he will force opponents to move a certain way.<br/><br/>On the defenders&rsquo; side, Oryx&rsquo;s charges are a force to be reckoned with. He can run and crash through walls! Melusi and Aruni add traps and countermeasures on the field thanks to Banshee Sonic Defences or Surya Lasers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Want to create the best festival camp ever? This is your chance &ndash; but watch out or you might end up camping with your mother...again!<br/><br/>The summer is hot and it is yet again time for a mind-blowing week at Roskilde Festival. This year is going to be greater than ever. In Camp Roskilde, the players set up their camps next to one another as they start attracting cool and crazy people from the festival grounds. Having the best camp is all about getting the right vibe &ndash; &quot;that special something&quot; &ndash; generated by the people in the camp. Will this year have a green hippie vibe, a black metal vibe, a red crazy vibe or a blue sophisticated vibe to it? Or perhaps the right mix of all of the above?<br/> In game terms, players take turns sending festival-goers and gear from &quot;The Festival Grounds&quot; (four available face-up tiles) to either their own camp (player board) or the other players' camps, and carrying out any effect the tiles might have. When, at the end of a player's turn, any camp is filled with nine tiles, the game ends and the player with a perfectly diverse camp wins. If such a camp is not present, the player with the most well-themed camp wins, calculating points by taking the strongest represented color (vibe) in a camp and subtracting the second-strongest color, ignoring the rest.<br/><br/>Camp Roskilde is a short theme-driven game with simple game mechanisms. You don't need to have visited Roskilde Festival to play the game, but it helps a lot with the fun factor if you have.<br/><br/>",

First they have to collect casino tokens and then go to the five face-up canasta cards (showing scenes from the second movie) to collect them for tokens. On their way they can also use rat-holes for faster travel. In the easier version (for smaller children) number of steps is determined by dice rolling, in the 'heavier version' players choose from their 6 movement cards (and after 6 rounds they can use all of these movement cards again). In the easier version you get points for tokens (different tokens have different value) and for collected cards (cards with cats have a higher value than other cards). In the heavier version you bid for the cards you have come at, and score for the cards' value and extra points for pairs and trios...<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.macskafogojatek.hu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.macskafogojatek.hu/</a> (Hungarian)<br/><br/>",

Now that everyone has decided what car they are (secretly) rooting for, you're off to the races.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>On their turn a player rolls 3 dice from the pool. They then have to allocate one die each to two different racing stalls and discard the last die.

A car in first place for example is moved only one space forward, a car in fourth place is moved four spaces accordingly. You only count individual rows containing 1 or more cars. If for example 4 cars are tied for first place the last car is considered to be in second place for this purpose.<br/><br/>Splash - the mud hole<br/>If a car ends its movement in the mud hole it gets stuck.

If it came one in one place too late you still score 2 points. If it came in too early or too late, you score no points.<br/>Whoever manages to score the most points with their two cars wins and is crowned the King of Caracho.<br/><br/>",

The number the opposing player needs to beat to score a hit on them. This Defence can be added to when the player chooses to Defend.<br/><br/>Players secretly choose dice to roll, and roll them simultaneously onto the table. Players can choose to Attack (with a weapon and a gauntlet), Defend (with a weapon or a shield), Jostle/Disarm (with a Gauntlet) or Regather (where a player only feigns to roll dice, allowing them to return dice rolled on previous turns to their hand).<br/><br/>The dice results are compared and players may retrieve only one of their rolled dice, the rest are &quot;placed with their squire&quot;.<br/><br/>The game can be played using optional Knight and Items cards that introduce variable player powers and greater tactical depth.<br/><br/>",

He's been making one of each of the many pairs of twins disappear. The goal of the game is for the superhero player to find the twin card which has the missing pair. During each round, a player acts as the villain Forest Fox who keeps their chosen missing twin card out of sight while the other players, who act as the superheroes, close their eyes.<br/><br/>The superheroes then start searching for the twin card with the missing pair after the villain player turns over the sand timer. If a superhero player thinks they've found it, they immediately mark the card with their play figure. If the correct twin card is marked, the round ends and they receive both twin cards. If the incorrect twin card is marked, they may not continue searching anymore and the round continues. If all superhero players marked the wrong twin card or the sand timer runs out, the villain player wins the round and keeps the twin cards they hid.<br/><br/>The game ends when only 8 twin cards remain in the center at the end of the round. The winner is the player with the most pairs of twins. If there is a tie, the tied players shall share the win.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of a General, controlling different types of units to win glory and the battle.<br/><br/>While playing in a 3*4 tiles battleground, players are acting as either French (Attacker) or English (Defender) generals, who will execute their military tactics with unique sets of armies, in assigning tactical formations for winning tactical positions, resources, siege weapons, and finally, the battle.<br/><br/>The game is conducted in 4 rounds with several phases in each round. In these phases, players will obtain their unique heroes, armies, and strategic cards. They will assign these heroes, along with the units in different locations for making an advantage in winning or cheating their opponent. After everything is set, players will alternatingly activate armies&rsquo; skills in making an influence in the battle. Through eliminating, suppressing, flicking, and deforming opponent&rsquo;s formation, players will conclude the battle result by simply counting who has more units surviving and conquering these areas. After claiming resources (woods, rocks or alchemies mass) as a new landlord, players are granted the right to build tactical siege weapons (e.g. catapults, siege ram or watchtowers) on their lands for advanced tactical moves in the next round.<br/><br/>After fighting for 4 rounds, a final battle result will be out &ndash; either French conquering the English land, or the English successfully safeguarding their place.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The last player to make a successful play before the tower falls wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is similar to some Jenga versions that have colored planks, but has more colors.<br/><br/>Similar to Tumblin Dice Timberrr but this game has more planks (54 vs 48), it has more colors (6 vs 5), and there are some differences in the rules, perhaps the main one being that there is no option to &quot;Pass&quot; on the die, so that players are on the hot seat every turn and don't get any turns during which they are not at risk.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ramen &mdash; for some, it is a brutally delicious noodle soup originally from Japan. For its makers, ramen is the center of an intensely brutal fight in a mega-market. In the metropolis of Tokyo, cooks compete fiercely for the best ingredients so they can satisfy their customers' needs and desires.<br/><br/>In Ramen Chef, you are at the forefront of this battle. Play as one of up to four chefs who run their soup business with sophistication and brains in order to become Tokyo's greatest ramen chef. Your greatest weapon? Your smart head!<br/><br/>Ramen Chef features a literal flip of a classic memory game. You are trying to match ingredients from a 3x3 grid, and collect ingredients that match a secret objective. However, all of the ingredient tiles are double-sided, meaning you need to remember both sides of the tiles in front of you. On your turn, you must verbally state the ingredient you see BEFORE you flip, then flip the tile to reveal the opposite side. If after the second flip, your two tiles (on their opposite sides) now match, you are able to collect one of those tiles for your restaurant and work towards fulfilling your secret objective tile. The player with the most tiles &mdash; both ingredients and completed objective tiles&mdash; wins.<br/><br/>But be careful! If the opposites sides of your target tiles do not match, you collect nothing, and may leave a combination of tiles that your opponent can now use instead. Surprisingly tactical and shockingly difficult for only nine tiles, Ramen Chef is sure to leave you questioning your memory abilities and hungry for ramen!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Shortly before the opening of your pub the disaster happens. The competitors send hooligans to your premises that are about to destroy your work. You are determined to fight. Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!<br/><br/>Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.<br/><br/>By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This db spiele game can be translated to &quot;Hops and Malt&quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.<br/><br/>",

Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.<br/><br/>There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &quot;receipts&quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &quot;Take Off&quot; (e.g. &quot;Go&quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.<br/><br/>",

The track and other charts are printed on something akin to vinyl.<br/><br/>Drivers choose a speed from 1 - 12 squares with the cost of the moves measured in fuel use.  The larger the change in gears (up or down), the more fuel is used.  Corners have an ideal speed, and exceeding that can cause tire wear, speed loss, and movement to the outside of the curve.

Features 1 soft king pin and 5 soft bunny pins, with ribbons, bells, and wooden bases; plus 2 soft, safe 'cabbage' bowling balls. Bowling Bunnies was inspired by turn-of-the-century [late 1800s/early 1900s] parlor games. During this period, long before the advent of television or radio, families would gather together to play game sin the parlor, now known as the family or living room. Or on a bright sunny day, the family would play together on the lawn! Originally called Skittles, there were many different styles of bowling games using different kinds of animals and people as pins. Our classic game brings charming bunnies to life. Children and adults will delight in seeing these bunnies fall and tumble about, inspiring the imagination of all involved. We hope that your children will enjoy the simple pleasure of setting up the little bunny pins and trying to bowl them over with the soft green cabbage balls. Bowling Bunnies are fun for the child in all of us. Begin a new tradition in your home; start a family game time today!&quot;<br/><br/>",

There are 66 Resource cards of the three varieties in various denominations, 24 Domestic Event cards, and 18 Chaos cards. A game turn consists of drawing Domestic Event cards (which cause Resources to be drawn, discarded, or redistributed), turning over a Chaos card (which threatens the peace and requires an amount of a certain type of Resource to avert), and either passing the Chaos card to the next round or collectively playing Resource cards that total the amount required by the Chaos card in order to neutralize it. If, in ten turns, ten Chaos cards can be neutralized *and* each nation has total resource points equal to or greater than it started with, the players win.<br/><br/>This game was the first and possibly only one produced (in a limited edition of 500) by Pittsburgh-based Borderland Games, whose name and house logo were derived from the classic fantasy novel &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; by William Hope Hodgson.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of the game is to Push your Prince from its home position to one of the crowned squares on the opposite side of the board (the edge rows).  This is achieved with the help of your eight Escort pieces.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move either your Prince (1, 2 or 3 steps) or an Escort (by its exact value: 3, 4, 5 or 6).  Each step is horizontal, diagonal or vertical --but the board is odd.  It is 33x33 with 64 3x3 tiles &quot;punched out&quot;, some with a connected square remaining in the middle.<br/><br/>Jumps aren't allowed.  A Push occurs when an Escort arrives short of another piece (Princes can't Push); what happens is that the Escort's remaining steps are transferred to the pushed piece --which may be an opposing piece or your own Prince.  The pushed piece's move must be in a straight line, in the direction dictated by the collision.  When the straight line isn't possible, deflection occurs as indicated in the rules.  Compound pushes can occur, when a pushed piece in turn collides with another.<br/><br/>",

But then the body of Mellors, the butler, is discovered, with a revolver in his hand, a bullet in his head and suicide note that says: 'I have seen too much, and can take no more.'<br/><br/>What did the butler see?  Did he really kill himself?  Or did one of your guests murder him?<br/>Those present at the dinner-party are:<br/><br/>    Bunny Mandelson, a gentleman of very little brain.<br/>    Agatha Eton-Hogg, his fiancee, and inquisitive and intelligent young woman.<br/>    Sir Douglas Eton-Hogg, Agatha's uncle and a highly respected Member of Parliament.<br/>    Oscar Hemmingway III, an American big-game hunter and ivory merchant.<br/>    Sister Morticia Lewinskaya, a Russian-born nun now resident in Chicago.<br/>    Mary Lippe-Anstoldt, one of the leading stars of the Edwardian Music Hall and a friend of Agatha.<br/>    Herr Schnapps, a successful German industrialist and business-partner of Sir Douglas.<br/>    Georgette Michel, a young Frenchwoman who is only just recovering from her ordeal of going downon the Titanic.<br/><br/><br/>",

This goal is achieved by gathering magical items that are most compatible with their character.<br/><br/>At the start, each player is given a secret Wizard card (each with its SpellName and element type) and a hand of cards.  A Magic Item card is then revealed, starting off a round of fighting for it.  Taking turns, the players draw a card from the common deck and play, keep or discard it.  Through these cards, the players deploy heroes and monsters to fight, boost them up with equipment and spells, and kill off certain types of units.  The player with the highest value from his cards wins the Magic Item.  Played cards are discarded, and the next round begins by revealing another Magic Item.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards in the deck have been drawn.  The players reveal their wizards and tally the points for their artifacts' affinity with their wizard's element type.  The player with the highest score is the winner.  During the game, each player has one chance to guess another player's element type.  If the guess is correct, the target cannot win the game at the end even if he or she has the most points.<br/><br/>",

Rules are intended for miniatures and tape measures, though conversions are included for BYOHM (bring your own hexgrid map).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Precis Intermedia brings back this classic board/miniatures game. Originally published in 1977 by Wee Warriors, The Embattled Trek was created during an era without today's advanced software and print services, making indie publishers of the time truly special.<br/><br/>From out of the black void, two silent fleets deploy. They meet in battle to decide their disputed rights to a small but important section of the galaxy.<br/><br/>As a captain aboard one of the armed fighting ships of the Confederated Planetary Systems, you stand ready with your top scientists, engineers, and crew to meet the finest of a newly-contacted Empire. Facing an enemy with more-powerful weapons at short range, it is your task to use the best advantages of your individual ships to negate those of the Empire.<br/><br/>The Embattled Trek represents tactical level play of ship-to-ship combat between the forces of two space powers. Due to the novel combat system using subtractive percentages, the game cannot be counted as won until the last of the enemy ships is destroyed or disabled. And simultaneous plotted movement provides a clean-playing, fast game, where one mistake can cost you your fleet.<br/><br/>Two sizes of counters are provided to allow for hex-map play or use in tabletop gaming. Three-dimensional ships may also be used with these rules.<br/><br/>Requires a set of percentile dice and a six-sided die.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher of the revised 2019 edition<br/><br/>",

From thin air they could conjure mighty storms, raging fires, howling winds, and terrifying creatures. Some say the Casters could even manipulate time itself, bending it to their will. In their quest for power, the order discovered a chaotic quasi-element.

The outer track includes spaces for State Primaries, Ballots, Strategy Cards and Progress Report cards, as well as the entrances to various key Caucus tracks and to the risky &ldquo;Smoke-Filled Room&rdquo; where the party bosses will either heap rewards or boot you from the game.<br/><br/>Primary spaces are like Monopoly properties: the first to land claims them, and others then pay &ldquo;rent&rdquo; in  the form of Uncommitted Delegates. Landing on the entrance to a Caucus allows moving along its track and maybe winning its large bloc of votes (but a later player can win it back). Players may hold Demonstrations by making a declaration; if their next three moves avoid any squares with negative consequences, he gets 30 delegates from each player and can move to any square on the board. Failure means paying 20 delegates to each player.<br/><br/>Whenever a player lands on a Ballot square, hands are scored, and the leading player wins a Bandwagon effect (50 Delegates from each other player). A player that gets ahead therefore tries to trigger other ballots as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>",

Each round, three parrots fly onto the board from directions based on die rolls. Players then select movement options from different-complex cards, and simultaneously decide how their ship will move. The Parrots fly and then the ships move, and when a ship &quot;catches&quot; a parrot it keeps it. But if later the ship moves across an island, they lose a parrot as it flies off the ship to look for food. Whoever collects the most parrots by game end wins.<br/><br/>",

Players strategize together and have a 50-50 chance of staving off the end of the world.<br/><br/>--From the designer:<br/>&quot;My lifelong passion is the environment. I've been an alarmist eco-nut since the 60's, when as editor of the Los Angeles Free Press, the grandaddy of the underground press, I became aware of the man-made threats to habitation on the planet. In 1980, I created Save the World, the cooperative environmental board game. Players were confronted with all the threats to the planet and offered all the solutions, with the idea of taking them out into real life.  So far, the game has not achieve its mission. When I started research for Save the World, I didn't think we'd be around this long. After two years of study, I concluded that a small number of humans would survive, and a small number of other species: some consolation, I guess. I'm pleasantly surprised that we're still here, but the long-term prospects are still not encouraging.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A unique game, Battle Chips contains 30 wooden chips divided into two armies (orcs versus barbarians).  Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.<br/><br/>On a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.<br/><br/>Certain faces have different abilities, however:<br/><br/>     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),<br/>     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat<br/>     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself<br/>     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).<br/><br/><br/>After all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.<br/><br/>When one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.<br/><br/>While it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.<br/><br/>For those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.<br/><br/>",

If only the camels smelled better ...<br/>---end back cover blurb---<br/><br/>Abdul's Adventures comes in a ziplock bag.  The cover of the game unfolds to become the map, four times the size of the cover.  The illustrated rulebook is 16 pages long (half size paper), and the game includes six sheets of cardstock counters to cut out (and possibly mount).  LOTS of camels, for those who like camels, including one name Fritz.  Other counters include nomads, wolves, commodities, water, Arabs galore, and informational markers.<br/><br/>In town you can take two actions per turn, including stocking up on water, hiring guards, buying commodities, selling commodities or artifacts, buying camels, etc.  On the trail it's roll a d6 and move, and hope you land on a space you've planned ahead for.  Possible spaces include wolves, nomads, oases, open desert, pyramids (find artifacts), and sandstorms.<br/><br/>The game ends when one person has delivered 100 shekels worth of goods - regardless of how much you spent during the game to buy more camels and goods!  Thus it's possible to win while almost broke.<br/><br/>There are also advanced rules for commodities speculation.<br/><br/>",

When armed with sufficient points of evidence, a team can move to a space occupied by a rival piece, exhibit the incriminating revelations, and thus capture the rival.

On the whole it works well, but the letter &quot;h&quot; is surprisingly difficult to get rid of. There are very few Swedish words of a reasonable length that have &quot;h&quot; anywhere but first.

A variation where players have to name which Home is at each place they land on the map, makes the game harder.  The game dates from 1967 and is now quite rare to find.<br/><br/>",

You may decide to be a Conference line or an Independent line.<br/><br/>You may decide to sail from Northport, Southport or Gulfport. You may decide to accept cargo, pass, or bid competitively for it.<br/><br/>Every day on the North Atlantic, ships cross the ocean, carrying American cago for sale in Europe. A week or so later, these same ships are unloaded and refilled with containers of European goods, which are brought back to America.<br/><br/>Some of the shipping lines belong to a Conference, an association in which all members agree to charge the same rates and do business in an identical way to other Conference members. Some shipping lines remain Independent, which means they set their own rates (generally slightly lower than Conference rates) and do business in a way they feel is best for them and their customers.<br/><br/>Some ships sail from Northern parts, and others sail from Southern or Gulf Coast parts, where the weather at sea is generally calmer.<br/><br/>Shipping lines naturally prefer to carry cargo which pays the highest rate and often bid against each other to win an account. If they lose the bid, sometimes they must sail with an empty container. Some lines prefer to carry lower-priced cargo since they would rather have a lower profit than no profit at all, which is the case when you have to sail with an empty container.<br/><br/>In the real world, of course, there are many more things to consider when you own a shipping line. We describe them in the pages following these rules. But the concepts referred to above are what you will be concerned with when you play...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally published in 1923, this is one of six &quot;S&amp;E Games&quot; titles by Stoll &amp; Edwards. It is a simple spin-and-move race through the episodes of Charles Perrault's authored version of Cinderella (1697): Cinderella having to watch her stepsisters go to the ball, her fairy Godmother appearing, the three nights of the ball, and so on. The board is laid out in a spiral with many spaces including elements of the story, but only some of them instructing players to advance or move back a few spaces or lose turns. One space asks players to draw a random &quot;magic leaf&quot; and do what it says. The board is 16&quot; square and printed in just three colors (black, red, and blue).<br/><br/>Under the original &quot;Game of Cinderella&quot; title, it was reprinted along with its five sibling games in 1928, as part of Stoll &amp; Edwards' &quot;Two-Games-in-One&quot; series. These featured a two-sided board with the race game on one side and a checkerboard (for chess or checkers) on the other. Implements and rules were included for one game along with &quot;a full set of checker men&quot; (as a Stoll &amp; Edwards catalog put it) for the other.<br/><br/>A decade later, in their next incarnation as Stoll &amp; Einson, the publisher reissued the game as &quot;Cinderella&quot; under their Playjoy brand. The single-sided board of this edition was slightly bigger than the original, with redrawn art utilizing a wider variety of colors.<br/><br/>In each edition, the game included a cardboard &quot;indicator&quot; (spinner) and 12 red magic leaf cards (which look a lot like hearts). The 1923 edition included colored wooden discs as player tokens, while the 1928 and 1934 editions used turned wooden pawns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This one-on-one action/dexterity game pits the G.I. Joe action figure Duke against Cobra infantry trooper Neo-Viper in a match to five points. Turning the controller allows the two figures to attack with kicks and punches, with the object to connect with a small &quot;strike plate&quot; on the opposing character's chest (which releases the catch holding the figure to the controller), knock him out and score a point. Anyone who's ever enjoyed Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots will likely get a &quot;kick&quot; out of this one, which plays at a much faster pace and allows for a greater variety of attacks.<br/><br/>Others in the line included Batman vs. the Joker and a Small Soldiers tie-in.<br/><br/>",

Choose a timed game, or set target dollar and stock values.<br/>No one is ever put out of the game by bankruptcy. Elements of skill and luck ensure that anyone can win, even if they are behind in the play.<br/><br/>This  financial game is based on buying and selling stock in 6 different commodities. The board shows a throw dice and move track. Stock prices can crash or be forced to split, penalizing or benefiting those that hold the effected stock. Two card decks 'News' and 'Permission' are drawn from when landing on the appropriate spots. With those cards one can affect the price of the stock. One might force  a stock split or purchase an option. Options work just like in real life. You commit to and pay for shares and then when you land on one of the stock's squares and based on what the going rate for the stock is at that time you will either make or lose money.<br/><br/>",

All children participate in every round, with a whole new challenge arising every time. The idea is wonderfully simple: children try to form a word that contains certain letters, which they acquire by using the letter spinner. The longer the word, the more points are given. Six special categories guide the kids along - &quot;Food or Drink&quot;, &quot;Object or Thing&quot;, &quot;Living Creature&quot;, &quot;Something in the House&quot;, &quot;Boy's or Girl's Name&quot; and &quot;Any Word&quot;. To add to the excitement, the word must be formed before time runs out! Wordplay For Kids is not only challenging and competitive to play, but it is also a way for children to constantly test and improve world building skills in a fun environment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the tide of WW2 began to sway in favor Allies in the Fall of 1943 with the Italian sudden surrender, the British began to pursue their peripheral strategy, linked with expansionist aims in the Balkans. However, oddly enough, they would not sanction adequate ground, sea and air forces to mount it. The British however, possibly because the capture of the Dodecanese had been one of Churchill's favorite projects ever since war began, plunged in hell or high water, ignoring the fact that boldness does not always equate to success. <br/>Kos, even today, remains a quaint island unchanged in many ways since 1943. Located in the Aegean Sea, four miles from the Turkish coast is 28 miles long and 6 miles wide, at the widest point. It has an area of about 115 square miles, and a population of 20,000 in 1943, an airfield at Marmari, near the coast, another at Antimachia, and an emergency landing ground under construction at Lambia, near the town of Kos. The highest elevation is 2800 feet. Because of the airfields and its small port, Kos was one key, which would unlock the Aegean. If it could be taken, argued the British, Rhodes would fall and with Rhodes in British control, the other islands garrisoned with Italians, would certainly surrender. The other Allies, the Americans, were not interested in the least and refused to even lend a few P-38 squadrons until too late.<br/><br/>Thus, the British were on their own to pursue what Churchill had wanted: the soft underbelly of Europe.<br/><br/>OPERATION EISBAR was the German operation, a prelude to Leros, to prevent the British the most important first step: Kos. The game is a unique blend that allows for either player to win. The first step for the Germans is to destroy the three Spitfire squadrons based on Kos. Only when this is accomplished can German forces invade the island or drop their paratroopers. For the British, if they can cause sufficient aircraft losses during the first phase (German air raids), they may persuade them not to invade Kos. Failing this, the British Kos garrison with one battalion must prevent the Germans from either landing or if they land, defeat them on shore. British BB, CV or DD's may suddenly appear causing havoc, yet, become targets for the Luftwaffe. British Beaufighters may also suddenly appear during an air raid or invasion and torpedo the German ships. The Random Events will make each game's outcome totally different. Above all else, the British must fly in their supplies using only eight DC3s during the first phase.<br/><br/>The game's scale is platoons and company sized units, individual ships, each air counter is four aircraft. Each hex is 800 yards, game turns are 3-4 hours. The game lasts from Sept 17 to Oct 4. While the number of turns appears a lot, in reality, during Phase 1 (from Sept 17-Oct 2) turns move rapidly as only air battles and bombing occurs. Each player plans which map zone to defend and attack and what time!<br/><br/>The game map is divided into area zones and used to determine which areas of the island will be targeted by the German, defended by the British. They also serve for placement of British Naval and off map based aircraft which may randomly appear! There 280 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UPI) The Soviet Union suffered its greatest defeat at the Zhawar Complex near the Pakistan border on April 3rd. The Soviet 38th Commando unit, supported by Mi-24 gunships landed into what was thought safe ground, Instead, the Mujahideen armed with numerous SAMs, a few tanks, and many ZPU AA guns wreaked havoc on the 38th. SU-25s using laser guided bombs attacked the caves of Zhawar. One missile actually was guided into the cave. The 38th fought for its life as the enemy closed in on the multiple LZs, some 500-800 of them. The 38th, with 500 men, scattered, fought the whole day. By evening, most had been killed or captured and some 10-15 of the 32 helicopters used, destroyed.<br/><br/>THE SOVIET NADIR comes with over 280 counters, 11x17 color map, rules. Game scale is tactical, 15 men per counter, 2 hr turns. Units include RPG, Plamya, T-54, ZPU, and more. Also included are Su-25s, Mi-24, Mi-8, Mi-4 helicopters.

You would think that the &quot;C &amp; C-Ancients&quot; people would've have collaborated with these MINIS makers, to produce a much more appealing approach for THAT, and it's not like WE can't combine those for ourselves.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/>The military historical game &quot;Battles of Alexander the Great&quot; is based on the events of the Hellenic campaign to the East. In the spring of 334 BC the united Hellenic army invaded the Persian kingdom. Battles followed one after another. Battles of different peoples tried to resist the conquerors: Persian bowmen, Scythian cavalry, Indian elephants. The game has five scenarios of the most important battles.<br/><br/>Two to six players can participate in the game. The combat characteristics of the armies are close to historic. Tactical maneuvering by regiments is of great significance in the game. A skillful commander can bring an army to a victory over an out numbering enemy. The kit contains six scenarios, each of them making you able to reproduce a historic battle or try to change it. In any case one needs to win not only by number, but also by skill.<br/><br/>Zvezda 8223<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game each player secretly selects eight items, represented by nicely illustrated cards, of the sixteen different antiques available (the deck includes three of each type) recording these on a score pad.  Each item is likely to have a different value, representing the resale value for each player.  The object therefore is to purchase as many of the selected items as possible for less than the resale price.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to auction the cards.  The progress of each auction is unusual in being determined by die rolls. The auctioneer rolls a die to &quot;establish the reserve&quot;. The next player in rotation can either roll again, the value shown being added to the reserve price or drop out.  This continues until only one player remains in the bidding. The cost of the item is then the sum of all the die rolls!<br/><br/>Items other than the eight may be purchased but  at the game end they will represent a loss there is no resale value) and at any point a player may offer an item or items for sale at a price to be negotiated.<br/>The game continues until one player has accumulated his or her<br/>portfolio of eight items, the game ends immediately and all players calculate their profits.<br/><br/>The largest profit wins.<br/><br/>",

The 28 large Rizzi art cards have values between 0 and 6; each of the two players receives twelve. On a player's turn, they must discard a card from their hand. To discard, a player must either create a new discard pile or place the card on an existing discard pile - but in that case, the value of the card must be exactly one higher than the card onto which it is to be placed. If there are already three discard piles on the table, then a player has no choice but to discard to one of the piles.

Really. Behold a random sampling from the rules' index:<br/><br/><br/>     Ceremonial Magic<br/>     Bombards<br/>     Metamorphoids<br/>     Sacrificial Victims <br/>     Chariots<br/>     Oblique movement of self-disciplined units<br/>     Rules for innate chi projection<br/>     Killing rampaging large mounts<br/>     Infernal Engine Disadvantages   <br/>     Unconscious and mad magic users<br/>     Aerial unit fatigue<br/>     &quot;Goetic Magic Hour Correspondence Charts&quot;<br/>     Effects of routing units on dray animals<br/>     Klipothic and Beneficient Magic<br/><br/><br/>The rules' color text claims that the magic system &quot;is based on the actual grimoires (magical texts) that guided medieval European thaumaturges (workers of miracles).&quot; Cardstock sheets are designed to be cut into individual spell cards marked with &quot;evocation circles, mystical symbols, demons and angels that have been familiar to magic users for centuries.&quot; It is hard to judge the historical accuracy of such statements, but the book is packed with so many spell charts, Astral Force cards, magic critical fail results, and the affects of &quot;High Magic Color&quot; rules that Merlin would probably sell his left one for just one peek at the last 30 pages of the book.<br/><br/>",

To start, a Monster Card is drawn and placed in the center of the table. On your turn you may either draw 1 Number Card from the pile or pass. You are trying to draw cards whose total is closest to the number on the Monster Card without going over. When all players have passed, the cards are revealed.

Here he is, giving them to the guests who are shocked by this dreadful vision !<br/><br/>The Countess is beside herself and orders her servant to quickly do something otherwise he will be fired. But Alfred is too old to catch the monkey ! So he decides to ask the many participants to go into the living room after he gets back the panties that are being given out Koko. Hopefully when he eventually catches Koko, he will be able to get several pairs of underwear back simultaneously. Anyway he&rsquo;ll have to make sure that at 5 o&rsquo;clock, no more guest still has a piece of underwear in hand or he loses his job.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Following the American Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, the Thirteen Colonies engaged the British forces in the Revolutionary War. After the war ended, representatives from the colonies met to ratify the U.S. Constitution and select a leader. In Perfect Union, it is your task to influence the vote in each of the colonies so that your candidate gets elected president.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is played over seven rounds, with each player playing a single card from a fixed set each round. All the cards played in a round must be different. Most of the cards allow the player to place a certain number of pieces on the board, divided among the colonies as they wish. Two of the cards allow players to move already-placed pieces.<br/><br/>At the end of the game each colony is assessed and the player with the most pieces in each wins its votes. If there's a tie the colony is temporarily ignored. If no player reaches 22 votes the lowest player's pieces are removed from the board and everything is re-assessed.<br/><br/>The rules give no maximum number of players, but six seems reasonable.<br/><br/>",

One needs at least 20 points for the first laying out, and the words must be formed from at least three letters.  When laying out one may extend existing words or change them to new words.

        "description": "Gist is a card game of combing colors to make other colors.<br/>Players try to take the most cards.  The deck is comprised of only six different types of cards:  magenta, red, yellow, green, cyan and blue.  Each round a player starts with 6 dealt cards, and may do one of four actions: Show, Activate, Combine and Take.  To show a card a player takes a card out of is hand and places it on the table in front of him, it still belongs to him.  To activate, take a show card and place it in the center of the table, which now belongs to all.  To Combine, a player may take one card from his hand and combine it with one of his show cards, combine two of his show cards, combine one of his show cards with an active card, or two active cards.  Only cards whose colors are one color apart on the color wheel may be combined.  For example red and blue makes magenta, and blue and cyan makes green.  To Take cards, a player takes one of his show cards (or a combination as if it were the combined color) and an active card, (or combination) and puts them aside for scoring at the end of the round.  To take, the colors must be exactly opposite on the color wheel, for example a blue show card (or magenta, cyan combination) takes yellow active card (or red, green combination).<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow combining more than two cards to make combinations, thus yellow combined with a blue/red combination (as if it were magenta) makes red.<br/><br/>Although the number of players is stated as 2 to 6, there is no five player version.  Two decks of 36 cards, six of each color come with the game, one deck is used for 2 or 3 players, both are used for 4 or 6 players.<br/><br/>",

If you&rsquo;re lucky the little mouse will help you, but be careful that the rooster doesn&rsquo;t stumble through your nest.<br/>A fun colour and memory game.<br/><br/>The game contains a large (approx. 40 cm), colourful gameboard illustrated by Hermien Stellmacher.  The board has 20 recessed spaces to hold the wooden eggs (5 each of 4 colours) and 4 matching hen's nests with coloured spaces for each egg.  There is a die showing 1 space of each colour, plus 1 mouse and 1 rooster.  The rules detail 2 versions:<br/>1.  A straight memory version where the aim is to gather the 5 eggs in your colour before the other players.<br/>2.  A version where the winner is the first player to gather 5 eggs in any colour where you keep the egg if you match the colour rolled on the die.  A mouse rolled on the die gives you an extra egg, a rooster returns an egg from your nest to the henhouse floor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BOLTON BONANZA is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the City of BOLTON in the North-West of England.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

They also have a picture of an Indian with the name of a tribe (Potawatomi, Kiowa, Sioux, etc.) on the body, but for playing purpose, the tribes are irrelevant.  The score card consists of jutting triangles of different colors and boxed numbers in 5 colors.<br/>The arrow-heads are dealt out to players face down.  Each player in turn places an arrow-head on either the score card or a previously played arrow-head so that the color of the head matches the color of the tail it fits into, thereby creating a box of one color.  Players attempt to optimize their score by finding the match for their arrow-head that results in the largest available score on the score card.  The score is recorded each time an arrow-head is played.  If there is no available match for the player, he forfeits his turn, and must try again with the same arrow-head next turn.<br/>Play continues until all arrow-heads have been played.  The winner has the highest total.<br/><br/>",

The owner of the game simply specifies a number of 'teams' for a league, and then plays out a number of contests to determine a winner.  The 'teams' are simply a bunch of names, since players have no specific individual characteristics.<br/><br/>The game engine is a set of 100 cards with a series of play results on them.  Results are situation specific; thus a play with one out will turn out differently depending on whether there are runners on 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, or none on.  Each card also has two orientations, with a different set of play results on each side.<br/><br/>The game was marketed in conjunction with The Sporting News magazine.  Included was an abbreviated version of TSN's booklet, &quot;Batting And Pitching Averages At A Glance&quot;, which is designed to help the player figure out batting averages and other stats for his 'teams'.<br/><br/>",

The masses are getting restless, and the only thing Emperor Injurius will accept is a massive ratings sweep to bring the people back into the fold. A bright young ad executive at Mars Metals thinks of it first... Why not put Mecks in the Arena?<br/><br/>After the Meck War, which ended shortly before the League was formed, humanity swore they would never lose control of their machines again. These arena Mecks would be tightly controlled, highly programmed, and well sponsored by the huge corporations that Emperor Injurius had created to run the League.<br/><br/>After just one match, which put two squads of Mecks against each other, Emperor Injurius knew he had found a winner. The ratings were the highest ever recorded. Humanity had found its newest fad - Meck Wars!<br/>..<br/>.Summary from the back of the book:<br/><br/>It is the 22nd Century. After several years of successful gladiatorial games, Emperor Injurius has brought forth a new challenge, in the form of an old enemy, to increase the ratings of the arena battles.<br/><br/>Every gladiator who fights in the arena remembers this enemy. Every gladiator who dies for glory knows that it is a new battle. Every gladiator who hoped never to fight them again must face them one more time...<br/><br/>The Mecks have returned!<br/><br/>Salvaged from the battlefields of the Solar System, their metal and ceramic bodies re-built, their cold, calculating minds re-programmed, Mecks are the ultimate Corporate product.<br/><br/>They don't draw a salary, they take sponsorship without complaint, and they bring in the &quot;underdog&quot; viewer ratings that were sorely missing from recent human matches. The first Meck match was Meck vs Meck, but as their teams of programmers learned to refine their behavior, the Mecks were introduced against humans. Suddenly it was as if the Meck War had never ended.<br/><br/>You control a squad of five Mecks: the heavy Jumper leads from the front; a pair of middle-weight Spartans carries the firepower into battle; the light and fast Runners round out the team with speed only a Cheetah Suit's transmission could match.<br/><br/>Mecks earn Battle Honors the same way humans do, and can also gain software/power upgrades and hardware improvements. Their weapons are modular and may be switched from meck to Meck before any battle. Their command structure differs from human methods as well, owing to their networked nature. No distance to calculate for Command Points!<br/><br/>Meck Wars is not a stand-alone game. You need a copy of Injurius Games to play Meck Wars.<br/><br/>",

Comes in a very large box (17&quot; x 12&quot; x 8&quot;).<br/><br/>The game consists of a large hat with spring platform, four plastic rabbits (three of which glow in the dark), a large silk Hocus Pocus handkerchief, a wand with four detachable tips and many rings that are the game's 'currency' which also glow in the dark and must be  worn on the fingers of players.<br/><br/>When a player has won enough rings during gameplay (they must be wearing 10 rings BEFORE their turn) they get the opportunity to insert the tip of the wand into the hat &amp; release the spring, causing the rabbits to pop up in the air.  This may or may not occur, depending on whether the correct wand tip is chosen.<br/><br/>The first player to make the rabbits fly out of the hat is the winner.<br/><br/>Although this game can be played in the light (by pretending the black rabbit is 'invisible') it is much more atmospheric and exciting in the dark.<br/><br/>",

Each turn a player turns over one card from his or her dealt pile.  A card showing a nickel or five pennies is &quot;banked&quot;.  Other cards are placed in the center of the table in the &quot;till&quot;.  When a player draws a card that will match a card in the &quot;till&quot; to make five cents, those two cards are &quot;banked&quot;.  Cards can only be &quot;banked&quot; in two (or one) card combinations.  The Silver Pig card is worth 10 cents -- two tricks.  The player with the most money wins the game and becomes the next dealer.<br/><br/>2. DIME BANK: Plays like &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; except that players &quot;bank&quot; 10 cents instead of 5 cents, and the Silver Pig is worth 20 cents.  (It is unclear how to avoid the two-card limit in this version.)<br/><br/>3. CONCENTRATION: This version is similar to the game card game Memory.  It is for any number of players.  Players &quot;bank&quot; pairs to add up to either 10 cents or 5 cents.  A player's turn ends upon turning up the Silver Pig card.  The game ends when there are two cards left, and a player uncovers a five-cent card and then the Silver Pig; this combination is worth two tricks.<br/><br/>",

It sounds easy! But remember that your opponents are also trying their best to do the same - taking over your base and trapping you in the maze. Under these competitive conditions, the players manipulate the existing maze into a dynamic ever changing maze, that is KALEIDOMAZE.<br/><br/>As in life, very often you than CHANCEs (cards) for better or worse; and occasionally save one or two CREDITs (cards) to be used under certain adverse situations. Sometimes you may encounter such a dilemma of being trapped by your competitors; but fortunately many times you are able to develop intricate strategies and tactical moves to revert the embarrassment. Very often, your goal appears so close and yet it suddenly becomes so far. Many times, it appears so unlikely and yet it suddenly becomes so easy. This is KALEIDOMAZE.<br/><br/>You need strategy, judgment and luck to win the game. The rules are simple, and the skillfully designed gameboard and playing pieces allow you a wide choice of moves. This puzzling maze, being manipulated by you and your opponents, many times is very rewarding, but can also become a frustrating and aggravating challenge.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.<br/><br/>Player 1 owns the black checkers, while player 2 owns the red checkers. Opponents alternate turns, as in most games. A 'king' is defined as in the game of Checkers: it is a stack of two checkers, of the same color. Kings cannot move but can be captured.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player chooses one of his own checkers to move. Moves are made vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. A single move consists of picking up the chosen checker, jumping it over an opponent's checker or king (the jumped checker or king must be directly above, below, left, or right of the moving checker), and landing on an unoccupied square on the other side of the jumped checker. The jumped checker or king is then captured (removed from the board). On the same turn, a player may (but is not required to) continue moving this chosen checker in this way, until that checker cannot capture any more. A checker can only move if in so doing it captures an opponent's checker or king.<br/><br/>On his turn, after he has finished capturing, a player may use the checkers which he has just captured to transform some of his opponent's checkers into kings, by placing a single captured checker on top of a checker of the same color which is still on the board. The two checkers from a captured king can be used to make two new kings. A player can make as many kings on his turn as he has captured checkers.<br/><br/>The loser is the first player not able to move on his turn.<br/><br/>",

Here October 21, 1600 two samurai armies, more than 80,000 people each, met in the bloody battle. Tokugava Leyasu, an experienced general and politician, profited from the treason in the ranks of the enemy and defeated its troops thus stopping endless wars and establishing his shogunate in Japan.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet in the plain between mountains. Tactic maneuverings are very important in the game. Under a skillful leader a smaller army can defeat an outnumbering enemy. You can either recreate the historic battle or change the course of the fight. Anyway you should rely not only on the number of your army but also on your leadership and war skills.<br/><br/>Zvezda 8224<br/><br/>",

After the marble is placed into one of the marble holders on the wheel, the wheel will turn under the weight of the marble and will eventually come to a stop. The next player proceeds in the same way.<br/><br/>When the wheel rotates, some marbles may fall through the back of the wheel and down a marble return chute and into the return well, where the marbles are picked up by their respective players to be placed again, in turn.<br/><br/>If a player spins &quot;Wipe Out&quot; on the spinner, they place the steel ball in one of the empty marble holders. The weight of the steel ball can whirl the wheel back and forth several times before it comes to rest.<br/><br/>Players continue, in turn, to place their marbles on the wheel. When one player successfully places all of their marbles--and the wheel is at rest--that player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It combines magnetic poetry with the concept of poetry slams and a 12x24 (magnetic) gameboard.<br/><br/>The game's word tiles will be familiar to anyone who knows magnetic poetry. There are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and endings. A miscellaneous category includes adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. A rating assigned to each word reflects the difficulty of using that word in the magnetic poetry slam (1=easy; 8=obscure word) and doubles as the scoring mechanism.<br/><br/>Each player creates a line or a poem up to six words in length each turn. Second and subsequent lines/poems must include at least one word from those already on the board. The sum of the difficulty rating determines the score for the line or poem. The magnetic grid includes bonus cells, which add points to the play.<br/><br/>",
