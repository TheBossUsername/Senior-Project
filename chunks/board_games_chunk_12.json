        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling I'm In! is a game about the games that the heroes play when they gamble at the Red Dragon Inn. Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the &quot;Gambling? I'm In!&quot; card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.<br/><br/>This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).<br/><br/>There are five base games included and are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.<br/>     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. <br/>     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.<br/>     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.<br/>     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.<br/><br/><br/>When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the &quot;Gambling, I'm in!&quot; card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.<br/><br/>There will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview:<br/>Citizens of a high-tech metropolis demand the most modern commuter train system in the world! The mayor hires several companies to build the network as a joint project, including yours! Naturally, you&rsquo;re trying to take the most credit for the network&rsquo;s success. Complete routes with a variety of buildings to earn credit! Achieve your secret objectives to win extra credit at the end of the game. The player with the most credit wins!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Each player has their own personal color-coded deck of Rail Cards. Each Rail Card features two lines and two terminals in various combinations, thus all presenting six different outlets with varying connections or dead ends amongst them. Each card also features two different buildings, each situated on either of the two lines. (There are five different types of buildings.)<br/><br/>Players take turns laying down one card at a time, adjacent to existing cards, to build the map of the city. Cards must be placed in a &quot;brick&quot; pattern. If placed so that the short sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be in a straight line. However, if placed so that the long sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be off-set. In this manner, a single card may have up to six adjacent cards.<br/><br/>There is another limit to placement: Cards may not be placed outside of the city limits. This is a final shape of the city determined by the number of players. Though you know what shape the city will take at the end of the game, there is no &quot;board&quot; which predefines the &quot;center&quot; of the city. The city grows and shifts with each new card played. Controlling the growth and logic of the city is fundamental to strategic play.<br/><br/>Scoring and Victory:<br/>Score &quot;credit&quot; by having the most segments of your color comprising a complete route. A route is complete when it is capped at both ends by a terminal or when it is made into a loop. Score 1 credit for each different type of building on a complete route. Extra credits may be scored by completing secret objectives, most of which require the city to meet certain configurations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hearing I ask from the holy races, from Heimdall&rsquo;s sons, both high and low; Thou wilt, Valfather, that well I relate old tales I remember of men long ago. (Poetic Edda &ndash; V&ouml;luspa &ndash; The Prophecy of the Seeress, stanza 1).<br/><br/>Nine worlds, one destination. Driven by the call of the Nordic gods, 2 to 4 jarls, rulers of Viking villages, embark on an adventurous journey through the nine worlds of Yggdrasil to Asgard. But only the most glorious of them will be admitted to their halls. And so the players set off - with only a handful of mostly inexperienced residents of their villages at first - to experience adventures on land and at sea.<br/><br/>The Norse mythical world of the Vikings consists of 9 different worlds that players will get to know in this &quot;deck building game&quot;, such as Midgard, the world of humans, or J&ouml;tunheim, the realm of the frost giants. During their travels, other Vikings will join the players, they will learn about mysterious places, seek the help of the gods, fight against dangerous opponents and try to escape overpowering dangers without damage.<br/><br/>The basic game, briefly explained by a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;, has a modular structure and can be expanded almost as much as desired with additional game material. So little by little, new and more demanding rules come into play. While always 8 adventures (rounds) will be played, these can be put together from 35 different adventures almost any way the players want. Since players choose to play adventures from 3 of the 9 Viking worlds and because each world features other Vikings with different skills and other special rules, players can also adjust the level of difficulty and the duration of the game by their choice of Viking worlds.<br/><br/>With each adventure, players learn more about the legends of Nordic mythology, which graphic artist Michael Menzel brought to life with atmospheric illustrations on various cards, amongst them 34 different Vikings.<br/><br/>From the adventure cards that are placed on the gameboard, players will learn more about the secrets and mythical characters of Nordic mythology. The cards also show a section of the journey ahead. Playing their Viking cards skillfully, players move their Viking figures over this path, collect gold, get glory (victory points) and try to avoid the dangers of the path. With gold they can recruit other Vikings with better skills, filling the card deck with increasingly helpful Vikings. Vikings who fought bravely can be sent to Walhalla. This creates a second deck of cards with Vikings who will assist the players in the often-decisive final adventure at the rainbow bridge Bifr&ouml;st and can also help them win with the victory points they contain.<br/><br/>",

The French and Indian War ended the French Empire in Canada; the American Revolution ended the British Empire in the 13 American colonies. An additional bonus scenario covers the War of Jenkin's Ear between Spanish Florida and British Georgia. Freely available post publication scenarios cover Lord Dunmore's War, the Chickasaw Wars, Queen Anne's War, King William's War as well as variant starts and political situations for the three wars in the published game.<br/><br/>Each End of Empire game turn represents two months time. Each year consists of one spring turn, two summer turns, one fall turn, and two winter turns. Each hex is approximately 20 miles across. Units are mostly regiments but a few represent other sizes, each step represents approximately 250 men.<br/><br/>End of Empire features two maps showing eastern North America. Each hex or town contains natural and/or man-made features that can effect the movement of units and the combat between units.<br/><br/>End of Empire is an Epic game and perhaps the most detailed coverage of the critical period that saw the Empires of England, France, and Spain exit North America and the rise of the United States of America.

Competing with both open and hidden information, they must identify bluffing and beware of the others' weapons. The player who can obtain the most yummiest fruit will be recognized as the best fruit spy!<br/><br/>In Fruit Spy, six farmhouse boards are arranged in a circle in a random order, with 2-4 fruit tokens (valued 1-7) placed randomly upon them. Two stand-up figures &mdash; Farmer Papa and Daly &mdash; are placed on their respective starting farmhouses.<br/><br/>Each player has eight spy cards in hand &mdash; trick cards valued 1-7 and one tool card &mdash; and on a player's turn, they place one card face down on a farmhouse of their choice. If another face-down card is already there, the player turns it face up; if the revealed card is a tool card, then both the new card and the tool card are discarded. When cards are played on the farmhouse where one (or both) of the figures stands, that figure is moved &mdash; clockwise for Daly, counterclockwise for Farmer Papa. The game ends when one of the figures reaches its starting farmhouse or when all players have played all of their cards.<br/><br/>Fruit tokens are then awarded in order of the players' total strength on each farmhouse: the strongest player takes the fruit token with the highest Yum-yum value, the second-strongest player takes the next highest-valued token, and so on. Any remaining fruit tokens go to the strongest player. Daly is scored as a fruit token of value 10 while Farmer Papa kicks everyone out of the farmhouse where he stands at the end of the game empty-handed. The player with the highest Yum-yum value total wins!<br/><br/>Earlier versions of Fruit Spy were titled Dead Man's Treasure, with players fighting for treasure chests in exactly the same manner as Fruit Spy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maori Wars is a simulation of the principal uprisings that took place between 1845 and 1872 due to British colonial incursions into native Maori lands on the North Island of New Zealand. Conflict involved the destruction of numerous villages, pas (strongly fortified villages that featured intricate trench-works) and colonial settlements. The war introduced the British to a wily well-armed enemy whose defense works and strategy of ambush surprised and stymied them. As scenarios progress so does the extent of the conflict. More British regulars, native born Australian troops and New Zealand militia enter and are allied with increasingly more tribes who tend to change sides at the most inopportune times (those supporting the British came to be known as Queenites).<br/><br/>Historical scenarios feature low counter density, quick play time (under two hours), and features a novel bush-raiding rule that allows the Maori player to move units temporarily off the map and then back in a location of his choice. As the British player gains experience he learns to track these tribes. At which point he enters and battles these units in the bush. Maori resistance is dependent on village support so as fortified villages fall to British control, resistance melts away. Random battle dispatches reflect historical circumstances. Events such as: SEEK PEACE, NEW RELIGION, and CONCERNED TRIBES force players to deal with new and developing crises. The English may build forts but are penalized for fort-building as they historically caused local uprisings. Canoes and gunboats allow rapid transport and in the case of gunboats waterborne artillery support. Standard British artillery and cavalry are introduced but play only a minor supporting role. Terrain and knowledge of the terrain is the Maori&rsquo;s secret weapon. Relative troop strength is designed to allow the possibility of historical outcomes not the proportionate historical strength. The overwhelming British superiority of men and firepower made the successes of the Maori forces all the more remarkable.<br/><br/>Map Scale:    10 miles per hex<br/>Unit Size:     Battalions/Strength Points<br/>Time Scale:     3 months per turn<br/><br/>(from Legion Wargames website)<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards.

Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun.

Every day, its slow but tireless flow accompanies planes, trains, ships and trucks in a close-knit network of connections between major cities.<br/><br/>Rhein: River Trade is an absorbing game of commerce and transportation for 2-5 industrious players 12 years of age and up. The most important companies in Basel receive, assess, and acquire goods orders from the various cities located on or near the Rhine, and even as far away as London. Each order defines the destination and the number of containers, the delivery time, the agreed price, and the possible penalty. Using shared planes, trains and ships and their own trucks, the players must arrange these shipments, limiting the costs and making sure that delivery times are respected.

Merchants from the rich provinces of Holland and neighboring Zealand gather in stately rooms to discuss the foundation of a mighty consortium: a company that will hold the monopoly of the very profitable East Indies trade.  One question occupies their minds more than anything: who will control the new company?<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a merchant living at the end of the sixteenth century.  These merchants sent out ships to explore and expand the profitable trade in the east, where they traded cloves, nutmeg, silk and tea in such remote areas as India, Indonesia, China and Japan.  These goods were then sold at great profit in the West.  The journey, however, was a dangerous one, and fitting out a ship was prohibitively expensive.  Merchants therefore cooperated in small groups, called compagnies in Dutch, to fit out ships together.<br/><br/>At the same time, competition was cutthroat, not just abroad, but also at home, where Amsterdam was the most fearsome rival.  Your task in this game is to make as large a profit as you can - but at the same time uphold the honor of your hometown against the mighty merchants from Amsterdam.<br/><br/>This box contains two game versions: the basic game, which can be played by 4 or 5 players, and the advanced game, for 3 to 5 players.  The basic game is suited for people aged 10 onwards and takes about an hour.  The advanced game is intended for people Ages 14 and up, and takes between 90-120 minutes, depending on how long you spend negotiating.<br/><br/>",

By expanding fortifications, buildings and siege engines as well as by training armies, they gradually strengthen their dwelling.

Innumerable hordes of barbarians supported by horrifying monsters and brutal war machines are eager to flood the city walls and kill the defenders to cleanse their land of foreign influence.<br/><br/>The goal of the Defenders is to survive all waves of enemy attacks and gain the King's forgiveness.

The holding cells are overflowing and now you must work as a team to bring together the evidence needed to convict each suspect. Take care - just one slip means a criminal walks free...<br/><br/>Fallen Angels is a unique deduction game. Each card features two of six possible evidence icons on one side, but only one of those two on the reverse side. Each player fans their cards so that they can see one set of icons but the other players see the other set. On their turn, a player selects one card and the other players arrange their hands to indicate which of their own cards feature the icons that they can see on the back of that card. The player must then deduce what icon or icons are on the reverse of their card, taking into account that what they see in other players' hands is not exactly what those players themselves can see. If they deduce correctly then the evidence may be enough to convict a suspect. But if they guess wrong then that suspect is acquitted. To win the game, players must together convict ten suspects without acquitting too many.<br/><br/>The cards feature historical mugshots of real suspects arrested in Sydney, Australia, during the 1920s razor gang era.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Harakiri: Blades of Honor is a multi-campaign cooperative board game of adventures and fantasy for up to 4 players. After a bloody civil war, the Emperor was banished and the empire fell into the darkness, governed under the tyranny of the Dark Shogun.<br/>Pick one hero, each of them with their background and skill tree, to embark with your gaming group on an epic adventure. Travel through Japan, where you will be able to trade, visit shrines to increase your divine connection with your associated god, learn about the story of each character and many more, in an evolving map which will react to your decisions failures or successes.<br/>Each hero shall have a customized board with many options to decide your way of playing. Will you focus on divine powers, unleashing a devastating God Mode to use as a final option sacrificing your own body on the process? Or would you prefer to unveil your own history via personal missions? Many options are laid before you and choices will have to be made along the way.<br/>The game will include many travel events where your hero could go into the magical forest of the Tengus, travel to cursed villages and battle with the help of his blade the terrifying creatures of Japanese mythology&hellip; Some of these event cards can be turned into even more dangerous events depending on your hero decisions. Will you travel following safer roads to avoid potential conflicts or will you choose to go through more dangerous sideways to gain some precious time needed to achieve your goals before the Dark Shogun keeps on spreading his influence and power all over the land?<br/>Besides this, the combat system will also allow you to choose your way of playing. You will be able to decide if you want to use heavier and more damaging blows or faster ones, giving you extra time for other purposes. Also, you will be able to choose if you want to focus during your attack, allowing you to go through the enemies&rsquo; defense or diminish it for the rest of the battle. But beware, because a failed attack could even lead to a terrible counter from one of the many japan folklore-based members of the Shogun Horde. Not only that, but also during each and every attack the energy of the kami could give even more power if you are lucky enough to get the right combination from the yin-yang symbol dices. Finally, the dice-based skill system will also allow for powerful moves during your turn, giving passive or active effect to choose from. But beware, cause the more powerful a skill is, the harder it will be to use it again, adding a tactical layer to the game. <br/>Besides all the mechanics, we think that a good story is a crucial part of immersion and fun, and for that we are honored to have one of the top fantasy Spanish writers, David Velasco, in our team. Get ready to dive into a branching and evolving story, where decisions can deeply affect the outcome of upcoming sessions.<br/>Regarding art production we count on well-known artists and illustrators who have made fantastic pieces of art to recreate the Japanese culture. Our sculptors have created incredible minis to get a deeper immersion in the extensive world of Harakiri.<br/>Hone your blade and fight for your clan like a hero and get involved in the wonderful lands of Harakiri!<br/><br/>SYNERGIC GAMES<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Streets of Stalingrad&quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.<br/><br/>The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.<br/><br/>The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.<br/><br/>The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.<br/><br/>There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.<br/><br/>The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The second 18xx game ever published, 1829 Northern Board (usually referred to as 1829 North) is basically the same game as the original 1829 game with a different map covering Northern England and Scotland, a different set of corporations, and some minor rule changes.  Many of the companies in the original 1829 are used in the Northern versions, as is the surveyor which was abandoned when 1830 was published in 1986.<br/><br/>Large portions of the map from 1829 North overlap map sections on the original 1829 board, and the rules do not cover combining the two games.  The reason for this is that Francis Tresham (the designer of both games and 1830 and Civilization) felt that the combined game would be too large and unwieldy.  However, 18xx fans have always been fond of experimenting with the system and creating new variations with different locations.  A link is provided below to information on how some 18xx fans have combined the two games.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/><br/><br/>",

Napol&eacute;on was able to reconstitute an army of 300,000 men by summoning to the colors those young soldiers who soon came to be called by the name &laquo; Marie-Louise &raquo;. Europe formed a coalition against France: Prussia and Russia wanted to crush Napol&eacute;on permanently. Despite his victories during the spring and summer, Austria soon joined the side of the Empire&rsquo;s enemies. Gigantic maneuvers and great battles followed one after the other within the triangle formed by Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Whereas his victories were no longer decisive, Napol&eacute;on knew now that a single defeat could pull down his Empire !<br/><br/>",

Some of the inhabitants are in hiding, and you need to figure out which inhabitant is where, and chase any Monster to the Open Highlands or rivalling clans.<br/><br/>This game is all about memorising cards, taking calculated risks, and strategic long-term decision-making.<br/><br/>It's super easy to learn (5 minutes), fun for the whole family (2-6 players), and can be replayed over and over again.<br/><br/>HOW IT WORKS<br/><br/>Start of the game<br/>Every chieftain starts with four cards faced down in front of them. This is your clan, and each card is one of its inhabitants. To start, each player may peek once at the bottom two cards. Remember them well.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>The goal is to get rid of the Monsters in your clan by chasing them to your opponents or the open Highlands. Each card has a set amount of points, the scarier the monster, the more points it has. So the aim is to have the fewest amount of points. Once you think you're in that position and no longer have any Monster cards in your clan, you can call 'Saorsa' (&quot;freedom&quot; in Gaelic) and after one final turn by each player, the round will end.<br/><br/>During a turn<br/>Option A) You take the top card from the discard pile (Open Highland pile) and swap it with one of your clan cards - any actions displayed on the card cannot be taken.<br/><br/>Option B) You take the top card from the closed pile and choose:<br/>1. Place it directly on the Open Highland pile and perform the action as described on the card.<br/>2. Swap it with one of your clan cards - any actions displayed on the card cannot be taken.<br/><br/>Whenever a card is discarded on the Open Highland pile, any player that knows the position of that same card in any of the clans may quickly grab that card and place it on top of the discarded card. This is how you get fewer inhabitants in your clan.<br/><br/>There are a number of special cards in the game, there is a Witch who allows you to peek at one card each turn or the Evil Priest of Forvie, who will no longer be evil once he is converted by the Missionary. So taking big calculated risks can have big rewards, just like in real life.<br/><br/>End of the round<br/>If you don't have any monsters in your clan, just before it's your turn, you can declare 'Saorsa'. Every other player will take one last turn and the round ends and points will be counted. If the player that called Saorsa has the lowest amount of points, she or he will win a Victory Token.<br/><br/>Some cards in your clan might not seem too good at first sight, containing too many points, but keeping them in your clan will give you great advantages in future rounds.<br/><br/>The game ends when all four Victory Tokens have been won.<br/><br/>-description by designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Caf&eacute; del Gatto, you want to serve valuable drinks to customers, but you're competing against other baristas for coffee and milk, so making drinks will be tricky!<br/><br/>To set up, each player takes five glass tiles that require 1-4 &quot;shots&quot; to complete. Place the 36 coffee/milk tiles in the bag, then draw five tiles to fill the milk side of the espresso machine, then five tiles to fill the coffee side. Each double-sided coffee/milk tile has a value from 1-4 as well as a symbol for cold, hot, or foamy. Each player starts with 4-5 coins. Place completed drink tiles in the center of the playing area; each drink (cappuccino, latte macchiato, etc.) has tiles of varying values.<br/><br/>On a turn, take one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Take 2 coins from the bank.<br/>     Buy a tile from the espresso machine, with the cost of the tile being equal to the adjacent tile on the opposite side of the machine. If you're buying a milk tile, for example, the cost is the value on the adjacent coffee tile. Tiles in the top two rows have a 1-2 coin surcharge. Place the tile in the lowest empty matching space on one of your drink tiles, then draw a tile from the bag to refill the machine. If you buy a 1 tile, it comes with a bonus sugar cube.<br/>     Serve one or more completed drinks. For each glass tile that has all its spots filled, first gain coins from the bank, earning more coins if the drink has fewer symbols in it. (Mixing cold and hot tiles isn't good!) Next, take a completed drink tile of the same type that has a value equal to or less than the sum of the tiles, gaining coins to make up the difference. You can raise the value of a drink by 1 for each sugar cube spent.<br/><br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you can spend 2 coins to flush one side of the espresso machine, then refill it.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has served all five types of drinks, complete the round, then sum the value of your completed drink tiles, with each pair of sugar cubes counting as 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins, with coin serving as a tiebreaker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Star Fleet Battle Manual (SFBM) is a Tactical level Space Combat miniatures wargame for two or more players with spaceships familiar to fans of Star Trek (the original series).<br/><br/>SFBM is easily confused with the much better-known and much more complex &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; boardgame. Although the theme is the same, and some of the mechanics are quite similar, crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles, make SFBM unlike Star Fleet Battles.<br/><br/>A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square (or more) is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.<br/><br/>After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.<br/><br/>Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this used the Star Trek name without having properly licensed it, and therefore was not sold for long).<br/><br/>The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.<br/><br/>",

World Edition) uses the same game play as the other Ausgerechnet! titles: Players deal three piles of 15 location cards from a deck of roughly 200 cards (naming cities around the world for this edition), then place an interlude card between each set of piles to make a deck of 45 cards. One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is Honolulu west of San Francisco? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.<br/><br/>After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.<br/><br/>After 15 cards are placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.<br/><br/>After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41<br/><br/>is the first volume in a planned series of tactical level wargames in which players lead historical units into battle during Operation Barbarossa (June through October 1941). A Clash of Titans &ndash; the German Army and the Soviet Army fighting one another in a life and death struggle with infantry, artillery and armored units.<br/><br/>Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41 is intentionally not intended to be a simulation, but rather it abstracts certain aspects in favor of playability and manageable game length to convey the feeling of comprehensive tactical combat situations.<br/><br/>Read more about and find our Kickstarter page here:<br/>Find more: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.facebook.com/assaultgamescom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/assaultgamescom</a><br/>Kickstarter: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rh41/assault-red-horizon-41?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rh41/assault-red-horizo...</a><br/><br/>Game Mechanics and rules: <br/><br/>The Assault Game System is designed to be completely modular and to accommodate a wide range of preferences for those playing it. There are different scenarios that the players can choose from, and within these scenarios, the Order of Battle can vary through the use of Formation Cards. In each scenario, rather than being given a set Order of Battle, the players will randomly select Formation Cards (infantry, artillery, or armor/vehicle) based on the side they are playing.<br/><br/>The Formation Cards give the player a certain number and type of units available for the scenario. This ensures both variation and regular surprises, since the make-up of your forces will change from game to game. Your High Command has assigned you certain units to achieve a particular goal; you will have to adjust your individual tactics based on the available units and the objectives you have been given!<br/><br/>Units in the Assault Game System are activated by Command points. Players receive a certain number of Command points, which are listed on the Formation cards. Before Command Phase, players secretly decide (behind a small screen or divider) which units to activate in the current turn. The Command point allowance lets the player activate approximately 75% of all available units. Thus, players must set priorities for the turn. Not only does this speed up the game play, since all units are not used in each turn, but it also makes for some exciting moments in the fight.<br/><br/>In the Assault Game System, we have tried to minimize the counter stacking issue. With many game systems in the hobby, you can find towers of counters and markers on certain hexes of the game board. The overview is then quickly lost. In the Assault Game System, there is a clear limit of one unit counter per hex, with the exception being when units in are being transported. In addition, there is usually only one command and/or status marker.<br/><br/>Regarding Command and Unit State Markers, we have devised a simple double-marker system: each marker is double-sided and after the end of the round, in the Organization Phase, the markers are simply flipped or removed depending on their color. This helps to speed up play.<br/><br/>In general, Assault has attempted to emphasize game flow. The fact that Command Points are assigned to activate units in the Planning Phase accelerates the game. Since the units to be activated are already established before the Action Phase, there is less for the player to think about and fewer opportunities for AP to set in.<br/><br/>The Dynamic Campaign System: &quot;Crossing the Narew&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;It  is  the  end  of  June  1941,  when  the  German  Wehrmacht  begins  the  largest  land  operation  of  World  War II,  Operation  Barbarossa.  More  than  four  million  German  soldiers  are  in  their  starting  positions  on  the eastern  borders  of  the  German  Reich.  The  strategic  objective  is  the  capital  Moscow.  To  be  successful, the  operation  must  combine  strength  with  speed.  Key  to  this  will  be  seizing  control  the  bridges  that  lie between  the  German  Wehrmacht  and  its  ultimate  prize.<br/><br/>In  this  campaign,  players  take  on  the  role  of  a  company  commander  in  order  to  achieve  victory  for  their own  faction.  Each  serving  in  the  ranks  of  one  of  the  two  divisions  that  took  part  historically,  the  German 7th  Infantry  Division  and  the  Soviet  13th  Rifle  Division. The  campaign  consists  of  four  connected  battles  and  covers  the  period  24-25  June  1941.  This  campaign is  in  line  with  historical  operations  for  crossing  the  Narew  River.  This  crossing  was    important  and  had  to be  achieved  quickly  in  order  to  close  the  town  of  Bialystok  and  the  connected  basin.&quot;<br/><br/>Another aspect that sets Assault Red Horizons &rsquo;41 apart from the competition is our Dynamic Campaign Systemwhich will be included in the base game. We have designed a system whereby multiple scenarios can be linked with a variable starting set up for each subsequent scenario dependent upon how many of the victory conditions each side achieves. The players conduct operations, each commanding a company of troops from regiments that actually served on the Eastern Front. The campaign includes 8 different plots for a high replay value.<br/><br/>",

Players each have five slots available to them, and each slot can hold one card. On a turn, you draw a card from the deck then either play it in a row (if it's a character card) or use it (if it's an action).<br/><br/>Each element outranks two other elements, similar to rock/paper/scissors/Spock/lizard. You can play an element card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker element with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star element is wild and can represent any element you need; a trash card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star or an action card.<br/><br/>The actions let you discard cards in play, move cards, swap them, and recycle (discard a card and draw a new card). Play continues until someone collects one element of each type in his row. A scoring system is included for those who want to play multiple games.<br/><br/>",

This very complex and detailed process repeats until the end of the game at which point the player with the most money wins, just like in real life. At that point the winner will claim that Beer & Pretzels is the best game ever, and the losers will claim that the game is fundamentally flawed, and most likely broken.<br/><br/>Just by coincidence, each coaster has an image of either pretzels or beer on it. Different pretzels have different values. Beer doubles your money. Players only score for items that are completely visible... items entirely or partially obscured by other coasters don&rsquo;t count. There tends to be name calling, bragging, self-high-fiving and the occasional brawl during the game, all of which add to the rich atmosphere and theme.<br/><br/><br/>WARNING: Beer &amp; Pretzels should be played with caution. Unmitigated use of this game could result in anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, lapsing into inconsistent foreign accents, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, double vision, drooling, impulsivity, restlessness, extreme hyperactivity, unusual changes in behavior, kidney problems, long term memory loss, narrow angle glaucoma, itching, right upper belly pain, insomnia, fever, an inability to line up buttons properly on dress shirts, dark urine, yellow skin/eyes, unexplained flu-like symptoms, anal leakage, dizziness, yodeling, hive clusters, nausea, fainting upon standing, stiff muscles, uncontrollable cravings for onion rings, confusion, severe liver problems, barking, high fever, increased frequency of toe stubbing, dry mouth, constipation, sudden uncontrollable left-handedness and decreased appetite.

Then, the active player will select one of these 6 areas and will use the dice from that area to cross off boxes in the matching track on their player game sheet. Once they are done, the inactive players select 1 die from 2 different areas to cross off 2 boxes in the matching tracks on their game sheets.<br/><br/>Marking off boxes in the 6 tracks (and the bonus Field Goal, Breakaway Run, and Yards After Catch tracks) will advance your Yardage marker down the field. Whenever you advance your Yardage marker into the End Zone you score a 7-point touchdown. You can also choose to kick a 3-point Field Goal anytime you are within Field Goal kicking range. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.

        "description": "Don't Panic<br/><br/>East German game of Wizardry and Magic. Uses simultaneous action, dynamic tension, spells, special powers, line-of-sight and hidden identities in a peculiar mix that defies description but inspires awe in those who've experienced it. Feige Spiele's warehouse burnt down in early 1983, just before distribution of Willi Sonderling's masterpiece was to be shipped. Only a handful of reviewer copies survived.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter there was a very small print run (fewer than a couple hundred) of the German version, das Verschwinden.  In the mid to late 80s, the Starducks promotional version was released in certain regions of the United States.  (The Starducks version was released in two parts - a base game and expansion - but both parts are really needed to play the game.)<br/><br/>",

As the country's most successful secret agent, [NAME REDACTED], you've been on the hunt for an enemy spy, codename PROTEUS, on board the docked nuclear submarine Retiarius. However, your mission spirals out of control when the Retiarius submerges and its warheads prime for launch!<br/><br/>Danger in the Deep is a collaborative escape room game, where players must navigate their way through the engine room, crew&rsquo;s quarters, mess and control room of a submarine. Only by gathering key information and solving the 14 interactive puzzles will teams be able to disable the warheads, stop PROTEUS, and save the world. The game features puzzle books, cards, secret components, a blueprint, and a working UV torch (batteries included, 3 x AAA).<br/><br/>Danger in the Deep features a tiered hint system, to enable teams of all abilities to progress through the game and story. The game can optionally be completed solo.<br/><br/>Danger in the Deep is designed as a one-time experience, as some of the puzzles require players to cut, fold and write on the components. However, Professor Puzzle do provide a printable pdf of the destructible components, in the Files section on BGG and on their website, to enable the game to be replayed.<br/><br/>",

The three colors in the game are black, white, and red, and each player will be a different color. Each tile has a background color and a different-colored circle in the middle. There are 6 different combinations and 5 small tiles and 1 large tile for each combination.<br/><br/>Players place tiles on the table trying to connect groups of their border color and groups of their circle color.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Place all the tiles face-up in a pool, leaving room to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned one of the three colors by some agreeable method and takes the corresponding counter; the counters just show which player is which color. The order of play is White player, then Black, then Red. Players take turns placing any tile from the pool on the playing surface according to the following rules:<br/><br/>- Tiles must be placed so that they align with an imaginary grid of squares the size of the small tiles.<br/><br/>- White cannot play a large tile on the first turn.<br/><br/>- Except for the obvious exception of the first tile, each new tile must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one small tile (i.e. must touch a small tile). Just having the corners touch isn't good enough.<br/><br/>- A large tile cannot be placed orthogonally adjacent to another large tile (that is, no two large tiles can touch each other, except at the corners).<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no available moves.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>Small tiles count as 1 point, and large tiles count as 2 points.<br/><br/>Find the largest connected group of tiles with your border color, and then find the largest connected group of tiles with your circle color. Multiply these two numbers to determine your score.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins. If two players tie, the third player wins! If all three tie, play again!<br/><br/>The rules include a variant for 2 players.<br/><br/>Microbadges:<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s suitable for Ages 12 and up.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In Squadron Strike, ships move in one of three movement modes, named for the number of Newton&rsquo;s Laws being obeyed; with these options you&rsquo;re not stuck with whatever movement mode the game designer liked - you can pick the one that works best for the setting you&rsquo;re trying to run in. You even have optional fuel rules (for both interstellar and tactical movement) to simulate the setting or TV series to whatever degree you like. You decide what reality level is appropriate for your level of fun.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can design nearly everything in the game, from missiles, to beams, to fighters, to torpedoes. An original setting includes pre-built ships and weapons for people who don&rsquo;t want to get deeply into the customization process, but if you want it, you have complete control.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Automated tools do complete SSD generation for you, in Excel format, or with higher end features via web applications.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Squadron Strike comes with a complete, integrated campaign system, including web apps that automatically generate campaign maps, victory decks, and system maps. Just enter the campaign turn in the web app and the positions of the planets on the system map update automatically!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The boxed game will have two map sheets, a bag of tilt blocks, two bags of stacking tiles, box miniature sheets, a rulebook, an SSD book and a setting book. The ship design tools are available as a free download in Excel; the web applications (including a nicer ship design tool set, and campaign support) are behind a subscriber login.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the half-century after Columbus, small bands of daring Spanish adventurers conquered Central and South America, destroying the huge armies of long-established native empires in the process. Some won great fortunes in gold, while many others only died an early death. These men were The Conquistadors. In this partly card-driven, partly procedural game &mdash;a brand-new design from Jon Southard &mdash; one to five players each control a group of conquistadors, trying to discover and loot the civilizations of the Americas and end up with the most gold and power.<br/><br/>A game of The Conquistadors begins with the outline of Central and South America as known in 1520. Your first task will be to seek out and discover the great Indian cities and empires -- which may appear in their historical locations, or in quite different places. Once you discover where the cities and empires are, it is time to gather gold. You might battle and plunder the Indians, or your best plan may be to attempt diplomacy and enlist them as allies -- especially if you have an Indian interpreter in your expedition. Like Francisco Pizarro, you might try a Sudden Shock Attack to capture a native king and extort a fat ransom. Always you must be sure to keep the Governor happy, or he may issue a warrant for your arrest. Beware of native uprisings, painted warriors, and poisoned darts around the next corner, and watch out for defection in your own ranks. If you fall behind in the race for gold, you might try to descend the Amazon or discover the Fountain of Youth. And when you are really in a tight place, perhaps you can appeal to Mano de Dios (the Hand of God) to bail you out.<br/><br/>The Conquistadors is playable by from 1 to 5 players, with an introductory Basic Game, a more involved Standard Game, and some optional rules. While the normal game system requires 2 or more players, solitaire play is enabled by a special solitaire module.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>     Complexity: Low to Medium  3/4/5 out of 10 (Basic/Standard/plus Optional Rules)<br/>     Solitaire Suitability: High (solitaire scenario), Low (other scenarios)<br/>     Time Scale: variable, one turn = 3 to 18 months<br/>     Map Scale: abstract, point-to-point area map covers Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru<br/>     Unit Scale: Individual leaders, 3 to 25 Spanish troops, up to several thousand Indian troops<br/>     Players: one or two<br/>     Playing Time: three hours (Basic Game), four to six hours (Standard Game)<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/>Two Maps &ndash; each approximately 28 x 20&quot;<br/>Two Countersheets (5/8&rdquo; size)<br/>Deck of 130 Strategy/Conquistador Cards<br/>Deck of 26 Asset Cards<br/>Rules booklet<br/>Four Player Aid Cards<br/>One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Sweet Spot is the first title of the sports trilogy by Medieval Lords, and is a tactical card game that sees players take on the role of a tennis pro battling it out in intense singles or doubles matches.<br/><br/>There are three types of decks in the game: Service, Return and Tactic. Players have to play the right card at the right situation as they rally it out on the court. But beware &mdash; stamina management is a critical part of the game! If you are not careful enough, you might end up breathless too quickly.<br/><br/>Sweet Spot uses a uniquely designed 'numbers system' to simulate the tennis ball's position and allows players to feel a realistic strength control of their swings where they can literally hit the ball lightly or drive it down hard. Powerful Tactic cards can tilt the balance and are at the same time highly thematic - Bench allows one to regain more stamina in between rallies, Crowd Cheering allows one to perform better at critical moments and Egg Shot hits the ball so high in the sky that the opponent cannot take an accurate read on its position when it comes down.<br/><br/>The game features more than eight characters with unique character abilities, and over thirty different famous moves in the tennis world.

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - VIP&quot; contains historical events related to very important persons, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Rock to the beat of your favorite pirate radio station while you and your crew tag the city. Make sure your rivals know where their turf ends and where yours begins. Watch out for the man though, because not everyone in the city appreciates your artistic endeavors and they might call the fuzz on you!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to tag locations across the city's districts with your crew's color. You'll do this by collecting sets of cards with matching location icons. Each time you collect a set of 3 cards that all have the same icon, you get to place a tag on a hex with that icon anywhere on the map.<br/><br/>The game is played over 3 rounds and there are no turns! Once a round has started everyone takes their actions at the same time in any order they choose. There are 5 main actions:<br/>- Draw a card: Draw the top card from any draw pile into your hand.<br/>- Add to a set: Play a card from your hand or from the top of the share pile onto a set pile on your crew mat.<br/>- Share a card: Play a card from your hand onto a share pile that is empty or has the matching color or icon on top.<br/>- Complete a set: Clear a set of 3 cards from your crew mat and place a tag on a matching map hex.<br/>- Rush a set: Take a cop car token to clear an incomplete set and place a tag on a matching map hex.<br/><br/>The end of the round is triggered either when all draw piles are empty or once only 1 player has tags remaining on their map. Each player gets 6 crew tags from the supply and another round commences. The game ends after 3 rounds and you'll score for objectives and for each map hex where you have a tag AND lose points for cop cars and solo tags. The crew with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Witches compete to destroy the city, and the one that does the most destruction will be accepted as the coven's new leader.<br/><br/>To bring ruin to Triora, players use herbs to make potions and spread plagues and curses to its regions while they flee from the Inquisition that hunt them.<br/><br/>To aid the Witches, the spirit of their old leader still hunts Triora, guiding them to achieve their vengeance.<br/><br/>Triora focuses on resource management and tactical depth rather than luck. While players will not interact directly, their choices greatly influence each other. Each game is unique as optimal play requires players respond to the context of movement choices and positioning. Becoming great at Triora will require predicting your opponents' choices as each witch seeks in their own way to take the most vengeance and lead the coven into its next era.<br/><br/>",

Bass Reeves, the West's most persistent Marshal, arrives in pursuit of the notorious outlaw, Jessica Patchett, who's trying to escape her bloody past.   And out in the Badlands, Ursula's cult prepares to summon the power of the great Worm.<br/><br/>Doomtown: Weird West Edition is a poker-driven, territory control card game, updated from (and fully compatible with) the 2014 release of Doomtown: Reloaded, which was based on the 1998 Origins Awards Best Trading Card Game, Deadlands: Doomtown by Alderac Entertainment Group!<br/><br/>All aspects of the game that require randomization are controlled via a poker mechanism as every card has a suit and value. Preparing for the hands you want to draw is as much a part of deck building as choosing the actions and dudes you'll want to play. Your deck is built around an Outfit, one of the six main groups attempting to control Deadwood.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved via poker hands.  Deciding who goes first  is decided by drawing the top five cards from your deck and the lowest poker hands go first.<br/><br/>Players take one action each, in turn which can include:<br/><br/>     Hiring a new dude (getting you influence in town)<br/>     Purchasing a new deed (getting you control in town)<br/>     Shopping for gear for your dudes<br/>     Start a shootout with your opponents to try to remove their influence.<br/><br/><br/>When each player passes, you reach &quot;Sundown&quot; for the day.

Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.<br/><br/>Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.<br/><br/>Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.<br/><br/>Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.<br/><br/>The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.<br/><br/>",

Take up the reigns of rule in your hands and prove that you are the only one worthy to unite half the world under your banner!<br/><br/>In Founders of the Empire, each player expands his own domain using four types of square tiles:<br/><br/><br/>     Green tiles represent natural landscapes: forests, cliffs, lakes, etc. They can be added to the players' domains freely. These tiles provide basic resources: wood, stone, plants and water.<br/>     Blue tiles are village buildings that require specific natural resources. For instance, the mine (which provides gold) should be placed next to stone and water sources.<br/>     Purple tiles represent city structures: marketplaces, inns, workshops and army camps. They also should be placed next to other tiles that give certain resources. In addition to providing corresponding resources, city tiles give their owners action tokens that can be used at any point of the game.<br/>     Red tiles are temples and altars that give players victory points. They are of different values (from 1 to 3 points) and require different combination of resources.<br/><br/><br/>A player's turn consists of three phases. First, the player must add a new tile from the stack to the common market. Then, he has the option of playing one of his tokens; these tokens are able to buy opponents' resources, pillage enemy tiles, transfer resources between tiles, and convert resources to victory points. Finally, the player must add a tile from the market to his domain. The game ends after all red tiles are added to the players' domains. Each player calculates victory points from his temples and tokens, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability &quot;Horsemanship&quot;, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.<br/><br/>Portal was printed in three editions:<br/><br/>     Portal<br/>     Portal Second Age<br/>     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)<br/><br/><br/>",

They have developed a subtle method called &quot;Equilibrium&quot; in which they influence the actions of the Guilds for their own purposes without being exposed by doing so. Take the role of an esteemed member of the Spider Lodge and try through careful planning to achieve &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, destroy the plans of your opponents and claim for yourself the title of the High Counselor of Aar.<br/><br/>In each round of Intrigue City each player changes the influence that he and one of his opponents has on the Guilds of Aar. Influence Tokens of three different values (1, 2 &amp; 3) represent each player&rsquo;s control over a Guild. Perfect balance of influence - not too obvious, nor too weak - is achieved by having Influence Tokens with a total value of six on a Guild; this is called an Equilibrium. At the end of each round each player scores Equilibrium Cards  for every Equilibrium he has managed to maintain up to that point. During the game players vote to increase the power of each Guild, also increasing the point value of that Guild&rsquo;s Equilibrium Cards, affecting each player&rsquo;s final score.<br/><br/>",

It's time to begin the race! The first person to finish two laps will win. Let's start the engines...I mean...wind your springs and let it roll!<br/><br/>In Spring Rally, players control their toy car based on trick-taking mechanisms. The game lasts three rounds, and in each round, players play a card from their hand to advance their car on the track. If the player wins the trick, they move their car as much as the lowest number on the card played in the round. Other players wind up their spring, which can help to boost them along when they win a trick. As long as a player avoids winning a trick, they gain the chance to advance much more later &mdash; but too much winding makes your spring stop working!<br/><br/>The player who first circles the track two times wins the game.<br/><br/>",

For the Allies, it is a desperate race against time - a struggle to clear the Germans from Normandy in preparation for the drive across France to the Rhine. For the Germans, it is a game of careful defense, of tenacious holding actions followed by hammer counterattacks.<br/><br/>Overlord provides victory conditions and initial set up locations for each of these three periods, allowing players to recreate, in a series of one month games, the distinct phases of the campaign.

But they didn&rsquo;t notice the dog, who suddenly appears with their mouth wide open&hellip;<br/>This chaotic crowd chases and squabbles with each other all around the room until the infuriated innkeeper bangs on a pot to disperse the would-be thieves. After all that hubbub, can you remember how much cheese there actually was?<br/><br/>In Cheese Master players are rolling all dice and need to be as fast as possible to figure out how many cheese are left on the floor. Each die will show animal faces or cheese pieces and create a funny interaction that you will need to understand before your opponents.<br/>They are 4 cheeses but 2 mice eating cheese, 1 cat is there, chasing a mice but before they do so, the dog is making the cat running away. So how many cheese pieces are left?<br/>Be quick as the slowest of players will not even be able to take a guess!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In November of 1950, the United Nations counteroffensive against the North Koreans seemed to be in the final stages of a mop-up. Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.<br/><br/>Chinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.<br/><br/>UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.<br/><br/>Units in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.<br/><br/>This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977. The 2009, Second Edition of Yalu will be a fully updated version of the game with all new graphics, all known errata included and some additional rule updates.<br/><br/>Both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; components. Second Edition Yalu has both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; map and counters to provide some replay variability. The 1977 rules and the new rules will also be featured.<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea, November 1950 to May 1951<br/><br/><br/>",

Thanks to the cards, every turn offers different situations.<br/><br/>The Criminals will have to complete two heists out of the three available to win the game and to do so they will have to move hidden in the shadows, leaving traces of their path that the Police will have to find to ruin the plans of the Criminals.<br/><br/>The Police will have the hard job of investigating the traces of Diabolik and Eva, but they are not alone, in fact they will have the opportunity to call on up to four Police Officers to help, to keep every corner of the city under observation. To win the game, the cops will have to raise the Danger Level to the maximum on the Danger Track. Usually, solving a Clue increases the Danger Level by 1 point, but that's not the only way to do it. On the other hand, if Eva or Diabolik complete a Heist, the Danger Level is lowered.<br/><br/>In their turn, each player can perform a maximum of 3 individual actions. The only exception is for drawing, discarding, or playing cards, which is a repeatable action.<br/><br/>",

Errata was published in S&amp;T #159.<br/><br/>From the introduction :<br/>&quot;Franco-Prussian War is a simulation of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. One player assumes the role of the German high command, the other the French. The German objective is to defeat France, thereby unifying the various German states into a single nation. The French player's objective is, initially, to gain glory for the French Empire; failing that, it is to successfully defend France against a German invasion. Franco-Prussian War uses a new system to simulate the nature of 19th century warfare. The game system itself is simple, but it does have some innovative features to represent leadership, staff work, command/control, effects of different weapons, and the ever-shifting sands of morale and politics.&quot;<br/><br/>1 turn = 1 week<br/><br/>Other games in the series were Austro-Prussian War (S&amp;T #167); Russo-Turkish War (S&amp;T #154) and Risorgimento (S&amp;T #187).<br/><br/>",

The game of Arydia is built on four design pillars: Exploration, Progression, Combat, and Role-playing.<br/><br/>&bull; Exploration &mdash; Arydia is an open world to explore as you wish. Make your way across the world map, discovering new locations, interacting with memorable characters, fighting vicious monsters, and scavenging long-lost treasures. The world pulls you in through detailed descriptions and vivid artwork for each place you visit. Every location is unique, not randomized, and is built piece by piece as you explore.<br/><br/>&bull; Progression &mdash; Arydia is played as a campaign over the course of a number of game sessions; you start each session right where you left off! As you play, the game keeps track of your actions and decisions. Your characters will grow in power, collecting new items, weapons, and skills. NPCs and locations will change, depending on how you interact with them. All of this progression is done using a simple, but powerful, index system, which allows for quick and easy set-up and tear down.<br/><br/>&bull; Combat &mdash; Many of the locations you'll visit in Arydia are hostile, so you'll need your weapons, skills, and co-operation to overcome the challenges you encounter! Arydia features a tactical, co-operative combat system. Enemies are controlled by game cards and dice, while you and your companions work together to defeat them.<br/><br/>&bull; Role-playing &mdash; Take on the roles of a wide cast of characters as you encounter them throughout your journeys. Step into the shoes of a disgruntled shop owner, sniffling brat, or a poorly-dressed bandit leader. The incentive-based role-play system encourages you to engage in dramatic storytelling, without being intrusive.<br/><br/>As for being a &quot;green legacy&quot; game, publisher Far Off Games notes that Arydia features all the hallmarks of a legacy game &mdash; packages to open, hidden information, progression, discovery, exploration, all the while wrapping it in high-quality components &mdash; but allows you to reset the game when you have completed it so that you can start again or pass it on to someone else.<br/><br/>",

Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.<br/><br/>The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.<br/><br/>The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Over millennia, Mekannis was transformed until every piece of land was incorporated into the gears and levers of the Engine itself. An act of hubris by the world&rsquo;s rulers caused a series of devastating malfunctions that shattered the land and the death of the Great Engine. Now four empires rise to dominance. The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory. Each empire vies to fulfill the prophecy and restore the Great Engine, the source of ultimate power.<br/><br/>In Empire Engine, players take on the role of a mighty empire, powered by rotating gears. During the game, players simultaneously choose actions to attack, defend, salvage, export, or collect resources (goods for export, soldiers to attack your opponents and inventions to score points). Players use their gears to rotate their engines, and in each round perform the actions on the top edges of their engines. The player who scores the most points for the goods, soldiers and inventions in their score pile at the end of the game is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Why is the game set in 2020? A few soccer rules changed by that year, making the game more fluid.<br/><br/>While StreetSoccer simulates soccer with five players on a side on a small square, Champions 2020 simulates stadium soccer, so the field is bigger. As coach you select 11 players as a starting line-up (goalie, defenders, midfielders, forwards), while the rest of your team starts in the dug-out for possible substitutes (after warming up).<br/><br/>Your professional soccer players are more skilled than street soccer players, which leads to spectacular stadium matches. Players can try to hit passing balls, which can lead to throw-ins, corner-kicks and goalie-kicks. As skilled team players, your players can anticipate on passes. Your goalie is skilled, too. With good positioning he has the best save chances, which depends on the speed of the shot and the distance to the ball. A rebound is possible, but a better save is catching the ball in his hands.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the players are &quot;skilled&quot; in causing fouls (or &quot;schwalbes&quot;), too. As soccer coach, you can't always control your players &ndash; and that leads to free kicks, penalty kicks, yellow/red cards and injuries.<br/><br/>For tournaments the yellow/red cards, injuries, extra time, penalty kicks and stats make the soccer simulation complete.<br/><br/>",

Success would allow the Pact armies to drive a wedge between the NATO forces deployed to the north and south, seize several important logistic centers, and perhaps establish a bridgehead across the Rhine River.<br/><br/>Of all the scenarios for a coming world war, none has received more attention than the possibility of a future NATO-Warsaw Pact confrontation. For 25 years, the armies of East and West have faced one another across a divided Germany, each knowing that it is in this region that the course of any war will be decided.<br/><br/>There are two types of games: the Standard Game and the Advanced Game. Preferably, the Players should become familiar with the Standard Garne first and then increase the level of complexity until they find a rules mix with which they are most comfortable.<br/><br/>The key to the game lies in the combination of a unique combat system and a new untried unit procedure. Basically, each ground combat unit consists of three &quot;steps&quot; and an untried status. As a unit enters combat, its actual strength&mdash; which may be greater or less than its normal face-value &mdash; must be determined. Combat results are expressed in terms of &quot;retreat points&quot; which must be expended either by retreating and/or by taking step losses. Since the owning player controls the path and method of retreat, there is a wide range of possible outcomes from each combat situation.<br/><br/>Fulda Gap Shows the likely impact of a great number of factors on modern warfare. Supply and movement systems stress the importance of roads and autobahns; rules are provided to reflect the importance of divisional integrity, artillery, helicopters, airmobile units, replacements, Soviet doctrine, field fortifications, and disengagement. And players wishing to increase the complexity of the game may use an innovative air system. Extensive rules also cover chemical and nuclear warfare.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 3.88 miles / 6.25 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment &amp; Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Fulda Gap rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Turn Record/Reinforcement Track<br/>Two dual-side printed Charts &amp; Tables folder (4 pages, Combat, Terrain tables, etc)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

Players will take command of starships and work together to complete missions while defending the system from enemy fleets.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with their own starship with unique capabilities and basic crew. As you earn credits from completing missions, you'll be able to upgrade your ship and hire advanced Heroic crew members. Your crew are your dice and players will roll them, then assign them to their ship's stations in order to perform actions during combat or to complete missions.<br/><br/>Ship to ship combat in Armada involves managing your crew and ship stations. As your ship takes damages, your stations become disabled and require repair actions by engineers. Your crew is also susceptible to injury and you'll take medic actions to revive them. Ships can be customized to your individual playstyle, whether you prefer to deal direct damage, or support teammates by disabling enemy shields and stations.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>1) Planning: Players travel to nearby planets. Players may also repair and upgrade their ships or hire new crew members during this time.<br/>2) Encounter: Players combat enemy fleets or resolve missions (together or alone).<br/>3) Resolution: Event cards and hazard effects are resolved. Enemy reinforcements will also appear at this time.<br/><br/>Once players have collected enough Data tokens, a final encounter is revealed. If they can defeat this final encounter, the players will win the game. What challenge faces our Captains? And who is behind all the terror?<br/><br/>DSD6: Armada takes the gameplay of Deep Space D-6 and enhances it with ship upgrades, dice mitigation, missions, and co-operative gameplay- all while retaining the game's signature minimalist style.<br/><br/>DSD6: Armada is not an expansion and does not require the original Deep Space D-6.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Some proposals lead to love and happiness and some to financial prosperity, but some are nothing more than shallow seductions. Whatever happens, you must ensure that your characters come out on top!<br/><br/>When proposing, if a Gentleman's Charm is lower than the Lady's, he must discard cards to make up the difference. If he wants to really impress her, he can discard additional cards to boost his Charm. If the Lady accepts, the players exchange characters and whoever has the higher Wealth draws cards equal to the difference. If she declines - paying cards if necessary to counter his Charm offensive - the Gentleman returns to the player's hand to brush up on his manners.<br/><br/>Declining a proposal from a Gentleman with a higher Rank will earn you additional cards, and if you have more Ladies in Society than anyone else at the start of your turn, you get an extra 'go'. This can help you to dominate the matchmaking scene but will doubtless draw the ire of your rivals. It's good to be protective of your Ladies, but don't let them get left on the shelf...<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the game ends and players tally up the Virtue of their married characters, then subtract the Virtue of their 'old maids' (Ladies left unwed in Society). Whoever has the highest Virtue total wins!<br/><br/>",

In particular, this first chapter covers the first years of the competition, between 1927 and 1933, when the biggest cars brands &ndash; Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Mercedes, etc. &ndash; struggle against all the odds in that tough race of 1000 miles (1000 Miglia, in Italian) in the worst conditions ever in the history of car racing and technology.<br/><br/>The 15 stages are realized by a combination of large hexagons, which represent the Italian countryside and its typical winding roads.<br/><br/>Particular attention was paid realizing a &quot;playful simulation&quot; in which all 19 cars featured in the game have their own characteristics, historically and technically recreated, after long research and interviews with the actual drivers of each car. So every car features its handling, engine performance and reliability with the goal of finding the right trade-off between simulation and entertainment.<br/><br/>The driver prepares his car to the race, acquiring spare parts and abilities that will help him along the way.

Players take on the perspective of Romans, Christians, Jews, or a Coalition of outside cultures (Germanic Tribes, Goths, &amp; Parthians) in an effort to accomplish their faction&rsquo;s unique objectives using asymmetric advantages. Mechanically, Soul of the Empire uses dice-driven action selection, deterministic combat with faction effects, culturally-based Power decks, and an objective point system to heighten tension between the factions. Thematically, Soul of the Empire explores the tensions between and motivations behind the four dominant worldviews of the period. Rome is at the height of it&rsquo;s power, but is overextended in the face of both internal divisions and external challengers. Jews zealously protect their spiritual heritage from a rapidly spreading sect, and chafe under the thumb of an increasingly oppressive Rome. The Coalition struggles to survive beset by relentless Roman expansion, harsh environments, and confusing beliefs which threaten the old ways. Meanwhile, Christians find their strength in weakness, victory in defeat, and purpose in the very people who persecute them mercilessly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ausgespielt! Der Messe-Krimi, the players are at SPIEL in Essen, the largest board game show. A famous videoblogger has been found murdered in the VIP press area, and not only the murderer was there, but also a group of other suspects who have all been in contact with the deceased in one way or another.<br/><br/>Ausgespielt! is a classic murder mystery game. The players put themselves in a crime case and experience a setting, but one of them is the murderer. Confronted with the case and the will to solve it themselves, the players try to expose the true culprit, but that person can lie to keep their secrets.<br/><br/>Solving the case is not the main goal, but rather having fun and experiencing the case and unfolding the story as it emerges. The designer is both an experienced crime case writer and a passionate board gamer, so he's included some hints and easter eggs to add to the enjoyment.<br/><br/>",

Zurmat is a mostly Pashtun district that the government of Afghanistan has only the thinnest veneer of control over. Taliban forces move freely across the dusty roads at night, spreading terror with their night letters, threatening anyone who cooperates with Kabul.<br/><br/>Just now an American infantry company sets up a Forward Operating Base (FOB) just outside the district center. The Afghan Army is starting to patrol, drones are heard above, and the occasional jet swoops low, explosions following in its wake. Meanwhile, in the mountains of Pakistan, bearded men in secure caves are determined to stand up to this increased Coalition presence. By mules, motorcycles and camels, weapons and ammunition make their way into Zurmat. This will not be a quiet year&hellip;<br/><br/>Zurmat is a two-player (Coalition versus the Taliban) game played across month-long turns with players trying to achieve their commander&rsquo;s objectives while always trying to gain control of the peoples' hearts and minds. Each month/turn begins with a random event, then the Coalition player takes their turn, followed by the Taliban player. Each turn you will take an action and play cards. The game ends when winter arrives. Since winter cards are part of the deck of random events, the exact ending of the game may not be known until perhaps even the last turn of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaiju Crush is a light strategy game with limited grid movement, shared objectives, and intransitive combat on a modular board.<br/><br/>In the game, players choose one of four giant monsters to play and proceed to crush buildings and fight other kaiju for victory points. On each player's turn, they choose to play either their own movement card or the shared movement card to land on and crush a city tile (a.k.a. a building). The player picks up the city tile and drops a territory marker in its place. City tiles score different points and territory markers can yield victory points based on objective cards that show goals like connected or unconnected territory markers, the number of city tile groups a player claims, and shapes created on the city grid.<br/><br/>Points are also generated by fighting either a monster on an adjacent space or a monster occupying a territory marker. To fight, players draw five territory markers and look at the reverse side. There are five symbols that represent the blows in the fight: firebreath, claw, tail, kick, and spikes. These symbols are part of an intransitive combat system, in which some symbols beat others but are beaten by others in turn. Each monster also has their own unique fighting ability as well as special abilities that change every game. Winners of either type of battle gain a random combat victory token worth 1-3 points. Winners of territory battles also replace the current territory marker with their own, which may help meet objectives as well as thwart opponents.<br/><br/>When no monster can move, the game is over, and the monster with the most victory points is supreme!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Diaballik is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. The game attempts to simulate a sport whereby 2 teams are simultaneously trying to get their ball to the opposite teams starting goal line.<br/><br/>The board depicts a 7&times;7 grid. Each player starts with 7 ball holders along their edge of the board and their ball in the middle holder. Players subsequently take turns completing the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Moving an empty ball holder orthogonally (up to 2 times); and/or<br/>     Making a ball &quot;pass&quot; by moving the ball from on holder to another along lateral (horizontal) or diagonal line. Pass are not limited in length as long as no opponent pieces are in the way.<br/><br/><br/>First person to send their teams ball to a holder on the opponents starting line wins. It's worth noting that an impenetrable wall of ball holders results in an automatic loss to the player who created the wall.<br/><br/>Nominated for the 2006 As d'Or Game of the Year.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Boîte à jeux (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>Available on iPad (via iTunes Apps Store) since the june 21st 2011 (2 players local game, or 1 player vs AI)<br/><br/>Strategiespiel nach den Prinzipien von Mannschaftssportarten, mit Bewegung und P&auml;ssen. Ziel des Spiels ist es seine Kugel auf die Startlinie des Gegners zu bringen.  Um dies zu erreichen muss jeder Spieler Angriffe und Verteidigungen spielen.

Will you be remembered as a benevolent ruler, revered for your cultural achievements? Or will you carve out a legacy through conquest, leaving a trail of triumph in your wake?

        "description": "Tomb of Four Kings is a fantasy adventure card game for a single player using a standard 52 deck of playing cards and one joker. With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore a dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain skills, even use magic. But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out you will be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find the tomb hoards of four ancient kings, collect as much additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive.<br/><br/>The spread is the standard layout for the game. At the top of the spread is an area where you play torches (A), as they appear. In the middle of the spread is the dungeon area itself. Turns descending into the dungeon are played in a row from left to right. This row is called the delve. The turns ascending from the depths of the dungeon are played underneath the delve from right to left, with one turn for each turn of the delve except the turn-around point. This is called the retreat. Below the dungeon area, from left to right are a discard area, a hit point counter, and a hand where you collect your treasure, tomb hoards, skill cards, and magic scroll.<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns. Each turn, you play a series of cards in the dungeon area. The turn represents an encounter as you explore the vast and sprawling dungeon. Layer the cards in a column while the turn is active. When the turn is over, stack those cards face down before moving on to the next turn. Each turn starts by playing cards from the deck until an encounter card appears.<br/><br/>If you make it out of the dungeon alive, add up all the treasure in your hand.  If you found all four kings and survived, you have won the game, regardless of points. Multiply total points by 100 to calculate the value of your treasure in gold pieces.<br/><br/>",

The wise foresee an age of horror approaching, for the spirit of the earth is sick, tainted by deadly sorcery in a great conflict ages past. Not that the warlords of this bloody era care, not while there is glory to be won, territory to be wrested from the enemy, foes to be slaughtered.<br/><br/>Kings of War 2nd Edition is a hardback rulebook that contains the complete Kings of War history and rules. It features:<br/>- Rules written by Alessio Cavatore (Warhammer 40,000, Bolt Action) and the Mantic Rules Committee. Kings of War is a game for gamers, by gamers.<br/>- Compelling new background, art and photography that invoke a powerful realm of swords and sorcery.<br/>- Elegant easy-to-learn rules, balanced and playtested by the community for casual and tournament play.<br/>- New Magic Spells and Artefacts<br/>- Eleven Force Lists upgraded with new units, including Forces of the Abyss, Forces of Nature, Undead, Dwarfs, Elves, Abyssal Dwarfs, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Basileans and the Kingdoms of Men.<br/><br/>Kings of War is the miniatures wargame from Mantic Games. Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.<br/><br/>Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.<br/><br/>Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2012, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for many factions are also available for download. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdom of Men (Medieval Humans), Basileans (Clerical army with saints and angels), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes.<br/>An expansion includes the complete Ogre army list, while additional faction lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood, Salamander (humanoid lizards) Armies, The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undeads... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).<br/><br/>",

The game covers the entire war from the Axis invasion of Russia to the final destruction of the Axis armies four years later.  The Axis  player has a fixed reinforcement rate, but the Russian player must decide what type of units he wants to produce by allocating his available resources.  These decisions are critical to the game as they were in the war.  There are also rules for supply, weather, air power and Axis Minor allies as well as variant campaign game rules.  In addition to the campaign game, there are four yearly scenarios, one for each year 1941-1944, which simulate the situation at key times during the campaign.  Those scenarios cover the Barbarossa Campaign, the Stalingrad Campaign, Kursk and the Destruction of Army Group Center.<br/><br/>Reissued as War in the East: The Russo-German Conflict, 1941-45 (Second Edition) to form part of War in Europe.<br/><br/>",

Be careful who you invite as sometimes the characters will disappear as soon as they arrive!<br/><br/>In Tea Time, players collect characters from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, and each character card (other than Alice) is double-sided, with a normal image on one side and a reverse &quot;mirrored&quot; image on the other. Each round, an array of characters is laid out, with normal and mirrored images alternating. The round's start player takes one character, adds it to his collection, then places the Alice card in that spot of the array. The next player takes 1-2 cards, but if he takes two, the cards must be adjacent. From the third player on, each player takes 1-3 cards; again, you can take multiple cards only if they're adjacent. If you ever have a normal and a mirrored image of the same character in your collection, *poof* they both disappear.<br/><br/>After five rounds (with two players) or three rounds (with 3-4 players), the game ends. Players score 1-15 points for collecting 1-5 cards of the same character &ndash; with zero cards of a character being worth five points, so sometimes you do want them to vanish! Alice herself is worth four points, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, either you play a card to the right of your player board as an expedition supporter &mdash; thereby increasing your technology, provision or clothing resources &mdash; then draw a card to end your turn, or you play a card above your player board to represent the explorer who has hired you to take him on a trip. To be hired by that explorer, though, your expedition must meet the demands of that explorer card in the category shown, such as having a technology level of at least five. When you place an explorer, you carry out the special power shown on that card, such as giving other players additional cards, taking an extra turn, or stealing equipment or explorers from others.<br/><br/>Once a player has laid his final card, the round ends immediately. Players earn money equal to the value of the explorers lying above their boards, then lose two coins for each card still in hand. The player with the most money after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>In the expert game, each player board has different starting values for the technology, provision and clothing resources as well as a special unique ability that a player can use once during a turn.<br/><br/>",

The great powers of Europe begin to mobilize their armies, initially believing that their potential opponents will back down at the show of strength.  Yet no one shrinks from the face of an increasingly inevitable war.<br/><br/>The Germans move towards war according to the Schlieffen plan.  As chief of the pre-war German general staff, von Schlieffen envisions a powerful group of German armies (the Right Wing) quickly moving through Belgium and northern France to attack Paris from the rear, while weaker forces protect the German border with France.<br/><br/>France mobilizes according to their own 'Plan 17'.  This offensive-minded plan calls for the bulk of French forces to quickly re-conquer those parts of France lost to Germany in 1870.  To do this, France masses her armies along the German border between Belgium and Switzerland.<br/><br/>As the Schlieffen plan is executed, tiny Belgium is invaded by 4 separate German armies.  The Germans believe that the Belgians will either offer no resistance, or will quickly be swept aside by their might.  But Belgium does resist, fighting on in the face of hopeless odds, even as the Germans employ secret weapons like the massive Big Bertha guns.<br/><br/>As events quickly unfold, Great Britain lands an expeditionary force in France to help defend Belgium and assist France.  It meets the German juggernaught as it pushes through Belgium.<br/><br/>The French, meanwhile, incur huge losses when they execute 'Plan 17'.  They now rush to stop the Germans from reaching Paris.<br/><br/>The plans of both sides fail, due to not only to mistakes in execution, but due to causes that could have been foreseen and acted upon.  As a result, neither side is able to achieve its objectives, and the consequences is the stalemate of trench warfare.<br/><br/>The Schlieffen Plan covers the campaign in Belgium and France from August to November 1914.  In this simulation, you assume the role of the commander of either the German or Allied armies.  The forces available to you are the same that were available to the historical participants.  Bit it is up to you to make your own strategic decisions, and to execute your your own plans as you see fit.  This is your chance to prove that you could have done better, that you could have changed the course of history.<br/><br/>This is the first in a series of simulations designed to interlock to allow you to simulate conflicts and campaigns from 1914 to the present and beyond across all of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.  Each simulation is self contained.  Yet, tied together, they will allow you to control all aspects of land, sea, &amp; air warfare.<br/><br/>Scale is 20km/hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division/Brigade<br/>560 Backprinted Counters<br/><br/>Medium Complexity<br/>Very High Solitaire Suitability<br/><br/>",

Fill up your Caravelas with spices and precious metals and return to Lisbon to claim glory and all the points you earned in your journey. But you must be careful when passing the Cape of Good Hope, &quot;Adamastor&quot; may sink your boats.<br/><br/>This simplified version comes from the success of &quot;Caravelas&quot;, and maintains the goal and amazing graphics of the previous game, as well as its didactic interest, but in which rules and play duration are reduced in order to make it more accessible to young players.<br/><br/>How is it played?<br/><br/>Each player in turn spends up to 4 of his motion cards to move his caravels (by moving the corresponding number of squares on the predetermined sea routes). Then he can discover locations, load resources, and deliver them in Lisbon to gain victory points. At the end of his move, he can return the motion cards that he did not spend or save them for the next play. Finally, he picks new cards until he has 4 motion cards in his hand and the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The game is much simpler than &quot;Caravelas&quot; (1st version) in several aspects. There are less components. Only 4 pages of rules (instead of 16). Caravels move only on predetermined routes. Number of moves is determined by the motion cards (instead of depending on the route followed by the ship). There are no event cards. Management of the ships is simplified. Etc.<br/><br/>This new version of the game has been developed for a broader (and/or younger) public.<br/><br/>",

Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.<br/><br/>Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.<br/><br/>",

Each side alternates activating units to move or fight by card play, either as a &quot;simple&quot; action or by using the text on the cards for additional or enhanced actions, including play of card combinations. Players choose their hand of cards from their entire pool of available cards at the start of each turn, which rewards good planning and anticipation of opponent's plans. One Event card is added to the pool each turn starting on the third; these handle high-level options like submarine warfare or USA entry.<br/><br/>What Price Glory? can be taught and played to completion in three or four hours. Experienced players can shave an hour off that time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get Off My Land! is a game of rival farmers competing for limited space and resources. The game takes place over the course a year as you start your farm from nothing, and build it up to generate more money. The player that has managed to amass the most money by the end is the winner.<br/><br/>Build Your Farm<br/><br/>Each farmhouse starts the game surrounded by forest. The first step is to clear the forest; this not only provides land to build farms on, but also wood to build fences with. By fencing off the cleared land, you create areas to grow crops or raise animals.<br/><br/>Plant Crops and Raise Animals<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve got cleared and fenced land, it&rsquo;s time to go to the market to buy crops and animals for your farm. There&rsquo;s limited stock available though, so buy what you need quickly before other farmers do.<br/><br/>Gain Income<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re not growing crops for fun, you need to get paid! Some things on your farm will provide you with a slow and steady trickle of income, and others can be harvested to gain a larger amount of money right away. Of course if you harvest something, you&rsquo;ll need to wait for it to grow again.<br/><br/>Expand Your Farm<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s limited land and resources available, so why not re-adjust the fence line a little bit so that your neighbor&rsquo;s cows are now on your side? Other farmers are trying to steal your precious potatoes too, so don&rsquo;t let down your guard.<br/><br/>",

A tile must be placed next to the midfield or to other tiles, and pipes must connect only to pipes of the appropriate width; exit pipes are considered to be both widths. Pipes can't connect to empty edges, and if you can't lay a tile (or don't want to), you can place it on the board face-down with the spiral back showing.<br/><br/>After 24 tiles have been placed, players score points: 1 point for each spiral tile showing, and 1-3 points for each exit pipe not connected to the grid.

After each jump &ndash; or &quot;jump&quot;, as it were &ndash; the bridge used by that frog falls into the lake.<br/><br/>The lilypads are set up in a square or pyramid, depending on the number of players in the game, with one bridge between each pair of adjacent lilypads. On a turn, a player either moves one frog from one lilypad to an adjacent one (removing the bridge after doing so, except for the bridge to a player's home, which can never be removed) or places one bridge on the board to connect two lilypads. If a frog lands on an occupied space (other than a player's home), the frog already on that space must jump away in a direction of the active player's choosing, removing the bridge used; if that frog lands next to another, then the process repeats. If a frog cannot jump away when encroached upon due to a lack of bridges, then the initial jump is illegal and the active player must take another action.<br/><br/>Each player has four action cards that can be used once each game to place two bridges, jump without needing a bridge, remove an additional bridge, or take an extra jump. Get all your frogs into the other players' homes, with at least one frog in each location, and you win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Landor Syndicate, a pirate alliance in an area of space controlled by the Lunar Orion Order, needs a new leader. The outgoing Supreme Admiral is looking for his replacement. Players take on the role of rival captains recruiting crews, capturing rival pirates, and collecting treasure.<br/><br/>Pirate Tricks is a trick-taking game for 3 to 5 players with a unique scoring system. The game is played over three hands. Each hand has different scoring goals. Once the scoring cards are revealed, the players are dealt five cards.  Then players each bid on another 7 cards to complete their hands.<br/><br/>As the players bid for cards, they will look to gain certain cards that will boost their scores. While taking tricks, the players will need to be mindful of the different factions of pirates as some will score higher than others or may be worth negative points. At the end of the hand the players will collect treasure based on how well they matched the treasure scoring card. During some hands the players will want to get as many tricks as possible, other hands they will want to have few to no tricks, or they may have to match a predicted number of tricks taken.<br/><br/>Play continues for three hands. New scoring cards are revealed before each hand. After three hands, whichever player has gathered the most treasure will be proclaimed the next Supreme Admiral of the Landor Syndicate.<br/><br/>",

After the first player collected the first set of items, a timer sets in that will trigger the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players will score points for each item and sets of items as well as for ending the thread at the cat's paw. They will lose points for porcelain cups that got tipped over. The player with the most total points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Philosophy is a relaxing, abstract two-player game. In it, you and your fellow player are two friends having a conversation.<br/><br/>The board represents your conversation space, and your pieces represent your ideas. The goal of the game is simple: connect 3 of your ideas in a row anywhere on the board. This is called a Conclusion.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll take turns placing your ideas onto the board, with the restriction that new tiles may only be placed in the center nine squares. Each tile has a space that it will target with a unique effect. If placed correctly, a player's tiles can push or pull the opposing player's tiles. Moved tiles may also push neighboring tiles or even enter into the target space of the current player's previously placed tiles, triggering chain reactions. Tiles that are eventually pushed off of the board are returned to the player that owns them. The game ends when a single player has reached a Conclusion: three of their tiles connected in a line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/><br/>Philosophy often feels more like a puzzle than a competitive game, as the board state grows in complexity and changes between turns. The calm theme, simple mechanics, difficult decisions, and premium production come together in a high quality experience for avid gamers and casual players alike.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>The rules were originally written to address the author&rsquo;s passion for refighting ancient battles from Classical Greece, through the period of Macedonian dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean to the rise and eventual fall of the Roman Empire. However, in response to requests from play-testers, they have been extended to cover everything between the biblical era and the late medieval period.<br/><br/>They have been designed so that they can be used for anything from solo play with 100 or so miniatures through to huge games with 3000 plus miniatures and up to 5 players a side. A square grid has been used to promote speed of play. This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages for use with a variety of rule systems to be used together on the same battlefield.<br/><br/>Absolutely no dice are used in To the Strongest! Instead, an innovative (and entertaining) mechanism uses playing cards to activate units, which can each potentially move or fight multiple times during the same turn. Shooting and melees are resolved quickly and decisively, amidst a flurry of playing cards....<br/><br/>Despite their relative simplicity, the author believes that these rules capture the essential flavour of an ancient or medieval battle, and that the more seasoned gamer will find more than enough command decisions to entertain and challenge him. He wishes that players may enjoy very many happy games, and may victory always fall to the strongest!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rainbow Pirates is kind of like playing Rummy on an enchanted island while being attacked by pirates drinking pi&ntilde;a coladas.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to earn as many Treasure Points as possible by placing card groups (treasure) on your island.  However, you can also attack your opponents with pirate cards (stealing or blowing up their treasure) or use them to give yourself other advantages.<br/><br/>The game was designed to allow for multiple strategies (ranging from guns-blazing aggressive to peace-loving non-violence) based on the player's hand, preferences, and group dynamics.  (eg, attacking an opponent's island can give you the edge you need to win, but also often causes reprisals and limits the treasure you earn from Black Cards)<br/><br/>Game actions during your turn include: placing cards (for Treasure Points), rearranging cards (to and from your island and hand), and playing pirate cards (to attack opponents or give yourself advantages).<br/><br/>When it is not your turn, you have the opportunity to BLOCK incoming pirate attacks if you have the right matching Color Card in your hand.  (Eg, the Captain Card can be stopped by bribing him with a green &quot;Me Time&quot; Color Card)  This will stop the attack, but you lose the ability to earn Treasure Points from the card used as a bribe.<br/><br/>A game can end in 2 possible ways:<br/>1) When a player goes out (by playing all cards from their hand AND having at least 2 full rainbows on their island)<br/>2) Running out of draw cards<br/><br/>Going out does NOT necessarily mean you win, but you do earn a BONUS 5 Treasure Points which often is enough to give you the win.<br/><br/>Rainbow Pirate cards are rare in the deck and highly valuable (worth 5 Treasure Points each).  They often become the focus of pirate attacks and thievery between players.  While valuable, these cards can also become a distraction, tempting players to drain too many resources to obtain them.  This game dynamic can result in interesting gameplay and strategies, especially when playing with 3 or more players.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The board shows a side view of the airspace over war-torn Europe (or in one scenario, Africa). The counter representing your Zeppelin remains in a central &quot;Zeppelin corridor,&quot; or column, shifting up or down as it gains and loses altitude; forward movement is marked by moving every other card and counter on the board left or right relative to your Zepp.<br/><br/>A typical scenario has you playing through 30 randomly dealt &quot;Situation Cards,&quot; which represent enemy units, weather conditions, and the odd mountain encountered on the way to and from your primary target. The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.<br/><br/>A separate &quot;ballast sheet,&quot; or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew. Five different Zeppelin models are provided, from the Type M converted passenger liner to the mammoth Type X &quot;war Zeppelin.&quot;<br/><br/>The game's components are a step above desktop publishing quality; cards and counters must be cut apart before play. The game provides ten scenarios, plus a campaign game and variant rules for two players.

        "description": "It is time to mix some colors! Each turn, a player plays a card from their hand and resolves its effects. These cards remain in the play area until they are picked up via a &quot;Refill&quot; action. Players may play the Mix card to take 2 colors in their hand and mix them together to make one of the available colors in the market rows.<br/><br/>Colors are mixed according to their pigment values in the CMYK color system. For example, Soft Cyan (1,0,0) + Light Yellow (0,0,1) = Jungle (1,0,1). This is the main way to upgrade cards into stronger ones. The game has 3 win conditions: Having 17+ Victory Points, Mixing all 3 Rank IV cards, and having 17+ cards in hand while the correct card is in play.<br/><br/>Chroma Mix is an economic action retrieval game for 1-4 players in a deck of just 85 cards. Turns are rapid, but the decisions are agonizing.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The rules for each Crusade share the same basic mechanics however the 3rd Crusade scenario is designed as a two-player only game, while the 1st Crusade scenario is intended for multi-player play, and has additional rules covering diplomatic and economic elements.<br/><br/>Distinguishing features:<br/><br/>    Combat occurs within hexes.<br/>    Sieges play a significant part in the game.<br/>    The 1st Crusade scenario creates a co-operative yet competitive game in that the crusader players must co-operate for the Crusade to succeed yet still need to pursue their own objectives (the same applies to the Muslim players).<br/>    Lots of atmospheric 'chrome', individual Crusader and Muslim leader are present as units, random events (plague, visions, treachery etc), Armenian and Byzantine intervention.<br/>    All orders for a turn are pre-written - makes for a long game (particularly the 1st Crusade scenario).<br/>    The map covers South-East Asia minor down through the Holy Land and Northern Egypt. Constantinople and the early part of the rout of the 1st Crusade is therefore not covered.<br/><br/><br/>One of the few  strategic level treatments of the Crusades.

There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI.<br/><br/>La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders.<br/><br/>Note this game is totally different from the later TSR &lsquo;remake&rsquo; of the same title.<br/><br/>",

To gain favor in his eyes, each baron must show his worth by constructing buildings and thus increase the splendor of the kingdom, or by supporting the king in the war with military units. With the king's eyes fixed on the frontlines, he probably wouldn't notice your sharp elbow in your neighbour's side... right?<br/><br/>Brawling Barons is a tactical card game consisting of 54 cards. From this deck of cards each player draws cards and collects resources. Units (peasants and squires) can then be played from the hand. The peasants can be upgraded (rotated) to buildings, and squires can become various military units. The military units can be sent to the frontlines to gain victory points (VPs), or they can attack opposing towns. When the last card is removed from the deck, the game ends and VPs are counted.<br/><br/>Tactical options include choosing units to play, waiting for the perfect timing to play them, optimizing the actions, and playing the right events. At first glance, it may seem too simple, but new depths can certainly be discovered.<br/><br/>Brawling Barons can be played in 10-20 minutes by two experienced players. Three-player games take about 30 minutes. By combining two decks, up to six players can play, either in a deathmatch or in team play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A century ago, the true measure of wits was determined by feats of engineering. In &ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo;, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.<br/><br/>Bridges to Nowhere is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting &quot;bridge cards&quot; which they will use to attach to larger &quot;pillar cards&quot; creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!<br/><br/>No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.<br/><br/>The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!<br/><br/>Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stratego Legends takes the familiar game play of Stratego and expands it into something new. In addition to ranks, all pieces now have powers as well. Some fly, some teleport. Some perform better in the marshes or in the mountains. Others have powerful death curses that provide long-lasting effects to the battle. There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.<br/> Stratego Legends is an &quot;optionally collectible&quot; game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.<br/><br/>",

The tactical battle has the Jewish forces attempting to keep open or bypass with a new road, the only source of food for the city.<br/><br/>In Jerusalem, the players do not merely move, but conduct an operation. This creates a unique flow of play which gives a true feel for the disjointed and desperate battle of the Jews to keep open the one road to the Holy City. Included are units for all the invading armies, Arab guerrillas, el Katub (the mad bomber), the Palmach, Haganah, Irgun, and Stern Gangs.

        "description": "Twelve spiritual leaders, known as the Masters of Brilliance, have gained a great influence and many followers. At the night of solstice, they brought an unexpected end upon the world, precisely by the rules they had foretold. Anything that people could imagine happened on that night. During that tragic spectacle, the Masters of Brilliance separated wheat from chaff, taking the chosen ones to a new nice little hell they had built in a higher dimension somewhere at the doorstep of afterlife. No one knows how they got there or how they managed to affect reality. Anyway, only rigorous cooperation could grant them enough power.<br/><br/>The end of the world brought about by these wise guys was not as perfect as they had planned. Soon it turned out that some men left in the ashes of the past world could enter the realm of the Masters of Brilliance. Perhaps the power they cast upon the world to destroy it left a solid print? Or perhaps the transition was not that difficult?<br/><br/>The first man to discover he possessed this ability was Jonas Arvani. When he found out he was not the only one, he founded a guild. The boarding ability &ndash; that is, the ability to jump into a much higher plane, where the Masters of Brilliance have their twisted utopia &ndash; soon turned into an enormous business. Not everyone managed to follow the guild's strict rules. Therefore competitive undertakings began to appear that were less able and less honest. Now retrievers have been trained by guilds to steal inventions and devices from the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance. Those items become artifacts in the ruined world. The most valuable prizes are schematics that allow mankind to recreate lost devices, so that they can serve people again.<br/><br/>In the board game Enclave: Zakon Krańca Świata, each player starts with a retriever card along with the machine that boosts their boarding ability. During the game, which lasts six turns, players are allowed to:<br/><br/><br/>    Upgrade their retriever (mental and physical condition)<br/>    Upgrade their jump machine (sarcophagus and sesame)<br/>    Buy items to protect themselves from deadly traps in the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance<br/>    Buy medication needed to heal their mental damage and physical wounds<br/>    Boarding the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance to find valuable prizes and knowledge<br/>    Do the job for the &quot;Shepherd&quot; without any risk, but with fewer profits<br/>    Visit the oracle to peek at the future and gain initiative in the next turn<br/>    Use the character or location card on the path &quot;to the tree&quot;<br/><br/><br/>This path is the main way to victory, known as becoming &quot;the chosen of the Tree&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Dwunastu przyw&oacute;dc&oacute;w religijnych zwanych Mistrzami Blasku zyskało wielkie wpływy oraz mn&oacute;stwo wyznawc&oacute;w, aby w noc przesilenia niespodziewanie wywołać koniec świata dokładnie według przepowiedzianych przez siebie reguł.<br/><br/>Właściwie stało się wszystko, co tylko ludzie zdołali sobie wyobrazić. A podczas tego dramatycznego spektaklu Mistrzowie Blasku odsiewali ziarno od plew. Zabierali wybranych, żeby zbudować im nowe, miłe piekiełko w wyższym wymiarze. Gdzieś w takim przedsionku do zaświat&oacute;w. Nie wiadomo, jak zdołali się tam dostać ani jakim sposobem potrafili wpływać na rzeczywistość. W każdym razie odpowiednią moc mogli uzyskać wyłącznie dzięki ścisłej wsp&oacute;łpracy.<br/><br/>Koniec świata pan&oacute;w mądrali nie był tak perfekcyjny, jak można by się spodziewać. Wkr&oacute;tce okazało się, że niekt&oacute;rzy z ludzi pozostawionych własnemu losowi na zgliszczach minionego świata potrafią przenikać do rzeczywistości Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku. Może moc, kt&oacute;rą Mistrzowie Blasku tchnęli w świat, żeby go rozwalić, zostawiła jakiś trwały ślad? A może przejście po prostu nie jest takie trudne? Pierwszym człowiekiem, kt&oacute;ry odkrył u siebie te niezwykłe zdolności, był Jonas Arvani. Niedługo potem przekonał się, że nie jest jedyny i założył gildię.<br/><br/>Umiejętność dokonywania abordaży, to znaczy skok&oacute;w w wyższy wymiar, w kt&oacute;rym Mistrzowie Blasku zbudowali swoją kaleką utopię, stała się wkr&oacute;tce wielkim biznesem. Gildia miała twarde zasady, kt&oacute;rym nie każdy m&oacute;gł podołać. Zaczęły powstawać konkurencyjne ugrupowania, mniej sprawne i mniej uczciwe.<br/><br/>Zadaniem pozyskiwaczy czy też szkolonych w gildii grabieżc&oacute;w jest wykradanie z enklawy Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku wynalazk&oacute;w i urządzeń, kt&oacute;re w zrujnowanym świecie zyskiwały rangę artefakt&oacute;w. Najcenniejszymi pryzami, jakie można wynieść z abordażu, są schematy budowy urządzeń pozwalające odtworzyć daną rzecz, tak, aby zn&oacute;w mogła służyć ludziom.<br/><br/>I tak w grze planszowej każdy z graczy otrzymuje kartę pozyskiwacza wraz z maszyną wspomagającą abordaże.<br/><br/>Podczas rozgrywki, kt&oacute;ra będzie trwała 6 tur, gracze mają możliwość:<br/>- ulepszać swojego pozyskiwacza (psychika i kondycja fizyczna)<br/>- ulepszać wyposażenie maszyny do skok&oacute;w (sarkofagu i sezamu)<br/>- zakupić przedmioty umożliwiające ominięcie pułapek będących śmiertelnym zagrożeniem w enklawie Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku <br/>- zakupić niezbędne medykamenty, aby chronić swoje zdrowie psychiczne oraz fizyczne<br/>- wykonać abordaż do enklawy Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku dla cennego pryzu jak i zdobycia wiedzy<br/>- wykonać zlecenie dla &bdquo;Pasterza&rdquo; bez ponoszenia ryzyka, lecz z mniejszymi korzyściami<br/>- udać się do wyroczni celem podejrzenia swojej przyszłości, jak i przejęcia inicjatywy w kolejnej turze<br/>- skorzystać z karty osoby lub lokacji na ścieżce &bdquo;Ku Drzewu&rdquo; będącej gł&oacute;wną osia prowadzącą do zwycięstwa, jakim jest zostanie &bdquo;wybrańcem mistycznego Drzewa&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>ヴァンガード (Vanguard) is a Japanese trading card game published by Bushiroad. It was created in collaboration between Akira Itō (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, &quot;カードファイト!! ヴァンガード&quot; (Cardfight!! Vanguard).<br/><br/>In the game, players &quot;ride&quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.<br/><br/>As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &quot;drive check&quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &quot;triggers&quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &quot;damage check&quot;.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &quot;vanguard circle&quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &quot;drive check&quot; or &quot;damage check&quot;.<br/><br/>Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:<br/><br/>1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)<br/>2. Stand and Draw<br/>3. Ride<br/>4. Call<br/>5. Attack<br/>6. Guard<br/>7. Drive Check<br/>8. Damage Check<br/>9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)<br/>10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2<br/><br/>It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &quot;counter blast&quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).<br/><br/>",

The other pieces are not needed in either case.<br/><br/>The 36 wooden pieces or 25 picture tiles are mixed up and laid out in a circle. The game figure is placed on any of the wooden pieces or picture tiles. The 36 (or 25, respectively) small gold coins, and the large gold coin are placed in the center of the circle.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, he or she moves the game figure forward either one, two, or three places clockwise along the circle. The player then takes the wooden piece that the game figure is standing over and places the piece in front of themselves so that it is visible to all players. The game figure remains in the empty space.<br/><br/>When a player takes the last piece of a color (ie. yellow) or the last of a shape (ie. triangle), the game is interrupted and scoring takes place. Every player who has a piece of this color or shape in front of them receives a small gold coin for each of these pieces. When playing with the picture tiles, scoring is based on the colors or animals (with only 5 gold coins). If the taken piece is the last one of a color and shape, there is a double scoring: 6 (or 5) small coins for the appropriate color and 6 (or 5) for the appropriate shape (or animal) are distributed.<br/><br/>The game ends once all 36 (or 25) small coins are distributed. The player with most coins wins.<br/><br/>The game is an adaptation of &quot;Wheel of History&quot; from New Games in Old Rome. Marketed for children, but has variants for adults as well. It has nice-looking components (wooden pieces of different colors and shapes).<br/><br/>",

Special abilities or modifiers are shown on the bottom of each card. If the numbers are equal, both cards are defeated.<br/>7. After the attack is finished, the losing card is discarded and the winning card flips back over, then it is the next players turn.

        "description": "The year is 2179, and Earth's future seems bleak. Years of pollution have tarnished the landscape, and the world's supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies, and other energy-saving solutions have slowed the problem, but the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope, yet a group of optimistic explorers are trekking to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate.<br/><br/>In search of knowledge, these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing the rapid deterioration of Earth. They'll need to replicate Martian technologies, translate their languages, and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save Earth as they know it.<br/><br/>In Ruins of Mars, players compete to build out their arsenal of knowledge, attempting to understand the languages of ancient civilizations that colonized Mars and made it a hub of economic activity. The game is played around a board with five locations and eleven communal action tiles that are laid out at random underneath the board as evenly as possible.<br/><br/>On a turn, you choose one of the locations, optionally pay to shift an action tile from an adjacent location to the active one, take the action of the location &mdash; the effect of which will be based on the tiles below that space &mdash; optionally replicate alien tech by paying resources and adding it to your board for personal use, then reallocate the action tiles from the active site in a mancala-like fashion.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you learn the Martian languages and re-discover and study their technologies, which come in three levels and multiple classifications and which grant you special abilities. Along the way, you might pick up radiation from various actions, and you'll want to ditch that if possible so as not to lose points in the final scoring, which is mostly based on the tech you've assembled and your skill with languages.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.<br/><br/>A las Barricadas! (&quot;To the Barricades!&quot;), the first title in the War Storms series, is a game that attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Maurice&quot; is a delightful combination of tabletop miniatures rules for historical and fictional battles, a limitless campaign system that requires virtually no math or paperwork, and a role-playing game in which the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; are officers, units, and armies, whose personalities you create, and whose fates you manage from battle to battle across wars and decades.<br/><br/>The game play is driven by the action cards, which are used to activate forces and to modify those actions. Each card has the potential to do more than one thing, but can only ever be used for a single thing at any given time. The game is played in alternating rounds. The active player first chooses whether or not volleys will be fired by both sides. Then he decides whether to play a card for its event, or activate a group of units to march, rally, charge, or bombard. To activate a force a number of cards need to be discarded for their &quot;span&quot; number based on the distance from the commander to the force. The action also determines how many new cards may be drawn, the more vigorous action the fewer cards. Or he could also choose to pass and draw more cards. A group of units depends on their physical proximity, type, and formation. An additional card may be played to modify an action. The passive player might have interrupt cards that enable him to inject complications into the <br/>active player&rsquo;s action. The game continues until one side&rsquo;s army morale breaks. If neither side&rsquo;s army morale breaks before the game runs out of cards, then night has fallen without a decisive victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game pits two aircraft carrier task forces against each other; each player has two carriers loaded with 6 torpedoes and 4 aircraft.  Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.<br/><br/>An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.<br/><br/>Remade in to Mission Command Sea.<br/><br/>",

However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.<br/><br/>Each player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.<br/><br/>When it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are &quot;thieves&quot; with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, &quot;tax collectors&quot; who steal hand held cards and the &quot;pharaoh&quot; who can prevent these actions from taking place!<br/><br/>",

The goal is to place a set of three equal cards on each square, including # and *. At the beginning, each player starts with three cards. As soon as the hourglass is turned over, gameplay becomes fast-paced: Players can draw or discard cards. In order to win the game, however, an exchange of cards with their neighbors is indispensable. The cards may not be passed on freely, however. Each card shows an arrow that indicates whether the right or left neighbor can be traded with and they must be ready to return a suitable card. Jokers allow you to replace missing cards. Once a player has a set of three equal cards in hand, they can place it on the appropriate space, either cracking part of the code or earning extra time.

Your team consists of a Demo expert, Heavy Weapons Expert, Medic, Scout, Sniper and you -- the Leader. During your briefing you are told your objectives and known intel on the area. Move your force through the urban area facing an unknown number of insurgents coming from you at all angles. As the team leader you decide if you stay as a group or send out a specialist to eliminate the enemy with their unique skills. Play solo, or fight together with another player as Alpha and Bravo team, while the insurgents move and engage you both with equal resolve thanks to a card-automation system.  You can also race to see which team can complete the objectives first, or even play as a traditional 2-sided wargame.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Card: Series 1 is a collection of print at home micro solitaire games that depict iconic battles and campaigns of the Second World War with only a single sheet of paper and a handful of dice. Each scenario is played on a single sheet map with scenario-specific rules that allow players to face some of the unique challenges and struggles of that particular battle.<br/><br/>In each scenario the player takes the role of one of the powers from the Second World War, trying to achieve historic goals. Each scenario focuses on different aspects of conflict, such as supply, artillery support, and fighting withdrawals. Scenarios take place across a wide range of theaters, from Western Europe to the Eastern Front, North Africa, and the Pacific.<br/><br/>The games are played over a series of six turns, and while each game features unique choices, the player is often forced to make difficult decisions on whether to attack or defend, how best to bolster their main forces with support such as reinforcements and artillery, and when to advance or withdraw from conflict.<br/><br/>Players need only print a single sheet of paper, grab a handful of dice, and can play right away. Each game takes only a few minutes to set up and learn the rules and can be played in 10 minutes or less.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The medical horror Frankenstein was a bestselling novel, and medical shows in which physicians would electrify corpses, pull teeth, or peddle their &quot;miracle cures&quot; drew huge crowds.<br/><br/>In Trepanation, players take the role of fraudulent doctors in this era who are performing medical shows for the gullible public and vying to become the most famous medical performer.<br/><br/>The game takes place over six days (rounds). At the start of each day, players prepare their schedules by booking time slots at locations around town, then the day's events happen according to these schedules. Players will gather medicine and equipment, employ accomplices, bribe the police, and perform shows &mdash; but not all plans run smoothly. Other players will create stock shortages, steal your audience, and snatch up those essential time slots! Performing shows in related sets grants fame bonuses, as does getting your name in the local newspapers. Grave-robbing in the night damages your reputation, but earns cash! At the end of a busy week, the player who has earned the most fame wins.<br/><br/>This worker placement game features lots of action spaces because the emphasis is on timing your actions correctly to make the most of your limited resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each time a player dies, his survivors climb another rung up the political ladder, taking the deceased's title and all the wealth and power that comes with it.

It was fought between Polish army commanded by general Jan Skrzynecki and Russian army commanded by field marshal Ivan Diebitsch. The battle was the final part of the operation of Polish army against Russian Imperial Guard. The meeting near Ostrołęka was a bit suprising for both sides, especially for Poles who didn&rsquo;t expect such quick appearance of Russian forces near their positions. Polish army was divided into two parts. The first part was situated on the eastern bank of the river Narew. The second, larger part was put on the western bank of the river. In Ostrołęka there were two bridges connecting both banks of the river (one of them was pontoon bridge).<br/><br/>The first part of the battle was fought on the eastern bank of Narew. Polish forces tried to slow down an assault of Russians and withdraw to the western bank. Unfortunately, in consequence of earlier orders, one of Polish infantry brigades commanded by general Bogusławski was stayed to defend town Ostrołęka (situated on the eastern bank of the river), and there attacked by overwhelming Russians and partially routed, partially destroyed. Russians took control over Ostrołęka at noon. Then some Russian grenadier battalions decided to cross the river through the bridges to create a bridgehead for further operations. So started the second part of the battle. Polish main army began attacks to destroy Russian bridgehead and both brigdes to prevent main body of Russian army to cross the river. There were few attacks. At first they were not properly coordinated. Russian small forces on the bridgehead was supported by powerful artillery situated on the eastern bank of the river which was higher than western bank and allowed crossing fire (Russians formed two great batteries, one to the north and one to the south of Ostrołęka, and were shooting over own units on the western bank).<br/><br/>In the later afternoon Polish attacks became more coordinated. Russians tried to gain more terrain, but it moved them out of the range of their supporting artillery and encouraged Polish army to make last, most powerful attack, which was stopped near to the river. The battle ended a famous charge of Polish horse artillery battery commanded by lt. col. J. Bem, which caused great chaos in the Russian forces and discouraged Russians to make general cavalry attack on Polish army in the end of the battle as they were used to do in the Napoleonic Wars. When battle ended, both sides had similar casualties (about 6 000 killed, wounded etc.). The battle is considered Polish army defeat because it left the battlefield and during the night and the next day started retreat, not chased by Russians who first weren&rsquo;t sure they had won. The main effect of the battle for Poles was the fall of morale of soldiers and the upper command, which allowed Russians to take initiative in the later part of Polish-Russian War.<br/><br/>Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 contains three scenarios, with one made to introduce players to the system and two historical ones, showing both parts of the battlle. The game is quite complex, tending to show full spectrum of tactic of the Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic period, but in reasonably easy way. Basic game mechanic is similar to Igo/Ugo movement, but with two phases of movement: for cavalry and infantry, and two combat phases: for cavalry and infantry. Horse artillery is generally attached to cavalry and foot artillery is attached to infantry. Additional rules offer another movement systems but rather designed for further battles based on this rules, not for that one. Rules offer many possible reaction activities for non-active player during opposite player phase. Another rules feature is an unique combat calculation system based on traditional odds ratio but originally modified. The rules focuse on simulating cooperation of three kinds of weapon (infantry, cavalry and artillery) on the battlefield and showing different formations (column, line, square, skirmish, buildings defense). The playing time varies depending on the scenario, from 2-3 hours to whole day. It also depends on the players &ndash; the longest scenario can be finished very quickly by autowin.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- One mapsheet 96 x 68 cm <br/>- Nine sheets of die-cut counters (978 counters totally, most of them are markers)<br/>- One sheet of additional counters<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- Three dices (D6)<br/>- Six sheets with tables and player aids<br/>- One sheet with units tables (alternative way of marking units loses)<br/><br/>",

The patients that the doctors are treating are characters from Gothic literature, such as Mr. Hyde or Frankenstein's Monster.<br/><br/>Patients are &quot;cured&quot; with a combination of cards from the hand indicated on each patient's card. The number of treatments required range from 2 to 4 treatment cards, and harder-to-treat patients earn the doctor more money. There is also a &quot;wild card&quot; treatment in the game to speed up gameplay (though his treatment is required for some patients).<br/><br/>In addition to patient and treatment cards, there are also action cards, which allow doctors to affect how easily patients are treated, to draw additional cards, or to hinder another doctor's efforts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "End of the Trail is a competitive card game for 1-4 prospectors and fortune seekers. Players manage a hand of cards to secure transportation, prospect land, and take a shot at winning a title to more land at the poker table. Cards have three uses, each corresponding to a particular phase of the game: to prospect land tiles and discover how much gold a claim will produce, to collect and play cards that build a good poker hand, and to purchase additional cards in auction to help with prospecting, poker, or both.<br/><br/>Prospecting land is a risky business. Players must choose their cards carefully, as they have limited chances to discover the most bountiful sources of gold.  Each time they play a card and peek at a land tile, they must decide if they will stake a claim, placing their prospector&rsquo;s tent, or if they will press their luck and try to find a better claim.  But if a new land tile that they peek at produces less gold than their most previous inspected tile, the player&rsquo;s luck has run out, and they are forced to accept the less bountiful claim.<br/><br/>In the California Gold Rush, fortunes were won and lost at the poker table.  At the end of each round, players must select two of the cards they played for prospecting and add them to the stud poker hand in front of them on the table.  At the end of the game, players reveal their poker hands.  The player with the best poker hand wins another claim, placing their fourth and final prospector&rsquo;s tent on a land tile.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, all hidden values  are revealed and players add up the gold of their various claims.  The player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are very few games on the topic, and none quite like this. The US Army, US Marine Corp, ROK Army, NKPA, and CPA forces are all represented. Air power, armor, and the Naval might of the UN forces are represented simply and elegantly. Rail movement, amphibious landings, and surprise attacks are in here too. Can you as the NKPA take Seoul and Pusan before the might of the US led UN forces get too strong? Will you as the UN player be able to blitz into N. Korea securing the Yalu River before Chinese forces come pouring across like a blizzard from the north? And as a last resort can you secure more enemy territory to control across the 38th Parallel as the peace makers negotiate the end of the war? The decisions are yours!<br/><br/>",

Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.<br/><br/>The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.<br/><br/>The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.<br/><br/>Optional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.<br/><br/>",

Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.<br/><br/>In this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.<br/><br/>The game ends after a certain number of rounds.

A vast island chain, covered in the ruins of ancient civilizations, the Archipelago appears every few centuries, far out in the southern ocean. At such times, pirates, adventurers, wizards, and legendary heroes all descend upon the islands in the hopes of finding lost treasures and powerful artefacts. A few, drawn by the blood of their ancestors, search for the fabled Crystal Pool, whose waters grant abilities far beyond those of normal men. It is only the bravest, however, who venture into the islands, for they are filled with numerous deadly threats. Cannibal tribes, sorcerous snake-men, and poisonous water-beasts all inhabit the island ruins, guarding their treasure hordes and setting traps for the unwary.<br/><br/>In the wargame Frostgrave: Ghost Archipelago, set in the world of Frostgrave, players take on the role of Heritors, mighty warriors whose ancestors drank from the Crystal Pool. These Heritors lead their small, handpicked teams of spellcasters, rogues, and treasure hunters into the ever-shifting labyrinth of the Ghost Archipelago. Using the same rules system as Frostgrave, this standalone wargame focuses on heroes who draw on the power in their blood to perform nigh-impossible feats of strength and agility. This game also includes thirty spells drawn from five schools of magic, a host of soldier types, challenging scenarios, treasure tables, and a full bestiary of the most common creatures that inhabit the Lost Isles.<br/><br/>",

The end of the myth of German invincibility. Kursk. Just one hell of a lot of fun to game with 1&rdquo; square cardboard counters representing platoons of infantry and tanks and batteries of anti-tank guns, mortars, and stuff. And that is what you get with Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk.<br/><br/>Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk (PCD:K) is the port of Tiny Battles&rsquo; well-known Platoon Commander system to Flying Pig&rsquo;s big box, mounted map, large counter method of game publishing. Each game includes three mounted 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; geomorphic maps, and four sheets of thick (as in 2mm thick, wow these counters are so easy to pick up, thick, why haven&rsquo;t wargames been like this forever, thick), 1&rdquo; square counters. There are Tiger tanks, Panther tanks, Mk IV tanks, T-34/76 tanks, KV-1 tanks, SU-152 assault guns, infantry (rifle, guards, pioneers, submachinegun), mortar batteries, Stukas, IL-2, and more.<br/><br/>PCD:K uses version 2 of the Platoon Commander rules, which are identical to the V1.5 rules released with the latest Tiny Battle Publishing Platoon Commander game, Poland Strikes, with the exception of enhanced artillery and new air strike routines.<br/><br/>Each turn is gamed through several phases. At the beginning of each turn, the players determine initiative with a unique dice-off system in which ties award the initiative to whomever lacked it the previous turn and applying the Commander's Focus to the roll might tilt the odds in your favor. Next, players will draw a scenario-designated  number (usually just one) of Action Cards that may be used for anything from artillery strikes, through rally assists, to negating the opponent's just-played card. Then it is time to rally disrupted units with a simple 1d6 roll against a nationality or scenario-designated morale. Action Cards, in addition to the special Aid chit, may be used to improve a unit's chances of preparing for combat.<br/><br/>And then all hell breaks lose...<br/><br/>It's the Fire Phase and players alternate firing with individual units or stacks of units against in-range and in-sight enemy units. When firing on the enemy tanks, the target's Armor Factor is subtracted from the firing unit's Armor Piercing Factor, two dice are rolled, and the results checked on the appropriate column on the Fire Results Table, yielding a number of potential hits. The target rolls a die for each potential hit and compares it to his or her morale. Pass the morale check, that hit is negated. These columns and die rolls can be modified by the target's terrain, flanking fire, the Focus marker (represents the commander's presence), and most importantly Action Cards, which can grant column shifts or even allow the same unit to fire again, adding a delicious uncertainty that makes the game thrilling to play. Players continue to alternate attacks until neither wishes to attack.<br/><br/>Next comes the Movement Phase. Unlike the preceding Fire Phase, one player moves ALL his eligible units before the opposition gets to move. Certain units can move and fire or vice versa (with a penalty), unfired opposing units can opportunity fire on enemies moving within their line of sight. As in many other facets of the game, the insightful play of Action Cards during the movement phase is critical, allowing additional movement or opportunity fire conducted by units that have already fired. No PanzerBush tactics here, you never know when a unit will be able to fire on you. Exciting stuff.<br/><br/>Finally, we reach the Aid and Focus Phase. Platoon Commander eschews the use of HQs that can be unrealistically targeted. Instead both players have Aid and Focus markers, representing where the commander intends to place emphasis or send additional assets (ammunition, weapons, etc) or first aid. The placement of these markers provides combat and morale bonuses to the units underneath them. Additionally, if the player chooses, the Focus marker can be used to influence the initiative roll.<br/><br/>And that's a turn of Platoon Commander.<br/><br/>So, What's Different?<br/><br/>I hear that a lot. With all the tactical games on the market, what makes Platoon Commander Deluxe: Kursk different?<br/><br/>Clutterless counters. PCD:K uses color to determine a weapon's range. For example, an Armor Piercing factor printed on gold indicates that the weapon can fire normally at a target up to four hexes away.<br/>Unique phasing. Players alternate attacking in the Fire Phase, but move all their units at once during the Movement Phase.<br/>Flanking Friendly Close Assault Phase. Units do not enter the hex of the Close Assault target, but rather attack from adjacent hexes. This allows the attacker to not only amass the overwhelming odds needed to take that key position, but also attack from multiple directions, which provide a flanking bonus. Additionally, alternating attacks in the Close Assault phase allow defenders to conduct true spoiling attacks. <br/>Ranged combat results are based not only an the target's armor factor and terrain, which determine the column on which the attack is executed, but also the target unit's morale which determines how many hits affected the target.<br/>Artillery is card driven. Neither player knows the other's artillery capability by glancing at a scenario card. Artillery barrages are determined by Action Cards.<br/>Action Cards. PCD:K is not card driven, but rather card assisted. The Action Cards provide artillery, rally units, provide combat bonuses, and even unexpected Opportunity Fire shots. <br/>Focus and Aid Markers. These markers allow players to influence the battle much as their real life counterparts would. Players may choose to focus on a specific area, providing combat bonuses, or provide additional aid to those disrupted by fire.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a system that grognards and newbies alike can enjoy. The counters are large, easy to read, and beautifully illustrated. There is no jungle of numbers to wade through; the range at which a unit can fire is indicated by the color of the placard (badge?) behind the attack factor. Although gamers need not fiddle with unit facing, simple rules account for flanking fire. And infantry isn&rsquo;t forgotten either. Platoon Commander Deluxe uses a unique system in which infantry assaults from adjacent hexes, allowing commanders to concentrate overwhelming force at a critical point and even conduct flank attacks. And woe be the Tiger platoon caught unsupported in the midst of a city by a horde of Russian rifleman.'<br/><br/>",

Neurodepression is a game of flipping the place card, but Nana will reveal someone's hand. In addition, your hand can only be published with the largest number or the smallest number. In that rule, the first person who purchased three challenges wins the game. Basically, you will find 3 identical cards, but you will see many things in the process. For example, if a person's largest number is 8. Numbers are only 1 to 12 so you know that your hand is just a small number. If you have 2 &quot;1&quot; cards in your hand, you may be able to reveal those &quot;people who seem to have a small number.&quot; (Of course, it is not necessary...) Nana is the interesting point of being able to enjoy reasoning thoughts even though it is a very simple rule.<br/><br/>",

To play, choose one card from your hand simultaneously and put it face down in front of you. Reveal your chosen card simultaneously. Place cards into your caf&eacute;, respecting the order of initiative, and choose whether to resolve their effects.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>At the end of the round, review your caf&eacute; from left to right to see which objectives have been fulfilled. Each card has one objective, which earns you coins if you have that card in your caf&eacute; and you fulfill its requirements. If a Group card has been placed in front of a card, that card&rsquo;s coin reward is either doubled or tripled, depending on which half of the Group points towards you. Add up all the coins you have earned from your objectives. If you have earned the most coins, you win the round and receive 1 Tip card. If you now have 2 Tip cards, the game ends and you win! Otherwise, set up the next round and continue playing.<br/><br/>",

Play powerful blessings and curses to gain advantage.  Summon Minions onto the board or use them as upgrades, serving as mounts or offerings to bolster their allies.<br/><br/>Command your forces during the action phase.  Manage Minion actions for combat, area control, and tactical advantage.  Send your Minions to the Greek Isles to recruit epic heroes and monsters of legend, such as Medusa, Perseus, and Pegasus.

The only solution is throwing them on the conveyor belt and eventually they'll fall in the meat grinder so they can be processed again and become tasty sausages fit for human consumption.<br/><br/>But the sausages will struggle to survive. They want to stay alive as long as possible so they will run away from the meat grinder and push the other sausages in front of them. But they will also have to keep an eye out for the Must-ard who will give them commands they must follow. They can also turn to the May-onnaise who will give them some options they might use. And don't forget the Ketchup. What's a sausage without Ketchup?<br/><br/>Who'll be the last Wurst standing? Will it be you?<br/><br/>Wurst Case Scenario is a funny very lightweight family game. The players are dealt an identity card randomly and they keep their identity a secret. Every turn all players play one card to influence the position of the sausages on the belt. When all players have played their card all sausages move one position further on the belt in the direction of the meat grinder. Eventually the sausages will move onto the meat grinder and they are eliminated from the game (but the owner of the sausage will keep on playing cards). When there is only one sausage left on the belt the game has ended and the owner of the sausage is declared the winner. When your sausage is eliminated, you can still keep on playing to plot your revenge. The eliminated players will try to make sure the last sausages fall in the grinder at the same time (this isn't as easy as you might think) and when this happens there is no winner.

As the culmination of over 20 years of research in consultation with world-class experts, Valley of Tears shows the Yom Kippur war at a level of detail not yet seen. For the first time ever, for example, the game&rsquo;s maps were precisely drawn using actual tactical Israeli maps used during the war and include the official code names for hilly defensive positions in both battle areas.<br/><br/>Valley of Tears takes the BCS into a whole new level: that of post WW2 operations. For example, its dedicated air warfare system allows BCS players to not only pit F-4 Phantoms against MiG-21 Fishbeds in the contest for air superiority, but also assign the Front&rsquo;s air units to execute SEAD and Deep Strike (both RAM and DOMINQUE) missions (to suppress the ever present SAM threat and attack enemy air bases/destroy enemy infrastructure, respectively) as well as the traditional (but more effective) BCS Close Air Support missions.<br/><br/>The game presents the largest tank battle since WWII, with the Cold War adversaries fighting a proxy war where the latest Centurion and Patton tanks faced off against T-62s following Soviet tactical doctrines.<br/><br/>Expecting to have to repeat the war&rsquo;s of 1967 and 1956, the Israelis were confronted by the then-new and unexpected masses of Sagger missiles and RPG hand-held weapons. It&rsquo;s your job to win the war, with or against, these new weapons and the much more effective and versatile air war to generate a win without taking excessive casualties making the win Pyrrhic.<br/><br/>Can you master the deadly environment and become the victor?<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/>The Yom Kippur War: Two Front Campaign (All 4 maps)<br/>On the Banks of the Suez: The Sinai Front Campaign (3 maps)<br/>Syrians at the Border: Golan Front Campaign (1 map)<br/>Dual for the Golan (1 map)<br/>Iraqi Intervention (1 map)<br/>Aryeh Dov (1 map)<br/>Operation Stouthearted Men (less than 1 map)<br/>Africa (2 maps)<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/>BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)<br/>BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>VoT Game Specific rulebook<br/>Israeli Player Booklet<br/>Arab Player Booklet<br/>Turn Record Track Card<br/>Israeli Player Display Card<br/>Arab Player Display Card<br/>Two Frontal Air Display Cards<br/>Four 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps (Three Sinai, One Golan)<br/>1,400 Counters (Three unit sheets and Two BCS marker sheets)<br/>8 scenarios total, 4 one-map (or smaller) scenarios of 2 to 5 turns.<br/>Box and Dice<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Ascari&quot; is a company-level wargame based on the stories of loyal solders who fought for Italy in Eritrea, the first Italian colony. The game depicts four battles in which the Italians were the protagonists: the two battles of Agordat against the Dervishes, Amba Alagi, and Coatit against the Ethiopians. A bonus scenario depicting the battle of Metemma between the Dervishes and the Ethiopian Emperor Johannes IV is also included.<br/><br/>Here are the description of the Scenarios:<br/>S1 First Agordat:<br/>A raiding party of Dervishes are caught by the Ascari troops commanded by Captain Gustavo Fara in the plain of Agordat.<br/><br/>S2 Agordat:<br/>2200 native Askari and some Italian national soldiers, led by Lt. Colonel Arimondi, encounters in the plain of Agordat around 12,000 Mahdists, led by the Amir of Ghedaref, attempting to invade the Italian Colony of Eritrea. An astonishing Italian victory and the very first one of the young nation.<br/><br/>S3 Coatit:<br/>The Italian Army in Eritrea, led by General Baratieri, wins its last victory before Adowa, attacking the overhelming Ras Mangasha&rsquo;s Army at Coatit, fighting two days and performing a perfect redeployment under enemy fire. Tactically a draw, but stra-tegically a victory.<br/><br/>S4 Amba Alagi<br/>The political quarrel between Gen. Arimondi and Eritrea Governor Baratieri led the IV Native Battalion to be put in the advanced position of Amba Alagi, just in front of the full Negus Menelik Ethiopian Army. Arimondi wanted to repeat Agordat, when with few troops managed to win the day, and therefore, despite Baratieri&rsquo;s order to withdraw the Battalion, he didn&rsquo;t forward it to Lt. Toselli, condemning him and his men to sure death&hellip; it will be the prelude to Adowa!<br/><br/>S5 Metemma<br/>After the sack of the historic capital city of Gondar in 1888, Negus Neghesti Johannes IV gathered an army to repel the Mahdists from the city of Metemma. While on the way to victory, the Ethiopians melt away demoralized by the killing of their Emperor during the final assault.<br/><br/>",

The initial shock of the attack sent the Soviets reeling and Minsk quickly fell to the invaders. However, the Axis timetable demanded complete success during the initial months of the invasion, for only with the Red Army destroyed and Byelorussia occupied could the Soviet Union, fresh from Stalin&rsquo;s purges, collapse; but anything less than total victory would mean a long and protracted war. The stakes could not be higher as the German panzers and infantry engaged Soviet armies and mechanized corps along Russia&rsquo;s western frontier.<br/><br/>The Arduous Beginning is the first new historical board game in some 15 years from renowned game designer Frank Chadwick. It is a new iteration on his classic Battle for Moscow game system that combines ease of learning and design elegance with the kind of dramatic gameplay that Frank has long been famous for.<br/><br/>Complexity: 2.5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is one German corps or Soviet army or corps, and each turn is approximately eight days.<br/><br/>",

Each variant must be played on its own, not combined with another. They are:<br/><br/>&bull; Even/Odd: During set-up, place a double-sided even/odd card to the left of the lowest starting card, placing it even or odd side face up to match that card. Only cards of the same type can be added to that row, so if the card is on odd, then even cards can be placed only on the other three rows. If you take the row next to this card, move this card next to the row with the lowest number at right, flipping it if needed.<br/><br/>&bull; Mountain Climbing: During set-up, place a double-sided card to the left of the bottommost starting card with the face showing the up arrow in the corner and down arrow on a row of cards. Cards placed in this row go in descending order instead of ascending. If you play 35 and the descending row ends in 40 and an ascending row ends in 28, you'll place your card in the descending row since the difference between 35 &amp; 40 is less than between 35 &amp; 20. If you take this row, slide the double-sided card up to the next row; when it reaches the top row, it then starts moving back down.<br/><br/>&bull; The Jumping Cow: During set-up, place the jumping cow card to the right of the lowest starting card; this card counts as part of this row. When someone places the sixth card in this row, they claim the number cards other than the one they played, then the cow immediately jumps to the end of the row with the lowest number at right; if this row now has six cards, they claim these cards as well!<br/><br/>&bull; Number Spinner: During set-up, each player takes a number spinner card along with ten number cards. Once during the round, they can play the number spinner along with a two-digit number card. During card placement, the digits on this player's card are reversed, e.g. 41 becomes 14, so if 14 is the lowest number, they place their card first. However, once placed, the digits are treated in their original order for all subsequent card placements.<br/><br/>&bull; Beat the Buffalo: This co-operative variant is for 1-6 players, who try to score less collectively than the buffalo. During set-up, deal ten cards face down to the buffalo board; additionally, take 0-16 random action cards depending on the player count, then lay two of them face up. Each turn, all players choose and reveal their cards, then flip the buffalo's top number card. All of the cards are placed in the rows like normal, but at any time before, during, or after this process, players can choose to use one or more action cards, replacing each with a new card immediately. Action cards let you make a row off-limits, place a card inside a row, move an already placed card, and more. (In a game with one or two players, the buffalo must score twice as many points as the players for the players to win.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forty years of tense, uneasy peace are suddenly shattered as the Korean Peninsula erupts in renewed warfare. Two peoples -- historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous, but polarized by politics and economics -- hurl men, weapons, and materials into the fray in an attempt to settle their division once and for all.<br/><br/>From Pyongyang in North Korea to Pusan in South Korea, the battle rages. While the front line surges east to west across the peninsula, both sides commit airborne and seaborne Special Forces and Marines as well as their Air Forces to deep penetrations into enemy territory. With skilled infiltration capabilities, and the strategic mobility of armor, airmobile, paratroop, and marine forces, there is no safe haven throughout the length or breadth of Korea.<br/><br/>While the North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. Will the United States reinforce the South, and if so, how, when, and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again intervene into the Korean conflict as they did in 1950? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Crisis: Korea 1995 allows players to fight a near-future war on the peninsula. Players have access to virtually all available military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy-to-learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, tunnels, light infantry, attack helicopter, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and particularly tough terrain of Korea.<br/><br/>",

The next round begins with a new game master and a new rule. The game is played with 144 playing cards, with each card appearing exactly twice in the game. The cards are distinguished by four different characteristics:<br/><br/><br/>     The shape: &quot;circle&quot;, &quot;triangle&quot; or &quot;square&quot;.<br/>     The number of shapes: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot; or &quot;6&quot;.<br/>     The filling of the shapes: &quot;filled&quot; or &quot;unfilled&quot;. <br/>     The color of the card: &quot;white&quot; or &quot;black&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>A simple rule would be, for example: &quot;Always alternate black and white cards&quot;.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The strongest and most violent competition on wheels is about to start. The smell of petrol blood, kerosene and gunpowder mix in a desert blurred with the scars caused by hundreds of tyres. The pilots howl with euphoria after the starting line while their mechanic frames roar waiting for the starting pistol shot. Missiles, machine guns, knives, missile launchers, antitank mines, the vehicles are ready to depart. Soon they pistons will go off and the sand below the tyres will explode. Badass Riders has just started.<br/><br/>Badass Riders is a competitive card game for 2 to 8 players who recreate a frenetic race of armed cars in a post-apocalyptic future. Each player chooses a vehicle and a pilot, both with their abilities and unique characteristics wich could be combined to give rise to different strategies. The terrain cards permit you to build the circuit on which the vehicles will run. You can create or build completely personalised circuits, which permits you to adjust the complexity and duration of the game by adding or more or less special terrains, collocating traps, sandstorms, snipers, arsenals or even a huge and monstrous sandworm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space pirates are battling for honor, glory and wealth! Join them in their exploration of the universe and their quest for victory. Players will explore, challenge each others, and engage in short-term or long-term alliances, but there will be battles and mighty spaceships involved. In Metal Adventures, you'll use cards to explore, enhance your ship and your crew, and live up to bold challenges. There will be negotiations, battle tactics, and the uncertainty and risk that really make a pirate's life.<br/><br/>During the game, each player uses a fancy four-wheeled astrolabe to track their power (which can be improved via equipment), damage (which reduces power), glory (which is how players win), and the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot; (which affects glory).<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either rests (gaining money and repairing their ship) or else travels (paying to do so), battles (either starships, planets or opponents), and optionally takes the &quot;tour of pirates&quot;, visiting one of the ten planets in the game and taken the action available there. Each player holds two trophy cards, and when they meet the conditions on one of them, they can reveal it to earn credits, glory or both. They can gain support (single-use cards) and equipment (providing power adjustments and possibly other special abilities), keeping at most four of these improvement cards at a time.<br/><br/>Players can negotiate alliances and trade anything but glory, and while they must keep their word for immediate exchanges and actions, they can break promises or alliances in later turns, although doing so requires them to suffer the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot;, thereby affecting their glory count. Collect four such points, and they can no longer ally with other players or give or receive assistance.<br/><br/>When a player has nine or more glory points or the space deck contains two or fewer cards, the game ends and whoever has the most glory wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The topic of the game is the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.<br/> Players control the actual units that fought in the campaign. Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.<br/><br/>The original game was published in 2004.  The 2016, Avalanche Press released an updated &quot;Player's Edition&quot;, more pieces, a larger map and more scenarios.  There are 200 playing pieces in the Player's Edition (the first edition had 140) and a 28x22-inch map (the first edition&rsquo;s was 22x17 inches) by Guy Riessen. There&rsquo;s an introductory scenario for the 1939 German invasion of Poland, but the main event is the 1941 Axis attack on the Soviet Union. There are additional scenarios built around Operation Barbarossa plus variations like Turkish intervention.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the night of 5-6 june 1944, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to be parachuted behind Utah Beach in order to secure the approaches to the beach for the first wave of the landing forces. The sector had been flooded by the Germans, transforming streams and lowlands into swamps and increasing the strategic value of the bridges and roads of the region. Of these, the two bridges located in the commune of Chef-du-Pont and the crossroads of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise are of primary importance for the Allies. In fact, withouth capturing them, it would be impossible to advance quickly into the Cotentin Peninsula and enlarge the bridgehead.<br/><br/>The paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne need to be dropped onto three Drop Zones: The 505th PIR to the northwest of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise, the 507th PIR to the north of Amfreville, and the 508th PIR to the south of Amfreville. The Americans did have some reservations about the chances of success of this airborne operation. The landing zones were surrounded by several swamps and the smallest error would lead to heavy losses. The most pessimistic predictions had the casualty rate at 80%.<br/><br/>While flying over the Cotentin, the troop transports were fired upon by German anti-aircraft defenses and thrown into disorder. Some pilots broke formation and gave the order to jump before the drop zones had been reached, leaving many parachutists dozens of kilometers away from their objectives. The less fortunate landed in the swampland and drowned in their heavy equipment. More than three-quarter of paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to, leading to the complete disorganization of the American troops dropped over France. This general state of disorder resulted in a series of clashes all over southeastern Cotentin. The Germans, themselves disorganized, limited their engagements against an enemy force whose objectives and strength remained unknown.<br/><br/>Despite an extremely high rate of losses (more than 50% during the night of 6 June 1944 alone), the American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions accomplished a great deal of their assigned missions. The Germans, disorganized by the chaos, were incapable of counter-attacking. The landing could begin.<br/><br/>&quot;Night Drop&quot; simulates the first hours of June 1944 and focuses on the operations conducted by the 82nd Us Airborne division. During the first (night time) game turns, the American player had to regroup his scattered forces in order to re-form companies and regiments. As long as this reorganization remains undone, American troops remain very vulnerable and the American player cannot know which objectives are in priority.<br/><br/>The German player can use the opportunity to create even more disorder in the American ranks, or chase after isolated paratroopers. But the surprise of the airborne assault keeps the Germans blind to the objectives of their adversaries. As daylight comes, the German player slowly begins to learn the intentions of the American troops and can better organize as reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>For the American player, the knowledge of his objectives and the strength of his units give him the advantage over his enemies. The superiority from which he benefits allows him to bluff his opponent by attacking lesser important objectives, obliging the German player to make some critical choices: continue to defend a hex of middling importance and risk abandoning a more important hex, or focus on defending more important hexes and risk having been &quot;fooled&quot; by the enemy! The randomness of the drop, the priority assigned to each objective, and the arrival of German reinforcements assures a different game each time.<br/><br/>140 counters<br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; map<br/>6 pages rules booklet<br/><br/>Scale: 1 counter = 1 American company or 1 German section/company<br/>1 game turn = 1 hour<br/>1 hex = 400 meters<br/><br/>(source: publisher's description)<br/><br/>",

Isekai is a popular genre in Japanese culture, where characters travel to a different world.

Basically each side secretly selects and deploys the forces, which may include guided missile ships, submarines, helicopters, multi-role aircraft and land-based missile sites, considered necessary to achieve a defined objective.  The ships and aircraft are moved and guided missiles and other weapons fired.  Combat is resolved by means of a carefully programmed 'computer-card' system.<br/><br/>&quot;Two approaches to the game are suggested, SEASTRIKE I and SEASTRIKE II.  The former is a single complete game and the latter is more detailed and more flexible and enables players to evolve their own games.&quot; <br/>                              [From the promotional material]<br/><br/>This is a naval coldwar wargame some way between miniatures and boardgames.

This will be the first game in the series Sengoku Jidai, which will cover battles in 16th century Japan. The system is designed so players can finish a game in an evening, and has simple but dynamic mechanics.<br/><br/>In the game, each player takes the role of a commander in chief. Each army consists of various clans, and the players have to choose an action for each of their clans. Each clan is represented by 1 to 3 units. The units have various abilities, summarized by the 4 factors: &eacute;lan, mass, fire and the presence of a leader. Elan represents factors such as the unit's mobility, and its boldness in attack, and is also used to reflect the advantage that cavalry can have over infantry when attacking. The unit's mass represents its staying power, such as its ability to resist a cavalry charge or a rout.<br/><br/>A unit's abilities are tied to the value of its four factors and the current mode of the clan that it belongs to. A clan can be placed in one of four modes: Attack, Defense, Move, and Rally. The owning clan's mode will affect a unit's ability to move or engage in combat.<br/><br/>A game turn consists of alternating phases where a player can activate his units. The order in which activations will occur is tied to a chit pull system.<br/><br/>The game system requires each player to plan carefully how to win. They must maneuver to gain numerical superiority, deploy in terrain that takes advantage of their clan's mode, and try to surprise his opponent by attacking troops that are not prepared.<br/><br/>The system also places the players under the same historical limitations as the actual Japanese leaders. Japanese generals of this time prearranged their battle plans and coordinated their armies with a precise system of semaphore flags and sound signals.<br/><br/>The game includes 2 scenarios: one depicting the historical battle, and a &quot;what if?&quot; hypothetical scenario. In the historical scenario, Takeda's army is divided in two contingents. One of the contingents is taken by surprise by Uesugi's army, and has to fight a holding action until the rest of the army can come to its aid.<br/>The hypothetical scenario explores what could have happened several days before the historical battle.<br/><br/>In Kawanakajima 1561 a hex represents about 250 meters and a strength point corresponds to around 100 men.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>     1 map A1 (84cm*60cm)<br/>     228 game counters (88 5/8inch, 140 1/2inch)<br/>     one rule book with scenarios<br/>     Game play aids<br/>     Cardboard jacket<br/>     4 dice<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Compass Games website:)<br/><br/>After failing to defeat the invading Japanese forces on the beaches of Luzon, General MacArthur, commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), retreated the Philippine Army to the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor, according to War Plan Orange. Holding fortified positions and bolstered by the crack Philippine Scouts, the Allied forces would hold for months against the well equipped and trained Japanese invaders.<br/><br/>Bataan! is a two-player game, recreating the battle for the peninsula. Vance von Borries has drawn from his game design experience to create a game engine capable of portraying the tense jungle-fighting which took place on Bataan. While the system is based on a previous success, the changes needed to simulate the fighting on Bataan make this a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>Japanese forces will move quickly to out-flank and pry the US/Filipino units from their fortifications. Yet the Americans can successfully launch attacks out of these strong points, particularly when the crack Philippine Scouts are in the lead. From time to time a player may lead with his armor and this was the one battle of the war where the lowly US Stuart tank was the superior tank!<br/><br/>A chit-pull system is used to randomly determine activations for the various formations on each side. In general, formation size is based on a division. Each formation activates individually for movement and combat. Players alternate activations based on the random chit-pull until all formations have played. Most Japanese formations receive two activations per turn, thereby demonstrating their combat capabilities, preparedness and motivation in taking an offensive role. Individual unit counters represent battalions or half battalions, and include efficiency ratings for combat comparisons and other functions.<br/><br/>Bataan! features five scenarios. The three early scenarios, which include a learning scenario, all play to a conclusion in one sitting. They feature a surprising amount of movement for a mostly jungle warfare game and rely on sound military tactics. Only the fourth scenario, the last battle, is a true set-piece action. The Japanese planned it that way and yet even the outcome of that battle was not pre-ordained. All scenarios are tied together by a campaign scenario where both players contend with supply and disease to field the best force possible for the final offensive.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     1 map &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; - [scale of 1.2 km to the hex] <br/>        2 full sheets of 0.6&rdquo; counters [or 408 5/8 inch counters]<br/>        11 full-color set-up and player aid cards<br/>        1 rules booklet [with historical notes] <br/>        1 10-sided dice<br/>        1 full color box and lid set<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Vance von Borries<br/>Developer: Mark Guttag<br/>Artist: Tim Schleif<br/><br/><br/>(BGG user description:)<br/><br/>Bataan! is a two-player operational level game of this WW II Pacific theater campaign, January through April 1942. It presents a fascinating contest of two mismatched armies on a subject our hobby has not gamed often. The US/Filipino defense, embattled, isolated and led initially by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, for three months held off a numerically inferior but well-equipped and very aggressive Japanese force led by General Masaharu Homma. While the US and Filipino forces can be said to have won most of the first contests: the Abucay Line, the Battle of the Points and the Battle of the Pockets, it would be the final contest that decided the issue. Only because of continued complete isolation would the US lose that final battle in April 1942. And yet it was that heroic defense of sublime courage that helped motivate the US to endure the reverses of the war and persevere to a complete victory. It was &quot;Why We Fight.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is time to settle your differences, once and for all, and destroy that fortress in an all-out castle rampage! However, your opponent seems to have had the same idea, so now you have to defend your own castle, while still trying to raze the other one to the ground.<br/><br/>Players start Castle Rampage by building their castle and its gate with their cards. Once a player has three cards in each of these locations, they can start attacking. Each round, they may draw a card from the draw pile, reinforce their castle with one card, then play additional cards to attack, first going after the opponent's gate and once that is destroyed the castle itself. Whoever manages to destroy the last defense card of their opponent wins.<br/><br/>Castle Rampage is a quick and entertaining tower defense card game in which both players are the attacker as well as the defender. Each turn, they have to consider which part of their castle to reinforce and how many cards to play in order to tear down the opponent's castle walls as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>",

In the first littering phase players draw four waste cards each from the draw pile and choose exactly one of them to keep. Later on comes the investment phase in which players may purchase recycling and incineration plants as well as the waste processing facility and profitability tokens, that will be placed at the players boards. All those investments influence the recycling and incineration phase, which provides players with waste cards, that will be processed in the last phase in order to bring revenue.<br/><br/>After the last, 10th round the game finishes and the time comes for assessment of the players efforts. Victory points are awarded for proper investments and gained money. The players may also be punished with negative points for garbage cards and waste cards that they discarded during the game. After summing up the victory and negative points, the winner is determined.<br/><br/>Waste processing has never been this much fun!<br/><br/>",

It's also a well-known fact that the only way to get to BE a bigger goblin is to eat a good breakfast.  This makes breakfast in the Goblin Warren a highly competitive and somewhat dangerous meal...<br/><br/>In this card game, players take the role of Goblins at the Breakfast table, scrambling to eat as much food as possible and to prevent other players from doing the same.<br/><br/>Illustrated by Travis Hansen, the game plays from 2 to 6 players, (more with multiple decks.)  It takes about 5 minutes to learn, and 15 minutes to play.  It includes about 60 cards.<br/><br/>To start the game, a few cards are dealt out to the center table, and on each turn, players can do one of the following four things.<br/><br/>A, They can take a food or weapon from the center of the table.<br/>B, If they have a bigger weapon than another player, they can steal another card from another player's hand.<br/>C, If they have a food card in hand they can eat it, scoring it.<br/>D, They can play a special action card from the center of the table, immediately playing its effects.<br/><br/>The result is a fast-paced, light-hearted arms race, with quickly shifting strategy and chaotic fun.  After the deck runs out, the player that eats the most food wins!<br/><br/>It should be noted that this game was a finalist for the 2014 Ion Awards at the SaltCon board game convention in Salt Lake City.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OVERVIEW<br/>Sans Alli&eacute;s (French: &ldquo;without allies&rdquo;) is a solitaire card game where you command 20th century troops and technology, pushing through an enemy nation bent on developing a vile super-weapon.  Sans Alli&eacute;s takes the feel of a grand-strategy, area-movement war game and compresses it into a tight little solo package, playable in about an hour.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>The enemy nation is represented by an assortment of &quot;region&quot; cards arranged as a layered pyramid, with the &quot;enemy capital&quot; card at the top of the pyramid.  Meanwhile, the enemy's &quot;progress&quot; towards completion of an ultimate weapon is represented by a proximity track along the side of the pyramid, which possibly increases each turn.  The object of the game is to capture or claim the enemy capital card before the enemy succeeds in completing his weapon.<br/><br/>No region card can be removed from the pyramid until either one or both of the cards laid atop it are removed first.  Therefore, you will need to capture region cards at the lowest level of the pyramid first, working your way up the pyramid in stages.  Each attempt to capture a region is called an &quot;invasion.&quot; To conduct invasions, you gather various military unit cards from your draw deck (separate from the enemy nation deck).  These units have strength values, while each level of the pyramid has a defensive value.  You have to amass enough strength and the right types of units to attempt an invasion on a given region, and then a roll of the dice determines whether you lose (discard) this entire invasionary force, or save a few, or lose more than expected, and are possibly forced to retreat.<br/><br/>Along the way, you can capture select region cards called resource centers, and/or you can invade select zones to liberate prison camps.  These achievements not only increase the number of cards you draw on a turn, but also grant you the ability to improve your units strength values, and they introduce tactical developments that give you more dynamic choices in battle, including an Ultimate Weapon of your own.<br/><br/>",

Craft words using the 26 letter cards, focus on the achievement cards, score the most experience points, and win.<br/><br/>Can you find the best word in WordCraft?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The 26 letters of the English alphabet are separated in 5 categories based on the frequency they appear in the English vocabulary. On each of the 3 rounds of the game, only some letters from each category will be available for the players to use them. On their turn, they form words with the available letters and they indicate which letters they used by placing cubes on the Letter cards. By the end of the round, only the players with the majority of the cubes on each Letter card will score experience points.<br/>Furthermore, through the game there are 4 different Achievement cards that can get fulfilled on every turn by using the available letters in certain ways.

The Confederate Army, victorious at Bull Run, sits watching warily across the Potomac at McClellans 100,000 plus troops train and prepare for the coming campaign season. McClellan is being spurred by politicians and press to use the army he has molded for operations besides drill.<br/><br/>McClellan launches a bold flanking maneuver, taking his juggernaut by boat to the tip of the Virginia Peninsula at Fort Monroe. He slowly moves westward towards Richmond. This forces Johnston to react and fight or lose Richmond. The battles at Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Savage Station, Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill will forever be seared into the memories of the participants.

Each mission tells a story and takes the players on a unique adventure to various locations to save POWs, raid jungle encampments, survive a treacherous jungle, battle on boats, and more! Missions unlock new gear and tactics cards to help players customize their experience and allow for high replayability and great tactical strategy. Taking actions and engaging in combat is done without random dice, but with a card-based tactical system in which the player is in control and where every choice can be life or death!<br/><br/>Players choose from iconic characters each with highly detailed miniatures such as John Rambo, Col. Trautman, Co Bao, and all new characters created for the game! Each hero has unique abilities and customization options as well! You control how to approach the mission: Do you go in guns blazing? Or do you take a more stealthy approach? Perhaps you set a trap for the enemy? It's up to you to decide and lead Rambo and his team to victory in Rambo: The Board Game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the elements of Diplomacy that makes it so unique is the writing of orders for your pieces and then the simultaneous resolution of the move for everyone.  Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brewin' USA is a thematic Eurogame in which players control a start-up brewery at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players will need to collect key ingredients, launch a product line of &quot;liquid gold&quot; craft beer, and strategically compete for regional control across the nation.<br/><br/>A game turn consists of three phases: Ingredient Auction, Launching Beers, and Resolving any Brewfests. During the Auction Phase, players compete for the ingredient cards needed to launch their beer via a turn-based bidding system. Any bids entered are then turned into craft beer &quot;market demand&quot; that is dispersed at the discretion of the players making each play through unique and delivering many interesting decisions. Each beer card has an ingredient recipe that must be satisfied before the beer can be brewed and one of six different beer styles that tailor better to certain cities which will be key when competing for regional control. When a player brews a beer, they must choose to control an open city location or challenge an controlled city to a brewfest where the winner of the brewfest will control the city. If any player controls the most cities in a region at the end of the game, then they control the region. The game ends when the first player brews three beers, and points are then totaled counting beer quality and reputation on cities and any regions you control.<br/><br/>Brewin' USA aims to deliver a quick strategic euro experience paired with a very approachable theme and thrives on its player interaction. The game play revolves around Beer Coaster tiles delivering new twists on fun mechanisms and components including 105 Bottle caps to be used for both money and victory points. The player interaction comes from the Brewfest event in the game, which ramps us as more players grow their craft beer product lines and are chomping to establish their control in the regions.<br/><br/>",

There are numerous variations with other names like &quot;Smeghead&quot;, &quot;Shit-boot&quot; or &quot;Mukava&quot;. In Sweden it is referred to as &quot;V&auml;ndtia&quot; and often comes with minor rules variations.<br/><br/>The game is for two to six players in which players aim to not be the last player to get rid of their cards. Who gets rid of their cards first is usually considered unimportant. The loser must deal the next game.<br/><br/>The game requires one regular 52-card deck (plus 2 Jokers, when six play). Aces are high, although twos and tens act as trump cards in different ways.<br/><br/>Each player gets a set of piles of two cards, three face up and three face down. They then take turns to play cards onto a central pile, drawing from the deck to replenish their hand. If they can't make a play they have to pick up the pile and the next player begins a new one. Once a player has emptied their hand and no more cards can be drawn, they move on to play cards from their own piles.<br/><br/>",

Keep an eye out for valuable royal jelly along the way- whoever mines the most will be crowned king or queen of Mount Honeycomb! Hurry though, because time is short, and once the mountain crumbles, it&rsquo;s time to go home. Look out while you mine though because other bears are on your tail. You&rsquo;ll need to dodge their tricks, use your equipment, and even withstand earthquakes to be victorious!<br/><br/>Ursa Miner is a 30 minute, family-friendly game for 2 to 4 players. The game takes place in a 3-layered mountain of tiles- as you play the game, you&rsquo;ll reveal more tiles to mine. You&rsquo;ll also break down the mountain as you play, so watch your step! A randomized board setup means that no two games will play out the same way, and the mountain will crumble differently every time.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will perform two actions with each of their bears. All bears can move to an adjacent hex, and work together to mine adjacent tiles. Tiles are worth honey, which are used to buy more bears and play bonus cards, or royal jelly, which are used as victory points. As bears mine deeper in the mountain, the tiles will get more valuable, but also more difficult to mine. Players draw bonus cards into their hand at the end of each turn, which move tiles and bears around the mountain, and foil your opponent's plans. When the deck runs out, the game ends, and the player with the most royal jelly wins!<br/><br/>",

According to the school tradition all who wish to be school president may now present their candidacy to the voters. In order to do that they organize events on the school playing field. All seems to proceed in an atmosphere of friendly rivalry. The truth is, however, that the first week of school is a time of merciless combat during which all is fair. At the end of the week  we will know who gets position and influence and who loses status and privilege.&quot;<br/><br/>Saigo no Kane is a board game in which you will battle your friends for power and authority in a Japanese high school.

        "description": "&quot;Kulikovo 1380: The Golden Horde&quot; is a tactical wargame covering the battle between the Golden Horde clan of Mongols and the collected principalities that we know as Russia under the growing leadership of Muscovy, and the Grand Prince of Moscow, Dmitri Ivanovich, later entitled Donskoi for his victory at Kulikovo (which is right near the Don River). For 150 years, Tatar armies had readily destroyed all Russian opposition, and Kulikovo was the first sign that Russia was starting to emerge from Tatar domination. It would take several centuries more.<br/><br/>Kulikovo is considered a major turning point/battle of the Middle Ages, in that it not only showed that a western-style, &quot;heavy&quot; army could defeat the Mongols, but it was also the first major step in the unification of the various Russian principalities under the leadership of Muscovy.<br/><br/>Kulikovo is an accessible, fast-playing, fun wargame of low complexity. Gamers who have played ATO's Suleiman the Magnificent (ATO #9), and/or GMT Games’s Men Of Iron should find all of this quite familiar.<br/><br/>",

In this world, we are the heroes!<br/><br/>In OrcQuest, you are about to embody a gang of green skins, and being mean is good. Brawls, traps, treasures, captures and cheap shots are on the menu, and you're gonna love it! OrcQuest is a fast-paced card game in which violence and dirty tricks are the keys to victory. Even our dice are sharp enough to slash our enemies. Be bad, be strong, be orc!<br/><br/>In more detail, you want to be the richest green skin alive at the end of the raid. Every turn, you take a card from the draw pile, then you have to play one challenge card: Brawl, Trap or Capture. You can also play other cards: one Magic stuff, one Treasure, and as many Cheapshot as you want to help you. The dice determine the result of the challenge. If you succeed, you get the reward (gold, life points...). If you fail, you can lose life points, gains, cards... and maybe you will not be alone. Every player can interact during the turn of the others, using Cheapshots or Magic stuff.<br/><br/>When the draw pile is empty, one last turn is played. This is the final phase. Some cards can be played only at this moment &mdash; if you manage to keep them in your hand...<br/><br/>",

It's your only weapon in a world rife wtih monsters, necropunks, man-machine hybrids, gunslingers, and power-hungry politicos.  In Malifaux, you lead your crew in the battle for control of the Breach, a dark portal to a world of limitless magic.  Those who don't make it become monsters you must destroy.<br/><br/>Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game.  Players lead groups, called Crews, in skirmish attacks against their opponents in the magical realm of Malifaux.  Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux and pit these Crews against one another.  Masters, powerful practitioners of magic, and those fighting them control these Crews.<br/><br/>Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, and can change their own fates, through their control or theft of the powerful Soulstones in Malifaux.  A Crew conssists of a variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, who serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations.  In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew.  Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extension of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter.<br/><br/>How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determiens whether or not it will emerge victgorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew.  Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.<br/><br/>Malifaxu players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell casting.  Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome.  It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.<br/><br/>Be Prepared to fight to the death because Malifaux is the end of the line!<br/><br/>",

Whoever ends up with the most reputation wins the bet and the game.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player starts with a few randomly-dealt knowledge cards, with these cards corresponding to some of the eight legendary locations: Atlantis, Himalayas, the pyramids of Egypt, and so on. On a turn, a character moves to a location of their choice, spending time to do based on what shows on the game board. At each location, the player can either collect additional knowledge (i.e. cards, with the player collecting cards based on the method showing at the specific location) or discard cards that match this location in order to place a diary token in their color on this space; the more cards they discard, the more points they might possibly earn.<br/><br/>Those points are only possible points because four times during the 75 weeks, the Club members meet again in London to compare their knowledge about the legends, and because time is at a premium, only the five most promising stories can be told. What stories will these be? Well, in game terms, one of the places that players can visit while traveling is Club headquarters in London, and here players can drop cards that they've collected. During the scoring phase, these cards are shuffled, then five different locations revealed &mdash; and these five locations are the only ones that score. Thus, the more often you share knowledge about a particular location, the more likely it is to score &mdash; but the less valuable it will be for you since you cannot use that knowledge for your diary!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legends of Novus is a fantasy adventure game, placing you in control of a heroic character who is embarking on a journey across the mythical world of Novus in an effort to help rid the world of powerful creatures who are terrorizing the lands...<br/><br/>The game is designed for 1-5 players, ages 13+, and takes between 60 to 90 minutes to play (less for Solo play).<br/><br/>The game has a combination of a physical character sheet and card based equipment attached to it.  The variety of initial characters, and classes they can advance to make the game re-playable with a different game play experience each time.  The world story, and the ability to navigate the world with a free roam aspect (and no dice rolling controlling how far or where you can travel to), gives the players a strong sense of control over their fate.  The multiple paths to gaining XP also give the players a chance to explore different character strengths and game strategies in their goal to become a Legend of Novus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Build a team of amazing fictional and historical women to put escaped literary terrors back in their books! Can the Lady of Shalott defeat Dracula? Or Heidi and Ada Lovelace overcome a Kraken? Can Nzinga and Mary Seacole deal with the Martian Robots from War of the Worlds?<br/><br/>Library Labyrinth is a co-operative board game set in a cursed library that plays in about 45-60 minutes for 2-5 players and around 30 minutes as a solo game. The play space is a grid of 25 octagonal tiles that can rotate and flip, revealing (and changing) parts of the library. Some tiles spawn literary terrors, which players need to defeat by drafting different book cards from their hands. These book cards each feature a fictional or historical woman with a combination of six different skills. Team up different cards to defeat specific terrors, then travel through the library to place the terrors back on the correct shelves. The curse is still at work in the library, however, undoing your good work, so make sure that you don't run out of time or let the library become overwhelmed...<br/><br/>In more detail, on your turn you can pick up cards, trade cards, flip or rotate floor tiles, move down a lit path (as shown on the floor tiles), capture a terror, or put a terror back in the right shelf. You have three actions available with the option to donate one action to another player. After each player turn, a curse disturbance card is drawn, which disrupts the playing area by rotating a tile or spawning a new terror. When all six shelves have been filled with a captured terror, you win; if the deck of curse cards runs out or six terrors are left on the library floor before this happens, the game is lost.<br/><br/>Library Labyrinth is a quick game leading to ridiculous character mash-ups. Of course Alice in Wonderland and Marie Curie can deal with the Big Bad Wolf! The game can also scale between a game suitable for ten-year-olds and a fiendish puzzle. Floor tiles can be swapped out to make a harder grid, more difficult monsters can be used, or the amount of time can be reduced. Each game also comes with a booklet about the characters and the literary terrors in the game.<br/><br/>",

Players can maximize their points by capturing higher value Tiles, but also by collecting specific sets of Tiles worth extra bonus points. The expansion package Equilibrium adds additional opportunities to add points to one&rsquo;s score by gaining individual Equilibrium Cards.<br/><br/>Each round consists of two stages &ndash; one where each player secretly and simultaneously selects the Tiles he wants to capture &ndash; and another where players reveal their selection and interact. Be careful &ndash; Envyra is not a game of chance. The player that best anticipates his opponents&rsquo; moves and strategically adjusts in mid-play has the best chance to be the winner. The game ends when the End Tile is captured. Each player can try to end the game when it is most advantageous to him &ndash; at that moment he has the most points &ndash; making the game more dynamic and strategic. When the game ends, the player with the most points is the winner. If multiple players end with the same point total, the player who gained the most points through collecting specific sets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Torch is an The Europa Series covering the Allied invasion of Northwest Africa in November 1942 and the subsequent land campaign for control of Africa through May 1943. It is a two-player game, with one player controlling the American and British forces and the other the German and Italian forces.<br/><br/>The maps display the harsh terrain of French North Africa, from the wooded coastal region to the mountainous inland region into the sand dune and wadi infested wastelands of the Sahara Desert. The maps cover North Africa from the Safi-Casablanca region to Tripoli in Libya; they include the Allied and Axis base areas in Gibraltar, Southern Sardinia, and Western Sicily.<br/><br/>The counters represent the diverse forces engaged in North Africa: American, British, Free French, German, Indian, Italian, New Zealander, and Vichy French. Ground forces range in strength from armored divisions down to commando battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 50 aircraft; with both sides committing the best available aircraft, German Fw 190A's and Me 109G's fight for air superiority against British Spitfire IX's and American P-38G's.<br/><br/>The rules are the Europa rules for desert warfare; they are the same as the rules to Western Desert, with additions for the special features of Operation Torch. The rules cover the important elements of operations in Africa: armor effects, antitank abilities, supply considerations, air power, and shipping troops and supplies. Special operations in the campaign are covered in detail: parachute drops, amphibious landings, and commando actions. Political rules cover the volatile situation in French North Africa: the Vichy French army's response in North Africa can range from full co-operation with the Allies to determined resistance to the invasion.<br/><br/>Torch is playable by itself or in combination with the other Europa game on North Africa: Western Desert. In fact, the rules set, titled War in the Desert, provides the rules, charts, and orders of battle for the entire North African and Near Eastern theater of World War II. The rules link three Europa games - Western Desert, The Near East, and Torch - to show the struggle for this theatre from December 1940 through May 1943. A seperate rules set includes the instructions and orders of battle for playing Torch by itself.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    480 Die Cut Counters (Europa sheet #44, 45)<br/>    Two 20&quot; x 26&quot; Maps (Europa maps )<br/>    One War in the Desert Rules and Chart Set<br/>    One Operation Torch Rules and Chart Set <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.<br/><br/>The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.<br/><br/>The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.<br/><br/>There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.<br/><br/>",

All the guests have different personalities like the jerk, the flirt, the party animal, the wallflower, and the cool which causes them to have a different effect on the room they enter.<br/><br/>Meeple Party is a cooperative game of puzzle-solving strategy and party-throwing insanity for 1-5 players. As roommates in the house, you and your fellow players move guests by welcoming them and mingling them around the party to meet your photo opportunity goals. Each time you meet a photo opportunity, you take a photo! Photos keep the party going. Each photo moves the party time clock forward, and your goal is to get through the entire party without all roommates stressing out!<br/><br/>However, things could start spiraling out of control! Surprise guests start showing up! Potential disasters actually happen! Roommates take stress each time a disaster happens or when certain surprises come up. Once all roommates have reached maximum stress, becoming stressed out, the party immediately ends and you all LOSE! However, if roommates can successfully get through the party before stressing out, you all WIN! Will your party be the best ever?<br/><br/>Each player has special goals, but everyone wins or loses together.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disclaimer: This game is an unauthorized, non-profit game that uses names and images from the original movie by Warner Brothers. Neither the designer nor anyone else is allowed to make any financial profit from it.<br/><br/>About the game:<br/><br/>I hope you remember the great movie &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;. Cobb and his team of Extractors are offered a job to implant an idea into a person&acute;s mind by infiltrating his dreams. The target is Fischer and the client is Saito, who will profit greatly from Fischer's new &ldquo;idea&rdquo;. The reward: a lot of money and the chance for Cobb to return home to see his children. But to plant a thought deep enough into someone&acute;s mind, you&acute;ll have to go very deep. A dream within a dream&hellip; within another dream. And if you die in a dream, you&acute;ll end up in Limbo and probably go mad.<br/><br/>Guide Cobb and his team through the different dream levels. Recruit your team members and sedate Fischer in the waking reality. Step deeper into his dreams, plant Inceptions, and prepare for the final Kick that&acute;ll bring the team back home. Fight against attackers, Cobb's adversaries and Fischer&acute;s &ldquo;dream police&rdquo;. Cobb&acute;s wife Mal will show up and try to stop the team. And some of your team might end up in Limbo and have to be saved first before they can return to reality.<br/><br/>About the gameplay:<br/><br/>Inception is a solo (1-player) card game with a playing time of around 50 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each turn the player draws 2 cards to his hand. Some negative cards (Cobb&acute;s Flashbacks) apply immediately, while the others may be played in the &ldquo;Play cards&rdquo; step. Cards may be played in different ways. They may be discarded to use their one-shop effects. Weapon cards may be attached to a character to increase his strength against attacks. Other cards may be placed in a dedicated &ldquo;Convince Display&rdquo; from which they may be played when trying to convince opponents or to plant Inceptions. But the player should also keep some cards in his hand, to either react to new Events or boost his strength when defending against an attacker. These are the tactical choices that have to be made and that will determine success or failure.<br/><br/>An Event card is drawn from the Dream Level the Characters are currently in. You will have to evade attacks, convince people, plant Inceptions in Fischer&acute;s mind, and face other challenges. Team members might die, as in the movie, and have to be found in Limbo and convinced to come back with you.<br/><br/>To win the game, the final Inception on Fischer has to be successful, Mal must be dead, and Saito, Cobb, and enough members for the final Kick must still be alive.<br/><br/>Designed for the BGG Solitaire Print and Play Contest 2012.<br/><br/>Inception is available as Print and Play (see file section) via ArtsCow, Printerstudio (thanks Jay) as PC game (thanks David) and as Vassal module.

The railroads are the place to do it, and the American Southwest is booming, with robber barons starting and funding railroads across Texas and beyond. Savvy investments will pay off handsomely, others not so much. What sort of dividends should be paid versus how much should be kept by the railroad for further expansion? Each railroad president must decide for themselves, keeping the shareholders happy or being forced out in a hostile takeover.<br/><br/>In the luck-free game Southern Pacific, six railroads vie for dominance in Texas as they approach from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma in the 1800s. The selling of shares finances these railroads, with the president of each railroad auctioning stock, building new track, acquiring existing track from other companies, or paying dividends. &quot;Bull market&quot; auctions at the end of each round can unexpectedly disrupt a president's control of a company. The game ends when one railroad has built all of its track or all stocks have been acquired. A stock earns dividends during the game, but has no value in the final scoring. In the end, whoever has the most cash in hand wins.<br/><br/>",

It can be played competitively, cooperatively, or in solo mode. Each player plays a Nano, Jack, or Glaive. Each character is described with an adjective (&quot;I am a learned...&quot;), noun (&quot;...nano...&quot;), and verb phrase (&quot;...who rides the lightning&quot;).<br/><br/>Characters will explore one of the nine kingdoms of The Steadfast&mdash;or they may venture into the even stranger lands of the Beyond. Each kingdom is illustrated with a set of five region cards. Over the course of a quick five-round game, the characters will simultaneously explore the starting region on round 1, then continue out to the region on the far reaches of the kingdom. In a standard game of nine rounds, they'll then head back home on the other side of the card.<br/><br/>Each round, characters will choose how much time to spend performing actions with their five skills &mdash; scouting the wilderness, tinkering with cyphers and oddities, charming allies, combating creatures, and focusing on skill advancement &mdash; and then bid against the other heroes for the choicest cards. Each phase, a character can adventure in the town, where rewards are predictable and creatures not so dangerous. Or they can head out to the wilderness, where strange cyphers have unpredictable powers and the creatures look to bash you into oblivion.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simultaneous and every action is rewarded with victory points. Whoever has the most points at the end is the most legendary adventurer.<br/><br/>In co-op mode, characters can work together to defeat the creatures and garner the relics, but there's a catch: the wilderness is trying to kill the town. Cards flip off the wilderness deck, and the characters have to take them out before the creatures destroy the town locations and the relics and quests make it impossible for them to win. Or a character can go it alone in solo mode, which is like that except no one is there to help.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in the echoing tunnels of an ancient Dwarf Hold whose generations of ancestral tombs attract the Undead as much as they inspire the Dwarf defenders.<br/><br/>The game includes six scenarios, each of which uses the tiles provided with the game to create a different board. In each scenario you control a number of miniatures representing your warriors or minions, which you move across the board and use to fight your opponent's miniatures to achieve the scenario's objective. Each scenario builds on previous ones, culminating in a huge, desperate battle which will ultimately decide who controls the King's Hold<br/><br/>Dwarf King's Hold: Dead Rising includes 32 plastic figures: five Dwarf Ironclad Warriors, two Shieldbreakers, one Dwarf Mastiff, twelve Skeletons, ten Revenants and two Skeletal Hounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warsaw Rising Up 1945-1980 is a board game for 3-5 players, where participants take the roles of Polish urban planners, architects, engineers and builders &ndash; members of design and building studios functioning within the Bureau for the Rebuilding of the Capital. They face the challenges of restoring Warsaw destroyed during World War 2, bringing back the city&rsquo;s prestige and importance in the fields of administration, culture and industry.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to rebuild Warsaw after the war and develop the city. The players have to get concrete, use the materials acquired from the debris of the destroyed Capital and various social funds that were used in reality during the rebuilding of Warsaw. However, not only the reconstruction itself is important, but also the appropriate location of the objects on the city map and competent delegation of the members of one&rsquo;s studio to work. One of the several tactical elements of the game is managing the project cards and workers. Using their extra abilities may be the key which will benefit one player and make the work much harder for another. But even for a moment they should not forget about acquiring building materials from prefabricated elements and building new panel blocks.<br/><br/>The game covers the period of thirty-five years, so in subsequent stages many various tasks appear. They are related to political doctrines, tendencies in architecture as well as the general economical and developmental situation in Poland in the given period. But the most important feature of the game is that each time the players are able to rebuild Warsaw in a different way from this known from history. They decide whether the historical rebuilding plan will be realized and where &ndash; if at all &ndash; the Palace of Culture and Science will stand. The players also have an access to the plans that were never realized, both from the Six-Year Plan and later urban development concepts. The game includes a futuristic element, too &ndash; the players have plans of two subway lines at their disposal. Such plans actually existed in post-war Warsaw, but they were never realized due to economic problems. In this game it is possible.<br/><br/>",

This is part of Winsome's Essen 2010 set. (Taken from the Winsome Games homepage)<br/><br/>This game fixes many of the &quot;down-time issues&quot; with West Riding. The theme is again the United Kingdom during the Industrial Revolution.<br/><br/>Players follow the following turn squence to become the investor who has made the most money. The phases of a turn are: bid on shares, build track, trade shares (at two-to-one: two basic shares for a grouping share), pay dividends, and turn order. If the game ends, either by the game marker (a little wooden locomotive) reaching the end-of-game space OR if all six basic railways have the been finished. When the game is at its end, the Big Payoff begins, whereby players liquidate all of their holdings. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>This game did away with the crayon aspect of its predecessor. Cubes are used to show expansion links. Some stocks also begin in the hands of &quot;dummy&quot; players. This results in the game opening not quite being so wide open. There is an advanced game variant that provides a variable starting setup if the basic game's opening becomes too scripted.<br/><br/>The basic rail companies are: the Midland Railway (red), the London &amp; North Western Railway (black), the North Eastern Railway (brown), the Great Central Railway (blue), the Great Northern Railway (green), and the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway (yellow). There are eight of each of these shares. The grouping rail companies are: the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (orange) and the London, Midland, &amp; Scottish Railway (pink); both with 12 shares.

In this game you will take the role of a novice adventurer who will try, as they progress through epic adventures, to defeat the Great Dragon and take its mythical treasure with them. Of course, it won't be easy: both the enemies you meet and your own rivals will try to prevent you from doing so. Because there can only be one winner here... although you may all lose!<br/><br/>Cartaventuras is a narrative card game in which each game will write the story of your glory, or the Dragon's supper if you don't beat it. The same Dragon that terrorizes the Kingdom, yes, that one, the one with the priceless treasure.<br/><br/>Your starting equipment is like you: it has potential but is more pitiful than scary, so before you face the Dragon, you'd better go on some adventures first. You know other adventurers have found riches by defeating enemies, acquiring weapons and finding items or fragments of powerful relics that can forged. Sounds good, doesn't it? The problem is that those enemies won't want to give away their possessions voluntarily.<br/><br/>Each play is basically a tour across the Kingdom, with the map (the board, actually) being shaped randomly card by card. Each card includes a text and a picture describing an event; the development of the game will determine the narration of your hero's adventures.<br/><br/>When you're ready for the challenge, properly equipped and in the right mood, it'll be time to face the biggest and most dangerous monster in the kingdom: The Great Dragon, with capital letters, sharp teeth, impenetrable scales... and an eager desire to eat.<br/><br/>Manage your items cleverly, trade skilfully, plan your way well and go for it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>En Cartaventuras se unen la fantas&iacute;a, el humor y la narraci&oacute;n.

        "description": "The Men Who Would Be Kings is a set of rules designed for fighting historical or Hollywood colonial battles in the mid- to late-Nineteenth Century, from the Indian Mutiny to the Boxer Rebellion. Large scale colonial clashes tended to be one-sided affairs, but there are countless reports of brief, frantic skirmishes in every colonial war--where either side could be victorious--and these are the battles that The Men Who Would Be Kings seeks to recreate. Although focusing on the British colonial wars against the Zulus, Maoris, and others, these rules will also permit players to explore the empires of France, Germany, and other nations, as well as allowing for battles between rival native factions. Gameplay is very simple, and is driven by the quality of the officers leading your units, in the true spirit of Victorian derring-do and adventure, where larger than life characters such as the (real) Fred Burnaby and the (fictional) Harry Flashman led their troops to glory and medals, or to a horrible end at the point of a spear tip.<br/><br/>",

As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.<br/><br/>The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.<br/><br/>The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.<br/><br/>Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.<br/><br/>There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans. US Marines, Rangers and Armored Infantry, U-Boat Pens (complete with the plastic figurines and/or special rules).<br/><br/>The rules introduce a variety of simulation fidelity enhancements, such as Banzai and Kamikaze attacks for the Japanese player, a Fall of France rule, Peacetime Production rules for the US and USSR, etc.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Axis & Allies<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    World At War Expansion<br/>    World at War Update 2005 Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

Icarus was created to respond to the new challenges that this new way of life brings. Its goal: Investigate sensitive cases and undertake delicate operations.<br/><br/>Critical: Foundation &ndash; Season 1 is constructed like a television series, with each of the nine episodes taking 30 minutes to play. You can take on the role of Gamemaster, who directs the adventure, or play as one of the characters to put yourself in the story.

        "description": "In Trickdraw, you collect gold and call on allies to become the local hero (or villain!) of the mercantile town Trickdraw Junction.<br/><br/>Cards can be played two different ways. Face down as gold (worth 1 point), or face up to perform actions. With only 10 points to win, any card you draw is guaranteed to push you toward victory.<br/><br/>The real trick comes not in how you use your cards the first time but in how you REUSE them. As you play, you&rsquo;ll discover numerous ways to flip the cards in front of you. And whenever you flip a card face up, you can activate it again immediately!<br/><br/>You can also do the opposite. Flipping a spent card face down gives it new value as 1 point. This mechanic lets you find creative uses for your resources, giving all cards relative value. Your best card one turn may be better face down the next.<br/><br/>These tools allow for strong combos, sneaky plays, and cheeky bluffs. New strategy will emerge each time you play, and no game will feel quite like the last.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Ten years later, they are still undercover, but their minds have been twisted by the temptation of power, authority and money &mdash; and nobody is certain about their original roles anymore. Both groups learn that they have been infiltrated and want to ferret out the moles. Each mole has a secret code to lock their identity file, and once the code is cracked their identity is fully revealed. The battle of wits starts now. Either exposing the enemy or taking the chance to change the identity for good can save their lives as long as nobody knows who is who!<br/><br/>Internal Affairs is an intense elimination game between infiltrators from both the Triad and the Police Force Infiltrator. Each player has a set of secret ID cards which determine that player's allegiance. Each player also has a secret code, which when cracked reveals the player's real ID. At the beginning of the game, each player has five code cards and chooses three of them to be the secret code that locks the identity file. During their turn, players try to crack other players' codes to find out who is who and get their team to victory. Due to action cards, though, ID cards may be passed from player to player and this may change each player's allegiance. Players must be quick to win, as otherwise they may end up in the losing team when they least expect it.<br/><br/>Internal Affairs is designed for 5-8 players, but alternative rules have been included to allow for play with 2-4.<br/><br/>",

Your role is to lead humanity&rsquo;s charge into a bright new future.<br/><br/>Every player selects one of the four types of laboratories. You may play as a Government Lab, a Corporation Lab, a University Lab, or an Innovator Lab. Each one offers asymmetrical powers to use to your advantage.<br/><br/>While running the Lab, you will have the chance to purchase different Equipment made available every round. Your choice of equipment will be influenced by each piece&rsquo;s ability and its cost in funds. Your equipment will also indirectly affect your order of play during every round.<br/><br/>Most importantly, you will be able to use your funds to hire legendary inventors like Tesla, Marie Curie, or Einstein himself! Every inventor has their own unique abilities that might just give you the edge against your opponents.<br/><br/>Then you need to conceive of the right invention from the inventions offer by spending your most valuable resource, &ldquo;Ideas.&rdquo;<br/><br/>To complete each invention, you will need to spend the necessary scientific resources (physics, chemistry, or engineering) required by the particular invention. Use your lab assistants as workers and place them on the locations available to research and gather these resources. These locations can either be on your lab or with the inventors you and your opponents have placed on the board. Then, all you need to do is to find an available inventor to invent your invention. Unsurprisingly, you will need an engineer for an engineering invention and so on.<br/><br/>By completing inventions, you not only gain their unique instant ability, but you also advance humanity&rsquo;s progress in different tracks: Industrial, Economic, and Academic. The player whose laboratory contributes the most to society will be crowned the winner at the end of the game.<br/><br/>However, there is much more than meets the eye. You may gain secret victory points by cleverly placing inventions on the board and gaining Breakthrough Tokens, or gather experiments to fulfill. There is also the Ingenuity rank that affects most parts of the game where you may advance, but at a cost.<br/><br/>Experience a strongly replayable game with a different pattern of inventors and inventions created every time. Breaking News cards spice up the game by altering the rules of each round just a bit to make it more interesting.<br/><br/>Age of Inventors combines Worker Placement and Action Selection mechanics with an interesting blend of asymmetrical power use from your Lab and Inventors, and eventually tile placement of Inventors and Inventions. It is a fast and intense, highly replayable game that is equally enjoyable as a family game or as a competitive euro game for the most demanding gamer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Here's a game description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;For a brief period the Industrial Revolution burned so bright that Britain was known as the 'Workshop of the World.' This Ragnar Brothers' game recreates that dramatic time. Players establish their position on the map-board by investing in ports, heavy industries, textiles, light industries and crafts. Canal networks are built to connect the thriving towns. Expenditure is vast, but capital gains are greater. Next the railways are built and each player seeks to strengthen their industrial base. By game end, towns are linked from London to Wales, Scotland to the Channel ports. Wealth decides the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>And here's the game play described in more detail:<br/><br/>&bull; The game lasts two eras &ndash; the Canal Era and Railroad Era &ndash; with players earning money at the end of each era.<br/><br/>&bull; Before starting an era, players each reveal one of their two demand tokens to show which towns (ports, textile locations, etc.) have special value.<br/><br/>&bull; Each era lasts a number of rounds, and in each round players reveal town cards equal to the number of players, then hold an auction for turn order. Players choose towns in turn order, placing an Industry marker on that location, then optionally building links from that town, ideally forming a network of links that connects their Industries.<br/><br/>&bull; Once the town cards run out, the era ends. Players (may) reveal their second demand token, then they collect money equal to their revenue (earned by connecting Industries with links), the demand value of their Industries, and the value of their largest network of links, with token payment for any remaining links.<br/><br/>&bull; Between eras, the game is reset Amun-Re-style, with revenues being zeroed out and all links being cleared from the board.

Players shuffle and stack these tiles face down, revealing only the topmost tile.<br/><br/>To start the game, a two-square tile (one red, one green) is placed on the table. Players then take turns adding their topmost tile to the display. A tile can be placed (1) on the table with at least one edge adjacent to an edge in play or (2) on top of at least two tiles already in play. When placed on a higher level, each square of the tile must be supported, the tile must be level, and red and green squares cannot cover one another. (Every other color play &ndash; such as green on neutral or red on red &ndash; is legal.)<br/><br/>Once all tiles have been played, players count the scores of their zones, to find their best zone: number of squares in a contiguously connected area of their color times the height of the square in this area that is at the highest level. The player with the highest scoring zone wins.<br/><br/>Variant rules invite players to play with a hand of tiles that they refresh after each turn or to play with all tiles available at all time.<br/><br/>",

Players must capture tricks containing crucial courtiers and score the most points.<br/><br/>The suits, and the years on the timeline, are proportional to the lengths of the reign of each Queen, with Anne of Cleves being the shortest.<br/><br/>Players sit across from their partner and pass two cards face down to begin. Tricks are must-follow. Players win one point per trick, and any points on the cards in the trick. Four hands are played, and the team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced variant, three cards are added: the King and two Spies. The King card is the highest trump.<br/><br/>King Henry pursued Anne Boleyn for almost seven years before they were married. Those loyal to Catherine of Aragon did not accept Anne Boleyn, and considered King Henry&rsquo;s first wife the rightful Queen. Those loyal to Anne Boleyn saw her as the future, the young wife who would surely give the King a son.<br/><br/>The zero cards are spies, lowly servants that go unnoticed, working to undermine the rival side. They come in black (for Catherine of Aragon) and red (for Anne Boleyn),  but may reveal themselves as the 13 of the opposite suit.<br/><br/>There is also The Church of England, which is given to the team with fewer points after scoring. Once per hand, it can annul a trick that does not contain the King.<br/><br/>",

In the updated Risk, the Goal is to be the first player to complete 3 Objectives and be in control of your capital.<br/><br/>Capitals are player specific and deployed during intial troop setup. Cities add to territories when calculating for Troop draft and are placed during game setup in random or pre-determined location.

Territories printed on cards are only utilized for the random placement of Cities during initial setup.<br/><br/>Objectives and Rewards are broken down into minor and major categories. Minor Objectives include items such as Control Europe and Control 1 Enemy Capital. Major Objectives include items such as Take over 10 Territories in one Turn and Control 18 Territories.

It is the seventh game of the Great Battles of the American Civil War series which includes Pea Ridge, Drive on Washington, Wilson's Creek, Cedar Mountain, and Jackson at the Crossroads/Corinth.<br/><br/>The game is a simulation of the battle of Pleasant Hill, fought in Louisiana in April, 1864.  The Union Army was attempting to move up the Red River valley to Shreveport where it was overrun by a small Confederate force at Mansfield. The Union Army then retreated to nearby Pleasant Hill and took a defensive posture... on April 9, the Confederates attacked.<br/><br/>Each Game-Turn represents 20 minutes of real time, each hex covers about 125 yards from hexside to hexside, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun.<br/><br/>Included are a 22&quot;X34&quot; mapsheet, 200 counters, standard rules for the 'Great Battles' series, exclusive rules, and player charts and tables.<br/><br/>Not a simple game... there are more than 20 pages of rules which include extensive rules for cavalry, artillery and line-of-sight, morale, and fire and melee combat.<br/><br/>Victory is based on points earned by eliminating or demoralizing units and through capture of certain geographical objectives. The difference in points between the Union and Confederate players determine the level of victory.<br/><br/>",

Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.<br/><br/>Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the &quot;parts unknown&quot; pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive.

        "description": "Knockabout is an abstract board game where players are trying to push the other players' pieces off the hexagonal board.  The pieces are 4-, 6-, and 8-sided dice which move in a straight line as far as the number on their top face.  Whenever a die gets hit by other pieces (friendly or otherwise), the last die to move as a result of the collision gets rerolled. Pieces knocked into the outer ring are eliminated from the game, but still can prevent future pieces from being knocked into the same spot.  The first player to knock five out of his opponent's nine pieces into the outer ring wins.<br/><br/>The game is mostly a mixture of attempting to maneuver ones pieces into strong positions, gently bumping them to get high numbers, and sabotaging the opponents' positions so their pieces have more limited movement.<br/><br/>",

The game begins with each player drawing a &lsquo;hand&rsquo; of five tiles (numbered from 0 to 9). Players then take turns placing their numbered tiles on the board so that the sum&mdash;of row(s) and column(s)&mdash;is equal to a multiple of the &quot;Multile&quot; number (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) which has been randomly selected for that round. Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions. Once all the tiles have been placed, players are docked points for any tiles they have not used; highest score wins.<br/><br/>The red &quot;Multiles&quot; were introduced in the 1968 edition; the previous (1964) edition didn't have those, and is played as if the &quot;5&quot; Multile were always the one drawn.<br/><br/>",

The player whose stock of jewels has the highest value wins the game.<br/><br/>Every player has a set of 12 cards, each card showing a character the player can impersonate. Each of the characters has a special ability which can be used (the diamond dealer, for example, can buy diamonds twice, the pickpocket steals a coin from the richest player etc.). Although all of the players try to gather as many jewels as possible, these cannot be collected easily as they have to be purchased with coins first.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the player cannot play any character during his turn. After this the jewels which have been collected are counted. Players score one point for each diamond and five points for each ruby they gathered.<br/><br/>From the English rules:<br/>It is a time of intrigues over the marquis' domain. The Prosecutor, the extortioner and the countess covet the invaluable jewels of each other. To buy jewels at the best price, players will have to continuously impersonate new characters. Choose wisely between the 11 roles available and fortune will change hands relentlessly. But do not forget that money is only a mean to achieve your goal. At the end, the title of &ldquo;Marquis&ldquo; will go the one with the fullest jewel case. So be cautious!<br/><br/>Forget &ldquo;Noblesse oblige&ldquo;, now play catch as catch can.

Organise your carriage as best as you can by properly placing passengers, offering them services and paying attention to their individual preferences. Prove that you are the right person to manage the Skyline Express!<br/><br/>Skyline Express is an easy entry family board game. On your turn pick a passenger from the waiting line and place them in your carriage. Sounds easy, right? Not necessarily. In order to win you need to concentrate and control the constantly changing situation on the board. Observing the actions of other players, adjusting your strategy to the current round and making sure you fill individual passengers' preferences shows that becoming a manager of an aerial train is not an easy task.<br/><br/>The game uses familiar mechanisms such as pattern building, set collection, tile placement and action selection and merges them into a fun experience for everyone! It&rsquo;s sure to appeal to fans of games such as Azul, Sagrada and Reef.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most victory points after 3 rounds. At the end of every round each player sums up all the points they earned in 3 different ways:<br/><br/>GOALS<br/>SERVICES<br/>PERSONAS<br/><br/>On their turn players pick a passenger from the current waiting line to then place in their carriage. Additionally, the player may also perfom actions and aquire SERVICE tiles.<br/><br/>There are 6 types of passengers in the game. For example, one passenger is considered a PERSONA and has a specific preference tile that goes along with them. The Preference tile indicates where the PERSONA would like to be seated and what passengers they&rsquo;d like to sit with. Fulfill the Persona's preferences and earn big points!<br/><br/>Every round has 2 GOALS that give victory points if fulfilled.<br/><br/>For every full compartment players receives a ticket token. Once they've acquired 2 ticket tokens they can then spend them to buy a SERVICE tile. A SERVICE tile gives victory points for every pair of passengers of the types shown on the tile.<br/><br/>A round ends once all passengers from the Main Hall have been placed in the players' carriages. Players sum up their victory points and the next round begins with new passengers filling up the Main Hall. The game ends after the scoring phase of round 3. The player with the most victory points becomes the manager of the Skyline Express.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The combat rules have been simplified for faster play, and the scale has been increased to 1/60th making a lot of the calculations and movements easier.<br/><br/>Part of the Car Wars Series, 5th Edition is not a single book, but rather a collection of comic-book sized books.  Any of the Division sets (see below) is enough to get started.  As of early 2009 there are still not official construction rules for 5th Edition, rather each book  in the series has a number or pre-designed cars.  However, in the online Car Wars forums at Steve Jackson Games' website, there are un-official but reliable vehicle construction rules posted and available for those who wish &quot;make their own&quot; autoduel cars.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "No Honor Among Thieves is a competitive/cooperative game for three to six players, in which each player assembles a crew of thieves and sets out to see who can steal the most from the rich and powerful of the kingdom.<br/><br/>Each player is the head of their own crew, which consists of different character cards recruited from an array of thieves available for hire. These characters are then sent on heists to try and overcome defense cards in front of objectives, using their different sets of skills to bypass guards, traps and walls to get to the filthy lucre that they're after. Players not involved in the heist will, of course, try and stop the thieves in their tracks by playing Scheme cards, which represent the quirks of fate which might cause a heist to fail--unexpectedly alert guards, City Watch patrols, or the simple mistake that leads to disaster.<br/><br/>Staging a heist alone is difficult, but working together with other players leaves you open to betrayal by your so-called allies, or gives you the chance to betray them, and take it all for yourself. Once any player has been betrayed, the game changes, and more dangerous abilities on different cards can now be played. The Assassin begins killing other characters, the Pickpocket starts stealing from players, the Fall Guy takes the blame, and the whole table becomes a little more vicious. Thieves like to believe they have a code of honor, but once that illusion is broken, there is no going back.<br/><br/>What will you risk to be the richest and cleverest thief in this city of rogues?<br/><br/>",

The last galactic emperor has met with a sudden and quite fatal accident. Now there is a power vacuum in the galaxy, and you're one of the Planetary Dukes who wants to fill it.<br/><br/>Based on the award-winning Galactic Emperor game, this completely new experience gives each of 2-4 players one of 30 asymmetric powers and control of their own throne and sector of the galaxy. Using a unique action selection system, the game plays over several rounds, and within each round, the roles players choose determine what happens next. There are seven different roles: Explorer, Merchant, Steward, Engineer, Scientist, Warlord, and Regent. All players get a turn to act during each role, so the game is fast paced and everyone is always playing. Combat is thrilling and daring using a unique combat system.

One game takes about 60-120 minutes to play.<br/> Many years have passed since the devastating nuclear war destroyed great civilizations and changed the climate on the planet dramatically. The world was turned into a desert with but lonely radioactive ruins of cities left. Massive usage of biological and nuclear weaponry during the war led to many people and animals being turned into horrifying monsters.<br/><br/>Few survivors who managed to make it through &quot;The Last War&quot; have joined together in clans and established the small settlements in this new world.<br/><br/>In Badlands you&rsquo;ll lead a small community of post-nuclear survivors struggling for their lives. You will have to undertake distant expeditions and explore abandoned locations. Develop trade and attack your enemies, protect your settlement and fight for influence to secure your corner in the ruthless world of Badlands!<br/><br/>(Espa&ntilde;ol)<br/>&quot;Badlands&quot; es un juego de mesa estrat&eacute;gico en un mundo post- apocal&iacute;ptico, para 2 a 4 jugadores de 14+ a&ntilde;os y una duraci&oacute;n de la partida en torno a 60 a 120 minutos.<br/><br/>Han pasado muchos a&ntilde;os desde que una devastadora guerra nuclear destruy&oacute; las grandes civilizaciones y cambi&oacute; dram&aacute;ticamente el clima del planeta. El mundo se ha convertido en un desierto en el que de las ciudades solo quedan ruinas radioactivas. El uso masivo de armamento nuclear y biol&oacute;gico durante la guerra ha convertido tanto a gente como a animales en horribles monstruos.<br/><br/>Los pocos supervivivientes que consiguieron sobrevivir a &quot;La &uacute;ltima guerra&quot; se agrupan en clanes y peque&ntilde;os asentamientos en este nuevo mundo.<br/><br/>En Badlands liderar&aacute;s una peque&ntilde;a comunidad de supervivientes post-apocal&iacute;pticos luchando por sus vidas.

Each game turn represents one month. Each hexagon on the map represents 12.5 miles (20 km). There are two scenarios, short (May-November 1941) and long (May 1941 to November 1942). Afrikakorps is a two-player game of intermediate complexity. The rules contain about 15,000 words, meaning experienced players can finish the short scenario in about four hours. Solitaire play is doable.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: high command bulletins, unit refits, supply, fog of war, pursuit and pursuit combat, fortified boxes, airpower, naval bombardment and transport, unit upgrades, off-map bases, major operations, special forces and tactics, coastal shipping, battlefield salvage, appeals to Berlin, capture of the Western Desert Force headquarters, amphibious landings, the Qattara Depression, port interdiction, anti-aircraft fire, air transport, aerial supply, airborne assault, oases, reconnaissance, heavy armor, 88s, and Malta. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Planning Phase<br/><br/>II. Reinforcement &amp; Refit Phase<br/><br/>III. Operations Phases<br/><br/>A. First Operations Phase<br/><br/>1 Movement Sub-Phase<br/><br/>2. Combat Sub-Phase<br/><br/>B. Second Operations Phase<br/><br/>C., D., Etc. Subsequent Operations Phases<br/><br/>IV.

Each clan is composed of one player giving orders (the King) and another one trying to understand which order has been given (the Warchief).<br/><br/>To give an order, the King chooses a card and flips it onto the table to reveal two orders on its back, with no clue as to which is the right one. The Warchief checks the battlefield, then tries to choose the right order with a card in hand. When both clans have chosen their cards, all of them are revealed, and if both cards match on a clan, then the order is carried out. Some examples of orders: loading the catapult, firing with the catapult, progressing toward the Queen, looking at hidden cards in the middle to find the Queen, and avoiding traps...<br/><br/>Of course, within a clan it is absolutely prohibited to make any sign or say anything to help the partner to guess which order is intended.<br/><br/>When playing 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-2, the game is a bit different: The single player team cannot play the same order twice, one turn after another.<br/><br/>With multiple copies of Goths Save The Queen, you can compete in a 3-vs-3, 3-vs-4 or 4-vs-4 format.<br/><br/>",

Created by award-winning designer John Prados, and using the same scale and game system as his earlier Campaigns of Robert E. Lee, this game focuses on the critical, but largely ignored actions in Kentucky, Tennessee and northern Georgia between 1861 and 1863.  The game includes 560 die-cut counters and two stunning maps depicting the 'heartland.'  You also get two army display sheets, a 32 page rulebook with 8 pages of charts and tables and 9 scenarios covering the major engagements.  A campaign game scenario covering the whole crucial year of 1863 is also included to allow players to explore the options available to both sides.&quot;<br/><br/>Game Scale<br/>Units: Divisions, brigades and regiments<br/>Ground: One hex = roughly 5 1/4 miles<br/>Time: One turn = 5 days (in Winter, 10 days)<br/><br/>Contents<br/>560 Die-Cut Counters<br/>Two 34 inch by 22 inch Game Maps<br/>Rulebook with Scenarios, Historical Analysis, plus Charts and Tables<br/>Two Army Organization Displays<br/>Nine scenarios plus an 1863 Campaign scenario<br/>Two Dice<br/>Over 90 Leaders, each individually rated for his Initiative, Administrative, and Tactical Abilities<br/><br/>",

Wait -- what's that noise??<br/><br/>In The Nacho Incident, players are trying to make the most money by smuggling Mexican food into Canada. They must evade the Mounties and choose the most profitable combination of smuggler, food and destination.<br/><br/>Smugglers are ranked by number, and each turn all players select one from their hand and reveal them simultaneously. High numbers act first and have greater smuggling options available to them, but also attract the attention of the Mounties. After crossing the border, smugglers set up cantinas to finance further smuggling operations -- but these cantinas will be shut down as the Mounties discover them.<br/><br/>After 12 turns of smuggling (about 30-45 minutes), the player with the most money wins!<br/><br/>",

Players roll four dice and must assign each of them to one of the four places on the adventure sheet (Movement, Enemies, Treasures, and Locations).<br/><br/>MAP &ndash; One die must be used to explore the map. Each side of the die allows the player to shade in a certain shape of hexes on the map. When a number is shaded in in front of location, the player may attempt to battle the enemy there and secure the treasure that resides there.<br/><br/>ENEMY &ndash; One die is also used to increase the power of an enemy. You must choose to either make the enemy have more health or deal more damage. So as the game progresses your foes will gain in power, so you need to balance how powerful you want them to get with how big the treasure horde is there.<br/><br/>TREASURE &ndash; Another die is used to increase the size of a treasure horde by shading in the next square in the corresponding treasure. All sorts of helpful items can be had including swords, shields, and potions, but sometimes moving down the treasure track will add obstacles like traps or locks.<br/><br/>LOCATION- The fourth and final die is used to increase the power level of a location. This both increases the amount of gold there and the power of the enemy. Whenever a star is shaded in on the location tracker you must shade in a box on the enemy residing there.

While the northern group of armies (Army Group North) pushed towards Leningrad in a war of rapid maneuver its 16th Army covered the flank in the Lake Ilmen &ndash; Valday Hills area. Here, fighting began to settle down in early fall 1941 and by January had become static. Then the Soviets attacked. By late January the Soviet 11th Army had broken the German front in several sectors and threatened to surround perhaps 70,000 Germans around Demyansk. When 3rd Shock Army broke the southern wing of German 16th Army Soviet advances threatened now to destroy 16th Army and open the flank to Leningrad. It is at this stage that game-play begins.<br/><br/>Demyansk Shield recreates the World War II campaign in the Valday Hills region of Russia, from late January 1942 through May 1942. One player will control the Axis forces (Germans), while his opponent controls the Soviet forces (Russians). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play.

        "description": "The feather party starts! In the card game Samoa, each player gets their own mask, but ownership of the masks is secret. The players collect feathers on the beach to decorate the masks as beautifully as possible. In the end, the most colorful masks are worth the most points.<br/><br/>The players play colored or black cards to the five masks. They don't know which mask belongs to whom, but they are trying to deduce that information. If they guess correctly, they receive bonus points. If the owner of a mask is correctly guessed by everyone, then that player loses.<br/><br/>In turn, the active player reveals a card from the deck and places it above or below a mask. As soon as a mask has five feather cards, points are awarded. However, only at the end of the round will the owners of these points (and the masks) be identified. The game lasts for three rounds, so if you don't score in a round, you will get two additional chances.<br/><br/>The elements water, fire, and air influence the party. Sometimes the sea brings additional feathers, while the wind in combination with a campfire could burn a feather.<br/><br/>Decorate the masks on the island, mask yourself, and press your luck!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Britain and Operation Sea Lion<br/><br/>After the defeat of France in the spring of 1940, Britain alone remained in the war against German aggression. Follow-ing their triumph on the continent, the Germans organized and trained their forces for the campaign they hoped would win the war: the invasion and conquest of Britain. With the British army only slowly recovering from the tremendous loss of equipment it suffered during its hasty evacuation from France, the defense of Britain lay with the Royal Navy and, especially, with the Royal Air Force. For if the German Luftwaffe could drive the RAF from the skies of southern Britain, then the German armies would have a fair chance of crossing the English Channel and bringing the sparsely-equipped British ground forces to battle.<br/>Their Finest Hour is a two-player game recreating the military situation facing Britain and Germany in the summer and fall of 1940. At 16 miles per hex, the maps cover the entire British Isles plus northern France and western Norway. Each player controls the air, naval, and ground forces committed to the invasion or defense of Britain. Air units are based on groups of about 40 aircraft; naval units represent flotillas of destroyers and individual capital ships and cruisers; ground units are scaled at divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. The rules use the basic Europa game mechanics as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in detail.<br/><br/>This box contains the following game components:<br/><br/>    two 21 x 27 maps<br/>    1,200 die-cut counters<br/>    a complete set of rules<br/>    chart set<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/>Playing Time: up to 6 hours<br/>Number of Players: 2 players<br/>Complexity: Master<br/><br/>Original Design: Marc W.

        "description": "A frightening virus, Virus Q, is spreading in the major cities of the planet. Infected people and animals change rapidly, becoming horrible bloodthirsty and almost unstoppable creatures. Our only hope is to find the zero patient and the place where everything originated. There, perhaps, we can find an antidote and return the hope to the dying humanity.<br/><br/>But not everyone agrees. There are those who want to take advantage of the chaos and terror in order to gain power and establish a new form of government, trying to maneuver and control the monsters generated by the virus. A cure would ruin their plans forever.<br/><br/>The virus was created in a secret military lab, in a space that's practically inaccessible. Inside, Virus Q spread for the first time, accidentally, maybe; the creatures that now inhabit the Lab are difficult even to imagine...<br/><br/>In the innovative lab crawler game Virus, players are the team that infiltrates the Lab looking for the antidote to Virus Q. They will collect the few and fragmentary bits of information scattered in the laboratory, avoiding or fighting the monsters that populate it.<br/><br/>The map generation and the movement/placement of monsters depends on the player actions with a semi-automatic mechanism controlling what takes place where. The fighting requires some dexterity elements as well as players must plan their tactics by combining their shooting power with available movement, achieving successes by rolling cubes.<br/><br/>Also, the game takes place in real time!<br/><br/>In sum, you can play Virus cooperatively, semi-cooperatively or competitively. The &quot;infiltrator&quot; option makes the game even more exciting and unpredictable!<br/><br/>",

Gameplay passes from person to person until one player or team has collected three sets of matching park tiles in front of them.<br/><br/>Memories captures a depth of strategy in player abilities which can be activated by finding matches of PARKS resource icons when you reveal tiles. There are a variety of ways to enjoy the game. Play a head to head game, or on teams. Expand the grid size for a bigger challenge, or simplify the game to a memory game without player abilities for younger gamers.<br/><br/>PARKS Memories: Coast to Coast is one of three editions of PARKS Memories, highlighting the national parks in the United States with exceptional bodies of water in them.

        "description": "Palago is a tile placement game in which players strive to form closed groups of their colour. Two players, White and Blue, share a common pool of 48 hexagonal arch tiles. Each tile contains a white arch and a blue arch, and may be oriented in three ways such that the corner colours are the same for each rotation.<br/><br/>White starts by placing two adjacent tiles, then players then take turns adding two adjacent tiles such that edge colours match neighbouring tiles.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who forms a surrounded island of their colour containing at least one arch. If a move forms winning groups for both players, then the mover loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the summer of 1914, Germany&rsquo;s East Asia cruiser squadron&rsquo;s superbly-trained crews of long-service professionals made Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's small fleet the envy of the China station. But when war broke out, this tiny force found itself far from home and threatened by the powerful Japanese navy, many times the size of the German squadron. Spee decided to force his way home around the world. After an epic journey across the Pacific, his cruisers met their end off of the Falkland Islands in a final battle.<br/><br/>Cruiser Warfare gives the Great War at Sea series its greatest scope yet: the entire world. British, German, Japanese, Italian, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Dutch ships begin as they did in August 1914. The German player must disrupt Allied commerce and try to get the cruisers home if at all possible. The Allied player must track them down and destroy them before they can wreak havoc.<br/><br/>Cruiser Warfare&rsquo;s map divides the world into sea areas, with modified search rules allowing German and Austrian ships to look for prey, and Allied ships to hunt them. Once contact is made, combat is resolved using the standard game rules.<br/><br/>Cruiser Warfare: Final Edition comes in our popular Playbook format and includes the playing pieces from the first edition (we had several hundred of each in storage), a new map, new full-color play aids, and an all-new book with revised rules and scenarios, additional scenarios plus historical background.<br/><br/>Cruiser Warfare: Final Edition is a complete game: everything you need to play (except dice) is included in the Playbook.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer, translation courtesy of BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>Trapper is an adventurous family game for 2-4 trappers from 10 years old, in which players gather tiles lying on the table. Trapper is suited especially well for two players.<br/><br/>Players are trappers in the Canadian wilderness, catching wild animals in the forests and lakes and searching for fungus and herbs. You ship your prey in canoes. As soon as one of your canoes is full, you sell the goods at the market. Both in the gathering of your prey and in the filling of your canoes, you need clever plans and foresight. Who will make the most valuable captures? The winner is the player who possesses the most money.<br/><br/>The game offers two different versions: A basic version in which luck plays a larger share and a somewhat more demanding version for tactically-minded players.<br/><br/>The basic game of Trapper is a simple game in the style of Verflixxt and Celtica that's suitable for a wide target audience. Good luck and tactics are about equal on the scales.<br/><br/>The somewhat more demanding version offers more tactical possibilities. How should one advance with the animal gathering? Which is more lucrative, getting a few larger and very valuable canoes or bringing many small canoes with different species to the market? Both strategies can lead to success.<br/><br/>",

However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!

Joined by the Druids of the Welsh isle of Mona, the British rebels defeated the Roman Ninth Legion and razed Britain's two largest cities, Londinium and Camulodunum. <br/>But the Roman governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, marshalled two legions and processed to destroy a Briton force ten times its size, destroying the revolt.  Boudicca disappeared from history, probably taking poison.  As for Paulinus, his repression in the aftermath was so severe that Tacitus, in his famed phrase, described it as &quot;making a desert and calling it peace.&quot;<br/><br/>Druid is a vivid simulation of Boudicca's Rebellion, a fast-paced board wargame of Ancient &quot;guerilla warfare.&quot;  Barbarian and Roman players battle across first-century Britain, burning villages and sacking towns.  The undisciplined Britons are initially strong, but must rally the disparate tribes of the island in revolt against the well-trained legions of Imperial Rome.  The Roman forces begin as weak, but can call on powerful reinforcements.  The Britons must hit cities and melt into the vast forests of the island where they cannot be found by Rome's legionaries. A wealth of &quot;chrome&quot; rules make the game interesting and provide repeated play value; rules are provided for tribal revolts, hidden deployment, legion activation, Druid invocation, and berserk units.  <br/>An unusual wargame on an unusual topic, Druid proves the claim that some of history's least known conflicts can make some of its best games.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Boudicca: The Warrior Queen<br/><br/><br/>",

What makes it bigger is a larger board, Train Depots, Skyscrapers, 9 new Properties, and the addition of the $1,000 bill. It is faster because of a new speed die and Bus cards. Monopoly: The Mega Edition can be played in 1&frac12; hours with more fun than ever!<br/><br/>The massive game board has 12 additional spaces, including 9 new properties. You'll be able to buy, for the first time: California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Arctic Avenues, plus the Gas Company. Each joins an existing group.<br/><br/>Buy all the properties of a group, build your houses and hotels, and then keep on going by building Skyscrapers for a chance to earn &quot;mega&quot; rents. Good news: you can build houses and hotels once you own three out of four properties in a group (or two out of three in the smaller groups). You can even build a Depot on a railroad to double its rent.<br/><br/>Start play with $2500, including a $1,000 bill.<br/><br/>Roll three dice on your turn: two regular dice and the special &quot;Speed&quot; Die. The Speed Die gives you a chance for free trip to the next unowned property. (Later in the game the Speed Die could send you to the next property you owe rent on. Ouch!) From time to time you'll earn free &quot;Bus Tickets.&quot; Use them to go where you want to go, but beware: they expire! The Speed Die and the Bus Tickets make the action speedy, intense, and sure-fire fun!<br/><br/>",

Each player has a dry erase board and marker on which to draw their tattoos. The &quot;customer&quot; chooses five cards, containing tattoo elements that should be included in their tattoo, then the &quot;tattoo artists&quot; have three minutes to ask the customer questions and create their tattoo. After the three minutes are up, each player reveals their tattoo to the group and pitches their tattoo to the customer. The customer awards each individual element card to the person who used it best/most creatively. The player with the most cards after every player has drawn twice wins.<br/><br/>",

The God of Nature provides abundant resources year after year, and the grace from nature spreads to the ground through the running rivers.<br/><br/>People view the resources in the river as &quot;Nature's Bounty&quot;. People move along the river with alpacas to collect enough resources, ideally returning to the village with enough resources to start a prosperous year.<br/><br/>In 12 Rivers, players lead one of four tribes and take turns sending warriors to climb the mountain. The warriors camp near the river to collect Nature's bounties and bring these resources to villagers in need. Warriors can collect more valuable bounties if they move toward the origin of the river, but more camp tools have to be paid as well. After five rounds, the bounties to the villagers will be scored for players based on the rarity.<br/><br/>",

One player begins by placing a card or cards of the same value from their hand onto the table face-up to create a discard pile. The other players in turn must place onto the discard stack a card or cards of the same value that match(es) or exceed(s) the value of the top card of the stack; or else, pick up the stack. Until the draw pile is gone, players must draw at the end of their turns to maintain a hand of at least three cards.<br/><br/>All of a player's hand cards must be played before any of their face-up table cards, which must in turn be played before any of their face-down table cards.

Above all, they begin our favorite fairy tales.<br/><br/>Fairy Tales, the debut game of the StoryLine series, invites you to craft your own original fairy tales beginning with that remarkable phrase &quot;Once upon a time&quot;. In this fanciful card game, three to eight players craft a story together with each player contributing characters, places, objects, and events to the narrative.<br/><br/>StoryLine: Fairy Tales is a collaborative storytelling game that encourages players to play cards to add to the story and embellish on them. Each round a player is the narrator and ask the other players for a specific type of card such as an object or location to add to the story. All other players select one of these cards from their hand, then the narrator chooses the one they like most and awards that player a point. At the end of the story, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Not to be confused with the Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada accessory)<br/><br/>The galaxy is engulfed in terrible conflict. Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. Armada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.<br/><br/>Take control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:<br/><br/>Federation of Sol<br/>Sardakk N'orr<br/>Barony of Letnev<br/>Emirates of Hacan<br/><br/>Each ship is a die-cut counter that you move by &quot;flipping&quot; (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.<br/><br/>Overall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.<br/><br/>Another note of interest, when the Star Trek Red Alert! game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.<br/><br/>The Twilight Imperium: Armada – Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need. The Twilight Imperium: Armada – Incursion introduces several new elements to the game, such as missiles, new squadron types, new technology, new ships, and new crew.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Armada – Stellar Matter<br/>    Twilight Imperium: Armada – Incursion<br/><br/><br/>",

A bead of sweat trickles down your forehead as you release the block, and then, the moment of truth. The tower sways for a second, then rights itself. It&rsquo;s going to stay standing, at least for now. Although most of you are working as a team, one player is a Traitor trying to make the tower fall.<br/><br/>In Crazy Tower, players work together to get rid of their blocks and build a safe, stable structure. All of them, except for one that is. One player takes on the role of the Traitor, looking to deviously make a building that will collapse on another player&rsquo;s turn. Will they succeed, or will the Tower stand the test of time? Either way, you can bet it&rsquo;s going to be crazy!<br/><br/>On a turn, players can either place a block on the highest floor of the tower or place a new Floor and then add a block to that floor. A block may only ever be added to the highest Floor and must be laid following the instructions on the Floor. If the team successfully places their final piece on the Tower, they win the game, but if it falls and it&rsquo;s not on the Saboteur&rsquo;s turn, then they win.<br/><br/>",

Long aware of German plans, the Soviets were ready and waiting, with heavily fortified lines backed by 3,600 tanks of their own.<br/><br/>Kursk - South Flank is a stand-alone game in the Panzer Grenadier series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 40 scenarios. Design is by Panzer Grenadier veteran Mike Perryman (Workers and Peasants among many others).<br/><br/>In this game the German SS Panzer Corps assaults the lines of the Soviet 40th Army, only to meet fierce counter-attacks from the Sixth Guards Army and First Tank Army. Pieces include masses of tanks: Lend-Lease Grants, T-34 tanks in three models, T-70 light tanks and more. The SS counter with Tigers, mobile artillery and a whole lot more.<br/><br/>There are four semi-rigid mapboards, just like those found in August 1914 or 1940: The Fall of France.<br/><br/>",

It is going to be an epic battle for bragging rights and fireworks as you compete with one another to see who will have the most money at the end of the week!<br/><br/>Lemonade Stand is played over seven turns (days), and each turn players start by turning over a forecast card which shows the weather forecast for the day along with number of customers and the price they will be willing to pay for each possible weather outcome. Players then place a 5, 10 or 15 cent price card down along with any signs or lemonade inventory they want to put out, all face down. All players reveal their cards at the same time and then a new forecast card is revealed which has an arrow pointing to one of five spots on the old forecast card, which determines which weather event occurred. Each player then collects money based on their price and # of glasses of lemonade invested versus the actual weather that happened.<br/><br/>Money is gained or lost, and play continues for seven rounds. Most money wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  <br/>   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cornish Smuggler allows players to assume the roles of Smugglers in 18th Century Cornwall. Buying and selling goods for gold while employing a network of local characters, secret knowledge, hidden locations, bribes, dirty tricks and a healthy dose of cunning to evade the attentions of the customs officers and the other players.<br/><br/>When selling goods, players can choose how much to sell them for; making a choice to either increase their reputation and influence in the community by selling cheaply, or maximising their profit by getting the best price possible.  An increased reputation allows a player to transport their contraband more easily and evade customs, but to win the game they must have the most gold out of all the other players.  However, the higher the price goods are sold for, the stronger the customs forces become&hellip;<br/><br/>Smuggling in Cornwall was rarely performed by just one person; rather large swathes of the community were often involved.  In Cornish Smuggler, players must build a smuggling network by employing characters; each with a unique ability, cost and affect on a smugglers reputation within the local community.<br/><br/>When smuggling goods, the choice of which goods to buy is key. Players can choose to buy big bulky goods, which are hard to fit on board ship (goods and ships are all different shapes and sizes) or smaller more easily transported goods which are worth far less.<br/><br/>Also, different sized  towns will offer different prices for goods.  Smaller towns offer a lower price, but with a lower risk.  Larger towns offer better prices and allow smugglers to sell more goods, but the risk of do so is (generally) much greater.<br/><br/>The customs forces in Cornish Smuggler will move around the board dependant on what the players do.  Landing, moving and selling goods merits their attention although players can also move customs by spending influence or utilising secrets.  Luckily all Customs can be bribed  meaning that once you've bought them they will remain 'your man' until the end of the game...or until another player pays them more.<br/><br/>Although starting off fairly underfunded and under supported, as the game progresses the Customs Officers will get steadily stronger, harder to bribe and more numerous.  As such, it gets harder and harder to smuggle goods effectively, secretly and profitably so each game has a clearly defined end point that is visible to all players<br/><br/>Discovering secret tricks can help a players cause, and there are secret storehouses that can be hired out where you can stash your goods, hiding them from Customs and protecting them from being seized.<br/><br/>There are many possible paths to victory in Cornish Smuggler.  Players will have to adapt their strategy to accommodate the actions of the other players, employ the right characters, buy the right goods, discover the right secrets and make the right deals.<br/><br/>This game is about real things that happened to real people in a real place, thus creating a directly relatable experience between 21st Century Cornwall and Cornwall at a time when the community was experiencing significant poverty and exorbitant taxation.  As a result, smuggling wasn&rsquo;t necessarily seen as something that was illegal, but rather as something that was &lsquo;fair game&rsquo; and as such was taken with an often light hearted view.<br/><br/>What this game is:<br/><br/>Dodging the Law, employing the local vicar, building an network, discovering and using secrets, renting out the mayor's wine cellar, getting rich, a surprisingly accurate historical representation.<br/><br/>What this game isn't:<br/><br/>Ship racing, firing cannons, being a pirate<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two. Nevertheless, this war was vital to the final Allied victory in the Pacific, and even more so to the impact this war would have on the post-war world. Many &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; could have dramatically changed the world. What if China had surrendered in 1937 and over a million Japanese soldiers would be free to overrun India. There would be no Flying Tigers or Doolittle's Raid, or even Pearl Harbor. If Japan could have mobilized Chinese manpower, the world as we know it might not exist.<br/><br/>War of the Suns (WotS) was first designed by Leonard To, a Hong Kong native, more than 20 years ago. It won the championship of the First Wargame Design Competition in Hong Kong in 1984. The game has since been updated in the early 90's, and extensively again during the last 3 years. Offering exclusive research based on recently opened Chinese archives, as well as many Japanese and English sources, has made War of the Suns one of the most painstakingly researched and accurate games of its type ever made.<br/><br/>The title of the &mdash; &quot;War of the Suns&quot;, refers to the flags of Kuomintang China and Imperial Japan. The game itself covers the period from July 1937 to August 1945. The roughly 1:3,000,000 map covers most of China proper, Burma, Assam area of India, and parts of Thailand and Indochina.<br/><br/>There is a campaign game as well as 5 separate scenarios, and the game can be played as a 1-4 players' game-with players taking the roles of Japanese, KMT, CCP, and British Commonwealth. In the game, politics will play as vital a role in how the game progresses as the units presented on the map.<br/><br/>Other key game concepts include: <br/><br/>    The HQ activation system - Players move units under the activated HQ. The number of activated HQs is affected by command points, the quality of HQ selected, and whether China is cut off from foreign routes. Randomness and quality of the HQ affects who moves what first.<br/>    The KMT replacement system - KMT units are divided into 3 levels: The elite units with imported weapons; the standard units equipped with what Chinese herself produced; and the local units which simply bought whatever they could find locally.<br/>    The Political Affiliation system - Each warlord and minor country has its own home territory. They may be affiliated with different players at different levels under different conditions. Friend may become foe with a random or historical triggering event.<br/>    The Guerilla System - From the setting up of guerrilla bases to a unique combat system, Guerrilla actions from CCP, KMT, and even British player can be as active as the front line.<br/>    Optional Rules - The game does not shy away from controversial subjects such as wartime atrocity, opium production, and Japanese collaborators. It also includes an &quot;alternate history&quot; section that probes into many &quot;what if?&quot; situations, e.g. what if Stilwell has not been recalled, but instead was capable of commanding all the Chinese forces?<br/><br/><br/>War of the Suns Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 3 months<br/>    Counters: Army [marked as Corps on counters]/Division for the Chinese; Division/Brigade for the Japanese and British [/Western Allies]<br/><br/><br/>Game Details:<br/><br/>    Players: 1-4<br/>    Scenarios: 5<br/>    Complexity: Medium to Hard<br/>    Playing Time: 5 to 34 hours<br/><br/><br/>War of the Sun Components:<br/><br/>    3 22&quot;x32&quot; mapsheets<br/>    1 8-1/2&quot;x11&quot; map overlay<br/>    10 countersheets (176 counters on each countersheet)<br/>    36 page rulebook<br/>    56 page playbook<br/>    8 player aid cards<br/>    4 six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/><br/>International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two.

Pooling their resources, experts from all walks of life converge to find the best path forward &ndash; and the team they&rsquo;ll need to follow it.<br/><br/>The story and gameplay of Converge spans across 3 sets. Each one comes in their own wallet and includes 3 unique 6-card skillsets. All 3 sets can be played individually as standalone games, or players can combine any 3 skillsets from multiple sets to create a new combination.<br/><br/><br/>     Converge: Catalysts of Change<br/>     Converge: Sparks of Hope<br/>     Converge: Engines of Progress<br/><br/><br/>Converge: Catalysts of Change features the sage Archivists, the resourceful Mechanists, and the experimental Alchemists. Archivists use their extensive library to Educate others, converting a goal into a team member. Mechanists can Scavenge almost anything, letting them turn a discarded card into a goal. The Alchemists are all about pushing the boundaries of science, which often results in team members getting Burned and discarded.<br/><br/><br/>In Converge, players are competing to build the best team that meets the current goals, though goals and teams can shift with each play. So can control of the powerful artifact which gives an advantage to those who possess it.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns to play a single card from their hand.<br/><br/>Every card has 2 parts: a character with a skillset, rank and special ability, and a goal, each of which has a star value for fulfilling its requirement. These goals apply to both players while the card is in the central area, with fulfilled goals remaining in play.<br/><br/>Cards can be discarded for their special ability, played to the player&rsquo;s team to fulfill goals using its suit and value, or as a new shared goal.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players count their current star value. The player with the most stars gains control of the artifact. If they already had control of the artifact, they win! If no player can secure victory by the time all cards have been played, then the player who holds the artifact is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a new concept game covering the whole North African campaign from 1940 to 1943.<br/><br/>Developed on wooden blocks and cubes system, over an astonishing 87x64cm full laminated multicolor map-board, there's not any paper component, but the Manual.<br/>All the over 400 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.<br/><br/>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>On June 10 1940, the Italian Fascist Leader Benito Mussolini was convinced that it was the right time to join the war on the German side before it  was over and Germany got all the glory.<br/><br/>Fascist Italy was unprepared for a World War, but Mussolini thought the war would have only lasted for some weeks and that a few thousand Italian casualties would have given him some credibility at the future Peace Conference.<br/><br/>However, as soon as Italian troops crossed the French border, they encountered  fierce resistance  from the determined French Transalpine Army.<br/><br/>Even worse was to come when the Italian Army  crossed the Egyptian border to face a well trained and motivated British Desert Force; furthermore, the idea of invading Greece through the Balkans, was not as easy as it looked.<br/><br/>It was only thanks to a major German commitment in the Mediterranean that operations swung in favor of the Axis and the name of Rommel became a legend. <br/><br/>It was also said that, by having to provide aid to the Italians in the Balkans, Germany diverted manpower that was needed in Russia and hence sowed the seeds of the Axis defeat in the East.<br/><br/>However, as soon as America was thrown into the war by the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the fate of the Axis was written in stone and defeat was only a matter of time.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the African Theater Front from the Italian drive to Marsa Matruh in Summer 1940, until the collapse of the Italian Regime in Semptember 1943.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a game for two players, one controls the Western Allies and the other one controls the Axis Powers.<br/>Although based on history, players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War 2 in the Mediterranean Theater.<br/><br/>RULES INTRODUCTION<br/>The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time.<br/>The first section is the BASIC GAME RULES which introduces the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.<br/>Then the ADVANCED GAME RULES provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.<br/>Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, OPTIONAL RULES can be added as desired.<br/>The Optional Rules include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, Parachute Assaults&hellip;<br/><br/>SCALE<br/>A hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 Km) across.<br/>A turn is 1 month long.<br/>A full strength counter represents 300 planes, 300 Tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the type unit, equipment and nationality.<br/><br/>FOG OF WAR<br/>The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).<br/><br/>Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian<br/>Genre: Operational, Strategic<br/>Turns: Turn-Based<br/>Complexity: Basic to Advanced, depending on which rules are used and on Scenario Lenght<br/>Period: World War II<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/>With over 240 units counters and 200 different resource points of various color, players can enjoy hours of fun by playing one of the ten BIA scenarios, one of the four 7-turn BIE scenarios (in cobination with BITE and BITW) or the gargantuan 1939 CAMPAIGN.<br/><br/>1940 Operation Compass, November 1940 - March 1941<br/>1941 Operation Exporter, June - July 1941<br/>1941 Middle- East Uprising, May - September 1941<br/>1941 Operation Marita-Merkur, April - June 1941<br/>1941 The Desert Fox, March - July 1941<br/>1942 Tobruk, June - October 1942<br/>1942  El Alamein, October 1942 - February 1943<br/><br/>NAVAL BATTLES <br/> Punta Stilo, 9 July 1940<br/> Capo Teulada, 27 November 1940<br/> Capo Matapan, 28-29 March 1941<br/> Harpoon, 21 June 1942<br/><br/>Every scenario has different Victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 2 turns.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the West and Blocks in the East in one of the four 7 turn long BLOCKS IN EUROPE SCENARIOS:<br/><br/>1941 - LEBENSRAUM<br/><br/>1942 - AXIS HYPE<br/><br/>1943 - TIEBREAK<br/><br/>1944 - DOWNFALL<br/><br/>and the gargantuan  1939 CAMPAIGN: from Danzig to Hell <br/><br/>Microbadge: <br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strike - Counter Strike: 4th Armored Division vs Panzer Lehr along the Saar is designed as an entry-level game as an introduction to the Series: Grand Tactical (MMP) by Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>Strike - Counter Strike is a small footprint, low counter density Grand Tactical Series game with minimal exclusive rules meant to provide a quick, easy introduction to the Grand Tactical Series. The game highlights the elegance and fun of the GTS at gaming maneuver warfare at the company level. The Saar battle was chosen as a topic of interest because of the size of the forces involved, the limited battlespace and time period, and most importantly, because it pits two mobile forces against each other, both with the chance to attack and defend.<br/><br/>In November 1944, the advances of the US Army XII Corps and XV Corps threatened the boundary between the German First and Nineteenth Armies. General Balck, Commander of German Army Group G ordered Generalleutnant Bayerlein's Panzer Lehr Division to attack southward along the Saar River into the flank of the US Army XV Corps to stop its advance east.<br/><br/>Unknown to Bayerlein, the situation of the Panzer Lehr was precarious. While the German division was moving south, the XII Corps' 4th Armored Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. John S. &quot;P&quot; Wood, advanced west toward the Saar River before advancing north. Judging the soggy ground west of the Saar River to be unsuitable for armored operations, Maj. Gen. Wood obtained permission to have the American armored unit's CCB move eastward across the Saar River into the XV Corps' zone, before swinging north toward Sarre-Union. A clash between the two opposing armored formations was inevitable.<br/><br/>Strike - Counter Strike simulates the attack of the Panzer Lehr Division into the flank of the US XV Corps, the delaying actions by 106th Cavalry Group, the defense by the 44th Infantry Division, and the counterattack by the 4th Armored Division. The game covers the afternoon of 23 November to the afternoon of 27 November 1944. The German commands the Panzer Lehr Division and the American player commands parts of two divisions an a single map.<br/><br/>Originally published in the 44 page magazine GTS Briefing Vol 1 (May 2023) by Multi-Man Publishing<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 hours daylight / 8 - 12 hours night time<br/>Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters<br/>Units: Platoon to Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>Two dual-side printed full countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One dual-side printed half countersheet (88 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Strike - Counter Strike Exclusive rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC player aid cards<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>Note 1: Players will need to provide Grand Tactical Series Rules v2.0c to play.<br/>Note 2: Players will need to provide one 10-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Summary from Columbia Games website:<br/><br/>&quot;Borodino was fought between the Army of Imperial Russia and Napoleon's Grand Armee on September 7 1812. The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoleon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.<br/><br/>The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoleon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically. The French player has several possible lines of attack and the Russian player must try to anticipate and counter them all. The tactical interaction of Napoleonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares. This makes for exciting and tense gaming.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Shiloh. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division of the same corps. Game time is 3-4 hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Note:  This game should not be confused with Borodino 1812 or Borodino 1812 or any other similarly-named games.<br/><br/>",

If they can hold them off until sunrise or raise the alarm then all will be safe for another night.<br/><br/>Ninja or guards, players face difficult decisions. Do the ninja recklessly force their way through their opponents whilst undoubtedly raising the alarm level, go too slowly and stealthily though and they face losing the advantage that night brings, dawn ultimately bringing an unreckonable force down upon them. Do the guards throw themselves in the way of their more deadly rivals or strategically attempt to slow them down? Rise of the Kage offers a great blend of sneaky skills and gobsmacking kills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In January of 1848, an event occurred which changed the face of the west&mdash;gold was discovered on the American River in California. News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.<br/><br/>As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.<br/><br/>In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.<br/><br/>_____________<br/><br/>In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!<br/><br/>The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.<br/><br/>Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.<br/><br/>Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.<br/><br/>After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;<br/><br/>The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.<br/><br/>Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.<br/><br/>The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.<br/><br/>",

Each song, players count down, then roll and place dice in real time to gain symbols and create patterns. When one player has placed all four of their dice, they shout &quot;Take it to the bridge!&quot; and other players must stop re-rolling and place the remainder of their dice. After placing all of their dice, each player can add the shape that their dice formed to their instrument's unique solo board,&nbsp;each of which offers a different challenge and way of scoring. Players can use symbols gained via the song and their solo boards to quickly change their dice, keep them for endgame scoring, or spend them to buy audience cards, each of which represents a newly-gained fan who will give you another way of scoring points at game's end.<br/><br/>After the set list of six songs has been played, the player with the most points gained from their solo, audience cards, harmonies, and symbol sets and majorities wins.<br/><br/>The Gig includes a solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi.<br/><br/>",

The theme this time is the &quot;mycel heathen here&quot;: the terrifying host of Vikings that landed in England not to loot and pillage, but to conquer. They were steadfastly resisted by Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, and three of Alfie's most famous battles are included. His descendents fought off Viking encroachments with varying degrees of success, until the victory of Canute in 1016. The battles are as follows:<br/><br/>Ashdown 871 - King Aethelred and his kid brother Alfred each command half of the army on either side of a causeway, squaring off against a Viking army likewise split in two. Basically two small battles fought side-by-side.<br/><br/>Marden 871 - The Saxons are favored to win until exhaustion sets in, giving the Vikings the chance to turn the tables.<br/><br/>Cynwit 878 - Vastly outnumbered Saxons leave their fort to launch a surprise attack against Viking besiegers; historically, the Saxons won the day and the Vikings were wiped out.<br/><br/>Ethandun 878 - Alfred's decisive victory over the Vikings. A big long battle with horsies and archers on both sides.<br/><br/>Wednesfield 910 - Vikings try to make their way across a river and to safety when they're attacked by the ferocious Aethelflaed of Mercia and her less-awesome baby brother, Edward the Elder.<br/><br/>Corbridge 918 - Constantine II, King of Scotland, defeats three Viking columns one after the other, when a hidden fourth column launches a sneak attack just before nightfall.<br/><br/>Maldon 991 - The story of Byhrtnoth and his &quot;ofermode&quot;, which turned an easy victory into a defeat and a bloodbath. Didn't help that half his army ran away.<br/><br/>Assandun 1016 - A pre-game bid for the loyalty of the scheming Eadric Streona may prove decisive in this final clash between Canute the Great and Edmund Ironside.<br/><br/>",

Not only pious monks, humble scholars and trustworthy merchants, but also those mischievous, cunning and dishonest. Welcome to the city of Slyville, where you become one of the latter kind! As head of a guild operating in one of the world's major trade and cultural centers in the Middle Ages, you will be sending your trusted henchmen to various districts to find trade bargains, make deals, and provide your organization with more power and wealth &mdash; maybe not always in a way that is completely legal, but the end justifies the means, doesn&rsquo;t it? After all, you want to get in the graces of the Prince, right?<br/><br/>Slyville is a game of pretense and deceit for 3-5 players in which managing your resources matters just as much as your bluffing skills and the ability to figure out the opponents&rsquo; strategy. Try to predict what Goods your adversaries might need, and do your best to upset their plans, but above all, secure the most valuable Deals for yourself!<br/><br/>In Slyville, the players become heads of guilds operating in a medieval city and send their trusted henchmen to do business and close shady deals. Each turn they have seven cards in their hands and must play four of them onto spaces on the district boards placed in the center of the table. By using their card actions, they bid to acquire goods in five types that can later be spent on deal tiles. If a player has collected the goods required by a chosen deal, they must play a deal card and spend the appropriate goods. Tiles are worth 20-40 points, and the player who gathers 100 triggers the endgame. After that, the rest of the players take their final turn and points are counted. The highest scorer wins and becomes the most influential guild master of the city!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With great photos and surprising facts / figures about 175 animals from all over the world!<br/><br/>In this new trick-taking card game for 2-5 players ages 8 and up, one gets excited at the diverse animal kingdom! Everyone learns about the often amazing measurements and characteristics of each animal by constantly comparing the four categories of &quot;size,&quot; &quot;weight,&quot; &quot;age,&quot; and &quot;speed.&quot; Because both the highest and the lowest value can sting, it is possible to win in one category, for example, with the ant against a much larger animal, such as the cat (same game principle as in the first two games &quot;L&auml;nder toppen!&quot; and &quot;Inseln toppen!&quot;). But beware, there are also predators who can reshuffle the cards again within one trick ...<br/><br/>Simple rules, exciting gameplay!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

It went on to earn a dedicated following of its own but GW never developed or re-issued the product after the initial release.<br/><br/>Game start was different, decided by random allocation of city starting locations. Radiation markers could be cleared away as an entire turn action of non-fighting and non-moving armies. H-Bombs were removed from the game completely.<br/><br/>Eventually the GW licence would expire, and ownership and rights would revert to Mike Hayes, who then went on to re-publish his 2012 Classic Warlord version with the full map and H-Bombs restored and rules re-organised for the more classic gameplay from the earlier Red Box and Blue Box versions.<br/><br/>",

You are a powerful hacker in the ranks of an international Mega-Corporation.<br/><br/>Your job: hack into the brains of innocent citizens and manipulate their behavior.<br/><br/>Your goal: wring as many resources out of the city as possible and maximize your corporations profit, no matter the cost. Time and timing is crucial. Enemy hackers will fight you every step of the way, and at some point the city will reach its limits and collapse under the corporate struggle.<br/>Chaos and anarchy will follow. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You got the most out of it. And there is always another city.<br/>It&rsquo;s all in the name of profit.<br/><br/>Axon Protocol is a for 2-6 players and features a unique game mechanic called &ldquo;Shared worker control&rdquo;.<br/>Every single character in the city has their own routine and skills. Each character can be hacked and controlled by every player.<br/>But they will follow their own behavior again the moment no one is hacking them. The Rockstar might give a concert in the city plaza, until a terrorist blows it up, and the corporate rescue team can only save one of the victims.<br/>The game features 6 types of resources: augments, data, drugs, products, scandals and violence. Each corporation profits from two of these resources.<br/>With over 40 unique characters and 6 different corporations each with their own unique special ability, every game of Axon Protocol will tell its own story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can do this as long as the sum of the book weight shown in the cards of the Active Shelf does not exceed 13 after placing the card. In Rebis there is no hand limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can play 1 card to another player&rsquo;s Active Shelf. You may choose to play your card with the positive or the negative value by considering that the sum of the book victory points in a shelf must never be negative. Whenever you play a card with a negative point value to another player&rsquo;s Shelf, you take 1 card from the Library deck.<br/><br/>If your card causes the sum to exceed 13 points, you close the shelf by playing your card face down to create a new Active Shelf for the player. If you close another player&rsquo;s Active Shelf, you receive 1 Mixture token and the other player takes 1 card from the Library deck.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn, after drawing a card, you may place as many golden dust mixture tokens as you want exclusively on your active shelf. Mixture tokens act as multipliers of the victory point value on the shelf where they are placed.<br/><br/>When there are no more golden dust mixture tokens left, the players will take a golden mixture token instead, which can be placed immediately after, in any shelf of your preference.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out or as soon as all mixture tokens have been taken, excluding the red mixture token. Count the total negative book value visible in all of your shelves and sum it to the amount of cards in your hand. The player with the higher result will receive the red mixture token, which will be placed in any shelf of the player&rsquo;s preference.<br/><br/>When the game ends, count the total book value of each shelf and multiply it if there are any mixture tokens on the shelf. The player who has the highest total book value is the winner.<br/><br/>A mini-expansion, Rebis: Zero, is included inside the base game's box.

Nominated for the Charles S. Roberts Award for best historical miniatures rules set in 1996, the rules have been refined and expanded from hundreds of players&rsquo; feedback. The result is a game system which allows a huge number of aircraft to be easily handled without the tedium of written orders.  Multiple sets can be combined to allow large games that are limited only by the space provided by the players.<br/><br/>The game originates from &quot;Squadrons: The Battle of Britain&quot; written in 1994.   As a result of the success of Squadrons demand for more aircraft appeared.   The Blue Sky Series of games resulted in the new rules Red Sun / Blue Sky.   This was done to normalize aircraft statistics across theaters of war by revamping the formulas for calculating plane statistics.<br/><br/>The resulting rulesets / expansions have been published:<br/>Red Sun, Blue Sky - Pacific Theater (Main Ruleset)<br/>Blue Sea, Blue Sky - Mediterranean Theater (Expansion)<br/>White Star, Blue Sky - Daylight Bombing  (Expansion)<br/>Red Star, Blue Sky - Russian Front (Expansion)<br/>Black Cross, Blue Sky - Battle of Britain (Re-implements the Battle of Britain and provides for cardboard planes). 2nd Edition of Rules<br/>Lost Squadrons Black Cross, Blue Sky - Expansion for Black Cross.<br/><br/>All planes published in these modules are compatible and can be played against each other.    Only the planes from the original Squadrons are incompatible.    While it took 10 years to publish Black Cross the expansion rulebooks even mention the requirement to have the black cross rulebooks or red sun rulebooks to play.<br/><br/>While the cardboard planes are not available for the theater books the plane statistics are 100% compatible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.<br/><br/>How Is It Played?<br/>First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.<br/><br/>When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.<br/><br/>Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.<br/><br/>You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.<br/><br/>But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!<br/><br/>Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!<br/><br/>Head-to-head play?<br/>If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.<br/><br/>Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.<br/><br/>",

A basic goal for any TV show is to &quot;win&quot; its time slot for the network by having the highest ratings, and thus the highest ad revenue. As you add talented actors, producers and writers to the show, you&rsquo;ll have to decide how to arrange your TV Guide to win over the most viewers. Will you be putting your best shows early in the week? What will you leave for the Friday night death slot? Make your choices wisely so you can become the #1 network.<br/><br/>Prime Time is played over six rounds, divided into two seasons of three rounds each. During each round, players will bid for and take their actions - buy shows, hire and fire talent, or play golf, among other things.<br/><br/>Each round follows 4 phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Development phase &ndash; Players take 3 actions each. <br/>    Broadcasting phase &ndash; Players set up their TV schedule and try to attract demographics. <br/>    Award show phase (only in rounds 3 and 6) &ndash; Players score points based on their performance.<br/>    Income phase &ndash; Get paid, clear the board and set up for the new round.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the 6th round, each player counts their remaining cash and gains 1 VP for each full $3.<br/>The player with the most VP wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europa is the next game in line from KOSMOS' geography series (previous installments: Deutschland - Finden Sie Minden! and Globalissimo).<br/><br/>The game expands the idea from 'Deutschland' to a European map, where the players have to locate cities, rivers/lakes, landscapes/regions and historical sites. In doing so, the players can decide how much risk they take by choosing how detailed they get in their localization attempt.<br/>The systems works more or less like betting at roulette; the smaller the region you guessed, the higher the return. But if you make a mistake you get nothing at all!  <br/>Europa is to 'Deutschland' what 'Ausgerechnet, Uppsala!' was to 'Ausgerechnet, Buxtehude!'. It just takes the game to another geographical level. <br/>The only major difference is the catch-up mechanism: Instead of allowing trailing players to jump over occupied fields on the point track, the game reuses the 'barriers' from 'Globalissimo'. The leading player has to guess the country of a certain location in order to advance further on the point track. Trailing players can then proceed without such a trial. Additionally, the last player may make a bonus guess by correcting or detailing another player's guess for a bonus point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players compete to collect their container blocks from a central island and return them across the ice sheet to their respective camps before the Spring thaw.<br/><br/>The game runs in two parts; Winter as the players lay ice tiles across the hex board to the central island, and Spring as the thaw allows the players to remove ice tiles. In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.<br/><br/>A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.<br/><br/>The Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternative symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the strategy game Make Make, each person represents the chief of one of the clans that inhabit Rapa Nui. Each clan seeks control of the island's territories, which will allow them to perform the ceremonial rites dedicated to the god Make Make, who will then make the chief of the clan the new Ariki of the island that will govern and give prosperity to the Rapanui people.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with one chief token, five Tangata Manu tokens, and eleven dominance tokens. Twelve Moai tokens are placed to the side, and the Make Make figure is placed in the center of the game board, which has a trapezoidal-shaped hex grid on it, with the intersection of any three hexes (called &quot;territories&quot;) being marked as a ceremonial ground. The six territories surrounding Make Make are &quot;sacred territories&quot;.<br/><br/>A turn consists of a dominance phase, then a ceremonial phase. In the dominance phase, each player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take control of a neutral territory by placing one or more of your dominance tokens on this hex, whether with or without your chief; a chief is worth three dominance tokens.<br/>    Take control of a territory owned by another player by placing more dominance tokens in this hex than they have; the other player returns all of their tokens to their reserve.<br/>    Withdraw from a territory by returning all but one dominance token to your reserve.<br/><br/><br/>If you ever control at least three sacred territories and more sacred territories than each other player, then you gain control of Make Make (possibly from another player), placing the figure in front of you. No player can place tokens in the central space, even after Make Make has been claimed.<br/><br/>During the ceremonial phase, if you control a territory and control all of its surrounding territories and have your chief token and at least Tangata Manu on these territories, then you return tokens on this surrounded territory to your reserve and place a Moai on this territory instead. A territory with a Moai on it is considered to be controlled by all clans, and a Moai cannot be removed from the game board.<br/><br/>Next in the ceremonial phase, if you have control of three territories surrounding a ceremonial ground, you place one of your Tangata Manu tokens on this ceremonial ground. If you lose control of one of these territories, remove the Tangata Manu from the board and return it to your reserve.<br/><br/>If you have all five of your Tangata Manu tokens on the board and you have the Make Make token in front of you, you win instantly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triple Yahtzee is basically regular Yahtzee except that there are three scoring columns for each game instead of the normal one. The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.<br/><br/>Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>",

Some seek action like the brash Astro-Rangers, others desire riches like the fearsome Star Pirates. Some planeteers will to conquer like the horrible alien Blaarg or hunger for honor like the reptilian Zard. Which Planeteers will be the master of the galaxy? That's up to you!<br/><br/>Rayguns and Rocketships is an action strategy game inspired by the sci-fi classics of the pulp era. The game features fast-paced strategy, pulse-pounding action and over 32 original miniatures!<br/><br/>Players starts by selecting a Planeteer faction consisting of a rocketship miniature, a rocketship interior map, a crew of six Planeteers miniatures, a captain miniature, a two-sided captain card and a deck of maneuver cards unique to each Planeteer faction. Player place their crew on their rocketship map - in the cockpit, manning the control systems or manning a raygun -  each gives advantages in flight and combat.<br/><br/>Play is divided into three phases: rocketship movement, rocketship combat, crew movement and combat. Players plot their Rocketship's course using maneuver cards or star cards which are added to the player's hand each turn to provide additional tactical and combat advantages during play.<br/><br/>As the gigantic rocketships maneuver on the Star Map, they blast away at each other with their deadly rayguns. Crew members can leap out of the airlocks to jetpack into combat with other Planeteers or board enemy rocketships to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat!<br/><br/>Points are scored by defeating crew, playing star cards and destroying rayguns and rocketships. The player who reaches the game's victory point goal wins the game and is declared master of the galaxy!<br/><br/>",

Choose wisely, and you just might make it home with the story of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The quest is already done: your goal is to make it back to The Finishing Post, your local tavern, to tell your epic tale. Form a party of up to six characters and brave your way home through the Forest together, meeting threats at every turn with your particular skills and abilities. In your way stand beasts, bandits and nature itself - colourfully illustrated by 36 unique encounter cards, each with 16 surprising outcomes. Draw a set at the beginning of each game and place them in a random path (that you decide) to ensure that no two playthroughs are ever the same. Resolve outcomes using your choice of approach and skill, looking up the appropriate paragraph reference in the printed or digital story book. When the going gets tough use the legendary artefacts you recovered, or items you find on the way, to help you out - but don't imagine this will be easy. The Forest is a dangerous place and it's possible that some of you will not make it back. It's possible that none of you will make it back. Fail, and a shocking twist of fate awaits you.<br/><br/>Lose all your life points and you may allow the Forest to absorb your soul, turning you into a dreaded Shade. This is your opportunity to extract vengeance on the party that so cruelly abandoned you. Flip your character card to reveal a powerful new ability enabling you to thwart their progress - but only if you can correctly predict their next move!<br/><br/>Forest of Fate takes the Choose Your Own Adventure format and transforms it into an enthralling yet easy-to-learn group activity, with elements of strategy, negotiation and over 40,000 words of high-quality, original narrative.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the Danube campaign over and the Austrian capital of Vienna occupied by French troops, Napoleon requires a decisive battlefield victory to secure his gains. At the end of a long line of communication back to Paris, the Grande Arm&eacute;e feigns weakness in the cold and fog of an early December morning in 1805. Now Austerlitz 20 presents the story of desperation and destiny as three Emperors clash to resolve the fate of Europe. With its myriad scenarios and variations, students of history can explore a plethora of &quot;What if?&quot; possibilities as Allied greatness clashes with French glory at the dawn of the &quot;Sun of Austerlitz.&quot;<br/><br/>This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &quot;friction of war&quot; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 corps or division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).<br/><br/>2009 Charles S.

        "description": "&ldquo;111&rdquo; is a simple war game for two based on the mechanics used in the &ldquo;303&rdquo; board game. One of the players is the commander of the Pursuit Brigade - Polish fighter group defending Warsaw on September 1st., 1939, the very first day of World War II, while the other commands the attacking German Luftwaffe. Polish player has access to four P.11 fighters, outdated and slow but highly manoeuvrable. German player uses two powerful Heinkel He-111 bombers and three fast and well-armed Messerschmitt BF-110 fighter. They conduct aerial duels by using special dice. <br/>The mission of the Third Reich&rsquo;s air force is to bomb Capital City. Polish Air Force mission is to shoot down the bombers using the advantage of clouds, hidden airfields and anti-aircraft artillery. <br/>The name of the game &ldquo;111&rdquo; evokes one of the escadrilles, which pilots, after Poland&rsquo;s defeat in 1939, formed the personnel of the famous 303 Fighter Squadron in 1940 during the Battle of Britain. This makes the &ldquo;111&rdquo; the prequel of &ldquo;303&rdquo;, showing the crucial differences between aerial war over Poland in 1939 and Britain in 1940.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vorpals is a card drafting game. It is played in four rounds, with each round representing 25 years of game time. They players are princes seeking power over an island.  Over a period of 100 years, each prince will organize their army, expand their territories and fight neighbouring lords.<br/><br/>The goal is to accumulate more victory points than anyone else by earning the devotion of the people. There are three main ways to do this. The first is to win wars with neighbouring lords. Second, it is possible to construct buildings to produce wood and ore. The third is to use the special powers of each unit or building. You are free to choose which of these strategies to pursue, individually or in combination.<br/><br/>Each round is composed of the following four phases:<br/>1.    Deployment phase: acquire a unit card by drafting and place it by paying the cost.  Units come in three basic varieties; military (e.g. veterans, knights), development (e.g. workers and farmers), and allies (e.g. dragons, goblins) <br/>2.    War Phase: Players make war with neighbouring players, the winner gaining victory points.<br/>3.    Production phase: the production of income and resources, which enable buildings (e.g. treasury, barracks, castle) to be constructed.  Every building starts at level 1 and can be improved to level 2 by spending more resources.<br/>4.    Aging phase: people and monsters die two rounds after they are deployed. So, you can feel the generations change and you must carefully plan how to maintain your forces.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, each player considers the current target fruit card, then chooses and plays a fruit card at the same time. Whoever plays a card of the same color with the smallest difference from the target fruit wins the target. (If no played cards are of the same color as the target card, the card closest in value to the target card wins it. If cards are tied for closest, ignore them.)<br/><br/>After seven turns, you add your remaining cards in hand to your collection, separating the types of fruit, then you score points by multiplying the value of the column with the most fruit by the value of the column with the fewest fruit. If you have only one column, then you multiply that value by itself...so you don't necessarily want to win cards!<br/><br/>After three rounds, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

In my opinion it was a modern day Thermopylae. The difference between the two battles being that in Thermopylae the Spartans were at least able to take advantage of the Terrain to minimize the Persian&rsquo;s numerical advantage. But in this battle the US forces were completely surrounded. They had no way of evening the odds at all. But somehow, caused such devastation to the Chinese forces that they had to permanently disband 2 of their divisions and the remaining divisions were still under-strength for 7 months.<br/><br/>You control the United Nations X-Corps, which primarily consisted of US Marine and Army forces.

Are the others greedy and want to grab the best dice, or are they too cautious for that? Take your chance!<br/><br/>Your goal is to raise forces in all corners of the kingdom. To do this, you use the Stones of Power (twelve-sided dice) that you collect each turn.<br/><br/>You get dice by selecting one of the character cards in your hand and playing it face down in front of you.<br/><br/>Each character has special abilities that can get you the right color, the right number, or a completely new character card.<br/><br/>But be careful, if several of you play the same character, he doesn't know where to help first and prefers not to help anyone. As a result, its effect cannot be used.<br/><br/>In addition, the characters have different speeds. Characters with low numbers in the top center of the map are executed before the others. For this they are usually not allowed to take so many dice<br/><br/>... But who knows if there are any dice left at all when it's the turn of the characters with the high numbers?<br/><br/>Once you've got dice, you decide on your score sheet where you want to put crosses. For each die, you can decide whether to mark the color or the number.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the most points are awarded for a full row or column with 5 crosses. But beware: If there are exactly 2 crosses in a row or column, there are NO points!<br/><br/>If you don't get any dice, all is not lost. Then you can use one of the powerful one-time effects that will get you back in the saddle very quickly. In some situations, you may even want to intentionally not collect any dice in order to be able to use one of these effects ...<br/><br/>Whoever was able to place crosses the most cleverly at the end and thus received the most points, has won and becomes the new queen of the 12 kingdoms!<br/><br/>-Translated from the crowdfunding page<br/><br/>",

Wonderful in every way , whether in its simple mechanics, either in its neat art!<br/><br/>Encantados is played in a series of rounds. Every round, in alternate turns, players buy a new card and have the chance to play one Song and one Set of cards of the same Magical Creature. You can only play creatures if you have three of a kind in your hand. After you play them, they start giving you passive bonus.

If you have one, you know you're safe. If not, you're making an educated guess.<br/><br/>A call ends the hand. When you call another player, you are saying that they were wrong when they played their last card, and there are no more cards of that rank left in anyone's hand. If the caller is right, she wins the pot, plus a penalty equal to the rank of the card, paid by the called player. (For example, 7 coins for calling a 7.) If the caller is wrong, the called player wins the pot, and he wins the same penalty from the caller.<br/><br/>There are two ways to get ahead in Deadfall: You can catch people when they play the wrong cards, and you can trick others into calling you when you're safe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pacific Rim: Extinction is a scenario driven, tabletop miniatures strategy game of city-wide destruction and chaos of epic proportions. With fantastically detailed and painted 75mm scale miniatures of the iconic Jaegers &ndash; mechanical guardians of humanity &ndash; and Kaiju &ndash; monsters the size of mountains sent from beyond our world &ndash; it captures the spectacular conflict of the Pacific Rim universe and places it in the palm of your hands.<br/><br/>Players will be able to jump right into the action as either the PPDC Jaegers or the Kaiju, either in a quick play match of intense combat, or a more constructed battle with both Jaegers and Kaiju using all their skills and abilities to achieve an objective.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is different depending on which side you choose to fight with. As a Kaiju player, you&rsquo;ll uncover a secret objective at the start of the game. To win, you&rsquo;ll need to meet this objective, ideally without revealing what it is to the Jaeger player too early. As a Jaeger player, your goal is to fulfill the PPDC&rsquo;s task: the protection of humanity. You&rsquo;ll need to defend cities as Kaiju trample them, and take down the immense invaders<br/><br/>The Jaegers and Kaiju each have their own abilities and customisation options. Using the 'Jaeger Conn-Pod&rsquo;, &lsquo;Upgrades&rsquo; can be applied to improve the machine&rsquo;s weapons or other capabilities, while each 'Kaiju Signature&rsquo; can be altered with &lsquo;Mutations&rsquo;, making the monsters even more dangerous and unpredictable.<br/><br/>During a game round, players control either Jaegers or Kaiju on their turn by playing &lsquo;Action Cards&rsquo;. These represent all-out attacks, cunning tricks, solid defences, secret weapons, and everything else the machines and monsters can do!<br/><br/>When Jaegers or Kaiju take damage, the player who dealt the damage takes an action card at random from their opponent and reads the Damage section of the card to find out what happens. There's a chance that a critical part of Jaeger machinery, or Kaiju biology, will be struck with massive consequences. The Action Card that was drawn as Damage is then discarded, and cannot be used for the rest of the game. In this way, dealing damage to an enemy not only brings them closer to destruction but can also render weapons or abilities useless.<br/><br/>When a Jaeger or Kaiju has taken Damage equal to their Structure Points total, they are destroyed! If either the Jaegers or Kaiju are all destroyed, the surviving side will have claimed victory, but winning isn't always that simple. If the Kaiju meet their objective before they are all killed, they win the battle and the PPDC will be forced to retreat. Every Scenario and Objective Card will change the way the battle must be fought and won, often drastically.<br/><br/>Using these tools, the Jaeger and Kaiju must outwit, outmatch, and overcome their opponent.<br/><br/>",

These rebel factions, each with their own vision of what life in the galaxy should be, despise each other almost as much as they hate the corrupt Galactic Senate. However, only one can wield ultimate power in the galaxy.<br/><br/>You are the leader on one such rebel faction. You must recruit and train key specialists to help you fight and win a Galactic Rebellion. Scientists will perform research on new technologies that can tip the balance in your favor. Smugglers will help you build a trade network, while Diplomats will join the Senate in hopes of influencing critical decisions. Heroes will conduct Covert Missions to aid your rebel cause, and Troopers will fight your battles as they flare up on planets across the galaxy.<br/><br/>Empires: Galactic Rebellion is a sequel to Empires: Age of Discovery using similar overall mechanisms. However, many of the specific actions have been reworked to follow the theme, and new spheres of activities have been added to create an entirely new experience, including Covert Missions, The Galactic Senate, and Capital Ship Fleets.<br/><br/>As the Rebel Faction Leader, you must lead your rebellion to free the galaxy from tyranny and thereby achieve ultimate victory!<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve been hired to help Zeus figure out who this wretched thief is. Does Hades have it in his underworld? Did Dionysus take it after one of his wild parties? Or was it that trouble-maker Hermes? Oh My Gods! is a fast-paced game of mystery, mischief, and deduction. Race against your friends to search for clues, uncover hidden gods, and use their almighty powers. But watch out for the angry Zeus &ndash; he&rsquo;s on the prowl and is ready to zap your game!<br/><br/>In Oh My Gods!, players are each dealt a hand of cards to help deduce who the thief is. Each player's hand consists of a few gods - these are the gods with alibis. With twenty possible suspects, players must exchange information in order to find the god with no alibi. Information is tracked on a score card that each player keeps hidden.<br/><br/>Each god also has their own power that players can use in order to find out more information. But watch out! Using a god's power gives your opponents a lot of valuable information and can leave you with fewer cards in your hand.<br/><br/>Be the first player to correctly figure out the thief god and you win the game. Be careful, because if you're wrong, you lose and are out for the remainder of the game!<br/><br/>",

Players still try to collect as many points in all four symbol colours. Points are given when a player connects two or more towers with his tiles, with the larger towers also giving special points.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player places one of his two-hex tiles on an empty space on the board. He will try to connect two or more towers, as this brings him as many points for a colour as stated on the coloured chips on the tower. When scored, the chips are turned on their black side that has a different scoring. New chains will score better than enlarging an existing one as this will only score for the new connected tower. There are bonus fields which advance any one colour 1 space on the score track when a tile is placed over them. Connecting the large towers gives a bonus of one point in every colour for each large tower in the chain, which can be very rewarding.<br/><br/>The game ends after 20 rounds when all players have placed their tiles.

Cards represent all of the normal plays in volleyball, such as forearm pass, spike, block, dive, etc. Players work in teams, playing cards to send the ball over the net. Combinations of cards can be played to make it more difficult for the opposing team to respond. The opposing team must then play cards to receive the ball and send it back over the net. Play continues until one team is unable to return the ball over the net. Players then re-fill their hand and begin a new point.<br/><br/>The normal rules of volleyball apply, such as only the side serving can score and a player can't hit the ball (play a card) 2 times in succession.

From the publisher's web page:<br/><br/>Vanished Planet is a cooperative board game. That means that all players work together to play the game, and either win as a group or lose as a group. It can be played with as many as six players or as few as one.<br/><br/>Playing the game requires complex strategies involving ship movement, resource management, and technology building, all while trying to delay the creature's progress towards destroying the players' home worlds.<br/><br/>The difficulty level is scalable, making it enjoyable for everyone from the beginner to the expert. Vanished Planet can be made easy enough for parents to play with their children or difficult enough to challenge the most masochistic hardcore gamers.<br/><br/>Vanished Planet takes place in a richly detailed game world.<br/><br/>The past one hundred years had been marked by an unprecedented peace. Humans from the Earth, newcomers to the Galactic Sextant, surprised the Elder Races with their grasp of foreign technologies and their dedication to freedom and peace. With Earth's help, a massive communications and trade network was established. Treaties were negotiated. Disputes were settled and wars became less frequent. The Peoples of the Sextant welcomed the children of Earth and looked toward a brighter future.<br/><br/>Then, without warning, Earth vanished.<br/><br/>In its place appeared a writhing mass of darkness. It was impenetrable. It was unassailable. It was without reason. It drank energy like water and consumed all matter it touched. After devouring Earth's solar system, the Creature began stretching massive tentacles across space with terrifying speed, reaching straight toward the homeworlds of the Six Peoples.<br/><br/>With Earth gone, the communications network all but broke down. Each of the Peoples accused the others of betraying Earth and setting loose the Creature, for each had lost many of their top men and women with the planet when it disappeared. And with them vanished all hope of stopping the dark Creature. In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.<br/><br/>It was days before any news came to them. Even the hub satellites that formed the backbone of the network spun silently in empty space. News came in the unexpected form of a single ship; one of the few to survive the cataclysm and return to tell what they had seen. Unlike the other ships, they brought not rumor, but six of those thought lost in the vanishing and their tale was devoid of the speculations the other ships had brought.<br/><br/>The ship, Hope, raced from home world to home world bringing what truth they knew of Earth's disappearance to their peoples, narrowly avoiding the wars that were preparing to burst forth over the galaxy even as the Creature began groping insatiable tentacles toward them over the vastness of space. <br/> Then the messages came. As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!<br/><br/>Bizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned. Time was of the essence. Earth could do nothing and the Creature would soon devour the other worlds if they did not hurry...<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Vanished Planet: Racial Advantage Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sam Grant covers the western theater of the American Civil War around the Mississippi area from 1862-1864.  It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>All artwork and graphics in the game Sam Grant was created by RPG/Historical artist,  Eric Hotz.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tiki, you are a divinity on Manami Island and you love all the delicious fruits that grow there. You prefer nothing more than influencing the living tribes of the island to share their gifts with you. Unfortunately, you aren't the only one. Another divinity shares your passion for these fruits, which leaves you only one choice &mdash; you need to show him your power in order to get more fruits than he does before the end of the fruit season.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the nine village tiles and place them in a 3x3 square with some space between each tile. Players then take turns until the fruit supply exhausted or one of them collects four fruits. On a turn, a player creates a new totem (by placing one of their totem tokens on an empty village tile) or moves a totem that has one of their tokens on top. When you move a totem, you must move the entire totem orthogonally as many spaces as the number of tokens in it. As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.<br/><br/>When a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has four fruit, they win. If the fruit supply is empty, the game ends and whoever has the most fruit wins; in the event of a tie, continue to play until one player would win (or lose) a fruit to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Once you've played a few times, start using the Shaman rule. The second player places a Shaman between two villages before their first move, and no totem can be moved between these two villages. When a village with value 0 is influenced, the owner of the topmost token can move the Shaman to a new location, if desired.<br/><br/>",

The more fights you win the more prison resources you control. The more resources you control the more respect you will gain. Be careful or your members will end up in solitary confinement or worse, in the grave! Even if you find yourself running the most powerful gang in the San Quentin beware of the final riot. Who knows what treachery the other gangs may be planning... You can be sure they seek your demise. At games end the players are scored based on what they managed to control in the prison. The more aspects of the prison economy your gang controls the more power and respect you gain. The player's gang with the most respect wins!<br/><br/>San Quentin Kings is 3-5 players and runs 90-120 minutes. Ages 14 and up!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Parley, set in the Mediterranean region of the 16th century, each player chooses one of six fictional corsair characters at the start of the game, receiving a secret mission from one of six corresponding kings.<br/><br/>Twenty ports are located on a map of the Mediterranean Sea on the game board, with these ports initially not belonging to any country. Four of them are under the protection of the great admirals; the other sixteen ports will each be controlled by three countries at the end of the game. In order to control a port, the countries have to make a successful attack on (or defense of) the port in the port siege.<br/><br/>During the game, there will be one siege for each single port. In each siege, three countries will attack the port while the other three countries are on the defensive. The structure of coalitions is random and different each time. Since the power of the countries are equal to each other, the allies which are supported by the corsairs will be victorious.<br/><br/>The corsairs make their collective decision about which coalition it will support by voting. Naturally each player has to vote according to their secret mission but they cannot make it openly. Because the other players can make blackmail if the secret mission of any player is revealed. If the voting is done openly, their secret mission will be exposed and they will be open to blackmail by other players.<br/>At the end of the game, the country who controls the highest number of adjoining ports will be victorious. Automatically the players who support this country will get the most victory points. However, the successful blackmails have a big impact on the final score as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War II is ongoing. Germany broadly uses Enigma rotor cipher machines. The breaking of the Enigma code gives the Allies an advantage in the war &mdash; but this is just one side of the coin because the Enigma code is based on chaos, a non-measurable force lurking beyond the boundaries of our world and eager to consume all its flesh. The code decryption would stop the chaos invasion into our world.<br/><br/>An &quot;Agency&quot; operates in a secret heavily-guarded Victorian mansion somewhere in London suburbs; it has been opposing the supernatural for centuries. To break the Enigma code, the Agency has gathered the world's best decrypters together. You are one of them. Your mission is to break the Enigma code as soon as possible while wandering inside the mansion with an ever-changing layout. At least, you tell others so. In fact, you might pursue completely different goals...<br/><br/>Enigma: Beyond Code is a game of deduction. Victory depends on your ability to understand the motives of other players and locate the cards you need &mdash; while keeping others away from the cards they are looking for. Each play takes 5-10 minutes, and it is best to play Enigma: Beyond Code up to three victories.<br/><br/>In the beginning, each player receives a character card featuring a cryptology expert who has arrived at the Agency's mansion to break the Enigma code. But only one of them is the true decrypter; the others are just masterfully posing as cryptologists. Each of them has a unique secret mission. To accomplish the missions of their characters, the players view mansion cards in turns; each of these cards represents a room or an object inside the mansion. The invited experts work as a team, which means that upon looking at a mansion card, you must tell others what is there. You may either lie or tell the truth &mdash; that depends on your goals. Lying is always a risk, while telling the truth may allow your opponents to win.<br/><br/>The player who first accomplishes their character's mission wins the game. If no one does so within the game's time limit, chaos breaks into our world, and all players lose!<br/><br/>",

Mighty is played mostly by current or former students in Korea, as well as by some groups in North America.<br/><br/>Mighty is a point-trick game with bidding. In each hand, the high bidder chooses a partner by calling a card, and these two players try to take enough of the scoring cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) to fulfill the bid. Importantly, the bidder's partner is not revealed until that called-for card is played.<br/><br/>The standard Mighty is played for five players, but variant rules allow for player counts from three to eight.<br/><br/>",

Moves follow that of traditional chess, with a few variations--most notably that pawns may move orthogonally (and capture diagonally) toward the center of the board.<br/><br/>When a player's piece is on a colored square, she controls the pieces of that color. Players can control multiple colors at once, either with a number of their own pieces, or through a &quot;chain&quot; of pieces. For example, if the white player has her pawn on a red square, and then moves a red pawn to the blue square, then she controls both red and blue.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to checkmate the opposing king.<br/><br/>",

The other players then have each to write a plausible opening or closing sentence to the work in an attempt to bluff fellow players into believing his or her &lsquo;script&rsquo; to be the genuine one. These are all handed in to the reader, who has meanwhile written down the genuine sentence (given on the back of the card). The genuine and fake are shuffled together, and then each sentence is read out. Each player votes for the sentence he/she believes is the real one.  Players win a point for each vote cast for his or her entry (while further points are won if you manage to identify the genuine sentence). The reader receives a point if no one manages to identify the authentic sentence.<br/><br/>Players try to both:<br/><br/><br/>     guess the correct 1st or last line to a novel<br/>     write a fake 1st or last line to a novel and trick other players into thinking it is real<br/><br/><br/>Points are scored for making correct guesses and for tricking other players. The actual 1st/last lines for novels such as the following are included:<br/><br/><br/>     Moby Dick<br/>     Pride and Prejudice<br/>     Jude the Obscure<br/>     Zuleika Dobson<br/>     The Spy Who Loved Me<br/>     The House at Pooh Corner<br/><br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Liebrary<br/><br/><br/>",

And, of course, you will earn wisdom from the Holy God, who knows everything about everything. <br/>The game is based on the mythology and legend of the Hutsuls &ndash; a Ukrainian ethnical group from the Carpathian mountains, who through the centuries developed a unique culture, the amazing blend of Christian and pagan traditions, together with the tough highlander customs.    <br/>During their turn, the player places a tile from their hand and activates its &ldquo;when placed&rdquo; abilities: move their Shepherd, move one of the Spirits, draw a Card (Plot of Trinket), or gain Sheep. After moving their Shepherd, the player can activate the &ldquo;when moved on&rdquo; abilities of the tile, and the shepherd has ended their movement on. Any time during their turn, the player may play 1 trinket card, receiving a buff or any number of plot cards, but only if their conditions are met in full. When the player completes their actions, they draw a new tile, and the turn passes to the next player. <br/>The game lasts until all the tiles are placed, and after the last player completes their turn, all players count their sheep, and whoever has the largest flock is declared a winner!<br/><br/>",

Infernals held court in their fantastic ballrooms, connoisseurs of decadence and indulgence. And most unfathomable of all, the celestials shaped, guided, created and molded.<br/><br/>In Primordial Secrets, players must send their obedient pawns to entreat these all-powerful titans for their aid and guidance, all while playing a strange and dangerous game of flamboyant intrigue. If a player's visitors have enough devotion, they will return with strong new allies, and with enough insight they could even uncover a dark secret guarded by a rival. Meanwhile, your deceitful hosts will try to lure the emissaries and party guests sent by your opponents to your sacrificial altar.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has collected six sacrifices or stolen six secrets, and the unborn universe shall be theirs alone to rule.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When preparation is over, the run begins.<br/><br/>During each turn of the void run, players will flip over the next card in the 10-card void deck, and all must resolve that card (take damage if it's a creature, draw and resolve a dice roll event card, or gain victory points based on the card revealed).<br/><br/>Once a void run card is resolved, all players who remain alive in the void must then choose whether to leave the void and bank their stored energy for the next run (they gain one per void run card successfully cleared) or to push their luck and prepare to resolve the next void card.<br/><br/>Deciding when and how far to push your luck is doubly intense and gripping, because all players are armed with a small hand of unique ability cards each run. These cards have lots of powers, which range from preventing damage and skipping void events, to messing with other players and causing havoc for their opponents (or preventing opponents from messing with them).<br/><br/>Abilities can be played at almost any time during the run. When multiple players fire abilities that would negate or impact another player's abilities, the abilities are resolved in instant reverse order (like instants in Magic: The Gathering).<br/><br/>Any player who survives the entire 10-card run gains additional victory points and other perks.<br/><br/>Players continue the Preparation -&gt; Void Run loop until someone reaches 10 victory points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When one player has rid himself of all of the cards (quests) in his hand, or when a certain period of time has passed (when you've drawn four special cards from the draw deck), that round ends. The player who rid himself of cards gets closer to the High Heavens, but those with cards remaining are pushed away even further.<br/><br/>The gods can also use their faithful servants for their own purposes. They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.<br/><br/>You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.<br/><br/>",

Like its Medieval era cousin Shields &amp; Swords, this series takes a broad brush approach to simulating battles, this time of the Ancient period, with an emphasis on speed and playability. While the basic philosophy and the core system of using Command Markers to activate Wings remains the same, each game in this Ancients line is designed from the ground-up to incorporate elements specific to its period and style of warfare.<br/><br/>This first game looks at six battles fought during the Greco-Persian and Peloponnesian Wars. Hoplite units that are attacking may use the Combat Class of the best hoplite in the line, giving them an advantage over heavy and light infantry formations. As a result of combat, units become exhausted, but these results may be distributed elsewhere in the line - a break occurs when there are no fresh units that can satisfy the result. Break the enemy line at the right time in the right place, and it will crumble in a disastrous rout. Maintaining pressure on the enemy while managing the morale of your own men is crucial to deciding the battle, and with it, the fate of empires.<br/><br/>",

Now revamped, expanded, and improved.<br/><br/>Better Dead Than Zed sweeps you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Who you are when the outbreak occurs is just as important as where you are. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for awhile, you won't be able to tell the humans from the zombies until maybe it's too late. Because it's all happening to you just like it would on Day One.<br/><br/>Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you'll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days?<br/><br/>Then what?<br/><br/>All Things Zombie takes you to where no other zombie game has before. Yes, it starts on the first day of the outbreak, but then let's you continue your life building your very own future. It's a game where every detail has been covered, as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you, then hunt them down and take back what's yours.<br/><br/>On the way there you'll find out that maybe your most dangerous enemies aren't the zombies, but maybe your neighbors or sometimes your friends. All Things Zombie can be played solo, cooperatively with everyone on the same side, or competitively with everyone against one another. All Things Zombie can be played as a one up game or part of an ongoing campaign.<br/><br/>But it doesn't matter which way you play it, as the goal of All Things Zombie is to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get ready to sharpen thy Shovel! Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels  is a 1-4 player side-scrolling, miniatures board game based on the popular video game Shovel Knight by Yacht Club Games. Players will venture into a dangerous dungeon filled with enemies and traps themed to one of the infamous members from the Order of No-Quarter to compete against rival Knights for treasure.  Whichever player has the most treasure at the end of the dungeon is the winner!<br/><br/>In  Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels , treasure is earned by rolling dice to defeat enemies, digging up the scattered dirt piles, and finding gold dropped by other players!. As players advance through the dungeon, they're likely to find powerful one-shot items called Relics as well as a friendly merchant named Chester who's willing to exchange some powerful equipment for some of your treasure. When defeated by enemies or falling into deadly spiked pits, players will drop half of their treasure, allowing the other rival players to come by and collect it. Don&rsquo;t worry though, if a player&rsquo;s Knight has been defeated, they spawn back into the game in the following round! Though a player&rsquo;s Knight may be able to wound enemies, they cannot hurt another rival Knight as it is against their chivalrous code (or shall we say...shovelrous code?) The code of shovelry says nothing about pushing each other around, however, as Knights may knock each other into deadly spiked pits, enemies, or otherwise disadvantageous positions!<br/><br/>Not only will enemies and Knights be moving, but the dungeon itself will too. Like a level you'd see in a classic video game side-scrolling segment, the dungeon will constantly move along with or without you, so make sure to keep up! Each round, the leftmost tile will fall off while a new tile moves on from the rightmost side of the board, and any enemies, treasure, or Knights are then defeated and removed from the board! Once players have dealt with the minions and lethal terrain, they will  face off against a boss from the Order of No-Quarter as the final challenge of the dungeon. Bosses from the Order of No-Quarter are controlled by their own unique AI Deck,  randomizing their attacks for an unforgettable fight. Each time damage is done to the boss players will gain gold, but each time the boss damage them they'll lose gold. Whoever has the most treasure by the end of the fight is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players simultaneously select a card to play and will add their cards to the rows in ascending order. If a player selects a card that is so low it cannot be added to any series, that player takes a row of cards and the low card begins a new row. Each row can contain at most 5 cards. The player that places the 6th card must take the other cards in the row and the 6th card is used to start a new row.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of 4 rounds.

        "description": "Battle Dome is &quot;the game of rapid-fire action and lightning-quick reflexes!&quot; It is a pinball-style game in which colored plastic marbles fall from a motorized dispenser down onto a dome, and then fall into one of four chutes. Players  2-4 control a set of flippers at their chute and try to shoot the falling balls into their opponent's goals while keeping marbles out of theirs. Any marbles in your goal count against you, with the black &quot;stealth&quot; marble counting extra. There are spinners and bells on the dome that the marbles hit - these can be rearranged, or replaced by a fence to block off one or two chutes if there are fewer than 4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fruit Passion is a fun and quick memory card game for kids and adults alike. The goal of the game is to be the player who collects the most points by using their excellent memory skills!<br/><br/>Players try to collect sequential numbers of each different type of fruit, but they can collect only one sequence of each type, so they can compile at most seven different sequences. You can collect these sequences in any order you like, but you cannot look at any of your cards once you have collected them. Your aim is to collect all five cards in sequence of coconuts, papayas, figs, avocados, pomegranates and pineapples (or all seven cards in the case of passion fruit), but don't duplicate the numbers you collect or you won't score anything!<br/><br/>Fruit Passion is #15 in the E-G-G series of small box games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Try to remember all the fruit you've grabbed in GY&Uuml;MI G&eacute;niusz (FRUTTA! Genius or GYUMI Genius) to maximize your score!To set up the game, shuffle the fruit cards, then create three face-down decks of approximately equal size, then turn one card face up to start a discard pile. The deck contains fruit cards of seven types, with six types of fruit (coconut, papaya, fig, avocado, pineapple, and pomegranate) being numbered from 1-5 while passion fruit is numbered 1-7. The ratio of identical cards differs by fruit type.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take one of two actions: Draw the top card from one of the decks, or draw the top card from the discard pile. If you draw from a deck and don't want the card, place it on the discard pile. Otherwise, start a pile with that type of fruit or place that card on top of any other cards of that type that you already have. (Thus, you can have at most seven piles.) Splay the cards in each pile upward so that you (and everyone else) can see how many cards of each type you've collected, but with the number of only the topmost card of each pile being visible. If the discard pile is emptied because people keep taking the cards, flip over one card to start a new discard pile.<br/><br/>When all three decks have run out, the game ends once the player holding the final card discards it or adds it to their collection. Players then score points for each type of fruit they've collected, but fruits score only from 1 up in consecutive order. If you have 1-2-3-4-5 of pineapple, for example, you score 11 points, whereas if you have 1-2-4-5 of fig, you score only 3 points since only the 1-2 count. If you fail to get a 1 in a fruit or you duplicate a number in a fruit sequence, then you score 0 points for that fruit!<br/><br/>Some cards have special colored numbers on them, and with these you can create a cross-fruit sequence as the coconut has the 1, the papaya the 2, and so on. As long as these &quot;genius&quot; numbers are in valid fruit sequences, then you'll score points for this genius sequence, too. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>Note: GY&Uuml;MI G&eacute;niusz supports 5 players while Fruit Passion supports 4, however both have the same number of cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After years of jungle fighting and island hopping the battle for Manila was the first urban fighting experienced by American forces during the war in the Pacific.  The campaign by the American XIV Corps to defeat Iwabuchi&rsquo;s forces and capture the city has been depicted in a handful of two-player designs in the past but is presented here in a new and exciting SOLITAIRE format, the second in a series of single-player area movement games by publisher Take Aim Designs.<br/><br/>Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945&nbsp;puts the player in charge of the attacking and far more mobile American side while the game system handles the defending and largely static Japanese side. No two games will ever be the same. Each turn presents new and unique challenges for the player in the form of random events, uncertain supply deliveries, and unknown Japanese area strengths and defensive strategies.<br/><br/>The primary game is a nine-turn campaign covering the American assault on the city during February and March 1945. The deeper American forces advance, from the city&rsquo;s less developed periphery to its urban business district and fortress-like government buildings, the greater Japanese resistance becomes. The number of American units fought to exhaustion, effectively out of action, mounts. American determination to secure a rapid victory for Supreme Allied Commander General Douglas MacArthur, represented as &ldquo;morale&rdquo; in the game, gradually decreases. The player wins by equaling or exceeding historical American gains and loses if they fail to do so, or if morale falls too low.<br/><br/>With a setup time of less than 15 minutes, low counter density, endless variability, and quick playing time, Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945&nbsp;will appeal to every level of player, from the novice to the grognard.<br/><br/>Few battles at the end of the Second World War exceeded the destruction and brutality of the fighting in the city of Manila. MacArthur had hoped to spare the multicultural city and its roughly 800,000 inhabitants from the horrors of war, but failed. The fate of the city of Manila, the &quot;Pearl of the Orient,&rdquo; now rests with you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If you didn't know who designed Draco but were familiar with the works of designer Leo Colovini, you'd likely be able to recognize his style when hearing a description of the game.<br/><br/>Ten dragons start the game on the first square of a movement track, with each space on the track bearing a number from -2 to 8. Four blue and three green scoring spaces are scattered on the track, and four summit spaces are found at the end of the track. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards, with cards coming in ten colors to match those of the dragons; each player also starts with a uniquely-colored card face-up on the table to indicate which dragon the player is riding.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays down one card from his hand, then advances the appropriately-colored dragon as many spaces as the number shown on the card. If another player has a card of this color in front of her, the player places the card on that player's stack; if not, the player places the card on his own stack, effectively changing steeds if the color differs from what was on top previously. (Exception: If a dragon not being ridden by anyone is in last place, the player may choose to place the card under his stack instead of on top of it, while moving the dragon normally.)<br/><br/>If a dragon moves onto a blue space, then each dragon on a space valued three or less scores that many points for the player riding that dragon, if any. If a dragon moves onto a green space, then each player scores points equal to the value of the space on which his dragon stands. If a player causes no scoring on his turn or plays his last card in hand, he refills his hand to six cards; if he caused a scoring, then he draws no card and plays with a smaller hand next turn.<br/><br/>When a dragon moves onto one of the four summit spaces, all dragons score points (possibly negative) for their riders. Once three dragons have reached the summit, the game ends after a final scoring, and whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Using the same rules as Fear God & Dread Nought, a novice can begin playing within a half hour of opening the box using the specially designed Jump start scenario.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Rising Sun follows the same format as Clash of Arm's other rules used in the Admiralty Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike.<br/><br/>Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.<br/><br/>Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical hits are a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits are typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon mounts).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. In addition to the well known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles are included. The scenario book is full of original after action reports as well as helpful sidebars on a wide range of topics. The Data Annex is complete for all the ships that were involved, as well as including line drawings of the major combatants and additional source material, making it a valuable reference in itself.<br/><br/>Step onto the Admiral's bridge and see if you will sustain or reverse history.<br/><br/>Russo-Japanese War contains:<br/>FG&amp;DN Rules<br/>RJW Data Annex<br/>Scenario Book - 20 scenarios plus numerous sidebars and articles.<br/>2 countersheets, 210 ship, and 140 markers (land based guns, searchlights, fires, torpedoes, etc.)<br/><br/>",

I command you to send forth my MONSTROUS pets. Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!&quot;<br/><br/>Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.<br/><br/>Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.<br/><br/>During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.<br/><br/>On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:<br/>1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.<br/>2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters. <br/>3. ideally both at the same time!<br/><br/>Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.<br/><br/>Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love. Every game is different and there are optional rules to tailor your MONSTROUS experience for children, team play and longer games with legendary monsters.<br/><br/>And yes, you can release the Kraken.<br/><br/>",

You shall go and find me the greatest army of 7 watchmen who will protect the Tree of Destiny. One of you who will manage to assemble the best army, will be given a great fortune.

Your 8 figures are numbered 1 (Prince), 2 (Samurai) or 3 (Fighter) and may only move their number of spaces. Finishing a move on an opponent's piece is a strike and it is removed from the board. Strike a prince and the player is out of the round, though their pieces remain on the board. Get your Prince to the centre and score 5 bonus points, whilst all remaining pieces score their value. Play a few rounds and most points win.<br/>Interesting abstract game, was very popular in Germany and often reprinted.<br/><br/>Description for Kaiser, K&ouml;nig, Edelmann (Emperor, King, Nobleman):<br/>Each player tries to be the first to reach the castle with his prince. At the beginning of play the figures are arranged according to a certain starting order. The player, whose turn it is, moves one of his figures as many fields as it is allowed (3,2,1). If the figure moves onto a field with an opposing figure, this one is struck and taken out of the play. If it takes an opposing emperor out of the play in this way, that player is immobilized completely; his figures however remain in the game as handicaps. One may not jump over figures. Likewise it is not allowed to move through the palace or go back to the spot you came from. Additionally the player is obliged to move every turn. The emperor can move only to one crossing, the kings to two crossings and the noble men up to three crossings. The player whose emperor first arrives at the castle wins.<br/><br/>",

The board is 5x6 squares, so it's a shorter game than regular Shogi, aimed at getting children even more interested in Shogi after they've outgrown the original Dōbutsu Shōgi.<br/><br/>Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi not only has a bigger board (goro is a contraction of go roku which means five six in Japanese, a reference to the board, as well as goro being onomatopoeic for purring) compared to Dobutsu Shogi, it also adds in some more rules of the full Shogi game:<br/>- Reaching the other side of the board with your lion no longer wins you the game. Only capturing your opponent's lion does.<br/>- You can't have two of your own chicks in the same column/file.<br/>- You can't drop a chick for mate.<br/><br/>Taken from the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The cute animal pieces are now combined with Goro-Goro Shogi, a small shogi on 5x6 square board. This is a very good next step for everyone who has played Dobutsu Shogi.<br/><br/>The rules of Goro-Goro Shogi was invented by Japan Shogi Association, and is widely known to be a very good variation of shogi to learn important concepts in shogi, such as handling the generals effectively, importance of promoting a pawn, and mating the opponent's king with successive piece drops.<br/><br/>Cats and dogs run and play in this small board. Highly recommended. Please have fun!<br/><br/>",

Each tile depicts two sandy spaces, two turtles, or sand and a turtle.<br/><br/>On a turn, first move two of your tokens one space each or one token two spaces. Tokens move orthogonally and can land on other tokens, whether yours or the opponent's, but you can never land on a turtle. After movement, slide the remaining tile into either side of the row where your last-moved token landed, ejecting another tile from the game board. Any tokens on this tile are returned to their respecting starting zone.<br/><br/>Tokens can be stacked up to three high; when a token moves from the top of a stack, it moves 2-3 spaces depending on the height of the stack and can jump turtles while moving.<br/><br/>If a token reaches the opponent's starting zone, it remains there, and the first player to cross the board with five of their tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

That's almost 2.5 million extra games every day.<br/><br/>Back in 2006, Ted Alspach provided a solution to this problem with a simple card game called Start Player. Just turn over a card, and you'll know who the start player is.<br/><br/>That was a wonderful solution...for 2006. But we're clearly living in the future now, and there's no time for getting out the box, shuffling cards, and finally turning a card over. It's time for something better, faster, and a whole lot more technologically advanced. It's time for Start Player Express.<br/><br/>Start Player Express consists of four custom dice. There's no shuffling, there's a whole lot less reading, and there's no messing with a box. (You're not a Neanderthal, are you?) Just roll the dice and BOOM! You know who goes first.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you need to bring the right things together to think outside the box, clear obstacles out of the way, and work together to stop the insane Professor Knix, the former mentor of the ChronoCops.<br/><br/>The players explore different timelines, which can be opened up only gradually by successfully solving puzzles. Each timeline has different jump markers that players can travel to, some in the past or future, others in alternate realities. There are clues and objects hidden everywhere that the ChronoCops can collect and combine with the Chrono Decoder to use at a specific location. The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.<br/><br/>In ChronoCops: Da Vincis Universal-Dilemma (&quot;Da Vinci's Universal Dilemma&quot;), Professor Knix plans to drill into an underground river, but the ChronoCops can't allow that to happen! To stop the mad professor, they first have to recalibrate an LED in their chronograph, and to do that they need Leonardo da Vinci's help.

        "description": "In the words of Nomic's author, Peter Suber:<br/><br/><br/>        &quot;Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, and gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.<br/><br/>Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:<br/><br/><br/>     the addition of a new mutable rule<br/>     an amendment to a mutable rule<br/>     the repeal of a mutable rule<br/>     the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable<br/>     or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable<br/><br/><br/>The game can be played around a table with written notes, or online through mailing lists or forums. Alternative starting rulesets exist, particularly for online and postal games which don't suit the usual clockwise turn order. Several games have been running online for over a decade.<br/><br/>",

It has only one separate extension set: Helicopter.<br/><br/>Game description:<br/><br/>Walking through the Italian Dolomite mountains you can see special Flowers, Animals, Waterfalls, Canyons and Mountain Tops. The player who visits the most of these and builds their Rifugios (Italian for 'mountain cabin') in strategic spots, is most likely to win the game.<br/><br/>In Rifugio you place hexagonal tiles every turn with just a few simple rules (meadows next to forest, next to rocky areas, which in turn are the only areas allowed to have mountain tops. No rock next to meadows, and no mountain tops next to forest or meadows. A few special tiles have to match their sides exactly.<br/><br/>With your pawn (a hiker with backpack) you move around the placed tiles, visiting those that have special items printed on them (animals, flowers, waterfalls, etc.), and avoiding those with bears. By visiting special places, you collect a victory points card (usually 2 points) for that special place (for a bear however, you get -3 points). There are three items in each category, and collecting the full set earns you a bonus of 5 points.<br/><br/>Each turn you have two free actions available, to either move, or place a Rifugio (a mountian cabin). Each time an opponent visits a tile with your Rifugio, you get a card with 2 victory points, but they too rest (which is getting a card with an extra action they can use at any time convenient).<br/><br/>Game ends when all tiles have been placed, and whoever gathered the most points in collecting those cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Each time the vacuum cleaner comes out you strive to be recognised as the most daring of all Dustbunnies by risking the dangers of the vortex.<br/><br/>Each round your fate is secretly linked with one of six fluffballs. The closer you can get your fluffball to the vacuum without it being sucked-up the more daring you will seem when the fates are revealed after the contest.<br/> Use your innate control of static, charms you found down the back of the sofa and your unique character powers to collectively propel the balls of fluff across the carpet. The furniture, rugs and even pets you encounter will help and hinder your efforts.<br/> Keep which colour of fluffball fate has handed you a secret, while working out which one your opponents are linked to and then decide which to send up the tube. Choose correctly and your opponent will be the agonised loser while you will rise to fame and glory in the kingdom behind the skirting boards.<br/><br/>Daring Dustbunnies is a game for 2 to 5 players. Each game lasts approximately 15 minutes per player and is suitable for ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>This is a card driven race game with a difference. The aim of the game is to attempt to move the fluffball you are secretly supporting to the highest scoring position (closest to the vacuum) when each round ends without being sucked-up.<br/> You start the game with 4 randomly dealt cards, each showing one of the six fluffballs and a &quot;suction&quot; number for how far it moves. On your turn you play one card to move a fluffball towards the doom that is the vacuum cleaner. Each carpet tile has a special power and if you move a fluffball onto an empty tile you immediately perform the carpet action. Moving onto an occupied space will reward you with static, the currency in the game which powers the charms. Exhausting your hand of cards will earn you an extra charm and four new cards.<br/><br/>Keeping which ball of fluff you are linked to a secret is key if you want it to stay out of the vacuum. <br/>Being closest to the vacuum of doom will earn you a gold medal but being inside it loses you everything.<br/>Use timing, tactics and trickery to prove you are the smartest and bravest of all the Daring Dustbunnies.<br/><br/>",

All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!<br/><br/>",

As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.<br/><br/>Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take tricks, organize, never bust.<br/><br/>TonTon is a trick-taking game with a forty-card deck, with five colors numbered 1-8. You use only three colors of cards for a three-player game, four colors for 4p, and five colors for 5p. The game lasts three rounds, and at the start of each round, you reveal a mission card. The game includes three basic missions and two advanced missions. These missions give you targets that you try to achieve during the round, such as having top cards (explained below) that sum to at most 12.<br/><br/>Gameplay follows standard trick-taking rules. In a trick, players must follow suit when possible, but they can play any card otherwise. Whoever played the last 4 in a round leads to the next trick; if no one played a 4, then whoever wins the trick leads. When you win a trick, you must take the cards in this trick, arrange them by color with the lowest card on top of each color stack, then place these cards on top of other cards that you've won. Thus, over the course of the game, you'll build up to five color stacks (depending on the number of players) as you take cards.<br/><br/>When the round ends, you compare the top cards on your stack to that round's mission. If the sum of these cards is higher (or lower, depending on the mission) than the depicted number, then you bust for the round and score only 1 point for each 6 you collected. For all those who didn't bust, players score points based on how their sum compares to others. For the advanced missions, as long as a player doesn't bust, they score points based on the sum of their top cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the APL website:<br/><br/>Spain&rsquo;s colony of Cuba had attracted American expansionist desires since at least the 1850s. By the end of the century, the American &ldquo;Yellow Press&rdquo; had made attempts by Cuban revolutionaries to overthrow Spanish colonial rule a leading news story. American public opinion demanded that Spain grant independence to Cuba.<br/><br/>When the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded in Havana harbor, President McKinley could no longer resist the tide of public sentiment. The U.S. government demanded that Spain withdraw from Cuba, and the U.S. Navy initiated a blockade of Cuban ports on 21 April 1898.<br/><br/>For the sake of honor, Spain declared war on 23 April and dispatched an ill-equipped and completely outclassed fleet to the Caribbean. In two smashing naval victories the U.S. Navy defeated the Spanish fleets in the Philippines and the Caribbean. The U.S. Army seized Santiago de Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Manila.<br/><br/>The fighting ended in less than four months, but the diplomats needed eight more to reach a peace agreement. The Spanish Cortes, unable to accept either its loss of Great Power status or that of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, rejected the treaty. The Queen Regent overruled their action to prevent further consequences. The &ldquo;Disaster of &rsquo;98&rdquo; crushed Spanish national pride and helped undermine Spanish democracy and constitutionalism.<br/><br/>For quite different reasons the U.S. people and government were divided over the treaty. They questioned annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Many did not want to give up their isolationism. The war served notice that the U.S. was now a Great Power. The twentieth century would become one of American world influence.<br/><br/>1898: The Spanish American War includes 22 scenarios. Of these, 15 are playable with the game pieces and maps provided in the game. The other seven require one or more pieces from other Great War at Sea titles. Two campaign scenarios allow players to play out the entire war at sea.<br/><br/>The operational map covers the area around Cuba and Puerto Rico where the war&rsquo;s most important campaign took place. The game includes the full Spanish and American fleets of 1898, plus a number of American warships of the early 20th century.<br/><br/>",

You can play a single era or a campaign of 3 eras.<br/><br/>Players try to win control over an era by gathering the most influential characters. They achieve this through the way they draft and play the character cards.<br/><br/>Each game consists of two major phases: Draft and Play.<br/><br/>The Draft is done simultaneously by both players. Each player distributes 3 cards between themself, their rival and the Independent Stack  until all 18 Era Characters are distributed.<br/><br/>Play consists of 6 rounds. In each round the players play one card each. Then the player with the card of higher influence decides over the 2 played cards: Which card should be triggered by their player for its effect and which is moved to the Influence Area of their player? A coin indicates who is deciding, but also who has to play first in the next round.<br/><br/>Each era and each character have unique effects and therefore require a different tactical approach and deliver.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Of course, dice may only be placed in the column of the corresponding color and they have to be placed in ascending order (e.g. the 3 may only be placed when the 1 and 2 are already in place). At any time, a player may reroll ALL his unplaced dice.<br/><br/>As soon as one player gets rid of all his dice, play stops. For each of his unplaced dice, each player gets minus one point.

All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, using the dice however each player determines.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to draw a shape with a certain dig type on the dig site. You dig up a fossil when it is completely surrounded (orthogonally) by shapes you have drawn.<br/><br/>- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference. Of the two dice rolled, one will be used to determine which shape and the other die will be used to determine the type of dig.<br/><br/>- Use dice to choose a shape and a dig type<br/><br/>Choosing the shape: Using one of the dice, choose one of the pentomino shapes coordinated with that number. There are twelve shapes, with a choice of two shapes with each die-face number.<br/><br/>Choosing the dig type: Using the other die, determine the dig type. There are three dig types.<br/><br/>Example: You roll a 2 and a 5. You can choose one shape, and can choose from four shapes; the two shapes next to the 2 and the two shapes next to the 5. You also have a choice between two dig types; the V from the 2 that was rolled or the diagonal lines from the 5 that was rolled. You decide the best play for your current dig site is to choose the L shape with the 5 die and then use the V dig type with the 2 die.<br/><br/>- Draw shape and fill that shape in with the Dig type<br/>Shapes can be mirrored, turned, and flipped, as long as they are still the same shape.<br/>Shapes can only be placed in open, non-fossil spaces. You can place shapes over the bonus star. If you do, choose and circle one of the bonuses to gain (you can use bonuses in future rounds).<br/><br/>- Check to see if you dig up a Fossil(s) - Once a fossil is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right. Not diagonally) then you score that fossil! Circle the number in a lower scoring area that corresponds to the fossil you dug up. If you use all of the same dig type for a fossil, you earn bonus points.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps each round (rolling 2 dice and placing a shape with a dig type) until 20 rounds have been completed.<br/><br/>- Earning Bonus points for using the same Dig Type - if you were able to use the same dig type for a fossil, you also gain the scoring bonus. Circle the extra smaller circle with the +number. If there is more than one dig type used for a fossil, you cannot gain the bonus.<br/><br/>- Bonus Stars - when you place a shape over a bonus star, you gain a bonus! Choose one of the four bonuses at the top-left of the page. The four types of bonuses are One Square Anywhere, Switch Shape, Switch Dig Type, and +1 Point. Each bonus can be gained up to four times in one game.<br/><br/>One Square Anywhere - At any time, place a 1x1 square on any empty square that does not contain a bonus star. Fill in the square (as the dig type). You cannot get the dig type bonus score when a filled-in square is used to dig up that fossil.<br/><br/>Switch Shape - Choose any shape for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)<br/><br/>Switch Dig Type - Choose any dig type for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)<br/><br/>+ 1 Point - Worth one point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>End of Game: After you have completed the 20th roll/round, total your points earned from each fossil dug up, adding in bonuses from fossils dug up with the same dig type, and finally adding points if circled from bonus stars. The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The walls inside this place of worship are to be decorated with paintings of feathered snakes to pay tribute to the gods. An election will be held to determine who is the empire&rsquo;s most celebrated C&oacute;atl painter so that they may have the honor of decorating the temple walls.<br/><br/>Can you prove your worth? <br/> In C&oacute;atl The Card Game, players try to paint the most beautiful and valuable serpent they can. The serpent (or C&oacute;atl) is made up of a Head, a Tail and 8 Body cards.<br/><br/>During their turn, players will play 2 cards to create, then claim, any available patterns on the Prophecy cards. If you complete a Prophecy card that has already been claimed by another player, you will steal it and display it in front of you. You score more points if you create the same pattern multiple times and you may eventually be able to protect that Prophecy card so that it can no longer be stolen.<br/><br/>One game lasts 5 rounds. Players can earn additional victory points if they fulfill the requirements listed on a Temple card. When the last player completes their C&oacute;atl, the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>C&oacute;atl The Card Game also has a solo mode and includes the Golden Feathers expansion, which is compatible with the C&oacute;atl base game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You have to be careful not to miscalculate because the dwarves cleverly build all kinds of useful things for their village from each resource during the production phases. For every gold coin a new dwarf comes to the village, for every stone a wall is built, for every combination of wood, stone and beer a tavern is built, and so on. Since the forest clearing available to you as a building site is not the largest, you must plan well in advance so that there is enough room for everything in your dwarf village. Of course, the wishes of the inhabitants must also be taken into account, so there is a lot to plan for your own dwarf village.<br/><br/>",

Customisable decks of cards for each Rider mean that even multiple games with the same rider will be different!<br/><br/>Manage your cards well, as you will be using them to move, attack enemies and upgrade your rider. Don't blow through them too quickly though, because once your deck runs out you've lost the battle! Fight your way through to the hordes of monsters to defeat the end boss and win the apocalypse!<br/><br/>Cards in Darksiders can function one of a variety of different ways ways: <br/>- You may discard a card to make an attack with your melee weapon (or a ranged weapon if your Rider has one equipped) <br/>- You may discard a card to move your rider up to 3 hexes (different cards have different possible movement values listed on them) <br/>- You can spend the soul cost listed on certain cards to use their special abilities. Equipment cards might be weapons or armor that make your Rider stronger in battle. Ability cards let you use ferocious special abilities to attack your enemies, defend your rider or even summon aid in battle.<br/>- Cards can also be discarded to interact with your environment, such as opening doors, triggering switches, or trading with Vulgrim the Demon Merchant !<br/><br/>The included Campaign Book has 20+ different levels - broken into multiple scenarios &ndash; to play through. These can be tackled in sequence for an entire campaign play-through, players may choose to focus on a single scenario for a shorter gaming session, or even just play through a single level. With a variety of enemies as well as numerous modular hex-tile game boards included in the game, we also look forward to seeing fan-created custom levels and scenarios!<br/><br/>",

The game is based on 100% real science and the mechanics were created to mimic how real biology works.<br/><br/>Avid deck builder players will feel at home playing the game as the mechanic foundation was based on several popular deck builders. The mechanics have evolved and mutated during the creation into a game that is quite its own.<br/><br/>The game offers several modes of play including solo play, cooperative, competitive, and team play.<br/><br/>No knowledge of science is required to play but it was developed to enhance the learning of the immune system at the college level.<br/><br/>Second Edition:<br/><br/>The immune system for the 2nd edition of Pathogenesis has been updated.  These updates include 4 immune system cards (4 copies of each) that are more consistently damaging than before as well as updated antibody tokens that have an attack value of their own.  The adaptive immune system response is now less volatile and even more dangerous than before!<br/><br/>",

The result was a titanic clash along the Psel that saw Pzkw VIE &lsquo;Tiger&rsquo; tanks crisscrossing the legendary steppe in mortal combat with hordes of T-34 tanks.<br/><br/>The Germans reached the dominating terrain of Hill 226.6, overlooking the Oboyan-Prokhorovka Highway, only to be attacked by wave after wave of Soviet tanks. The Germans were soon caught up in a savage battle to hold the perimeter around their pontoon bridge over the Psel. With the German spearhead attacked at its base, further advance in the Battle of Kursk came to an end for SSTK.<br/><br/>Module for ATS: Advanced Tobruk System<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Millions of years old, amber is considered a semi-precious jewel used since ancient times. While the best known color of amber is yellow/honey, there are rare varieties of other colors. In Ambar, you want to collect the amber by following dangerous routes to create attractive jewels and sell them to the highest bidder in villas and castles. There are two main play areas:<br/><br/>     The route days, which we will form by picking up cards from the route deck during the turn.<br/>     The action zone, which is made up of four fixed cards in front of each player.<br/><br/><br/>During their turn, a player picks up cards from the route deck, where neutral cards (cream color) and cards that represent dangers of the journey (black cards) will appear. Each card represents one day, and the more days you play (Phase 1 of the turn), the more actions you can take (Phase 2 of the turn). These actions are used to collect amber, produce precious jewels with it, and take them to villages where they can be sold.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two different rounds. The first round comes with fewer resources and involves less danger. The second round adds up the discard cards from the first round mixed with the new cards from the second round. When the cards of the second round are finished, the game ends, and the player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>During the whole game, demons are chasing the players. In the first round there is the snake demon, which chases the player who advances too much (five or more days of travel) and in the second round is the red demon, which always chases the player with the most gold.<br/><br/>Quick turn overview: You take cards from the deck placing them on the board, and some events happen. When you hold, you take actions in your area, one for each card previously played on the board, producing your jewels. Then, you can sell to a trade card to get gold. Later, you can buy something with your gold, improving your resources. At the end of the turn, you will solve the demon cards, if there are any of them in this turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To solve this problem, the Mad Science Foundation was created. Now these &quot;misunderstood geniuses&quot; can finally get the access they need to the four vital building blocks of mad science: Lasers, Dark Matter, Cryptomium, and Sharks.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for each mad scientist who seeks &quot;funding&quot; from the Mad Science Foundation, there remains the unfortunate fact of life that mad scientists do not play well with others. In the quest for infamy, directors will be bribed, resources will be reallocated, spies will be dispatched, inventions will be sabotaged, and big, ominous buttons will be pressed with catastrophic results. Welcome to the Mad Science Foundation, where everyone is ready to stab you in the back with overly-elaborate backstabbing machines.<br/><br/>At heart, Mad Science Foundation is a drafting game. You draft resources to craft wacky inventions and dispatch minions to help with your diabolical plans. Each round, one player controls the Crooked Director for that round. They then separate the available commodities into piles to be drafted. It's up to the scientist controlling the Director to determine the value of whatever resources are available and separate them into piles. Not all piles are created equal! Players then take turns selecting which pile of goodies to grab, with the Director's controller choosing last. Sizing up your competition is key! You know what they need; don't let them have it. Or give them two choices of equal terrible-ness! But each player also has a secret side objective that you may not figure out until it's too late...<br/><br/>By crafting new inventions, you might be able to put together an engine of cards that eventually fuel themselves. Perpetual motion in our lifetime! Or perhaps you might stockpile valuable resources for later exploitation. It's all done with the altruistic goals of megalomania and personal glory in mind. What could go wrong?*<br/><br/><br/>    The Mad Science Foundation is not responsible for stock market crashes, illegal dumping, or tears in the fabric of space-time.<br/><br/><br/>",

Can you wrangle the best sets of monsters, nurture them by collecting their favorite foods, and present the most horrifying group of monsters ever seen on the Island? Do so and you may just be named the new Island Protector...<br/><br/>In Isle of Monsters, a set collection, resource-gathering family game, 2-5 players take the role of monster wranglers attempting to gather the scariest team of monsters they can find in order to compete in the local Scare Faire. Getting screams from the audience gets you acclaim, as does scaring the monsters owned by other players.<br/><br/>Each round, players claim monsters and attempt to feed them their favorite foods to get the beasts ready for the Scare Faire. Each monster that's fully fed by the end of a round goes into that player's hand and participates in the Scare Faire.<br/><br/>Once every player is finished claiming and feeding monsters, a Scare Faire is held. Each player chooses a single color of monster to play from their hand along with as many cards of that color as they wish. Once every player has chosen, the played cards are revealed simultaneously and the player with the highest scare total from their monsters gets three scream points. Players can also get bonus points for scaring other players' monsters or from having more monsters in hand than any other player.<br/><br/>Play continues until there are no more monsters available to replenish the monster decks on the island. The player with the most scream points is declared the victor and Island Protector!<br/><br/>",

Every day players will have to visit various locations, obtaining skills and useful items, repairing their equipment, carrying out tasks and, of course, battling various monsters.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal is to rid the neighborhood of evil. The player who performs best at this task wins the game.<br/><br/>The game's events take place over several 'days' (rounds). Each day players move their characters' figures to various locations to perform available actions. Characters have their own unique sets of equipment:amulet, weapon and item tokens to be used against monsters in combat. The combat resembles a dynamic puzzle: players select weapons and items based on the monster's type, and this choice affects the chances of victory in the fight as well as potential spoils of war. Players gain Victory Points for defeating monsters and successfully carrying out tasks. Whoever obtains more VP by the end of the game becomes the winner.<br/><br/>",

As the commander of an army regiment, U.S. or German, you'll control platoon-sized elements of infantry, armor, artillery, air and support units, each represented by a playing card. Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.<br/><br/>Sold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.<br/><br/>Starters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.<br/><br/>",

You need to discover a way to stop the tragedies from occurring, but there is a Mastermind whose sole purpose is to make sure they unfold. Can you stop the tragedies before the last loop?!<br/><br/>In Tragedy Looper: New Tragedies, 1-3 players are Protagonists attempting to escape a time loop engineered by one player acting as the Mastermind. The Mastermind player selects a script, either one of the 13 scripts included or one created themselves, and sets up the game accordingly. The Protagonist players don't yet know the details of the tragic events about to unfold.<br/><br/>Protagonists and the Mastermind will play cards, activate abilities, and trigger incidents to uncover (or hide!) information and move the events forward. Players will interact with different characters and build relationships with them in order to unlock and activate those characters' helpful special abilities, but of course the Mastermind is attempting to trick and mislead the Protagonists. At the end of each loop, if the Protagonists haven't guessed correctly, they rewind all game components back to the start and try again with more information. If they don't guess correctly on the final loop, the Mastermind wins!<br/><br/>The Tragedy Looper system creates a unique game of deduction in which players begin each new loop better prepared, but the Mastermind player will know what they've learned and can alter their strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>Tragedy Looper: New Tragedies is a standalone game that brings content from original publisher BakaFire into English for the first time, collecting 13 scripts and 30 characters. This game includes a teaching guide for the Mastermind and a &quot;First Steps&quot; tragedy set for the first two scripts to help players get more comfortable with the gameplay loop. Experienced masterminds can also create their own scripts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your goal in Fickle, an inverse set collection card game, is to build the strongest fairy alliance over five rounds and win the Queen's crown. You do this by keeping fairies in your alliance that gain you favor points. Each card represents a single fairy from one of the five families. Each family has a unique power that enables you to improve your alliance and thwart opponents. Each round, you choose a single fairy, playing it into your alliance tableau, then resolve the family power. Easy, except that with all those powers, fairies don't seem to stay in one alliance for long. They tend to be...fickle.<br/><br/>In more detail, to set up before the game, players decide which five fairy suits to use in the game from the 22 suits included in the box. In each round, you are dealt three cards; you look at them, decide on the order in which to stack them, then pass that stack to another player. You'll receive a stack in turn, which is in effect a &quot;press your luck&quot; deck created by an opponent. You look at the top card, then decide whether to keep it or discard it and draw the next card, which you can also discard in favor of the third card. Once the &quot;press your luck&quot; draw is complete, each player has one fairy card in hand, which they play into their alliance, then resolve in order starting with whoever played the card with the highest favor.<br/><br/>After the fifth round, players score each fairy suit in their alliances, and because fairies want equal influence in an alliance, scores are based on an inverse scoring curve:<br/><br/><br/>     1 card of a suit: Score its favor value.<br/>     2 cards: Score 0 points.<br/>     3-4 cards: Lose points equal to the card of this suit with the highest favor.<br/>     5 or more cards of a suit: Score the summed value of all these cards.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest favor score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.<br/><br/>Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.<br/><br/>Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).<br/><br/>Historical Note:<br/>Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Glace et le Ciel is a cooperative game for 2 to 4 players, lasting for about 20 minutes. Players will really depend on each other (no one can lead the party) and that there will be tension crescendo during the part... Just be aware that it will be a question of balance between the elements of water (hydrosphere), the Earth (lithosphere) and Air (atmosphere), as well as the Biosphere at the intersection of all three.<br/><br/>Players will play each their turn in a clockwise direction. On their turn, the player must put one of his cards where they want, provided that the level of the element (Air at the top, Earth in the middle and Water at the bottom). As long as there are still empty spaces on the line of an element, they must be filled, as the next card will be laid over the cards already in place.<br/><br/>A player can never move a card that has already been placed, however they may cover it with another card. As soon as the placing of a card completes the goal of one or more players, or on the contrary destroys their goal, it is revealed. These are the only clues that are given!<br/><br/>When the 12 cards of the first generation are played, players reveal their Objective cards and points are scored. We look if there is=f there is a Co2 card in the ice returning as many ice cards as there are CO2 cards visible. Then we look at the sky level: you add up the number of unbalanced objective cards and subtracting the number of those out of balance to obtain the score. The 2nd sky card with the same value to observe the evolution of the CO2 in the sky.<br/><br/>The philosophy of the game was very largely inspired by the book by Claude Lorius: Voyage dans l'Anthropoc&egrave;ne.<br/><br/>",

Arenas are won by creating the strongest combinations of numbers, and completing each arena also unlocks a special power with a limited number of uses. The powers get exhausted as they're crossed off, incentivizing players to claim them before their opponent. Will you bid your time by spreading your numbers as thinly as possible, or concentrate your forces early to access superior special powers?<br/><br/>As both players always use the same dice rolls to generate their numbers, you cannot rely on luck to win.<br/><br/>The game is a PDF file that can be printed on one sheet of paper and played using one dice and a pencil. Rules are also on one page, so that you can print it with the rules on the back of the sheet. Files are provided for both A4 and Letter size, and it can even be printed in larger sizes such as A1. Players who don't wish to print can use a PNG image file provided to play online.<br/><br/>The game can be played with two players, as a team game with up to 10 players or solo.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The map is divided into 6 regions consisting of 30 territories. Some of the territories contain rough terrain and are harder to attack.<br/><br/>There are 4 different basic starting setups for the 2 players. All of them include a neutral player. To win, a player must keep his capital and achieve 3 goals. All goals are public. For each setup a different combination of 8 of the available 12 goals is used.<br/><br/>In the Command Centre version, one player sets up both sides and the neutrals then the other choses which one to play and who starts. Each side is able to add support to the neutral player, and your defeated armies can be used to gain special bonuses. One of the bonuses even allows you to attack with (some) neutral armies.<br/><br/>Armies are still raised based on the number of territories and any regions you own, but also on the number of cities. As in standard risk, area cards are still gained upon conquering a territory, and can still be used to raise additional armies. The army units are in the shape of small (flat) arrows.<br/><br/>Manufacturer's description (translated from the Dutch edition):<br/>RISK for 2 players. Battle man-to-man in this strategic battle of epic proportions. In this exciting strategy game everything revolves around the conquest and domination of Europe. For 12 years and up.<br/><br/>Two distinct ways to play the game:<br/>Base training - an introductory game which you can play within a few minutes.<br/>Command centre - a fast and exciting strategy game in which everything revolves around conquest and domination.<br/><br/>",

Kit Carson was given command of the US forces, and his mission was to find the Comanche and Kiowa winter camps and eliminate this threat to the settlers that were moving into and through this area of the Texas panhandle.<br/><br/>Adobe Walls shares many similarities with Little Bighorn.  The battle features a famous US leader in Kit Carson, attacking a large Indian camp along a river with a much smaller US force. He is also temporarily separated from the pack train, and the size of the Indian force was greatly underestimated.<br/><br/>&quot;The Battle of Adobe Walls&quot; adds a new weapon to the series, the Mountain Howitzer.

        "description": "Sevilla 1503 draws inspiration from the most important city in Spain and Europe for two hundred years. All the commerce towards the route to the Indies flowed from its port. Many merchants and noble families travelled to Seville in search of wealth and adventure. Now, you can embark on the most advanced ships and go across the ocean to the Americas from the city with the brightest sun, the largest cathedrals and the bravest sailors in Europe!<br/><br/>Sevilla 1503 is a set-collection and auction card game. For eight rounds, players will compete against each other with blind bidding and a re-bidding phase to get sets of cards they must embark on their ships. In addition to the crew, goods, officers and ornaments, players must get a fleet with enough capacity to ship the cards they have won. If they don't have the necessary slots, they will be forced to leave the goods in the port.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will combine the cards they acquired to get as many victory points as possible and ship them on their fleet.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the ancient city of China, a city known for its delicious sweets. As tourists, you can't wait to taste them all &mdash; but before enjoying your sweets, you must learn about a legendary guy named Sweet Nose. He loved sweets so much that he wanted to eat the best sweet in the heaven, and to do that he climbed up a ladder made from shrimp. Just at the moment he reached heaven, the god of thunder met him while patrolling. The god of thunder was pissed because no mortal human was allowed to intrude the sacred heaven. A flash and thunder hit poor Sweet Nose, who fell from the ladder like a meteor and dissolved into a pile of black powder when he hit the ground, transforming into tiny insects &mdash; the ants.<br/><br/>To avoid being hit by thunder and becoming the successor of the Sweet Nose legend, you had better not eat too many sweets. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy those delicious sweets in the city &mdash; but if you enter specific stores on the street, you might need to run from the thunder of heaven...<br/><br/>Sweet Nose is a game of exciting interaction. You try to eat the most types of candy by trading with others, but the sweetness of each candy differs for each player, so to keep yourself from being the one who eats too many sweets, you need to be careful when trading and observe the reaction of other players. What's more, different shops provide different surprises, so you also need to take those shops' candies into consideration. On a turn, you can do one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Trade with friend: Trade one of your candies with another player, with each player placing the candy they receive on their mouth board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Trade with market: Trade one of your candies with the market in the middle of table, placing your candy in the market and one of the market candies on your trading dish board.<br/><br/><br/>In the end, whoever eats the most sweets loses, and the winner is the one who eats the fewest sweets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction in the rulebook:<br/><br/>1812 is a member of the Series: 18xx series of games. The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham. 1812 is set in North-East England in the 19th century. Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Company&iacute;s Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>1812 is a medium length game. Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about three hours to complete a game.<br/><br/>Novices or more deliberate players might add a few hours to that time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction:<br/><br/>Drang Nach Osten! is a historical wargame/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! is a complete wargame of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian Campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/><br/>    Five 21 x 27&quot; mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).<br/>    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:<br/>    Two Europa sheet 1<br/>    One Europa sheet 2<br/>    Three Europa sheet 3<br/>    One Europa sheet 4<br/>    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)<br/>    One rules folder and cover.<br/>    One set of charts and tables consisting of:<br/>        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One Soviet Order of Appearance<br/>        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart<br/>        One German Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One German Order of Appearance<br/>        One German Units Appearing Chart<br/>        Two Combat Results Tables<br/>        One Unit Identification Chart<br/>        One Time Record Chart<br/>        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of thirty cards: villagers numbered 1-17, samurai numbered 18-27, and three &quot;old fools&quot; who have no numbers. (With 3-4 players, you remove cards 1-5 and 23-27 from the game.)<br/><br/>At the start of each round, you deal 4-5 cards to each player, then place the remaining 4-5 cards in a pile called &quot;Goze&quot;. Each player starts with five &quot;Nobori&quot; tokens, each of which has a special power, and a player can choose to play exactly one of these tokens after looking at their cards. These tokens let you look at another player's hand, swap your hand with the Goze, double your points, etc.<br/><br/>The lead player plays a card from their hand, then each player follows, with the highest card played winning the trick, then leading to the next trick. If a samurai (a red card) is played, then each other player must play a samurai, if possible. Otherwise the game has no required plays. An &quot;old fool&quot; played on its own is worthless, but if a second or third &quot;old fool&quot; is played into a trick, then the player of the last such card wins the trick.<br/><br/>Players earn 1 point for each trick won and 1 point for capturing the 16. A player who took no tricks loses 2 points. After 5-9 rounds, depending on the player count, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

If you play a clue that happens to be irrelevant<br/>to the case, you lose points at the end of the game, but be careful! Some clues are vital to resolve the case.<br/><br/>You can share and expose your theories at any moment and talk about the cards you have in your hand but you cannot show them to the other players and you may only read out loud the words written in bold or the text framed inside an image:<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all clue cards have been revealed or discarded, you must check carefully all the available information and prepare a theory of what happened, working all together. Then, open the questionnaire and answer all questions. During this phase of the game, you can speak freely about your discarded cards, or the information you remember of them. Each right answer will add two points.<br/><br/>",

If you use clever tactics, you might even finish off an entire row in one go! Which will win in the end: fire or water?<br/><br/>The 6x6 game board starts with eight tiles of each player &ndash; one being fire, the other water &ndash; in a fixed arrangement. Twelve air tiles and nine earth tiles start play off the board; all of the non-earth tiles have earth on their reverse side. On a turn, a player takes a neutral tile from off the board and slides it onto an edge space, which means at the start of the game the 6x6 border. If this edge space is occupied, the neutral tile pushes those tiles before it. If a non-earth tile is pushed off the edge of the board, flip it to the earth side. Earth tiles can be moved, but they cannot be pushed off the board!<br/><br/>If an outer edge of the playing area ever contains only tiles of the same element, remove these tiles from the board. These spaces are now off-limits on future turns. Thus, when the first edge is removed, pretend that the playing area is 5x6; when the second edge is removed, the playing area will be 4x6 or 5x5. Removing one row of tiles might cause another row to be removed afterward.<br/><br/>As soon as either fire or water are eliminated from the playing area, the opposing player wins.<br/><br/>",

In the card game Pungi, everybody knows what kinds of animals each player has in their hand, but they don't know the number values. The rewards you can earn are displayed in the middle of the table. Is it a good idea to go catching snakes together with another player &ndash; or is it better to try it alone?<br/><br/>With your animal cards, try to lure the most valuable snakes without attracting too many poisonous ones. Snake charmers can be of some help turning negative points into positive ones at the end of the game &mdash; but if you don&rsquo;t have any negative points, the snake charmer will turn your positive points into negative points! Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

If you become Shaman, your decisions affect events, so your rivals will try to influence you by fair means or foul...<br/><br/>Your aim is to score the most points by having treasures in your hut and natives in your reserve at the end of the fifth round. Treasures are the key: Each round you collect one from each island on which your tribe has a majority (or a minority, if other tribes are tied there). Cards let you move treasures, place natives on islands, bring them home, or move them between islands. In each round everyone plays one card face up in front of ANY player (including themselves), followed by another card, face down (also in front of anyone). Lastly, you may place one native on any played card &mdash; even a hidden card played by an opponent, if you are very bold! &mdash; to copy its effect for yourself. The background to each card is one of four colors, but in each round only cards of two colors will be resolved, affecting the players in front of whom they are played. The Shaman determines these colors by turning over one of two condition cards. If you are the Shaman, use your power to best effect; otherwise try to outguess the others or influence the Shaman. Remember the number of treasures in other players' huts and manage your natives carefully &ndash; a few points can make the difference!<br/><br/>Scheming, double-guessing, and bluffing: Welcome to Costa Ruana!<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Kunst&quot; contains historical events related to art, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

You can use it as a material or perform the action described on it. You can also strengthen your action by activating one of the 2 dice you will have. However, beware, every time you play the card you will cause the passage of time and you will forced to move your pawn to next district in the city! You will be able to take advantage of the action given by each district, but keep in mind that you will not be able to use the same region in subsequent rounds. Therefore, plan your moves in advance. Will you use the die to strengthen the action on the card? Or maybe you will use them to get more materials? Or maybe it is worth giving up one and the other to unlock previously used districts?

In the game, up to four players are tasked with forming a party of adventurers and combining their powers to defeat a series of bosses. As a cooperative fantasy-themed boss-battle game, players must synergize their abilities and employ effective combat strategies&mdash;via the utilization of items and their characters' unique class abilities&mdash;to defeat a collection of bosses.<br/><br/>Each character in Wild Hunt Festival has an assigned role (or class) such as attacker, healer, defender, etc. These characters possess their own combat statistics, strengths &amp; weaknesses, and class-specific skills that all must be leveraged throughout each battle and in conjunction with one another to overcome the game's challenging monsters.<br/><br/>There are two modes of play in Wild Hunt Festival. Story Mode, which is the game's primary play mode, offers a campaign-like progression system where players start at level 1 and take on a series of bosses, leveling between each fight. In Challenge Mode, players start at the level 4 (max level) and fight a single super-charged boss.<br/><br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

The game is divided in Turns, every Turn is completed when each Player completes his Round.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the cards are placed in two rows, Characters and Gems, for a total of seven columns. Each column represents a City. Every city has two slots one for a Character one for a Resource.<br/><br/>During his Round a Player can execute three Actions from a list of six:<br/><br/>    Travel to another City <br/>    Buy Gems or Gold <br/>    Craft Jewels or Gems <br/>    Interact with a Character: Sell a Jewel or a Gem, hire a Mercenary or fight a Monster <br/>    Refill City slots if empty <br/>    Earn a Coin<br/><br/><br/>The Player can travel between the columns, which represent Cities. Traveling between Cities costs Coins.<br/><br/>The Player can buy a Gem from his current City and add it to his hand.<br/>Before a Jewel or a Gem can be sold, the Player has to spend a crafting action to lay the cards down. To craft a Jewel the Player needs also the right combination of Gems and Gold. So each Player always has a round to plot against the seller.<br/><br/>Selling a Jewel or a Gem to a Buyer means discarding it and earning its value in Coins. Mercenaries and Monsters can hinder or favor the Players. After a Player interacts with any Character, the card is added to the discard pile.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn the Cities are repopulated with new Characters and Gems. At this time many Events can be triggered.<br/>The game ends when a City can&rsquo;t be refilled at the start of the Turn.<br/><br/>The Player with most Coins wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It covers the Allied attempts to push convoys through the Norwegian and Barents Seas while German aircraft, submarines and surface ships try to stop them. Famous convoy operations like those of PQ12 and PQ17, British carrier raids, German-Soviet destroyer skirmishes along the Arctic coast &mdash; all of these and more are included. Like all games in the series, this one come stuffed with scenarios and variations on them.<br/><br/>Most scenarios are very straightforward &mdash; each side knows what the other must do. The Allied player has large convoys of vital merchant shipping that must reach their destination. The German player has bases in Norway well-placed to intercept them, with submarines and aircraft that can hit them almost continuously. As in Bomb Alley, aircraft are drawn in a semi-random fashion so neither player has perfect intelligence about their numbers and location. German surface ships are few in number, but there's a lot of open sea in which they can hide and strike the convoys at vulnerable moments. And with war raging simultaneously on many other fronts, the convoy escort forces are stretched very, very thin.<br/><br/>There are two maps, covering the Norwegian and Barents Seas from Iceland in the southwest to Novaya Zemlya in the northeast, from the Norwegian coast to the Arctic pack ice. It's one of the larger play areas in the Second World War at Sea series, and unlike Leyte Gulf's three maps, both of these are in use in almost every scenario. Players quickly get a sense of the huge and desolate oceans in which they must operate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A continuation of the Set A Watch series, Forsaken Isles features a new band of adventurers sailing to islands and other tropical locations to face new monsters and challenges.<br/><br/>Defend your campfire from a horde of creatures and unhallowed bosses using each hero's unique abilities to survive the night. One hero stays in camp to rest and maintain the fire while the others battle. Each round, you draw a new location to setup camp in. Survive all 8 nights (rounds) to win the game.<br/><br/>New adventurers include:<br/><br/>    Corsair who earns coin by defeating enemies and mitigates bad dice rolls by taking gambles.<br/>    Druid who has their own unique nature deck full of animals that will aid him in battle. This deck can allow the Druid to shapeshift or seed the creature deck with his animal allies.<br/>    Earth Golem with d12 dice whose powers trigger off the location card for each round of the game. It can use stored earth essence to pip up its dice when bad luck strikes, making it one of the most consistent warriors in the series.<br/>    Fire Sorceress who draws her power from the campfire itself. Drawing too much from the fire means you can see less enemies in the darkness so balancing offensive abilities with her other abilities that rekindle the campfire are essential.<br/><br/><br/>Set a Watch: Forsaken Isles is both a standalone game for 1-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with the original Set A Watch and Set A Watch: Swords of the Coin.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "17 October 1903: The Esperanza ends up in a terrible storm and loses its battle against the elements. 163 people lose their lives, but a small group survives this disaster and washes ashore on the isle Juan Ansidad. For weeks they wait, hoping to be rescued, but they slowly run out of food. They come to realize that if they ever want to get home again, they will have to take matters into their own hands. A raft is carefully put together and with a small ration four brave survivors try their luck on the Pacific, looking for salvation. You have found the logbook in which the four survivors wrote down their adventures &mdash; their story, which lasted 21 days.<br/><br/>In the dice-driven survival board game 21 Days, you relive the events of 21 days recorded in this recovered logbook. The purpose of the game is to have (at least) one of the survivors rescued by the rescue ship on the 21st day. You do this by following the events described in the logbook and having the survivors, represented by two stacked dice per survivor, choose and perform actions on the various locations on the game board by using their placement dice.<br/><br/>Don't lose too many planks of the raft or else you will lose some of your survivors as well! In 21 Days, the four survivors are stuck together on a raft made out of six planks that are held loosely together. Some events during the 21 days may cause some planks to drift off. There are ways to prevent this, like saving up hope tokens or picking the right bottle cards. When the rescue ship enters the final spot on the rescue track and there are still survivors left on the raft, you will be saved and win the game.<br/><br/>21 Days is a dice-driven, Ameritrashy, game, so a lot depends on how you will roll the dice! However, there are ways to alter the dice, plan ahead, and make use of your survivor's special skills.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.21daysboardgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.21daysboardgame.com</a><br/><br/>",

For the audience in Showtime! that wants to enjoy the offered blockbusters and score points, the right seating choice is the all-important factor. They want to avoid having tall men in front of them, children who are blowing bubbles in the middle of the row, or purses blocking neighboring seats. Many moviegoers also have certain preferences. They would like to sit together with their partner, be surrounded by men or women, or sit in the first row. One can only hope that before the start of a show, a riot doesn't break out and chase people away from their chosen seats. Whoever's visitors have had the most pleasure in the cinema after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>Showtime!

Units clash in the skirmishes, but the fight is gritty, with little time to think and plan as sand timers dictate the activation of your units. When a unit moves, attacks, cast spells, or uses a special ability in Wartime: The Battle of Valyance Vale, a sand timer is flipped. The unit cannot be used again until the sand timer is drained, then that sand timer (or another one) can be used to activate the unit again. Manage your sand timers, as well as your unit actions, wisely. Sand timers come in different times: 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds. Scenarios use other timers in time-sensitive missions.<br/><br/>Wartime: The Battle of Valyance Vale features scenario-based play, with branching missions depending on the outcome of the previous mission. Configure your own units to fight in player-designed missions or mix up the unit configurations when playing the game's missions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms is a narrative miniatures game based on The Elder Scrolls video game franchise by Bethesda Game Studios. The game features scenarios ranging from dungeon delves in which you seek out lost treasure, to running battles across the ruined outposts that dot the landscape of Tamriel, all the while fulfilling quests and narrative-driven scenario objectives that will see your band of heroes grow from game to game. Will you claim the ruined fort as yours and build your own settlement, or wander the countryside clearing out foul ruins of the stench of your enemies?<br/><br/>Players can play against each other or team up (or play solo) to take on all manner of creatures and adversaries driven by an advanced AI system along the lines of the one in Fallout: Wasteland Warfare'. In addition to controlling troops, you need to manage the stamina and Magicka resources your characters bring to the table, all the while watching out for hostile AI-driven enemies and narrative events that can change the flow of battle.<br/><br/>The game features 32mm resin figures of heroes familiar to those who know the video games: Hadvar, Ralof, Yrsarald Thrice-Pierced, Marcurio, Mjoll the Lioness, Ulfric Stormcloak, Galmar Stone-Fist, General Tullius,&nbsp;and Lydia.<br/><br/>",

Across the eastern half of the United States the national pastime is taking shape. The leagues are settling into traditional formats that will remain unchanged for decades.<br/><br/>You are an owner of one of the charter franchises, a leader with the money and vision to grow the game into its modern form. Invest wisely &ndash; it is not only the team on the field that matters, but also the stadium, media, and fans that can set you up for success! This is not a baseball game simulation; this is a game about building a baseball dynasty. Your business savvy and skills will win the day.<br/><br/>Lords of Baseball is for 1-4 players (expandable to 6 or 8 and can even be expanded to 16 with two base games and 4 expansions). Lords of Baseball takes about 40 minutes per season to play. It is a card-driven strategy game that unfolds over multiple seasons (you can choose to play a short, medium, or long game).<br/><br/>A game of Lords of Baseball is played out over a pre-determined number of seasons (three, five, or seven). Each player has a team and stadium mat where they track the progress and development of the franchise. Players will utilize the various card decks to alter their team&rsquo;s abilities and to gain competitive edges during series against their opponents. Results are tracked on the main game board. Wins each season, fan support and victory points are shown there. In general players need to balance three objectives: winning games, earning money, and improving their stadiums. Be careful, it is easy to lose focus on one category and fail to score as well as someone that keeps all three balls in play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GAME OVERVIEW<br/>Space Movers is a cooperative sci-fi adventure set in the year 2201. In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.<br/><br/>Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.<br/><br/>To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)<br/><br/>- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic<br/>How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.<br/><br/>- Comic Book Included<br/>The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.<br/><br/>- Game Soundtrack <br/>Listen to the official game soundtrack on your computer or smart phone.<br/><br/>",

For example, in a 5-player game, up to 3 of them could have<br/>the intermediate card that gives the victory in Round 3.<br/><br/>When all 3 Rounds have been played, the starting player becomes Dealer.<br/>Thereby, all players will be Dealer once throughout the game.<br/>In each Round -in order, beginning with the starting player- players secretly<br/>choose a card from their hand and place it in their playing area face down<br/>They must choose between:<br/>- Exchange your card with the player on the left (they cannot refuse). The<br/>Dealer player has no players on their left. If you&rsquo;re Dealer and want to<br/>exchange your card, you can do it with the deck, first declaring it aloud. To<br/>do this, you must lift one or more cards at a time without looking. The card<br/>revealed after this cut is your new card.<br/>- To fold, that is, to keep the card that you&rsquo;ve chosen or that&rsquo;s been given to<br/>you after a previous exchange.<br/>- Use the ability of the card, if possible (Merchant, Thief, Juggler and Dragon).<br/>- If you have cards in hand, change the card with one of your hand.<br/>Once all the players have played, reveal players&acute;cards to activate the abilities<br/>&ldquo;At the end of the Round...&rdquo; of the cards that have this ability (Innkeeper,<br/>Jester, Monk, Sorceress, Knight, Princess and Queen).<br/><br/>The winners of each Round score a point. To indicate that they take the score<br/>markers and place them in their playing area according to their points value.<br/>Once the 3 Rounds have been played, the deck is formed and shuffled again,<br/>and a new turn begins.<br/>When the last Dealer player&rsquo;s turn is finished, the points are counted. The<br/>SECOND player with the most victory points is declared an absolute winner<br/>of Death Over The Kingdom until the next game!<br/>In case all players are tied in highest and lowest points, no player wins this<br/>game. You will have to play again!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941 is a two-player wargame simulating two campaigns located in the Horn of Africa - Italy vs. Ethiopia in 1935-1936, and the British Commonwealth and Ethiopia vs. Italy in 1940-1941. The scenarios use a common rule set combined with scenario-specific rules. Regular units are mostly divisions, brigades and regiments, while irregular units include warrior levies and tribal bands. Armor, transports, air power, and headquarters (which represent corps-level artillery assets, engineers, and administrative and command centers) are also represented. Lion of Judah has one large-hex map and approximately 400 counters representing Italian, Ethiopian, Commonwealth, French and German units.  In addition to the military units, there are markers to track game and unit status, as well as several Random Event markers used in the historical scenarios for added historical flavor.<br/><br/>Colonial Warfare in Unforgiving Conditions.<br/>The campaigns for Ethiopia were fought in extremely inhospitable terrain. Logistics was one of the key issues of these battles. This is simulated in Lion of Judah by supply counters: everything a modern army requires to operate, from replacements to ammunition to artillery, has to be moved across the harsh terrain. Western units have far more firepower that the Ethiopians, but much lower movement rates. This simulates the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; rate of movement for western units when moving across difficult terrain. They had to move through jungles, mountains and marshes, relying on local guides to move through this mostly-unmapped terrain.  Supplies often had to go by air due to lack of a road network. Western forces may attempt to move at a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; movement rate (using the &ldquo;Forced march&rdquo; table), but this entails risks: units may get lost, run out of supply, lose their pack mules, or even be ambushed. Unlike the Italians, the Ethiopian army of 1935 was a medieval-style collection of warriors, with little or no central command. This is simulated through activation rules: Ethiopian forces are activated randomly, and some may end up not activating at all during an entire turn! The Italian player may also &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; certain Ethiopian formations into inactivity, as they did historically.<br/><br/>Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare.<br/>Both historical campaigns, have conventional and unconventional warfare. In 1935-36, the Ethiopian army engaged a conventional Italian army in the north and south, while at the same time fighting rebels and tribal guerrillas in the far off corners of the Empire. In 1940-41, it was the Italian Army who had to face both a conventional, professional enemy (the Commonwealth forces) and Ethiopian guerrillas and Commonwealth special forces operating in its rear.<br/>To win, players must successfully manage both kinds of warfare, guerrilla and conventional. When invading Ethiopia in 1935-36, the Italian player must invest resources to encourage trouble within the Ethiopian Empire, recruiting irregulars, bribing and encouraging rebellions. If the Italian player concentrates exclusively on the conventional military front, then the Ethiopian Empire will have a chance to concentrate its armies and achieve a resounding, glorious Adowa-like victory over the Italian invaders.<br/><br/>Similarly, in the 1940-41 campaign the Commonwealth/Ethiopian player must raise rebel forces to force the Italian player to use desperately needed units to defend their lines of communications and cities. Furthermore, the Italian player has an 'Italian Prestige Index', which determines the chance of internal revolts.  He must attack British held territories and outposts as much as possible to keep his Prestige high, especially early in the game before the full might of the Commonwealth army can be brought to bear. The uncertainty regarding Italian defeats in Libya  (handled via event chits) adds further randomness as it is not guaranteed that the British and Indian units that were historically available in January 1941 will arrive in time for the Allied counteroffensive in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Diplomacy and other Chrome<br/>A random events system similar to that used in The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 accounts for political and diplomatic events, rebellions in the rear, the arrival of combat units, the purchase of foreign weapons (in the 1935-1936 Scenario) or the arrival of blockade runners to Italian East Africa. Pressure exerted by various political actors is also simulated through events chits: for instance, the event &ldquo;Pressure by Mussolini&rdquo; (1935-36 Scenario), simulates pressure from il Duce when he demanded a rapid advance on to Addis Ababa before he lost the favorable international situation. The Italian player may use chemical weapons, but at the risk of losing Italian Victory Points if the &ldquo;League of Nations&rdquo; event is pulled that turn.<br/><br/>Special units and rules cover the above mentioned Italian chemical warfare, as well as road building, supply dumps, Italian fuel and ammo shortages (1940-1941 scenario), open cities, the Red Sea Flotilla and blockade runners. The countersheet includes exotic units, such as the Somali Camel Corps, the Italo-German motorized company (a German volunteer unit that was recruited among German refugees from Kenya and crews of interned German ships), and Mission 101 or Gideon Force (Orde Wingate&rsquo;s guerrilla force operating in the Italian rear).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This two-player card game recreates the drama of the day Allied soldiers went ashore in occupied France, 6 June 1944. Each of the historic landing beaches - Gold, Juno, Sword, Omaha and Utah - is represented by its own card, as are the defending German divisions and attacking Allied units. The Allied player must marshal his resources to gain and secure control of every beach by day's end: one run-through of the 110-card deck.<br/><br/>The tension in the game increases with each card thrown, like the build up in a close baseball game. At first it seems the Allies have resources to meet every crisis across the beachheads, but if a key airborne division gets scattered across the countryside, allowing a counterattacking panzer division to slip through the perimeter, everything can change instantly. And an Allied unit committed to one beach, where you might find the defense isn't as strong as you thought, can't be called back in time to rush to the true danger zone. Both players must constantly be thinking ahead, looking for ways to best utilize their cards several throws down the line.<br/><br/>Lightning Game Series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally released in 1977 and 1978, the two first releases in The Fantasy Trip series, Melee and Wizard, were out of Steve Jackson's reach during the eighties when the classic Pocket Box was first produced. Finally, we're able to present these two great games in an 80s-styled package, making this the &quot;What If?&quot; edition you're sure had to have existed in the early days of gaming.<br/><br/>Melee -- Create characters in just a few minutes -- then send them into the arena. Winners become stronger and faster for the next battle. Losers die.<br/><br/>Each counter in this fast-moving game is a single warrior. Players choose weapons and tactics for their fighters, and send them into combat against men, beasts, or monsters -- to victory, or death.<br/><br/>Wizard -- The magic companion to Melee -- sorcerous combat, in the arena or in the dungeon.<br/><br/>Create your wizard, choose his spells, and go into combat. Zap your foe with fireballs or lightning. Summon giants, dragons, and wolves to destroy them all. Or be subtle and entangle them with Magic Rope and Slippery Floor spells. Successful wizards gain skill and power. Losers die.<br/><br/>Includes rules, classic-sized counters and maps, and three 12mm d6. Two games in one!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the old west of The Long Road, players have the difficult task of leading large herds of beef through prairies and highlands to the livestock markets. In the course of the journey, players try to guide the long caravan according to the most favorable route. Once they finally get to the destination, they split the proceeds from the sale. This division, however, doesn't happen fairly, but according to the rules of the far west: The best armed (or the smartest) takes most of the booty.<br/><br/>A player's turn takes place as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    You MAY change your caravan cards.<br/>    You MUST play one caravan card on a destination.<br/>    You MAY play a character card if you didn't before on this destination.<br/>    You MAY apply the effect of the caravan card.<br/>    You MAY buy one weapon.<br/>    You MAY assign weapons to one character.<br/>    You MUST draw cards to refill your hand of three caravan cards.<br/><br/><br/>When a destination is full, the sale takes place and the players get proceeds from the caravan cards based on the effects and values of the characters they've played, a value that could be increased by weapons. Then character cards are split as well.<br/><br/>The game continues until the fourth sale triggers the end. At that point, the richest player wins.<br/><br/>",

The only thing you need is perceptual and reliable memory since you can always see only the topmost cards of your sets!<br/><br/>The game provides different experience depending on the number of players: with 2 players it is a brain burner and you can count on some tense competition, with 3-4-5 players the game provides much more tactical possibilities and players need to pay more attention to the gameplay &ndash; only of course, if they want to win &ndash;, while with 6-7-8 players it turns into a fun party game.<br/><br/>Players try to collect sequences of the different fruits. Players can start any number of fruit sequences, but they can only have one sequence of each kind of fruit (e.g. they cannot have two plum sequences on their own playing area), so they can compile 6 different sequences at most. Your aim is to get all 5 of the collected fruits with different numbers (from 1 to 5). If somebody collected a sequence which does not meet these demands, they will get less points or none. (If you collected from 1 to 5 &ndash; 11 points, if number 1 is missing from a sequence &ndash; 0 point, if a number occurs more than once in a sequence &ndash; 0 point!)<br/><br/>The player who collects the highest number of points using their excellent memory skills will be the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tal der Abenteuer gives us a two-sided gameboard with an adventure on each side.  There are pawns in four colors, but players do not lay claim to them.  Instead, the players play cards capable of moving one of the pawns forward along the paths.  The paths diverge often, giving players a chance to send pawns on longer routes or to get them back onto shorter routes.  Getting a pawn to certain spaces rewards the player who moved it with gold, diamonds or additional cards (randomly assigned by face-down &quot;stepping-stone&quot; markers).<br/><br/>Once a player moves a pawn onto the temple, the end-zone of the path, the first round ends.  That player gets 1 diamond.<br/><br/>Next, the players are rewarded and/or penalized for the cards left in their hands, based on the zone the pawns have ended in.  A card for the pawn in the end zone (the one that ended the round) earns +3 gold, +2 for pawns in the second zone, +1 for those in the third, 0 for those in the fourth and -1 for those in the fifth.<br/><br/>Now the board is flipped to the second side and a similar adventure embarked upon.  This second side has an additional feature: bridges that are destroyed after crossing, further complicating the choices about divergent paths.  At the end of the second side, when a pawn reaches the goal, diamonds are counted and the player with the most diamonds gets 12 gold and second-most gets 6 gold.  Cards remaining in hand are again paid off according to the zone the pawn of that color finished in.  The game ends after this final scoring, and the player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>Winner of Austrian Spiel der Spiele 2006.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>Keytown is a game for two to five players lasting approximately 60 to 75 minutes. Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.<br/><br/>In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.<br/><br/>Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes. Rules and components are in English and German.<br/><br/>Keytown is Richard Breese's third game in the key series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Vote: Suffrage and Suppression in America is a game about voting rights in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One player, called Equality, advocates for the passage of two amendments to the constitution. The seventeenth amendment transforms the Senate into an elected body, while the nineteenth secures the rights of women to vote. The opposing player, called Supremacy, not only opposes this, but also seeks to entrench racist methods of voter suppression, intimidation, and discrimination &mdash; structures that will still be in place after the game ends and for decades longer. Equality's victory will be incomplete; it still remains incomplete today.<br/><br/>This game is something of a companion piece to the same designer's 2018 release, This Guilty Land. It shares many of the same mechanical features: Cards are dealt into and played from a face-up events display, with the function of the card depending upon its type rather than a one-off event. Once used, cards can be taken into a reserve, forming a sort of permanent hand that can be used to act and react. Cards are drawn and kept in reserve according to a player's organizational capacity, which is increased over the course of the game through play of an organization card.<br/><br/>Special attention is paid this time around to the tension between federal and state politics. It is through legislative victories at the local level that Equality will make passage of its amendments inevitable. Supremacy not only will attempt to oppose these gains, but can even reverse them through judicious intervention of the Supreme Court. Two elements that separate this game from its predecessor are the presence of passive abilities that trigger when a card in reserve remains face-up at the end of a turn and the use of region cards to perform free &quot;bonus&quot; actions.<br/><br/>If This Guilty Land was about systems that broke in the face of a clear moral evil, then The Vote sees those same systems functioning as intended. Equality can achieve its aims within the system, but so can Supremacy, making the game one of both triumphs and failures.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In Magus, the players embody powerful sorcerers who send heroes under their control to plunder the castle of Ardeth, their mentor, as they crave the treasures and secrets that are hidden there.<br/>In a game the players must fulfill missions and different objectives until obtaining 10 dominion points and thus to proclaim the new lord of the castle. In addition to controlling a hero, the player has spells at his disposal with which he can alter the very structure of the castle.<br/>In a Magus turn, a player can perform up to 2 normal actions (move, attack, play spells, among others) and any number of quick actions (use knowledge, advance missions, use relics, etc.) Each action has a cost that must be paid with energy from one of the two existing wells: Well of power (Green) and Well of control (purple). As the game progresses players will gain energy that they can freely assign to their power or control reserve as needed for one or the other action.<br/>The Magus main play mode is competitive, each player will try to reach before the rest to the 10 dominion points using his hero and his spells to delay the advance of enemies. But there is also the cooperative mode, in which players must defeat the powerful archmage Ardeth. For this they must travel the castle accomplishing different objectives that reduce the dominion of the archmage before he arrives at the castle for the final combat.<br/>In cooperative mode, the Dominion points are the way of measuring Ardeth's strength, which players must reduce as much as possible whilst preparing for his arrival. When the archmage appears in the castle players must face him, and the life of Ardeth will be determined by the dominion gained at the moment of his appearance.<br/><br/><br/>Magus: Aura Mortis es una reimplementaci&oacute;n de Magus: &quot;Fortuna et nostis&quot;.

Ademas de controlar a un h&eacute;roe, el jugador tiene conjuros a su disposici&oacute;n con los que podr&aacute; alterar la estructura misma del castillo.<br/>En un turno de Magus un jugador puede realizar hasta 2 acciones normales (mover, atacar, jugar conjuros, entre otras) y cualquier cantidad de acciones r&aacute;pidas (usar saberes, avanzar misiones, usar reliquias, entre otras. Cada acci&oacute;n tiene un costo que debe ser pagado siempre fichas de energ&iacute;a de alguno de los dos tipos existentes. Existe la energ&iacute;a de poder (de color verde) y la energ&iacute;a de control (de color violeta. A medida que avanza la partida los jugadores ir&aacute;n ganando energ&iacute;a que podr&aacute;n asignar libremente a su reserva de poder o de control seg&uacute;n la necesitar para una u otra acci&oacute;n. <br/>El modo principal de juego de Magus es competitivo, cada jugador intentar&aacute; llegar antes que el resto a los 10 puntos de dominio vali&eacute;ndose de su h&eacute;roe y sus conjuros para retrasar el avance de sus enemigos. Pero tambi&eacute;n existe el modo cooperativo, aqu&iacute; los jugadores deben derrotar al poderoso archimago Ardeth. Para ello deben recorrer el castillo cumpliendo distintos objetivos que reduzcan el dominio del archimago antes de que este llegue al castillo para el combate final. <br/>En el modo cooperativo los puntos de dominio miden la fuerza de Ardeth, y los jugadores deben reducirlo lo mas posible mientras se preparan para su llegada.

        "description": "Chili Mafia is a set-collection party card game for 2-8 players. Compete to assemble the most powerful Chili Pepper Gangs (sets of cards) and become the most respected mafia boss. In Chili Mafia, you will find existing Chili Peppers from around the world that are the main characters of the game. Just to mention a few, such well-known Chilies as the Jalape&ntilde;o, the Tabasco or the Carolina Reaper clash with each other. To reflect hierarchy, each pepper carries points that are in proportion to the respective Chili Pepper's strength on the Scoville scale. Moreover, the game includes various action and attack cards (inspired by Mafia jargon) that will not necessarily serve your interest. To win, score the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>[CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]<br/><br/>Things are heating up in the world. Chili peppers are splitting into factions, leading to organized crime and unrest. The Chili Mafia reigns supreme.<br/>The Ministry of International Chili Security has hired you&mdash;a group of agents&mdash;to work undercover and round up the most wanted chili pepper mafiosi from around the globe. Your goal is to bring them to Mexico for a peace summit.  As you arrive in the Chihuahuan desert, the spicy criminals jump out of your luggage. It&rsquo;s obvious they have no interest in peace. Instead, they want a showdown. You and your fellow agents have no choice but to seize control of the Chili Mafia. But to gain their respect, you must fight amongst yourselves to determine who will be the most powerful mafia boss. Once you control the peppers, what will you do next?<br/><br/>Players draw and play cards to form gangs and perform actions.  When a player draws the last card from the draw pile, they may complete their turn. Then every player (including the one that drew the last card) may take 1 more turn. After the last round, players calculate their scores.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

When you do conquer an area with three of your pawns and cover it with one of your tiles, you return those pawns to your supply.

        "description": "Right Fierce &amp; Terrible simulates the battle in 1340 between English King Edward III and a French fleet assembled to carry King Philip VI&rsquo;s invasion across the English Channel. It was the first major battle of the Hundred Years War, and although it was a naval encounter &ndash; the English fleet attacked their French adversaries in the estuary before Bruges &ndash; it was decided by sword, hammer and arrow. Confined to cog and barge, retreat was not an option for marines in this desperate fight. Despite being outnumbered and in foreign waters, the English fleet annihilated its adversary. Edward captured nearly all his rival&rsquo;s ships and slew a horde of soldiers and mariners that day, boasting that bodies were washing onto Flemish beaches for days.<br/><br/>Designed by Jeremy White, this is an unusual game. Players &ldquo;build&rdquo; the battlefield as they go. By navigating their squadrons of galleys, nefs and cogs through the estuary they create the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; upon which the knights and men-at-arms will vie for supremacy. Success hinges on the ability to deliver marines and archers against weak points, or in giving your opponent no choice but to hit your fleet where it is strongest. The English will have the longbow and a high freeboard, as well as the benefit of the wind gauge in many scenarios, but if played smartly the French will manage to offset those advantages, applying his weight of numbers irresistibly against the English king&rsquo;s bid to rule France. Scenarios treat the variety of questions that puzzle historians about this battle, and since the game is not complex and plays under three hours, it offers a chance to explore many angles of historical interpretation.<br/><br/>Right Fierce &amp; Terrible has one 22 by 34 inch map, oversized die cut counters, accessible rules with extensive illustrated examples of play, and seven scenarios with set-up diagrams for a quick start. Regardless of the scenario played, however, casualties will be horrendous, and there are tough decisions to make. Archery, ramming, grappling and melee are the tools of conquest here. The battle is likely to ebb and flow, squadrons can be captured, liberated, and captured again. Leaders, including King Edward, can also be captured and liberated, or killed by a stray arrow, or if nabbed, executed on the spot. Would Edward&rsquo;s demise have spared Flanders and France one hundred years of war? Knights can perform acts of heroism to avert disaster, but at great cost to themselves. Each fleet&rsquo;s morale will gradually deteriorate as the battle grows more desperate&hellip;until at last, one fleet finally breaks and the day is won!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ghooost! is a fast, easy-to-learn card game with a Halloween-based theme and lots of twists and turns! Play your cards wisely to get rid of all the ghosts, undead, vampires, zombies and other spooky creatures haunting your mansion. Block your opponents while they're trying to drive spirits out of their home and into your backyard &ndash; but beware as the scariest ghosts will not be driven away so easily...<br/><br/>In game terms, your goal in Ghooost! is to get rid of all of your cards in hand and in your mansion by playing a card (or several matching cards) equal to or higher than the one(s) played previously. To set up, each player has four ghost cards in hand and 4-12 cards in his mansion. Ghost cards come in four suits and have values ranging from 1 to 14, with a few cards having special powers; scary (red) ghosts, for example, can be topped only by fearless ghosts, other scary ghosts, or a ghost quartet, while fearless ghosts can be played no matter what's on top of the Cemetery (discard pile).<br/><br/>A game consists of two stages. In the first stage, players draw or play cards to prepare their hand of cards for the second stage. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Play one or more matching cards on the Cemetery equal to or higher than the cards played previously, then refill your hand to four cards by drawing from the Crypt (deck).<br/>    Take all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand; any card can be played on an empty Cemetery.<br/>    Draw one card from the Crypt and try to play it, taking all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand if the play isn't valid.<br/><br/><br/>Once the Crypt is empty, the second stage begins and players take turns either playing valid cards into the Cemetery or taking all cards from the Cemetery into their hand. If a player plays two or three matching ghosts, he takes another turn immediately; if he plays four cards that match (or plays cards that complete a quartet), those cards and the Cemetery are removed from play, then he takes another turn. If a player's hand is empty, he draws the top card from his mansion, playing it if valid and taking all the Cemetery cards into his hand if not. If a player empties his hand and mansion, he's out and the others keep playing. Play continues until only one player has cards in hand; this player loses the game and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>Ghooost! includes a scoring system that allows for multiple rounds.<br/><br/>",

The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.<br/><br/>",

Based on the system originally used in A las Barricadas!, the first game in the War Storm Series, La Bataille de France 1940incorporates new and adapted rules for the World War 2 era. The War Storm Series promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict.<br/><br/>The War Storm Series<br/><br/>The War Storm Series is a game series designed to simulate combined arms company level combat. Each game in the series has numerous scenarios allowing players to simulate a number of company or battalion level combats.<br/><br/>All War Storm Series games are of moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions, include create improved positions, entrench, replace officers, road-blocks, clear wire, units in Reaction, double time movement, load-upload, minefields, fortifications, rubble, barbed wire, dragoon teeth, anti-tank ditch and pontoon bridges. The various units include leaders, infantry, political commissars, priests, MMGs, mortars, artillery, AT guns, vehicles, armored vehicles, tanks, aircraft close support squadrons, aircraft bombardment squadrons, and even cavalry.<br/><br/>War Storm Series games are based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is company level with units representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews.

The ranks are polygon shapes where increased complexity means increased trick value: line, triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, octagon.  The suits are colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.  So there are 6 ranks and 6 suits.  There are also 6 circle cards, three white and three black, which act as trump cards.<br/><br/>The player draws a hand of 13 cards and plays one trick for each card.  The AI opponent ECK is the remaining cards, and in each trick the player plays one card and ECK plays one card based on the rules for following suit.<br/><br/>There are 7 trick cards numbered 2,4,6,8,10,12, and 13/0. The player's goal is, at the end of each round, to have won exactly the number of tricks shown on one of the available trick cards, collecting that card if successful.  Collecting 4 trick cards wins the game, though there are ways for ECK to win also.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of each round, or age, players are dealt a hand of 8 to 10 cards, and then draft four additional cards which represent the units in their army. After melding card sets, players move a pawn on the game board to determine a battle's location. Players win battles to claim control over regions and for the right to choose the next battle's location.<br/><br/>Valuable temples and useful portals add excitement to the board.

        "description": "Arcanum is played with a regular Tarot deck, used to move the game pieces on the board. There are four noble Houses, fighting for power and supremacy in a medieval city. They are named after the four Tarot suits: Pentacles, Chalices, Swords and Wands. Players will represent different paths for Fate, and will try to shape the destiny of those Houses to best suit their goals.<br/><br/>The game is played over 6 or 9 turns, and at every turn each player has the opportunity to hide one (and sometimes more) cards under the board in front of him (this is called &quot;influencing&quot; the Houses and it's like a hidden bet on the house, trying to get control over it) and to play cards for their effects (Major Arcana cannot be hidden but have stronger effects). Playing cards will impact, among other things, the ranking of the Houses in terms of prestige. To optimize point scoring, a good player will try to gain influence over &quot;winning&quot; houses without wasting too many cards for acheiving that, and/or to influence Houses in the lower positions with little effort. Experienced players will learn how to deceive their opponents about their real intentions.<br/><br/>Skill, bluffing, intuition and reading your opponent&rsquo;s moves are all skills required to gain victory.<br/><br/>Arcanum is the first board game by the world acclaimed Tarot publisher Lo Scarabeo, and includes a complete tarot deck: a &quot;family friendly&quot; version of the Initiatory Tarot of the Golden Dawn featuring wondrous illustrations by the artist Patrizio Evangelisti.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classic Knizia betting and racing game. Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse. Points are awarded to 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd home, and one of your bets is a doubler.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Winner's Circle / Royal Turf <br/><br/><br/>",

Each player has eight pieces of the same color: 2 squares, 2 diamonds, 2 triangles, and 2 circles. Each player arranges their pieces in ANY ORDER within their starting row. The object of the game is to get ALL of your pieces into the starting row of the player sitting opposite of you. The pieces move in different directions depending upon the shape:<br/><br/>    Squares can move horizontally and vertically. <br/>    Diamonds can move only diagonally. <br/>    Triangles can move forward on the diagonals or straight backwards. <br/>    Circles can move in any direction. <br/><br/><br/>Players take turns moving one piece each turn. Two pieces can not occupy the same space. Pieces can move in single space moves, one space at a time and only into an empty adjacent space as dictated by the piece's legal moves. Players can jump over their own or another player's piece. Jumped pieces are NOT captured, akin to Chinese Checkers. Players can string together a series of jumps if each individual jump in the series conforms to the rules governing single jumps. The first player to move all of their pieces into the destination row is the winner. Players can not force a draw.<br/><br/>Listed on &quot;GAMES 100&quot; GAMES Magazine<br/>1992 Mensa Select<br/><br/>2-4 players ages 7 to adult<br/><br/>",

Players each have 2 pawns, 9 green walls (which are placed vertically), and 9 blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.<br/><br/>This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In early 1918, the trench warfare stalemate between the Germans and Allies was on the verge of ending. New small unit tactics developed by the Germans, and the advent of the Royal Tank Corps for the Allies, promised a new set of doctrines that would rule warfare for decades. The question was: who would beat whom to the punch?<br/><br/>The Germans were fresh from a decisive military victory in the East against Tsarist Russia. The Allies were celebrating the arrival of fresh U.S. troops. Either side could claim victory if it could break the national will of the other.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front is another Ted Raicer design focusing on this often neglected war. For many years, wargame designers shunned World War I for a variety of reasons: too dull, too static, too hard to reproduce the suicidal wave attacks waged by both sides. Ted Raicer almost single-handedly put WWI back on the wargaming map with a number of designs, including Paths of Glory, Clash of Giants, and &quot;All Quiet...&quot;.<br/><br/>A traditional hex wargame, &quot;All Quiet...&quot; elegantly tackles a number of the key issues that help determine the outcome of the war, including German Stosstruppen and national morale, as well as more traditional elements like supply and command/control.<br/><br/>The game includes four scenarios: &quot;Operation Michael&quot; (an Introductory Scenario), &quot;Ludendorff Attacks&quot;, &quot;Allied Counteroffensive&quot;, and finally, the 30-hour campaign game, &quot;1918&quot;.<br/><br/>",

One of the original 12 Dragonlance modules was a wargame Dragons of Glory. They asked you to stop your role-playing game experience and start playing a wargame for a bit.<br/><br/>&ldquo;[It] allows you to play out sort of massive military battles in the world of Krynn.

        "description": "Description from the box:<br/><br/>&quot;Germany, 1919. Jan. 1: The opening of the Paris Peace Conference is imminent, but unrest and violence are already spreading throughout Germany and Italy as well as in many other European countries. Communist forces are marching to power, following the example of the Bolsheviks in Russia. The murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht is still a possibility. Will the German Social-Democracy make an evil pact with the proto-Nazi Freikorps to eliminate the two revolutionary leaders from the political theatre? Extreme left and right parties face each other creating disorder and putting the Social-Democratic and Liberal governments under pressure to bring peace to Europe. Democratic forces have about fifteen years to save the Old Continent from the maelstrom of tyranny and totalitarianism. Will they fail as happened in history? The economic crisis of middle classes, the loss of monetary power and wealth, hyperinflation, the never-ending clash with the proletarian forces and the Great Depression ... will all such factors bring the liberal European countries to the verge of bankruptcy? Or will Mussolini and Hitler be left out of the history books?<br/><br/>Rise of Totalitarianism is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the ideological conflicts and political struggles that led to the establishment of totalitarian dictatorships in Europe throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The game covers the period 1919-1933 and is designed for three players. Each takes the role of one of the three Ideologies &ndash; Social-Democracy, Fascism and Communism &ndash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game.<br/><br/>Rise of Totalitarianism offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 90 game cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy and must face the major crises that upset the European countries of the era. Game cards provide political points that are used by players to plan secret actions on the map by using action chits. Action chits are revealed simultaneously and players can then perform their reactions and activities (propaganda, conflicts, laws and reforms) to influence society, public opinion, political orientation, the economy and the stability of governments.&quot;<br/><br/>Some more details on the game-play:<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME &ndash; In Rise of Totalitarianism each player takes the role of an Ideology (Communism, Fascism or Social-Democracy) and has the goal of controlling, for as long as possible, the Governments of the Major Powers represented in the game (Germany and Italy) and of as many Minor Nations as possible (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Yugoslavia). Players earn Victory Points (VP) mostly through the control of the Governments of Major Powers and Minor Nations.<br/>To achieve control of Minor Nations, players try to influence the political allegiance of such countries, or they attempt to destabilize and overthrow their Governments. In both cases players are aiming for the same goal: to draw the ideological orientation of the Governments into their sphere of influence.<br/>To achieve control of Major Powers, on the other hand, players must use deeper and more complex mechanisms. One Ideology controls the Government of each Major Power at any time, with the other two Ideologies working in the background to influence public opinion and destabilize the Government. This causes the Government to fall and force new Elections, which are then won by the Ideology thanks to the shift of mass support towards it. In addition, Social-Democracy has the task of preserving Democracy by ensuring that the Governments are always determined by Elections. Fascism and Communism, in contrast, must attempt to put a totalitarian Regime in power &ndash; each Ideology has its own means and mechanism for doing this. Putting a Regime into power means that Elections will no longer take place in the nation &ndash; thus keeping the Government in power forever &ndash; unless the economic conditions and the stability of the country become so bad that the Regime is overthrown and new Elections can take place.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY FUNDAMENTALS &ndash; All activities performed by players (Actions) to pursue their goals in Major Powers and Minor Nations are planned secretly by using Action chits. But planning these Actions is costly. Players pay these costs both by expending the Political Points (PP) provided by Game Cards (see below) and by using cubes, which represent the Funding granted to their Ideologies by bankers, industrialists, agrarians, foreign states, or more simply the political support of bureaucrats and institutions. Funding fluctuates with the fortunes and disgraces of the major political parties represented by the Ideologies, but also with the wealth of nations where these parties operate. Furthermore, Actions can be supported by Leaders, which represent the politicians and statesmen that historically emerged in the period and that are present in the game. Each Leader provides a bonus to the effectiveness of the Action he or she is tasked to accomplish. Such effectiveness is measured by Action Points (AP), that enable the Primary Goal of the Action and a set of additional Bonus Operations to be performed.<br/><br/>GAME CARDS &ndash; Game cards are a core element of the game-play. There are three types:<br/><br/>1. Crisis Cards represent the most important historical events that generated troubles &ndash; or opportunities &ndash; during the timeline covered by the game. These cards trigger the Crises that must be resolved by players.<br/><br/>2. Strategy Cards are at the same time the engine and the fuel of players' operations. Each Ideology has its own Strategy Cards Deck. Strategy Cards provide the Political Points (PP) used by players to plan Actions, but they also enrich the game-play with Events, Political Actions, Laws and further Crises. Events are cards whose effects are applied immediately after the card is played. Political Actions are endeavors performed by players using a card whose effects are applied only after a successful Political Action Attempt (die roll with various modifiers). Laws are cards whose effects cause a permanent change in the game rules. Laws come into effect only after a specific player's Action has been planned and successfully performed, i.e. the Law is &quot;promulgated&quot;.<br/><br/>3. Coup Cards form an additional deck that is used to simulate a sort of &quot;domino effect&quot; throughout Minor Nations when a minor country's Government is overthrown. These cards add further Crises and Events.<br/>Political Points (PP) are also provided by Crisis Cards and Coup Cards.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY &ndash; The game is played in Turns, each Turn representing a period of time spanning from one to four years. Every Turn is played according to a strict procedure called the Sequence of Play, which is divided into four Phases:<br/><br/>1. Players must first determine their Funding. The Funding allows players to choose their position in the Order of Play, which determines the order in which Actions and Reactions are performed.<br/><br/>2. During the Card Phase, players refill their hand of cards, and reshuffle and add new cards to the decks if required by the Turn.<br/><br/>3. The Political Phase is resolved in one to three Rounds, depending on the length of the Turn (usually the number of years). During each Round, a Crisis Card is drawn and resolved, players secretly choose and then simultaneously reveal Strategy Cards, apply their effects, plan and resolve Actions and carry out Reactions. At the end of each Round, a Crisis check is performed to verify the outcomes of every Active Crisis.<br/><br/>4. The Cleanup Phase ends the Turn. Besides the normal end-Turn management activities, during this Phase players must check the Economy of Major Powers and the Stability of Minor Nations and Major Powers. A good Economy (growth, profits, foreign capitals) or a bad Economy (economic crises, depression, debts, war reparations) will, respectively, improve or worsen the Stability of Major Powers.<br/>If a Stability Check fails in a Major Power, Elections must take place to decide on a new Government Coalition in the Major Power. If a Regime rules the Major Power, the Stability check can fail only if the Economy is in the worst condition possible.<br/>If a Stability Check fails in a Minor Nation, the Government is overthrown and the political allegiance of the Minor Nation shifts towards the Ideology that contributed most to the change of the ideological orientation of the Government.<br/><br/>",

The rules revolve around a universal mechanic that is easy to grasp but supports a high level of detail and rewards sound tactical play. The game&rsquo;s dynamic turn sequence captures the turmoil of the modern city fight and integrated fog of war keeps things chaotic and unpredictable!<br/><br/>Ambush Alley contains complete rules for all the key elements of modern counter-insurgency and street-fighting, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Civilians on the Battlefield <br/>     Full Vehicle Rules <br/>     Special Assets and Off-Board Support <br/>     Night Combat<br/>     UAVs <br/>     IEDs and VBIEDs <br/>     Building Clearing <br/>     And much more! <br/><br/><br/>Ambush Alley includes five scenarios and sample organizational charts for US, British, and Australian forces.<br/><br/>The game can be played at any scale from 15mm up. 15mm scenarios call for a 2&rsquo;x2&rsquo; table, while 28mm games only require a 4&rsquo;x4&rsquo; table.<br/><br/>Ambush Alley is easy on the pocketbook where miniatures are concerned. Few scenarios require more than ten figures for the Regular force and a dozen or so for the Insurgents.<br/><br/>Ambush Alley also offers full solo-play rules, so players can still have fun pushing their figures around the table even when a flesh and blood opponent isn&rsquo;t available!<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Day of the Rangers (2008)<br/>     Ambush Alley: Motor Pool (2007)<br/>     INVALID OBJECT ID=33973, type=thing (2007)<br/>     The Three Block War: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2008)<br/>     Art of War: Ambush Alley Mini Campaign (2008)<br/>     Operation: Darkstar – an Ambush Alley Scenario Pack (2008)<br/>     Under the Black Flag: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2008)<br/>     Lawyers, Guns & Money: an Ambush Alley Scenario Pack (2008)<br/>     Indian Country: an Ambush Alley Mini-Campaign (2009)<br/>     The Wasteland: SOG Exclusive Supplement – 2010 (2010)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inside Pitch Baseball Game:<br/><br/>ISG is proud to announce Inside Pitch Baseball.<br/><br/>This game is based upon the Defense Independent Pitching Statistics, developed by V&ouml;r&ouml;s McCracken.  This is a statistic that operates under the revolutionary and controversial theorem that a pitchers value comes from his strikeouts, walks, and home runs allowed (because these are the only events over which the pitcher has total control).<br/><br/>Each at bat starts on the pitchers card and while one of the outcomes from above (K, BB or HR) may come into play each batter has the final say.  The game includes split LH/RH ratings for all pitchers and hitters with at least 40 BF/AB against each side. Defensive plays such as range plays and errors are interwoven into the game so as to make it seamless.  All action comes from the players cards so outside chart lookups to determine the outcome of at bats are a thing of the past.<br/>Hitters are not left out as they are rated for where they actually hit the ball in the year represented.  Base running, stealing and bunting can be handled by the game engine for the solitaire player as well.<br/><br/>Ballparks play a big part in IP.  Now each park will have its own card (look just like a hitter card)  that is referenced during game play.  Ballparks will be represented on more than just HRs allowed.  All hits, strikeouts and walks will be affected by the place a game is being played.  Just by looking at the ballpark cards you will see that the Astrodome will yield few HR chances while Coors Field will earn its rep as the launching pad.<br/>These ballpark cards have been seamlessly added to the game as well by not requiring any outside lookups.  They have also give the opportunity to add rare plays and the &quot;trying to stretch&quot; hits in the game.<br/><br/>We have completed a sample game run through that shows how the game plays along with pictures to guide you the IP game play.  It can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://forums.delphiforums.com/ISGF/messages?msg=214\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://forums.delphiforums.com/ISGF/messages?msg=214</a>.1 .<br/><br/>IP takes a unique approach to simulating the game of baseball.  From where you start with the pitchers card to how the defense gets involved the game just feels right.  So forget the 50/50 setup, forget the chart lookups and step inside the game of baseball with Inside Pitch.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time to take part in the greatest battles ever with your gladiator cards and try to win fights by taking tricks&hellip;or not because earlier you placed bets against them.<br/><br/>Sponsio is played over several rounds. At the beginning of a round, each player has four turns to set their own scoring and goals for the trick-taking that follows, and this is mostly done by betting. Players can bet on tricks taken, on the number of cards of a given color in your takes, on the last trick, on the highest card taking, or even on the failure of your opponent. Instead of betting, players can choose other actions as well.<br/><br/>Players can have up to four bets, but only those that you've won will earn you coins. For this reason and because the odds of the bets differ (x2, x3, x4, x5), sometimes instead of betting players will want to take other actions, such as changing one of their cards, doubling an odd, becoming the starting player in the trick phase, changing one of their bets, etc. This is where the tactical depth of Sponsio comes in: finding the best combinations to build your highest score!<br/><br/>Sponsio is a family-strategy game that can be won in two ways: collecting 30 coins or winning 9 bets in a row.<br/><br/>",

The Demonstration player has a lot of slow units plus some quicker and deadlier ones (from anarchists to marxist-leninists); the Power player has policemen and &quot;Carabinieri&quot; with heavy vehicles (some of them shooting gas) plus a few lousy city council policemen.<br/><br/>The huge city is finely depicted (graphics by Piergiorgio Maoloni, that later became one of the best well-known art directors of Italian newspapers and magazines) and it has funny names on streets and squares. A hex grid is of course impressed on it to rule movement and combat. A humorous &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; booklet is included to help finding the best places to score points around.<br/><br/>There are several scenarios, including a totally different &quot;Black Out&quot; scenario inspired by a New York black-out: up to 6 players go around sacking the city, while up to two players try to stop them with policemen and Carabinieri. Those two can fight each other to get the goods they seized to the pillagers, but only if it is a &quot;dark&quot; turn so they can pretend not to recognize each other.<br/><br/>This is the first boardgame published by C.UnS.A. when they were still &quot;Comitato Un Sacco Alternativo&quot;, before becoming a company and a successful team of game designer (for boardgames, radio and TV games, advertising games, training games, magazine games and so on). At that time, C.UnS.A. was composed by Massimo Casa, Giulio De Petra, Alvaro Lojacono, Piergiorgio Maoloni and Sergio Zoffoli.<br/><br/>In 1980 Mondadori Giochi made a second edition with a heavier map and counters, but without the &quot;Black Out&quot; variant: there was rumor that it could become a separate game, but this never happened.<br/><br/>",

Vietnamese General Giap directed his communist troops in a concerted attack during Tet (the lunar New Year), successfully overrunning [sic] Hue and starting a bloody battle to retake the city.<br/><br/>&quot;The battle for Hue was unique, in that it was a medieval city being attacked with modern weapons. The moats and walls presented new sets of tactical problems. The battle was a combination of World War II street fighting and medieval siege warfare, with almost all participants carrying [sic] a fully automatic weapon. If the rules seem peculiar at times, remember that it was a very peculiar battle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Age of Muskets is a rule set that covers the campaigns from the late XVII century to the first half of the XIX. It emphasizes Command and Control as well as the uncertainty and friction of any military operation. Players take command of an army of the period, represented by their headquarters, and control their attached units, their men and equipment. The purpose is to re-create all the relevant factors of war at the operational level in the pre-industrial age.<br/>The game is played as a sequence of &ldquo;game turns&rdquo;, each made up of several actions performed by the forces of all sides present on the game board. The diverse scenarios that can be played have a limited number of game turns, once finished players check which side has won. Many of these scenarios can be played by just 2 players. However, the longest and largest are designed for team play, ideally by 4 to 6 players.<br/><br/>I) Game scales. <br/>1 Combat point = 1.000 men (or approximately 8-12 artillery pieces).<br/>1 Turn = 1 month (or a fortnight)<br/>Game board = variable, mostly 1:1.250.000 (1 cm=12,5 Km)<br/>Unit size = Divisions &amp; brigades (in addition to counters representing Headquarters).<br/><br/>Age of Muskets Volume I: Tomb for an Empire.<br/><br/>&quot;Tomb for an Empire&quot; simulates the conflict that took place in the Iberian Peninsula from 1808 to 1814. It was a complex war that involved diverse interests and troops from many nations. Great Britain sent her troops to defend Portugal, within the context of the European Coalitions against France.  In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of &quot;Patriots&quot; facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as &quot;Juramentados&quot;).<br/><br/>Spaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side. A player (or team) control each side. The game allows to play the war beginning on July 1808 to April 1814, or on several later dates - November 1808,  May 1809, January 1810, January 1811 or February 1812. It is also possible to play only certain parts (e.g. The War in Levante 1809 - 1813),  individual campaigns (Napoleon's 1809) or just battles (Salamanca, Vitoria ...)<br/><br/>&quot;Tomb for an Empire&quot; is not just a game it's a whole gaming experience that includes 6 introductory battle scenarios and 18 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity, from Bailen (lasting less than one full turn) to the full campaign starting any year of the war (scenarios 14 to 18).<br/><br/>El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Southern Rails is played on a map of the southeast United States and is similar in style to many of the stock-based, cube-rail games released by Winsome Games since 2007.<br/><br/>During set up, players spend two rounds selecting stocks from two of the six available companies, then the game begins.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player must place a track cube for one of the companies in which they have stock. The first cube of a company can be placed on any hex, while each subsequent cube for that company must be placed adjacent to another of the same color. Hexes (other than Atlanta) can have 1-3 cubes placed on them, and when a cube is placed in a city &mdash; with cities coming in four colors &mdash; that railroad's revenue increases by $1-4 depending on the color of the city.<br/><br/>When the tenth cube of a company is placed, railroads earn points based on certain criteria &mdash; highest revenue, fewest shares owned, most cubes on the map, and most cities of a color in its network &mdash; with ties resulting in no points being awarded for a category. (If, for example, both the purple and black railroads have the most red cities in their networks, then no railroad scores the points for having the most red cities in its network.) Each player then scores points equal to the points scored by the railroads in which they have stock.<br/><br/>Player order is then reassigned, and players get to select an additional stock after which they again take turns placing cubes on the board. After the fourth scoring round, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The block of ice opens a hole in the right side of the hull and after two hours and forty minutes the Titanic is doomed.<br/><br/>One hundred years after those happenings, Sir Chester Cobblepot offers a refined board game that celebrates the unforgettable heroism and determination of the passengers on that English transatlantic. More specifically, our main characters are the survivors of the last lifeboat lowered into the water, the collapsible D.<br/><br/>The idea for Collapsible D: The Final Minutes of the Titanic comes from the mind of the Italian author Gianluca Santopietro. In this game the players are on board the Titanic during the night of April 14, 1912, starting at 11:40 p.m. when the ship collides with an iceberg; each turn represents ten minutes in real time. Each player controls a passenger of each Class and a member of the Crew. Each character has a different starting point, an attempt to recreate the exact location where they were on the ship, thanks to historical research led by the author in cooperation with history experts on the Titanic, such as Claudio Bossi. Thanks to an intuitive movement system, players will move their passengers through the ship, trying to reach the lifeboats on the dock.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the water floods in quickly and the risk of drowning is very high. Each saved passenger grants victory points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Especially in demand were seats in the section next to Caesar&rsquo;s box, offering the best view. But these seats were not cheap to obtain and could only be bought by knowing the right people. The black market boomed!<br/><br/>Each of the 3-5 players is leader of a gang of black market traders, who try to get the best tickets themselves so that they can make a hefty profit hawking them to wealthy tourists and senators. But each of the other gangs wants to enlarge its piece of the black market and supplant its rivals. Who can find the right tactics to make the most cash for the least effort?<br/>The players send their traders to Caesar&rsquo;s villa to obtain favors. Afterwards they try to buy the most lucrative tickets at the Forum Romanum. And finally, the traders race to the three venues to sell their tickets to the wealthiest visitor. After 3 days of events, the player with the most coins wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Plays one card in front of herself or another player to expand that player's kitty, or<br/>    Plays that card on top of a matching-colored card in any player's kitty.<br/><br/><br/>Any time that a player has two stacks topped with a card of the same number, those stacks are merged into a single stack. After playing, the player draws one card from the deck.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has six separate stacks in front of herself or all players have no cards left in hand, the round ends. Any player without stacks topped by cards of all three colors scores zero points for the round; all other players sum the numbers shown on the uppermost card of each stack they have. Rounds continue until at least one player has scored at least 150 points. In this case, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>For a harsh variant, players can decide that only the player with the most points each round scores, while everyone else receives zero points. In this variant, the game ends once a player reaches 100 points.<br/><br/>",

Congo Merc is a solitaire game that puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.<br/><br/>The game includes two decks of cards. The Mission Cards provide scenario objectives and the resources with which task forces are assembled. Missions include everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.<br/><br/>Congo Merc is part of the Commando mini-game Series. Once a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an Event Card is picked. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. There&rsquo;s a range of foes, from Simba rebels to Cubans dispatched by Fidel Castro. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts. There are special rules for CIA reinforcements, air transport and leaders.<br/><br/>",

        "description": " Listen pals. We did not fight the Void to make Lumen even brighter. The flying citadel has proven worthless, profiting from scrolls and abandoning us to our empty fate. Can't you figure out the Eternals on their terrace eating grapes and enjoying the show we put on against the Seraphs? <br/>Guess what? we mortals survived and pushed back the Void. We have shown the Seraphs the door. What about the Eternals now?<br/>- Commonly heard in Gon'Mar Taverns -<br/><br/>Fall of Lumen is a stand-alone tabletop game based on deck-building and tableau building. It is a follow-up of Legends of Void. <br/>The Void battles have ended. The Outer Lands are devastated after years of battles against the Seraphs, and the people are happy to return to a peaceful time and rebuild their houses and society. But a small group of rebels is sick of the citadel of Lumen and works in the shadows to free the Outer Lands from its dictatorship. Their plan is as simple as it will be effective. Bring back the Keepers that once saved the world from the Nihil of the Pale Night and sneak them into the flying citadel as incognito agents.<br/>You play a rebel&nbsp;Hero,&nbsp;an ex-Keeper&nbsp;banned from the Outer Lands long ago. Now you are back thanks to the dimensional fracture caused by the Void. You'll rescue comrades from the Inner Worlds, where the Eternals, the founders of Lumen, banished all of you. You will infiltrate Keepers into Lumen to take power back until the flying citadel becomes the falling one.&nbsp;<br/>You will be supported by a Faction, which shares your cause against the Eternals, and compete with the other Heroes to be the most influential Hero, the one who has infiltrated the most Agents on Lumen.<br/>You will move your Hero across the Outer Lands and spend their skills to gather resources such as Gold, Mana, Mithril, Dark Matter, and Genasi. Using these resources, you will acquire traits, learn spells, buy trinkets, retrieve artifacts, and hire followers to help your cause and improve your skills.<br/>Finally, with enough skills, you can restore the dimensional connection to an Inner World and bring back a Keeper stuck there. To unlock a portal and reach an Inner World, you need a different combination of skills: Deception, Wit, Fighting, Wizardry, and Void (the most precious and versatile skill).<br/>As the game gets closer to the end, your interest will switch from rescuing Keepers from the Inner Worlds to sneaking them onto Lumen, which is the goal of the game and the greatest source of victory points. You can infiltrate a saboteur in any of the five districts of Lumen: Informers, Engineers, Fighters, Wizards, and Voyagers. Each saboteur will grant you a recurring or immediate income and victory points.<br/><br/>The main mechanics are:<br/><br/>     Deck-building: the deck is your main resource; improving it by buying better cards will help you perform better.&nbsp;<br/>     Open drafting: market elements are face-up, so you can plan what to buy and collect the resources you need to get them, but you have to get there before the other players.<br/>     Tableau Building: in addition to your deck, you will hire Followers and buy Trinkets for your Hero. They are valuable because you can always count on them and not depend on the luck of the draw draw. You can use them once per turn, and then they are exhausted.&nbsp;<br/>     Area Movement: the game board is divided into eight regions, irregularly shaped. Regions grant access to gather actions, markets, and Challenge locations. During the game, you will move your Hero many times from one region to another to access what you need most at that moment of the game. &nbsp;<br/>     Once-per-game abilities: some cards have very powerful abilities, but you can use them only once per game, then they are removed from the game.<br/><br/><br/>The game will feature a Solo mode and a 2-player cooperative variant.<br/>Fall of Lumen has No Take That elements. The interaction between players is indirect. It mainly comes from solving challenges, market acquisitions, and timing the infiltration of Agents on Lumen. The more saboteurs are on a District Window of Lumen, the higher the cost to send a new one. <br/>Our estimated complexity is 3.2 on the BGG scale (max 5.0).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a party game. There are several cards with words whose meaning is unknown most of the times. Every player writes down what they think the meaning of that word could be. One player collects and shuffles these answers and reads them out loud. All players vote for the answer they think to be the right answer.<br/><br/>Everyone who is right gets points. Everyone who had such a good description that people believed him even if its not the correct meaning, also gets points.<br/><br/>There are also cards with pictures on them, you guess what the picture shows. Whoever reaches the end of the gameboard first wins.<br/><br/>This Limited Anniversary Edition adds 20 voting tokens, 10 voting cards and 10 bonus tokens.<br/><br/>(Parts of the description are taken from the main game&acute;s page.)<br/><br/>",

They then discover whether the remaining, unlinked word card is the key to their victory, validating its code with the answer card to know whether they've won the game!<br/><br/>Linkto Food, which has also been released as Match Up! Food, offers five levels of difficulty in the game, as well as a competitive mode for those who want it. The unlinked word card differs at each difficulty level, and the clues themselves also differ, getting much harder to decipher at the higher levels.<br/><br/>",

Wrest control of a noble family, guide them through lives of satirically-riddled sadism, and deliver them to their ultimate fate. Which is, of course, more death.<br/><br/>Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom of Thrones allows multiple cards to be played on top of the same character, determining their ultimate fate while still allowing you to see straight through their machinations, just like Lil' Finger, advisor to his seventeenth &ndash; whoops! eighteenth! &ndash; king and/or queen. As your characters seek a moment of respite on the Porcelain Throne, your goal is to plague them with horrible mishaps like being Seduced by a Sibling or Tumbled from a Tower, while filling the lives of the other noble families with happy events like w̶e̶d̶d̶i̶n̶g̶s̶ and family reunions that will raise their Self-Worth score. The player with the lowest-scoring, most tragedy-afflicted family wins!<br/><br/>When you aim for the Porcelain Throne, you'd best not miss...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, the avenues cross paths and the number of available trees are limited. Design the park so that the avenues you are in charge of are the most beautiful in the park.<br/><br/>Players take turns choosing trees and placing them to build a park in a 6x6 grid. As the trees provided in each round are limited, players fight over them. Higher points can be achieved by collecting the same type of trees on the rows and columns on which your gardeners stand. Choose your trees wisely, as it affects your turn order in the next round.<br/><br/>",
