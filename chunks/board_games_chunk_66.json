        "description": "Beaune/Turku is the newest addition to the Town Center line, which started with Alban Viard's brain-burning, elegant city-building sim game.<br/><br/>As Beaune is a walled town surrounded by vineyards, there are no suburbs. Also, the &quot;elevator&quot; black cubes must be built in the center. We're guessing that's because in many medieval towns, no building was allowed to be taller than the church, but who knows, the designer works in mysterious ways!<br/><br/>The Turku map has two seasons, summer and winter, alternating between odd- and even-numbered turns. During the summer, the two halves are considered separate, and during the winter, when the Aura river freezes, the two parts are considered one city - which allows for some clever play, such as building green cubes &quot;next&quot; to green cubes in the summer, when they are not considered adjacent, only for them to be joined in the winter.<br/><br/>",

After three rounds, flags run out and players are forced into combat to steal each others flags. Aside from the specialized six ships that compose each fleet in the game, players also have access to twenty Advanced Systems cards. Each player starts with two of these cards and more can be purchased throughout the game. These cards temporarily affect four aspects of the game: the economy, movement, attack, and defense of each player's fleet.<br/><br/>At the start of a game, players secure an economic foothold using carefully placed Harvesters to earn money. During the second round, players begin building an army to defend their Motherships and capture flags. During a player's turn, all of his or her ships can move and attack.<br/><br/>The six ships used in the game are: (1) The Mothership, the slow but hardy flagship of every fleet. (2) Harvesters, which harvest materials in space and earn money. (3) Salvagers, which collect the wreckage of destroyed ships for a money reward and pick up and carry flags. (4) F13s, cheap, fast, and weak fighters meant for quick skirmishes and surprise attacks. (5) F35s, expensive, slow, and strong fighters used for heavy assaults. (6) Bandits, used to steal enemy ships.<br/><br/>Mastering Hexica requires an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the ships used in the game, a familiarity with the Advanced Systems cards, creative thinking, and skill in successfully distracting and misleading the enemy.<br/><br/>",

Also similar to the Korean game of Dancing Dragons, which is essentially the same game played with two open ends instead of one.<br/><br/>If four people play, each is dealt 8 tiles. If three people play, each is dealt 10 tiles and the remaining two are not played. If two people play, each is dealt 16 tiles.<br/><br/>For the first tile laid, the leader must declare which half is 'open'. Then all dominoes are connected to the only open half of the boneyard, in a straight line. Once the boneyard counts a multiple of eight dominoes, the dominoes are stacked backward upon the previous row. The boneyard can therefore count up to four rows.<br/><br/>Whenever a player is unable to play, he must discard a tile from his hand facedown.<br/><br/>When all the players' hands are empty, the round is scored. Each players counts the pips on his tiles, and must pay to his opponents with lesser scores the difference in points. If a player manages to play all his tiles, this scoring difference is doubled.<br/><br/>",

Players send their workers into four triumphal gates to gain or convert resources during action phase, then they spend resources to construct buildings and ramparts during construction phase.<br/><br/>The distinctive features are variable cost and worker availability.<br/><br/>Each gate has six action spots. Five of these spots enable you to gain or convert resources. From the leftmost spot to right, its effect becomes greater.<br/><br/>The cost to send a worker is randomly determined by cost card. There are six spots which corresponds to action spots. From the leftmost spot to right, it becomes more costly. You may place a worker on any vacant spot, but doing so makes all spots rightward cheaper.<br/><br/>You should note that workers you sent to a gate don't return until someone send a worker to the rightmost spot of the gate, in which case the rightmost worker contributes to the gate's influence, earning its owner income per round, and all other workers on the gate return. Then a new cost card is placed.<br/><br/>During building phase, you may spend resources to gain coins, and construct a building and ramparts. Each building has its unique ability, and ramparts grants you victory points. The first player who has passed, takes these actions as many as they desire. Except for coins, all unspent resources are lost at the end of this phase, so you must plan ahead how many resources you need this round and where you should send your workers.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>フランスの市門ににワーカーを派遣して影響力を獲得し、建物や城壁を建築するゲームです。ワーカープレイスメントですが、資源の持ち越しはできず、毎ラウンドでアクションをパスした順に建築を行うのが特徴です。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Peaky Blinders: Birmingham Domain is a card game published directly by a Brazilian company, set in the scene of the famous TV series.<br/><br/>Players embody the top five gangs from the series Peaky Blinders in a fierce battle for hegemony in the Birmingham region. Therefore, it is not enough to expand their territories and open pubs. You will need to use your own gang's special skill wisely, create a working network for your (illicit) activities to thrive, get the most out of the characters and use the best moment to attack (or defend against) your opponents. Mechanics and themes were matured by the expertise of designer Marcos Macri and his long creative process. The result is an exciting, fun and balanced card game. You don't need to know or like the show to enjoy this game, but fans will delight in the elegance of the artwork and character reincarnation.<br/><br/>In his turn, the player has three options: expand his region or open a new business, laying down cards in his table; or receive profits from the table itself. It's also possible to use the effect of different characters to optimize actions and improve gang development.<br/><br/>After the endgame is triggered (the pubs cards or the territory cards have run out), the leader who scores more points wins and achieves supremacy over rival gangs.<br/><br/>",

One of you believes very strongly in the power of vertical alignment, while the other argues that the focus should be on horizontal structure. You each take turns placing the paintings in the exhibit, and once you've finished, you earn presentation points for the horizontal or vertical groupings of the artwork. When the exhibition ends, the curator with the most points wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, in Aqua, players take turns placing painting cards in the museum, with cards being placed face down when they're adjacent to face-up cards, and vice versa. When a face-down card is surrounded, flip it face up. When someone plays a face-up boat, each player moves a visitor token up to three spaces from that card, with each visitor token adding 1 point to the card on which it stands. Players score points by strategically aligning cards with matching icons and numbers in each row or column, with one player scoring the columns at game's end and the other scoring the rows &mdash; but these lines score only if they're valued from 10-20 points, so don't concentrate too much artistic power in one line!<br/><br/>",

Save the city together. &mdash; A fun, cooperative, strategic crime-fighting card game.&quot;<br/><br/>Beatdown is a 1-4 player fully cooperative card game. Players team up to defeat waves of comic-book criminal and eventually go toe-to-toe with a crime-boss that threatens their city. The group wins if they are able to reach and defeat the boss and lose if all players are simultaneously reduced to 0 hitpoints.<br/><br/>The core fighting mechanic revolves around building combos by using a mixture of attack cards in hand and from the shared &quot;Attack&quot; deck. Between each attack players must roll a 10-sided combo die to see if they can continue their attack. Each added attack increases the difficulty rating of this roll. A failed combo roll leaves an opening for enemies to attack.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a unique stat-line and ability. Heroes tend to have roles for group play such as tanky wrestlers or fragile high-damage boxers. Planning the right team to bring can be crucial for defeating the foes that await.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Variety and re-playability are key components of FireFights 2. The fog of war and variety remains high with variable reinforcement groups. Each scenario also comes with its own historically based map which also serves as a half board overlay. The half board overlays are compatible with boards 1, 14, 19, 26-31, 33.

After 2 days the Italians were counter-attacking and the Indians were in retreat.<br/><br/>FF-14 Bodange, Belgium, 10 May 1940 - War has come to western Europe! On 10 May 1940, the German XIX Korps crossed into the Belgian Ardennes. What to stop them?

While she has yet to harm anyone in the process, the damage she's causing to the city is nigh catastrophic. With all this chaos and destruction going on in Brook City, the BCPD can use any help it can get. Chance Mitchell has taken this opportunity to get some hands on experience with law enforcement for his upcoming cop movie. That&rsquo;s right, Chance is a famous actor doing research for a new film, but gets caught up in real world cop work in the mean streets of Brook City.<br/><br/>In Velocity, the cops face a new criminal in the form of Leeta Wix, a street orphan from nearby Ransom City with an explosive attitude. Her crimes are focused on evacuating important buildings in Brook City so she can blow them to the ashes, proving to the Syndicate that she's a much better asset to their organization than a liability. Meanwhile, the cops have to solve a new dangerous case. Someone has strapped a civilian bus with enough explosives to send it into the atmosphere. What's worse? If the bus stops, it blows! So the cops have to carefully navigate a speeding bus, represented on the board by a detailed plastic miniature, along the streets of Brook City while preventing collateral damage from spelling their destruction.<br/><br/>The Velocity Expansion introduces a new modular element to Brook City in the form of wrecks. While these plastic wreck markers can be used in any game, they are specifically designed to augment the included &quot;Velocity&quot; case. With the wreck deck, any time a cop is forced to lose their vehicle, it crashes and causes a wreck. Wrecks block the streets and cause additional stress to cops; meaning if they don't clean up the streets, they'll get fired in no time!<br/><br/>Components: 1 bus miniature, 1 cop miniature, 12 crew miniatures, 12 wrecks, 82 cards (25 cop cards, 22 criminal cards, 21 case cards, 14 wreck cards)<br/><br/>",

In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn.

In Nibble, two players take turns taking pieces of nine colors trying to claim majorities in those colors, but can also win the game instantly in two different ways.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/><br/>     81 discs in 9 colours (9 each)<br/>     Board<br/><br/><br/>RULES OVERVIEW (Please refer to rulebook)<br/><br/>Randomly place the 81 discs on the board such that no two of the same color are orthogonally adjacent (diagonally adjacent is OK).<br/><br/>Players alternate turns taking discs from the board according to the following rules:<br/><br/>1) Discs may only be taken if they have at least two adjacent exposed sides.<br/>       <br/>    2) A player must always take at least one disc on their turn (that is, players may not pass) and may take as many additional discs as they like on a turn, as long as all of those discs are the same color as the first one. They are not required to take all of the available discs of that color and may opt to leave one or more behind.<br/><br/>3) A disc may not be taken if it would divide the remaining discs into two separate groups (counting orthogonal connections only).<br/><br/>When a player takes discs, they should place them in a row on the table behind the correspondingly colored triangle on the board.<br/><br/>If a player takes their 5th, 7th, or 9th disc of a color, they should place it on the corresponding circle on their side of the board to make it clear how close they are to reaching one of the three win conditions.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME<br/><br/>A player wins the game immediately if they achieve either of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect all 9 discs of one color<br/>     Collect at least 7 discs each of three adjacent colors in a row.<br/><br/><br/>If neither player is able to accomplish either of these, continue play until all the discs have been taken. The winner is the player with the majority of majorities (5 or more discs in each of 5 or more colors).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the summer of 1191, Richard the Lionheart leads a Crusader army south along the coast, intending  eventually to turn east toward Jerusalem. Saladin, hoping to catch the Crusaders strung out on the march &mdash; as he had done four years earlier at Hattin &mdash; prepares to launch a strike near the ruined city of Jaffa. But, Richard, anticipating the attack, musters his army in a tight formation but continues to march nonetheless. On the morning of 7 September, Saladin strikes.<br/><br/>Arsuf uses the new Battles of the Medieval World system, a variation on the venerable Battles of the Ancient World system. The battle is dominated by masses of heavy cavalry and disciplined lines of heavily-armed and armored men-at-arms. Swirling around these forces are masses of foot- and horse-archers, whose purpose is to disrupt the heavy formations to make them easy prey for their counterparts. Using the classic Combat Results Table, the fighting is close and bloody until the morale of one side weakens. Once a line breaks, the victor must pursue ruthlessly to prevent a rally. Leaders enhance combat power and restore broken formations.<br/><br/>Arsuf is a contest of nimble Arab archers against stout Crusader men-at-arms, backed by the cream of European chivalry. Victory will go to the player who deploys to best utilize his strengths and take advantage of enemy weaknesses.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map<br/>&bull;    100 die-cut counters<br/>&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series<br/>&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title<br/><br/>(source: Decision games website)<br/><br/>",

While the Australian patent application failed, the New Zealand Application succeeded. The game can be found in Australian advertisements from May 1940 to January 1945. Four versions of the game are known exist and have been reviewed and published by Dirk H.R. Spenneman (2013)<br/><br/>1) first Australian version, with Bakelite counters (G.N.Raymond 1940)<br/><br/>2) Second Australian version, with cardboard counters as a war-time austerity measure (G.N.Raymond ~1942)<br/><br/>3) Third Australian version, with pressed metal counters. as a war-time austerity measure<br/><br/>4) New Zealand version, with wooden counters (Williamson Jeffery Ltd 1940 or 1941)<br/><br/>The game board consists of a mirror-image painted land and sea terrain with an overlay of circles connected with diagonal lines to indicate movement possibilities between circles. Each side, Redland and Greenland, has 8 army division counters, 6 battleship counters and 4 aircraft counters which are placed in their respective labeled circles at opposite ends of the board. The troops can only move on land and can only get to the island in the center of the board with the aid of either aircraft or naval counters. The navy can only move on the sea and the aircraft can move anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player who 'captures' forces by jumping them diagonally (like chequers) or the first player to gain possession of the island.<br/><br/>Reference: Spenneman, D.

Some lies allow players to draw or place more cards, allowing for powerful action chains. Players are only allowed to keep seven cards in hand at the end of their turn. Other players have some ability to damage opponents' stories, preventing the most outrageous ones from completing.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has completed enough stories, or the deck runs out, the game ends. The top lies from completed stories are scored for their lie value, and any remaining lies and embellishments add or subtract points from each player's score, with the highest score winning.<br/><br/>",

On the card is a short apocryphal theme like &quot;celebrity found dead in strange circumstances&quot;. Each player has a set of words on cardboard chits and is given one of four newspapers (a cardboard front page with slots to put the words into). The aim is to write, with your words, on you newspaper, a headline which captures the theme. All players then place their headlines into the center of the board, face down, after which they are all revealed and each player votes for the best headline (not allowed to vote for their own). You move one space forwards in the progression from paperboy to media magnate for every vote your headline gets. Along the way there are some random even cards (Stop press cards) helping to promote or demote you as chance would have it.<br/><br/>All told a very amusing game, but suffers a little form the zillions of fiddly bits (word chits) that need to be managed and the restricted vocab those same word chits provide. The vocab is Also very '80s, including Thatcher and Gobachev, but it's still a very entertaining game.<br/><br/>",

Most of the scenarios require one of the two sides to have control of some specific areas at the end of the last round.<br/><br/>The game also includes an educational leaflet with a brief description of the actual events that took place during that period and on which the scenarios are based.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     1 Gameboard 52x46cm (Ancient Greece - Minor Asia)<br/>     9 Cards of yearly event<br/>     1 Notepad (Chronology 492-479bc)<br/>     92 Plastic pawns <br/>     12 Plastic flags<br/>     1 Special 6sided dice (0,1,1,2,2,3)<br/>     Historical and educational leaflet<br/>     Rulles <br/><br/><br/>Description in Greek, taken from the game's back cover:<br/>&Sigma;&tau;&omicron; &alpha;&pi;ό&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &delta;ό&xi;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, &eta; &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;ή &Alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&rho;ί&alpha; ή&tau;&alpha;&nu; &eta; &mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;ύ&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&eta; &pi;&omicron;&upsilon; &epsilon;ί&chi;&epsilon; &delta;&epsilon;&iota; &eta; &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;ό&tau;&eta;&tau;&alpha; &mu;έ&chi;&rho;&iota; &tau;ό&tau;&epsilon;. &Tau;&alpha; 2/3 &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &pi;&alpha;&gamma;&kappa;ό&sigma;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon; &pi;&lambda;&eta;&theta;&upsilon;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;ύ, &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;ό&tau;&epsilon; &gamma;&nu;&omega;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ύ &kappa;ό&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;, &zeta;&omicron;ύ&sigma;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &pi;έ&theta;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;, &upsilon;&pi;ό &tau;&eta;&nu; &epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;ί&alpha; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &delta;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;ί&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega;&nu; &Alpha;&chi;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&iota;&delta;ώ&nu;. &Beta;&alpha;&beta;&upsilon;&lambda;ώ&nu;&iota;&omicron;&iota;, &Alpha;&iota;&gamma;ύ&pi;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&iota;, &Phi;&omicron;ί&nu;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&sigmaf;, &Iota;&nu;&delta;&omicron;ί &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &delta;&epsilon;&kappa;ά&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf; ά&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&iota; &lambda;ά&omicron;&iota;, έ&delta;&omega;&sigma;&alpha;&nu; &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &Pi;έ&rho;&sigma;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &quot;&gamma;&eta; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; ύ&delta;&omega;&rho;&quot;, &kappa;ά&pi;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&iota; ό&mu;&omega;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &epsilon;ί&pi;&alpha;&nu; &Mu;&Omicron;&Lambda;&Omega;&Nu; &Lambda;&Alpha;&Beta;&Epsilon; !!!<br/><br/>&Omicron;&iota; &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;ί &Pi;ό&lambda;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&iota; &alpha;&kappa;ό&mu;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &sigma;ή&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;ύ&nu; &delta;έ&omicron;&sigmaf;, &epsilon;&nu;ώ &omicron;&iota; &mu;ά&chi;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &Mu;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&theta;ώ&nu;&alpha;, &tau;&omega;&nu; &Theta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&pi;&upsilon;&lambda;ώ&nu;, &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;ί&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &tau;&omega;&nu; &Pi;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&iota;ώ&nu;, &kappa;&alpha;&theta;ό&rho;&iota;&sigma;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&omicron; &mu;έ&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;ό&tau;&eta;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;.<br/><br/>&Zeta;ή&sigma;&tau;&epsilon; &tau;ώ&rho;&alpha; &tau;&omicron; έ&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega;&nu; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&gamma;ό&nu;&omega;&nu; &mu;&alpha;&sigmaf;, &mu;έ&sigma;&alpha; &alpha;&pi;ό έ&nu;&alpha; &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;έ&zeta;&iota;&omicron; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;ί&delta;&iota; &sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&eta;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;ή&sigmaf;, &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &gamma;&rho;ά&psi;&tau;&epsilon; &tau;&eta; &delta;&iota;&kappa;ή &sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf; &iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;ί&alpha; !!!<br/><br/>",

They ran into Australian infantrymen of the 39th Militia Battalion, starting a three-month campaign waged in some of the world's most forbidding terrain.<br/><br/>An Australian militia brigade went up the trail to face the Japanese, who poured in reinforcements of their own. Next the veteran Australian 7th Infantry Division, the heroes of Tobruk, plunged into the jungles and finally stopped the Japanese attacks. While Australian soldiers fought on despite rampant malaria, Japanese troops hauled artillery shells over the mountains by hand and resorted to eating Australian prisoners of war. Finally in September 1942 the Japanese withdrew from one of the war's most brutal campaigns.<br/><br/>The Kokoda Campaign is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series. Based on these battles, it includes the two maps that appeared in our old Kokoda Trail book and 242 playing pieces that originally appeared in our out-of-print Guadalcanal and Afrika Korps games. It has 30 scenarios originally designed by Dave Cheever and re-worked by Matt Ward and Daniel Rouleau, plus a campaign game.<br/><br/>",

It is a game for six players which combines diplomatic negotiation, warfare, and religious strife.  Each player represents one of the primary religions of the seventh century AD:  Western Christianity, Eastern Christianity (or the Monophysites), Islam, Zoroastrianism, Norse paganism and Shamanism.  As such, one has at one's disposal missionaries to convert others.  However, one also controls the temporal power behind these faiths--the Shamanist player controls the Avars, the Franks belong to the Western Christian player, and so on.  Conquering other territories greatly increases the effectiveness of one's missionaries.<br/><br/>There are also a great number of minor religions, which also have their adherents.<br/><br/>There are two maps--one spiritual (showing the penetration of the various religions) and one temporal (showing the spread of the various empires).<br/><br/>As in Diplomacy, one writes orders secretly (after a round of negotiation) and all orders are resolved simultaneously, with combat as appropriate.<br/><br/>",

Each player has their own color of pyramid, and there is an additional color for Cthulhu, but players can play their own pyramids or ones belonging to each other. When any one color is exhausted, the player whose color is at the the top of the completed structure wins.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire variant included with the original rules.<br/><br/>",

Each individual bird is a scientific illustration, beautifully painted -- The game sheets themselves can even double as birding checklists for the specific locations.<br/><br/>MECHANICS<br/>Birdsong has four different play modes:<br/>Competitive <br/>Solitaire<br/>Cooperative<br/>Team v Team<br/><br/>In competitive play, players colored draft dice one at a time to allocate to three different areas of their unique player board (bird spotting, preparation, and research). Some areas require a specific color. Others require a number, and some might just require any die of any color. In this mode it's important to see what dice are beneficial to your opponents as well as to yourself. After each player has allocated 18 dice, the game ends and points are tallied from the different sections to determine the winner.<br/><br/>In solitaire play, the player allocates a die and then the next most valuable die disappears. Their task is to gather as many points as possible in 6 3-die rounds.<br/><br/>In cooperative play, everybody is working together to score as many points as possible for the lowest scoring player. In this mode, players will collaborate and give up dice to other players to keep the scoring gap small.<br/><br/>Team v Team play is a variant of cooperative with the exception the players can give/trade dice with their teammates in order to keep the gap small.

        "description": "Rosemary Clark is one of the world&rsquo;s most popular and enduring cozy mystery novelists. For the past two years, however, she has lived as a recluse in her hilltop mansion, cutting off contact with friends, family, and the public at large. The reason for her withdrawal from the public eye has been a subject of much debate until earlier this week when Ms. Clark emerged to announce that she had been writing her final novel, entitled &ldquo;The Dark and Stormy Night.&rdquo; To celebrate the completion of the book, Ms. Clark invited a small group of her closest friends and associates to Winterwood Manor with the tantalizing revelation that she had featured all of them as characters in the novel. Benjamin Baker, owner of The Will Street Detective Agency and your boss, is on the guest list because of years spent advising Ms. Clark on the finer details of being a private detective. After the guests arrive and dinner has been served, Rosemary reveals that she has spent the last two years leaving her estate in secret to investigate a very specific crime and that the novel contains hints about both the crime and the one who committed it. Poised to reveal more about the plot and the main players in her mystery, Rosemary has just taken a sip of her nightcap when the lights flicker suddenly and then go out for a period of approximately ten seconds. A scream rips through the night and then the lights come back on. Inexplicably, Rosemary is gone. All that&rsquo;s left where she was standing are a few spatters of blood. After a thorough search of the house, Rosemary is nowhere to be found, and while it&rsquo;s unclear whether any sort of crime has been committed, there is a definite feeling that something is wrong here. Benjamin immediately calls you to come and investigate, insisting that he can&rsquo;t be the one to question the other guests since he is just as much a suspect as they are. Now, you are here at Winterwood Manor tasked with solving the type of serpentine mystery that Rosemary Clark was known for. Determine what happened to Rosemary Clark, search through the clues of her final novel to determine the nature of the crime and the identity of the criminal she had been investigating, and solve the mystery of The Dark and Stormy Night.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7/10<br/><br/>",

In the Trenches (ITT) challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>The second Base Set is a grab-bag of great all-new scenarios. First, the green Americans find themselves in a desperate battle with German stormtroopers. Then, the US 327th Tank Battalion rolls into action at Bois de Sonnard. And finally, because you can never have enough tanks, Mark H. Walker gives us an alt-history engagement to round out the set.<br/><br/>This base set includes all the counters you'll need to play these scenarios, PLUS all the status markers and administrative counters you'll need to play any expansion.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    176 counters to manouevre<br/>    Three 8.5x11-inch maps<br/>    1 rulebook to rifle through<br/>    1 Player Aid Card and Scenario Card<br/>    1 Game Turn Track<br/><br/><br/>(source: Tiny Battle Publishing website)<br/><br/>",

It is in this sky colony where you will find Earth&rsquo;s most powerful, wealthiest, and most influential individuals.<br/><br/>These people enjoy having the largest portion of the pie, not to mention toying with the lives of everyone else on Earth &ndash; the Underbelly, as the inhabitants of Stratos love to call it. But you are not the type who tolerates these kinds of apathetic, arrogant attitudes. You must challenge these oligarchs and get into Stratos; you consider this action to be a show of defiance, proof that the leviathan city is not exclusive to the powerful few. <br/>But first, you must establish a name in the Underbelly, a strategy that will help in getting you and your crew into Stratos. Unfortunately, this is a journey that's not free from danger. Stratos has tight security, and authorities have their eyes on the gates 24/7. Anyone caught entering illegally is subject to instant termination without trial.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you have found a way in. The Tubes &ndash; vertical shafts that serve as the city's waste chutes. The Tubes will be your one-way ticket to wonderland, your only chance of acquiring a large portion of the pie. Of course, you will need the help of your crew to get in. So hone your skills, upgrade your abilities, and procure as many supplies as possible to achieve your objective.<br/><br/>You must employ cunning strategies and pick the juiciest missions among the lot. Regardless of which faction you choose, remember to use their key abilities to your advantage. That&rsquo;s how you can outwit the competition and eventually win the game. So do you have what it takes to become a part of Stratos' elite citizenry? Or do you want to live a continued oppressed existence in the Underbelly?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You've never heard of tootophants? They are a very rare breed of elephants with golden trumpet noses that are much louder than their fellow elephants with trunks. Now the elephant circus is looking for a new circus director, because every animal would like to have the ring to itself &ndash; and there's a lot of confusion! Which one of you can collect the most elephants and tootophants and play the &ldquo;trumpet&rdquo; to his fellow players?<br/><br/>Build your own elephant circus in Der Tr&ouml;tofanten-Zirkus! To do this, at the end of the game you must have as many elephants and tootophants in front of you that are happy with you as circus director and follow you voluntarily. In the scoring, each animal lying open in front of you counts as +1 point.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game round, each player draws a card from the edge of the ring and keeps it face down in his hand. In a clockwise direction, each player now takes a turn. Only when the player to your right has completed his turn, you show your card to your fellow players and take your action.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when the last card has been drawn from the edge of the circus ring and applied. Now it is time for the scoring, and the points are counted. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

You then roll four six-sided dice. Gems require a certain number sequence in order to mine them; roll that sequence, and you can take all the gems of that type available in the mine! As the game progresses, more and more gems will be added to the table, giving players more choices as to which gems they want to try to gain. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to press your luck in order to succeed! Failure to roll what is required is not a death sentence, as you will gain a relic card when this occurs. Relic cards will give you a scoring opportunity, or can be discarded for their one time use.<br/><br/>Each character is also unique in that they each gain bonus points for acquiring the most gems of a certain type. They also each have a unique persistent ability.<br/><br/>The game ends when no gems can be added to the mine and all players have had an equal number of turns. The player with the most valuable collection of gems will be crowned the new King of Black Mountain!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a modern day shaman and supernatural champion. Waging your secret war against dark forces intent on reshaping the universe, you also face off against destiny in the wake of an uncertain prophecy that foretells destruction but gives the promise of hope. Across the world, the infant Queens of Fate are being reincarnated into the world. Can you find them before the dark powers get to them?<br/><br/>--<br/>These are the complete instructions on how to play a solitaire game called Queens of Fate, using only a deck of tarot cards and a large playing surface. I made up this game as a tool to help me learn to use and interpret the multi-faceted meaning of the tarot cards in different ways, and soon found both the game and its story to be quite addictive.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of turning over cards from the deck, one at a time and resolving them.  Depending on the type of card (classified in the game as Opposition, Arcana, Source, or Court), you will either play it into your play area, confront it in a challenge, or compare it to the previous card drawn. You have a set of Arcana cards and Source cards to use in battles, but each can only be used once.<br/><br/>The strategy of the game involves using (discarding) cards you have in play when an Opposition card comes up, or deciding whether not to confront at all and deal with the consequences.  Playing cards in certain combinations allows you to &quot;resurrect&quot; cards from the discard pile.<br/><br/>The goal is to play the four Queens, and place one in each suite-themed play area.  If you run out of cards before this happens, you lose the game.  The Queens can be lost through losing battles to Obstacle cards, which may attack your Court cards or random cards from your deck.<br/><br/>",

These numbers have no effect on play but serve as a visual aid so players may easily envision the squares to which certain pieces may have access.<br/><br/>The pieces are named after the co-ordinates by which they move.<br/>Pieces are moved to either a vacant square or to a square occupied by an opposing piece. The opposing piece is thus captured and removed from the board.<br/><br/>With the exception of 0&middot;1 pieces, captured pieces may re-enter the game on the side of the capturing player as in Shogi. In lieu of a regular move, a player may place a captured piece on any vacant square. <br/>The object of the game is to capture the opposing 0&middot;1 piece.<br/><br/>",

With this game, you will be able to recreate most any actual or hypothetical major naval engagement that occurred or could have occurred during the Great War.<br/><br/> <br/>D&amp;B was designed by Gary Graber, the designer of both Jellicoe vs Scheer and Escape of the Goeben that appeared in Panzerschrek magazine.  D&amp;B combines the ships and rules that appeared in these two games, and has added 147 new ships, new optional rules, new scenarios, and 25 blank ship counters to give gamers a comprehensive package covering the fleets of 17 nations from around the world.  A brand new class of ship--the light cruiser--makes its debut in <br/>D&amp;B.  Over 40 CL are included, along with new optional rules for their use.   Besides these light cruisers, additional ships from Argentina, Australia, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany,Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States are included in D&amp;B.<br/> What's Included:  24 page rulebook, ten 8.5&quot;x11&quot; cardstock counter sheets (345 ships plus 25 blanks), game markers and templates, and a small color sheet of counters.  D&amp;B components must be mounted and cut apart prior to play. New optional rules include Light Cruisers, Modified CA Gun Range, Rough Sea option, Battlecruiser Vulnerability rule, Low Ammunition rule, and a new optional method for determining victory<br/>points.  The optional rules originally given in the Jellicoe/Goeben Supplement (Panzerschreck #10) are included, plus new optional rules covering Light Cruisers, Modified CA Gun Ranges, Rough Sea, Battlecruiser Vulnerability, Simultaneous Movement, Low Ammunition, and a new way to calculate Victory Points, and more.  Scenarios (18 in all) include Jutland, Dogger Bank, three North Sea scenarios  Goeben vs Battlecrusiers, Escape of the Goeben, Black Sea/Adriatic/Baltic Sea scenarios, Last Sortie of the German Fleet, and several Free Form and Introductory scenarios.  The possibility of &quot;design your own&quot; situations are almost limitless.<br/>    <br/>To quote the Designer's Notes, &quot;Dreadnoughts &amp; Battlecruisers is a simple, introductory game of World War I battleship combat.  It does not aim to be the last word in Great War naval simulation; it does aim to be a fun, accessible, and competitive &quot;first word&quot; on the subject.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assassins of the Sea is a deck-building game in which the players are scientists collecting predatory cone snails that prey on fish, worms and other mollusks. The type of snail determines its strength and the type of prey eaten, and the snails produce different peptides.  To win the game, the player must build a venom arsenal of the correct peptide toxin combinations- much as the marine biochemist who co-created the game does. The winning combination of peptides always changes as it is drawn at the beginning of each game.<br/><br/>In addition to a starter deck for each player, cards may be purchased from a card market. Cards with scientific events ranging from &quot;research&quot;, which provides a peek at part of the solution, to &quot;tsunami&quot;, which shifts all the prey cards on the table, offer strategic opportunities for victory. Additionally a variety of predators may be deployed to attack the competition's snails. The game offers a dynamic play experience in which players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly<br/><br/>To win Killer Snails: Assassins of the Sea, you must out-strategize your opponents to build a venom cocktail that matches the venom cocktail created at the beginning of the game. This game was designed in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>",

Rach player starts with $5,000. Turn on the game by pressing START and a random dollar value will appear on the LED display for the mystery song chosen from computer memory. Each player deposits that amount into the JACKPOT. Players then bid the number of notes they need to name the tune until all agree that the lowest bidder may proceed. The low bidder then presses the corresponding BID-A-NOTE BUTTON for his bid. The game will play that many notes of the song and the bidder has five seconds to name that tune and press the PLAY BUTTON.(If no guess is made, the &quot;YOU LOSE&quot; tune plays, the player loses his money and is out of the round.) The game then plays then song from beginning to end. If the player is correct, he collects the money from the JACKPOT and a new round begins. If another player believes the guess was incorrect, he may press the CHALLENGE BUTTON during the playback of the song. The playback of the song will stop and the challenger has five seconds to guess the name of the song and press the play button. Other players may challenge the subsequent guess and so on. If the players cannot agree on the name of the song, the money remains in the JACKPOT for the next round of play. The winner is the player with the most money when the when it it is agreed to end the game.<br/><br/>The game includes a variation called &quot;Stop the Music&quot; and a bonus game called &quot;Follow Me&quot;. A list of the pre-stored songs is included. The games also allows the input of any song into the computer memory for one round of play.<br/><br/>",

Resafa now lies in ruins in modern-day Syria, but at this time it was a fortified desert outpost that flourished as a stop along important caravan routes.<br/><br/>In the game, players represent merchants who travel on business trips and buy and sell goods in the various cities in the region. Resafa had no local sources of water, so it depended heavily on large cisterns to collect the spring and winter rainwater to make the area habitable. Players build water tanks and canals to distribute that water where it is needed. In the cities, they build workshops to help their businesses grow, which will allow them to collect resources and camels.

Take a corner and put the marbles of your color in the groove on the edge. Each player starts with 5 marbles. The sixth is a spare, but you can leave it in the groove to mark which player is which color.<br/><br/>Rules: Roll the marbles onto the board. You can swing, drop or spin a marble onto the board. Ignore the rules for removing marbles until all of the marbles have a home on the board.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts. He takes the big marble and rolls it onto the board. He should try to push opponent's marbles to the inside and his own to the outside. Let the ball roll around until all marbles settle.<br/><br/>End of a turn: At the end of the turn if a player has a majority of marbles in the innermost circle, that player must remove a marble. Only one marble is removed per turn and the owning player chooses which to remove.<br/><br/>If there is no obvious majority (2 or more players are tied) in the innermost circle, no marble is removed. If there are no marbles in the innermost circle, then consider the marbles in the next circle out. If there is a majority, a marble will be removed. If there are no marbles in the inner two circles, then look at the 3rd circle out. If the third circle is empty, no marbles will be removed. Check for removing marbles at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>End of Game: A player with no more marbles is out of the game.<br/><br/>Last player to have marbles on the board wins.<br/><br/>",

The spaceships are mounted on antennae and plastic joints, which combine to allow a remarkable range of positions -- for example, one could have a ship positioned upside down seven inches off the playing surface.  Movement is determined simultaneously and then resolved, often resulting in disaster for the inexperienced pilot.<br/><br/>Tactical space combat over the surface of the moon, using miniatures mounted on custom 3D telescoping flight stands. Each player is given two figures and stands for each of his ships, allowing him to see his old position while figuring his next movement (the extra ships are in play only during that ship's movement) - optional rules allow play with single figures. Each ship has a &quot;fighter display&quot; for tracking status. Weapons include a variety of lasers; the advanced rules add the paralyzer &quot;glue&quot; gun; resource rules also cover bombs, rockets, and missiles. Data is provided for four fighters plus non-combatants. The rulebook also provides Mission Builder random mission and campaign rules, a pilot development system, and a brief introduction to lunar terrain.<br/><br/>Boxed set includes:<br/><br/>80-page, 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; rules booklet<br/>    Quick Start/Frequently Asked Questions sheet<br/>    4 Ship Display sheets<br/>    Assembly Instructions sheet (for the flight stands)<br/>    Example Engagement pamphlet<br/>    two template sheets<br/>    blister pack containing 2x Wardog and 2 x Moondragon ship miniatures (manufactured by Rafm)<br/>    ziploc bag containing 2 6-sided dice and 36 red and blue plastic disks (tokens)<br/>    4 unassembled flight stands<br/>        four 3&quot; x 3&quot; x 1.5&quot; varnished wooden blocks (bases)<br/>        four telescoping antennae<br/>        40 plastic 3D joints<br/><br/>Tactical.

Instead of peaceful unity, war between the colonies is declared. All agreements between the colonies have been dissolved.<br/><br/>It is Spring 1901. The divisions between the colonies is fueled by a hunger to gain control over the continent. You are the colonies  governor and have already instructed the militia forces to be mustered and ready for action.<br/><br/>Who will succeed to unify Australia? Who will forever be doomed to oblivion? What will you do to unite Australia?<br/><br/>Federation Diplomacy is a variant of the popular Hasbro game called Diplomacy. Were as Diplomacy is based in Europe with the great powers at the turn of the 20th century, Federation Diplomacy is set in Australasia in the same time. It requires a keen eye for tactics and the silver tongue of the diplomat to weave a web of alliances to see your selected colony dominate the board.<br/><br/>It is played mainly by email with movement adjudicated by an electronic judge.

Just as the film was building to its final scenes, a Mopey Mouse cartoon appeared on the screen.  The final reel of the film was missing.  A search of the house has turned up nothing.

Opp?<br/><br/>It's December 9, 1943. Gentle snowflakes fall softly on New York City as the Christmas season goes into full swing. While World War II is raging across the ocean, world-renowned USO singer, Bea B. Opp, is preparing to leave for another tour through war-torn Europe. Tonight she has invited you to a private dinner party at that famous New York City hotel, the Alldorph Hysteria, where she often performs when she is stateside. After dinner, Miss Opp will debut her latest song, written by Big Band leader, Harry Lumbar. What a wonderful opportunity to see her perform before she and her troupe leave for the front lines, to nobly entertain our brave soldiers for Christmas on her upcoming USO tour. Yes, it's sure to be a night filled with glitz and glamor, as the stars come out to show their stuff. But you know what they say about stars: They always burn brightest before they die . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Constance Leigh Wyning, who epitomizes the beauty and dazzle of a USO singer. Always effervescent, she gurgles with talent, motivating our boys abroad to &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&quot; Yet her sparkle is more than skin deep; she's a home grown girl from the Midwest, a real American sweetheart, discovered and brought to the stage by Bea B. Opp herself.<br/><br/>Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.<br/><br/>Major Hornswagle &quot;Horn&quot; D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.<br/><br/>Jessica &quot;Jess&quot; Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.<br/><br/>W.A.C. Pilot Bunny &quot;Bun&quot; P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.<br/><br/>Oliver &quot;Ol&quot; W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.<br/><br/>Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;genius.&quot; Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.<br/><br/>Winona &quot;Wi&quot; Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers. Grown up to be a glamorous songstress, she was a shoe-in when Bea B. Opp was gathering together a USO troupe. Sophisticated, sleek, and always the professional entertainer, she someday hopes to be as big a star as Miss Opp herself.<br/><br/>This is a fabulous mystery for those of you who love the 1940s and big band music. Because the storyline is centered around a USO troupe, playing swing music throughout the party is a must. Also, if you're looking for a party where everyone can dress up more glamorously, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>And since this game is set in December, if you like, you can even drag out your holiday decorations and set them up to add to the scene. This is especially fun in the middle of summer.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, was there ever a more romantic era than the 40s?<br/><br/>",

The date is September 14, 1885, and you've been invited to join R. Eli Ritch, Colorado cattle baron and railroad tycoon, known for his power as well as his politics. You and his private party will take a weekend pleasure trip on that famous train, the Silver Spittoon, as it winds through the splendor of the Rocky Mountains, from Durango to Telluride. Of course, you'll be staying in one of Mr. Ritch's private Pullman cars, as well as eating in his private dining car. And on Saturday night, you'll enjoy a special celebration dinner, courtesy of Mr. Ritch's hospitality.<br/><br/>So pack your petticoats and pantaloons and hop aboard! It promises to be a weekend to remember. And for some, the opportunity of a lifetime . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Mariam Ritch is the wife of your host, R. Eli Ritch. Refined and ravishing, she runs the Ritch household so Eli can run the ranch. For she's a woman who knows her priorities and her place, and puts her husband first. Always wearing the latest of fashions from the East, she's a real society lady. Though it's rumored that her past may not be so reputable . . .<br/><br/>Bad Billy Bob Bobbitt is a rawboned rambler, known to travel from town to town, though no one seems to know what he does for a living. And while he's as good with a gun as he is at the gambling table, word has it his picture has been seen on more than one Wanted Poster. Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.<br/><br/>Burgandy &quot;Bur&quot; Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.<br/><br/>Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, &quot;It's never a good day to die.&quot; And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.<br/><br/>Virginia &quot;Virgin&quot; Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.<br/><br/>S. Cooper &quot;Coop&quot; DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7&cent; novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.<br/><br/>Manfred &quot;Man&quot; Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues. His attire usually fits the occasion: whether that means working on the tracks or attending a Sunday social.<br/><br/>Aimee &quot;Aim&quot; Ann Chute, is considered the best aim in the West, and is the star of Beaver Bob's Mild West Show. Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life. She's considered a woman years ahead of her time and often wears pants or pantskirts.<br/><br/>See the West as it never was . . . Or at least, we hope it was never like this . . .<br/><br/>Not only does this game have some amusing and not-too-terribly-bright characters, but this game is especially fun when it comes to costume potential! When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.<br/><br/>",

Finally the Dragon let out its anger, and began its revenge on the human kingdom of Silverado. The nearby villages burned from its breath, and every temple was destroyed. The Dragon proceeded towards the Royal Palace. Is there anyone who can stop the Dragon?<br/><br/>Dragon Attack is a simple fantasy boardgame. The player becomes an adventurer, and traverses Silverado, forming a party to stand against the Dragon. However, killing the Dragon is not the only objective. To revive the ruined Silverado will require a vast amount of money. In the end, when the Dragon is slain, the player with the most treasures becomes the true victor, and achieves glory for a long time.<br/><br/>(The above is my translation of the introduction to the game)<br/><br/>The game is a hex-and-counter style of game, where you move around the map, and turning over hidden counters to find enemies, allies, and treasure. However, anytime you roll a '1', the Dragon moves along a pre-determined path and destorys a village/temple. If noone can defeat the Dragon before it destroys the Royal Palace, everyone loses, making it a game where the players both compete against each other for treasure and against the game itself because of the Dragon-imposed time limit.<br/><br/>",

The hex grid mapboard is double sided -- one side is for the two player game, the other side is for three players.  The object of the game is to occupy hexes in an opponent's space station (indicated by a small group of colored hexes.)  Players have two types of pawns: yeoman satellites and explorer satellites.  Yeoman satellites are restricted to the owning player's home territory.  Pawns may jump to move, and opposing pieces are captured by jumping.  Some hexes have obstructions which prohibit movement into or over them.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Lancer<br/><br/><br/>",

There are also &quot;fuel depleted&quot; and &quot;damaged&quot; markers that may be inserted in each tank. Fuel may be transferred between tanks to extend movement.<br/><br/>The board features a somewhat abstract limited terrain map (essentially river and plain spaces) over which the tanks move.

Playability is the thrust of these rules, not complexity. Included are rules for setting up a campaign series of games, but players wishing more expansive campaigns will find the basics herein to enlarge upon. To reflect the conditions of the American theater during the various times of combat, heavy cavalry has been omitted -- but militia, riflemen, and natives (Indians) are included. With additions and adjustments of a minor nature, these rules will be eminently suitable for European warfare in the same period.<br/><br/>",

Our job is to rescue Bambino Dino!<br/><br/>We work as a Team to save little Dino by lowering the Water level until he is dry and also help give him the Food he likes best.<br/><br/>This is an excellent game to introduce the co-operative concept to young children. Simple to grasp with color-coded dice that indicate when to pick a helpful Tool or some Food and also when to build the Water higher and higher.<br/><br/>Though luck plays a part in keeping up the suspense, there are choices to be made, so you must do some thinking and discussing. Everyone's contribution matters. Have fun and remember to share your Tools. We need everyone's help.<br/><br/>Ages 4-6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Check - The Chess Card Game is an original card game which takes the classic Chess concept and packages it up in an original deck of 64 full-colour playing cards. There are sixteen cards in each of the four traditional suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. The goal is the same as Chess, to take the opponent's King, but gameplay is truly unique.<br/><br/>Each player plays with the cards of one suit, which evens the playing field substantially over many card games which are based principally on the luck of the draw. Each card in the deck has a numerical attack strength and an attack pattern which will be familiar to Chess players. However, unlike Chess, the eight Pawn cards have different attack strengths. The number one pawn is called the Ace and can be used in special attacks.<br/><br/>The game combines mainly strategic thinking with an element of luck, and some bluffing. In most turns, one card is taken from each player. Formulating an attack which takes more than one card, or a defence where no cards are lost, is a key strategic element of the game.<br/><br/>There are four game modes for 2, 3 and 4 players, plus a collaborative Alliance mode where two pairs team up against each other.<br/><br/>Unlike some other Chess variants which use cards to modify the traditional game of Chess, Check is a stand-alone card game. No board is required to play.<br/><br/>",

I've no idea if any further issues were produced eventually and this appears to be one of the first attempts at &quot;Desk Top Publishing&quot;.<br/> The components for this game consist of the following: 11-inches by 17-inches paper Mapsheet; 2-sets of thick paper counters-1-GREEN(U.S., French, British), 1-TAN(Germans &amp; Italians); a Set of BASIC &amp; ADVANCED Rules; and on the BACK of the Magazine are the Map Legend; Terrain Effects Chart; Combat Resolution table; Turn Record track; and Weather effects tables. The Mapsheet, Unit Deployment &amp; Reinforcement Charts and Counters will have to be separated from the magazine while the Counters will have to be cut apart for use.<br/> The Map sheet is TAN overall with BLACK print for all terrain details. The thick paper counters have Nationality indications on top of the UNIT Type symbol, Historical Formation numerals, and basically have separate COMBAT &amp; MOVEMENT numerical designations ALL printed in BLACK.<br/> The BASIC game Sequence of Play is as follows: A)Reinforcement Phase-Advance the TURN marker one, then BOTH players conduct placement or withdrawal of any Units indicated; B)AXIS Movement; C)AXIS Combat; D) ALLIED Movement; E)ALLIED Combat; F)Victory Determination.<br/> The ADVANCED game adds Replacements, Weather Determination, Tactical Air, an Operations Phase, Headquarters Units, Special Units Abilities, Cohesion Factors, Variable Forces allowances, Operations Points Allocations, Movement through Enemy Zones of Control, &amp; Overruns.<br/> During the Operations Phase, each player rolls a single 6-sided DIE with highest die-roller going first. He then rolls a 6-sided DIE and that's how many Operations Points he uses at that time. Then the other player gets to roll 2--6-sided DICE for HIS O.P.s. After this, then EACH player will roll 2--6-sided DICE, consecutively, until BOTH decide NOT to spend anymore O.P.s. Units can be Moved &amp; then Attack including Overruns, but once they DO conduct Combat, then they're done for the turn. There is an Operations Chart with action COSTS indicated for use during the Operartions Phase. An interesting approach with somewhat novel concepts for being the first attempt at publishing a very limited run edition for this company.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hellenistic Warfare (329-146BC) table top miniatures rules<br/><br/>This is designed as a supplement to Hoplite Warfare, to extend the latter&rsquo;s time period from its rather vague end&mdash;point at some point in Alexander&rsquo;s campaign in Persia to 146 B.C. when, with the destruction of the cities of Carthage and Corinth, Rome stamped her authority over the Mediterranean world. So to use this booklet you also need Hoplite Warfare.<br/><br/>The political and military history of this period is set on a great canvas. In the Eastern Mediterranean the armies of great monarchies replace the small wars of Greece, and the Greek cities band together into political leagues in an attempt to match these large kingdoms; while in the West, was Rome&rsquo;s vast struggle against Carthage. Finally Rome faced the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek Leagues; those that opposed her, one by one succumbed.<br/><br/>This was one of the great ages of scientific warfare. In the Hellenistic world armies of professional soldiers were led by generals who knew their business, the founders of the great kingdoms being, as it were, schooled by Alexander. Roman generals usually incompetently led soldiers whose length of service made them equally professional. The Carthaginians relied almost totally on professional mercenary soldiers.<br/><br/>Despite initial apprehensions, it was found that the modifications needed to simulate this period were not huge. The changes that have been made are an increase in armor classes to cover more heavily equipped cavalry, some changes to morale to cover the effect of elephants, shooting is modified to cater for the Roman pilum (as is hand&mdash;to&mdash;hand combat), the system for catering with unformed and disorganized troops is changed and the major addition, rules to simulate elephants. The training classes are slightly altered and rules added to simulate cavalry dismounting to fight as infantry &ldquo;taking the Omens&rdquo; is catered for.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hyperspace is an exploration game featuring a planet that has four physical dimensions. Two players compete to find the mountain (presumably mineral-bearing and therefore valuable) portions of the planet, using four playing pieces each of which can move across only one of the four terrain types. Terrain tiles are placed face-down, and are turned up when a player attempts to move a piece into the tile. If it's a mountain tile, the moving player scores a point. Tiles are turned over even if the moving piece isn't allowed to move into that type of terrain. The game ends when all the tiles have been turned face-up, and the player with the high score then wins. The counter mix deliberately provides more tiles than spaces on the board, but only 16 mountain tiles.<br/><br/>",

As described in the rules:<br/><br/>Battle of Atlanta War Centennial Game is a war game featuring the Atlanta Campaign of 1864, and also includes other war games centered around the East Tennessee and Northern Georgia battles of 1863-1864.  These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.  Having military experience is no advantage-- the methods of play are definite, decisive and easily mastered.&quot;<br/><br/>The game board, while rudimentary, includes rivers, mountains, high ridges, railroads, roads, streams, towns and cities.  Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.<br/><br/>The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.  There wasn't much competition for Avalon Hill in the early 60s, but fans of Avalon Hill's early games will immediately recognize elements of this one.<br/><br/>",

As opposed to other companies who are looking to turn a fast buck on Opoly style games, we at Opoly Enterprises are working closely with religious and community leaders to bring family values and history to games without offensive or controversial content. These games are under development, with trademarks in the application process of the USPTO.<br/><br/>The careful undertaking of JewishopolyTMand our other game titles: Christianopoly TM, IslamopolyTM, Latinopoly, TM, and ArmenianopolyTM, are all a labor of love. We are sure you will be able to share these games and play them time and time again with family and friends. The games we produce at Opoly Enterprises are so much more than a board, a couple of dice and some cards.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, players must record their ideal romantic journey that they would receive from the other player should they win the game. Players move together in a 21 room mansion and earn privileges they can perform with their partner who has a right of refusal.<br/><br/>The rooms in Romantic Journey do not have furniture - they come alive as you fill them with your thoughts, hopes, dreams and desires.  There is only one movement piece because both players share all experiences in Romantic Journey; for instance, it wouldn't be very romantic if you were in the utility room and your partner was in the game room.  There are no losers in our house.  Everyone is a winner who travels through Romantic Journey.<br/><br/>",

Their owners move them from station to station based on the result of a die roll.  A train must land exactly on a station to pick up or sell cargo there.  If a train lands on a green Fortune space, its owner draws a Fortune card and follows its instructions.

        "description": "From Bruno Faldetti's Review:<br/><br/>The name sounds like a Japanese war cry, and the game looks a bit like Go. With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens&eacute; Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.<br/><br/>Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.<br/><br/>Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players. Furthermore, it really looks like an exotic traditional game that you brought back from holidays, and will make a strong impression in your lounge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moves is a simple, turn-based game but also a mastermind brain cracker. The game starts with 8 stones (7 pawns and a king) on each side. You try to defeat your opponents by taking the opponent king or 6 of the opponent pawns. The number on the stones tell you how many tiles it can move straight or in an L-Bow. The idea for this game is taken from Shogun, but its not entirely the same. Set the &quot;Moves Mastermind&quot; option when starting a game to show numbers on the board and you will know what number your stone will get next when you move it. This games comes with 5 imaginary friends of fine-tuned artificial intelligence to play off line against your computer, but also allows for multiplayer over LAN or Internet.<br/><br/>You can find more information here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.codeimp.com/moves_info.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.codeimp.com/moves_info.php</a><br/><br/>You can download the game here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.codeimp.com/moves_download.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.codeimp.com/moves_download.php</a><br/><br/>",

The Battle of the Piave, also called the &quot;Battle of the Solstice&quot; in Italy, was a part of the last desperate offensive of the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire to bring about a decision in its war with Italy. After its failure the disintegration of the Habsburg forces accelerated. This situation presented the Italian leadership with the opportunity to score a glorious military victory in the last days of the war in order to enhance the Italian stature at the peace conference to follow in Paris. The resulting battle is called Vittorio Veneto, like Waterloo, sharing its name with a town north of the actual battlefield.<br/><br/>The 11&quot; x 17&quot; map represents the Italian battlefield using large hexes with contact boxes between. The 280 counters represent the combat forces involved in the struggle.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a 48-page booklet - players must provide their own miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.<br/><br/>Ranger covers small actions in the F&amp;I war.  Rogers' Rangers, Indians, line troops, marines, militia, coureurs de bois - the rules differentiate between them all.   Rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, morale, wounds, disorganization, etc., are given.<br/><br/>Due to the extensive wilderness this war was fought in, there are rules for &quot;fog of war.&quot;  Each unit uses a &quot;tray&quot; - a simple board to hold the miniatures on.  But you don't put the miniatures on the trays until contact is made.  Instead, depending on the terrain, you actually use more trays than you have units!  Certain amounts of dummy trays are allotted in each scenario, and you have to scout them out to see which are real and which are not.  Even then you may not be able to tell what type of troops are on the trays until they fire at you...<br/><br/>Another interesting rule is the &quot;officer incident&quot; rule.  At the end of each move when in fire combat, you must roll on the officer incident table.  This is a table of 66 events - use 2d6, reading them as percentile dice.  Results range from beneficial to deleterious, from mild to instant death.  Many are humorous, such as #44: &quot;A musket ball misses the officer's head, hits the flag staff, breaking it, the finial landing on the officer's crown, knocking him out.

        "description": "This game is simply a small booklet, 36 pages.  The players need to supply miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.  This game is strictly for skirmish wargaming, meaning one figure represents one person.<br/><br/>The game contains rules for miniatures gaming with 17th-century swashbuckling pirates and musketeers, as seen in the movies.  Rules are given for movement, ranged combat,  melee combat, morale, etc.  The most interesting rules are the &quot;cinematic&quot; rules, however.  Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a <b>lot</b> of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.<br/><br/>Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.  Very entertaining!<br/><br/>The rules not only deal with figures, but also cover ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind even though these are sailing ships.<br/><br/>Finally, the game provides two scenarios - &quot;Scripts,&quot; they call it, in keeping with their cinematic theme.  One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.<br/><br/>This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.  It doesn't require a lot of miniatures to get started - even four figures per side makes for an entertaining game.<br/><br/>[Note: there is a companion volume, Once Upon a Time in the West Country, set in the English Civil War.  Similar rules system, somewhat less cinematic.]<br/><br/>",

If you hit your opponent's tail peg you will send it forward one past the the same color lead peg, if you hit your opponent's head peg you will send it backward one past the rear peg. And if that displaced peg happens to end up in another peg's hole, another &quot;crash&quot; occurs... This greatly enhances the strategy involved in the pegging phase of the game.<br/><br/>The card play is exactly the same as traditional cribbage and the track is exactly 121 holes.<br/><br/>On the back of the Crash Cribbage board, a regular cribbage board is found.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Italian TV game, inspired by the quiz show with the same name made by the Italian-American anchorman Mike Bongiorno.<br/>Every player has some &quot;answer&quot; cards. Every turn a question is randomly selected and the player has to play the card with the answer or a joker. If he has no answer, then a question is made to which the player has to answer by voice, if he knows the answer. The winner is the first that, by doubling every time the 40,000 Liras he got at the start, reaches the sum of 5,120,000 Liras.<br/>The game includes a board, two decks of cards, a little arrow rotating on a cardboard base, a question booklet and 36 &quot;golden&quot; coins of size proportional to the value. The box looks like a TV set of that time, in wood with a silver &quot;screen&quot; in relief.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunder on South Mountain covers the American Civil War battle at South Mountain fought over Turner's and Fox's Gaps, September 14, 1862.<br/><br/>Following the discovery of Confederate Special Order No. 191, which outlined the disposition of General Robert E. Lee's entire army across the countryside, Union commander Gen. George McClellan moved to catch the Rebel Army while it was so dispersed. At South Mountain, the Federal First and Ninth Corps tangled with an assorted Confederate force under D.H. Hill, who fought the battle of his life. Could he hold the Yankees at bay and buy enough time for Lee to pull his scattered army back together?<br/><br/>Thunder on South Mountain is a tactical, brigade-level simulation of low complexity with an emphasis on command and control. A unique &quot;army posture&quot; matrix determines the sequence of play each turn, and leader effectiveness is governed by a combination of momentum, luck, and resource management.<br/><br/>Based on the Fire in Mississippi system, the game adds several new features such as long-range artillery fire and target disruption, line of sight, corps leaders, and variable reinforcement times.<br/><br/>Thunder on South Mountain is of high DTP (Desktop Publishing) quality with an 11x17 color map, 140 two-sided, color counters (that must be mounted and cut apart), a rules booklet, and player charts and cards.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt 4 Number Cards and a number of Vehicle Markers depending on the number of players.

These allow you to draw a Number Card, ask another player for a specific type of Number Card, or to look at another player's hand and take the Number Card you want. If you have a pair of matching numbers, you place them in the discard pile and go again. Instead of placing a Vehicle Marker on the next Track Card, you may instead give it to another player. The game ends when someone plays their last Vehicle Marker, or when the End Card is reached on the track, in which case the player with the fewest Markers wins.<br/><br/>",

The red herring's track overlaps the fish movement track in two &quot;danger zones&quot;. If the red herring's movement ends on a fish tile (or vice versa), the fish tile must return to the start.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls all 3 dice. The red herring is moved the number on the red die. The player may then move one of his fish tiles the total of the white dice combined, or he may move two fish tiles the number on each die separately.<br/><br/>The fish tiles are numbered on their reverse sides from 1 through 6. As a bonus move, when a fish tile ends his move on another player's fish tile, he may move the number of spaces indicated on the bottom of that tile. This may result in a another such bonus further along the track.<br/><br/>",

But mankind discovered a new weapon to fight the creatures of darkness.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Dr. Jack&rdquo; developed a way to tear the very essence of these horrors from their undead flesh and graft it into living blood and bones. For many years, the &ldquo;Rippers&rdquo; took back the night, and the hunters became the hunted.<br/><br/>The vile fiends of the world were backed into a corner, but under the leadership of Dracula himself, formed a &ldquo;Cabal&rdquo; of evil to combat those who hunted them. Their timing was perfect&mdash;for the essences the Rippers stole from their prey eventually corrupted the monster hunters.<br/><br/>The very men who created the Rippers&mdash;Moreau, Frankenstein, and even Dr. Jack himself&mdash;went mad and joined the Cabal!<br/><br/>Now Abraham Van Helsing and his mysteriously adopted son, Johann, the Harkers, Witch Hunter Serious Chapel, and a handful of other stout hearts are all that remain of the Rippers. It is their lot to carry on the Horror War.<br/><br/>Rippers: The Horror War is a complete miniatures skirmish game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you roll the dice and either move your piece(s) counterclockwise around the board (as per the rules for backgammon), or bear off a piece if the number on the space it occupies is equal to one of the die rolls. A captured piece must be returned to the board on a space whose number is equal to one of the die rolls. The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner.<br/><br/>",

He decided to produce a much simpler system for conducting 'minis' Combat in order to accustom folks to the entire idea of using them. There have been numerous attempts at this, but very few succeeded(if any), and his 'entry' is a long way towards fulfilling this accomplishment.<br/><br/>What you get are a very large Ziploc Baggie to store it all within; (3)Booklets(designed for 1/285, 1/300, 15mm, or even 20mm); (1&amp;1/2)-Full Color Sheets(providing Terrain Markers, a 'Compass', &amp; 'Firing Arcs' for Guns &amp; Target aspects); a &quot;Combat Results Table&quot; with the &quot;Sequence of Play&quot; on the reverse; a &quot;Terrain Effects Chart&quot; while on it's reverse are the &quot;Range Effects&quot;, &quot;Mine Attacks&quot;, &quot;Command Efficiency&quot; Tables &amp; a &quot;Movement Orders Chart&quot; with a &quot;Scatter Diagram&quot;; a &quot;Unit Roster Sheet&quot; while on it's reverse side is the &quot;Artillery Fire Target Plotting Chart&quot;; there is a sheet of &quot;Unit VALUES Card&quot; while on the reverse of this are markers for &quot;Wrecks&quot;, and small 'S' &amp; 'D' ones; and Players will need to provide at least (1) or more DICE of the '12', '8', &amp; '6'-sided variety, before commencing play. Players are given permission to copy anything pertinent to the gameplay using this 'system', and it is highly suggested for some items.<br/><br/>Of the (3) Booklets included, the 'Minis' one is '28' pages long and details the Rules system; the next one is the &quot;Consolidated Weapons Data&quot; that is '24' pages, along with some 'Supplement' Sheets; and the last one is the &quot;Tables of Organization &amp; Scenario Design&quot; which is '60' pages long. The &quot;Rules&quot; explain what to do during the &quot;Sequence of Play&quot; which is detailed as follows: 1)-Joint Plot Phase; 2)-Initiative Phase; 3)-Posture Determination Phase; 4)-Joint Indirect Phase; 5)-Joint Direct Fire Phase; 6)-Joint Movement Phase; &amp; 7)-Marker Removal Phase. The &quot;Consolidated Weapons Data&quot; Booklet (and 'Supplement' Sheets) provide detailed information for many Nation's weapons and vehicles that are associated with them. There are even individual 'stats' for BOTH of Spain's &quot;Civil War&quot; participants(the Nationalists &amp; Republicans!). The &quot;Table of Organizations and Scenario Design&quot; Booklet gives detailed make-ups of various Nation's Units and even during different periods of the entirety of World War 2! With these at your disposal, you should be up and running your own 'minis' based &quot;Wargame&quot; in very little time.<br/><br/>",

There are six (Lucy, Pigpen, Woodstock, Franklin, Snoopy, and Charlie Brown) sets  of cards, each set having the values 1 through 9. The object of the game is to get rid of all the Charlie Brown cards in your hand.<br/><br/>All the cards are dealt to the players. Each player selects and passes two cards unseen to the player on their left.<br/><br/>Dealer then leads with any card from his hand. Other players must play the same character from their hand if they can, else any other. The player who played the lead character with the highest value wins the trick.<br/><br/>Once all the tricks have been won, players total up the values of all Charlie Brown cards in their tricks - lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "George Washington's Campaigns is a boxed boardgame featuring scenarios for the battles of Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.  A square, heavy cardboard base with raised frame allows specific battlefields to be composed from a set of 144 one-by-one-inch terrain tiles (using the backs for &quot;clear&quot; terrain), producing a square-grid map.  Terrain tile types include hill (white slope splashes on brown), wooded (white outlines of trees on green), swamp (green swamp grass humps on white), river (white waves on blue), fort (white squares on brown), city (white &quot;streets&quot; on brown), objective (star), and combinations of several of these types (such as city streets superimposed on brown-backed hill).<br/><br/>Scenario cards provide a summary of each battle, order of battle for each side, terrain diagram for board set-up, and initial deployment.  Several scenarios have special rules or late-appearing forces.<br/><br/>Combat units are 7/8&quot; square two-sided counters.  Full-strength side is a white silhouette (infantryman, rider, or cannon) on a dark blue (Continental) or bright red (British) background.  Also represented are French (lighter shade of blue) and Hessians (lighter shade of red).  The reverse side of each counter is a national-color silhouette on white, representing a reduced-strength unit.<br/><br/>Units are further differentiated into Regular, Light, and Grenadier Infantry, Artillery, or mounted Dragoons.  The counter mix includes includes eight Continental infantry units (all rated as Light), two Continental Dragoons and two Continental Artillery, plus two French Regulars, one French Light, one French Grenadier, one French Dragoon and one French Artillery.<br/><br/>On the side of the Crown are six British Regular, one British Light, one British Grenadier, two British Dragoon and two British Artillery units, plus two Hessian Regular, one Hessian Light, one Hessian Grenadier, one Hessian Dragoon and one Hessian Artillery.<br/><br/>Most battles feature from seven to ten units on a side.  From battle to battle, unit scale, obviously abstracted, varies from one regiment to a division each.  The overall composition of each army in a scenario, however, strives to represent the historic proportions present at that action.<br/><br/>Unit scale, combined with the grid scale of each battlefield, allows great variety in approach and many options for force allocation and maneuver.<br/><br/>Movement is Igo-Ugo with a twist.  Movement is regulated by the draw of one card each turn by each player.  Cards are pre-cut, about three by two inches, glossy red on the back with a red number on the face.  The number on each card (from one to ten) indicates the total number of movement points that may be expended by the owner's side that turn.  There are a total of forty cards, one for each turn in a scenario.  When the cards are all used, the scenario is ended.<br/><br/>Movement points may be divided among the owning player's units in any manner desired.  One unit might move ten spaces through clear terrain, or multiple units may be moved in any desired order, so long as the maximum number of moves for that turn (defined by the card drawn) is not exceeded.  Friendly units may move through one another, but no stacking is permitted at turn's end.<br/><br/>Rules (which only total four pates) are divided into &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Advanced.&quot;  In the Basic Game, Swamps stop movement and rivers may only be crossed at diagonal bends between river squares (representing &quot;fords&quot; or &quot;bridges&quot;).  No diagonal movement is permitted except for such river crossings.<br/><br/>In the Advanced Game, terrain becomes more restrictive; Artillery, for example, may not enter Forest or Swamp squares.  Dragoons and Light Infantry units may move diagonally--a significant advantage.  Dragoons, if chosen for movement,  may also move two squares for each &quot;turn movement point&quot; allowed on the movement card for that turn.  Advanced Rules also provide for defensive benefits in fort, city or hill terrain, a quality advantage for Grenadiers, new rules for retreats, and Bayonet Attacks--costly but devastating if successful.<br/><br/>Units adjacent to enemy units at turn's end will receive defensive fire (roll one or two on a D6 for a hit).  Units are flipped on the first hit, eliminated on the second.  Attacking units which receive a first hit are retreated one space.  Surviving friendly units will then attack an adjacent enemy unit by the same method.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by points scored.  Two points are scored for each &quot;objective square&quot; occupied by a friendly unit at game's end, and one point for each enemy unit eliminated.  Given the area represented by each battlefield map, players usually have a choice between driving for geographical objectives and destroying enemy forces.  However, troop resources are finite and a reverse often compels a change in plan.<br/><br/>Although &quot;George Washington's Campaigns&quot; might more accurately be titled &quot;Battles of George Washington,&quot; a campaign game rule provides for a victory based on accrued points from multiple battle scenarios.  Since each scenario plays fast--rarely more than an hour--this is a viable approach to the game.<br/><br/>The game is free of ambiguity and errors, provides a fine vehicle for introducing new gamers to the hobby, and provides a fast but entertaining and balanced puzzle for the more experienced.  Almost thirty years later, it is notable for its clean rules, accessibility, and replayability.  Until the recent appearance of Decision Games' American Revolution series, it also provided the only published Long Island scenario in the gaming world.<br/><br/>This game was evidently produced with the U.S. Bicentennial (1976).  The number of copies printed is unknown; this game was found in the early 1980's at a shop in Alexandria, Va.  The box is approximately 16 x 14 by 1 1/2 inches in size, white background with a large blue drawing of Washington and his staff mounted on a hil, with red, white and blue letters in the lower right proclaiming the title.  Included is a cardboard insert providing a tray for pieces and printed examples of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is about a battle between two or more giant creatures.  The components consist of several rubber monsters (dinosaurs, giant gorillas, etc.) that are about 4 inches tall and mounted on wood blocks.<br/><br/>You play on a 4 x 4 square board.  Each turn you choose cards from your deck to play that indicates which direction you will move, and another that indicates which direction you will end up facing.  Diagonal movement or facing is not allowed.<br/><br/>Both players play simultaneously, so it is basically a guessing game of trying to anticipate where your opponent will move.  If your creature ends up adjacent to your opponent's creature AND is facing it, then you inflict a &quot;hurt&quot; on your opponent.  It takes 3 &quot;hurts&quot; to win.<br/><br/>Some of the creatures have different abilities, including armor (blocks an attack), more agility (can turn 180 degrees instead of just 90), or multiple attacks (like the Stegosaurus who can attack with his head or his tail).<br/><br/>",

The board has 3 tracks: a Guy Path (where you try to get a date with the guy you like), a Date Path (where you find out what happens on your date), and a Heart Path that tracks how much your guy likes you. To start, you select your Favorite Guy. On your turn, you move along the Guy Path (using a spinner) trying to land on a picture of your guy. When you do, you move to the Date Path and travel along it (gaining or losing Hearts depending on how things go). When your marker on the Heart Track reaches the telephone space, you spin the spinner to see if your Favorite Guy will call. If the spinner matches your Favorite Guy space color, he asks you to the Prom and you win.<br/><br/>",

The object is to collect the most Jem and Jessica heart pieces. On your turn, you roll the die and advance the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a &quot;Jem&quot; or &quot;Jessica&quot; space, you take a corresponding heart piece and then test Rio's affections. To do this you take the magnetic Jem or Jessica card and place either side against the magnetic Rio card. If the cards stick together, Rio is attracted to that girl and the player receives another heart. If the cards push apart, Rio is not interested and the player's turn ends. If you land on a guitar space, you must guess the next song that is randomly played on the audio cassette to receive two hearts (for either girl). Rio cards can be draw to help you or hinder your opponent. When a player reaches the Rio space at the end of the track, Rio's affections are tested one final time against either girl. If the cards stick then that girl his his true love, otherwise he likes the other girl. The player who has the most hearts for Rio's true love is the winner.<br/><br/>",

I imagine most of the &lsquo;game&rsquo; here is managing your PAC correctly vis-&agrave;-vis the map.<br/><br/>Other counters include DD tanks, commandos, coastal artillery, strong points, naval bombardment and TAC air markers and a whole handful with Japanese text (which is somewhat rare in Japanese games actually).<br/><br/>This game is way up on my list of games needing translation.

Body Talk is designed to help remedy this situation- and it's plenty of fun, too! How do you say 'I love you' without opening your mouth? How do you signal concern to another person without using words or a facial expression? How would you show fear with your hands alone? It's a lot of fun to find out how you would do all these things - and an important education in the communicative possibilities of your physical being. Since scientific research has indicated that as much as 93% of the impact of what you communicate to others is conveyed by nonverbal means, it is a matter of some importance that you learn more specifically what these means are.<br/><br/>Body Talk is an experience in the nonverbal sharing of feelings.  Here you can give yourself fully to an emotion, feel it in each muscle group, and let your body speak for you.  Open all your senses to yourself and to those with you.<br/><br/>",

Supplementary sources of income are bear-hunting and bounty-hunting (there are sometimes &quot;Wanted&quot;-warrants out for the men of one or more players).  After each round of player action, the bears move autonomously (on the squares) and keep the players on their toes by occasionally attacking / eating their employees.

Each player (offensive and defensive) secretly chooses a slide depicting their play choice, and one player sets the randomizing knob on the game's slide projector. They then view the two overlaid slides which produce an image of the play in progress, moving them through until a yardage/penalty result shows up at the bottom of the screen. Standard scoring rules for American football apply.<br/><br/>At least two editions of the game were produced. The first edition in 1973 had no official tie ins with the NFL. It provided 25 &quot;team&quot; markers listing the host city for each NFL team of the day, replacing &quot;New England&quot; with &quot;Boston&quot; and only giving one marker for &quot;New York&quot;. A later edition featured O.J. Simpson on the box cover and the game was retitled accordingly.<br/><br/>",

If they do not match, the outcome of the pitch is a ball, a strike, or a foul ball.<br/><br/>If the batter makes contact, the player at bat rolls the dice again to determine where on the field the ball is hit. The player in the field then rolls a die and moves a fielder based upon that roll in an attempt to make a play on the ball. If a fielder cannot be moved where he can make a play, the result is a base hit.

With no warning, a violent storm sweeps the grounds of the estate, but that's not the only violence afoot! After the storm subsided, self-made multi-millionaire Reginald Arcain went for a stroll to admire his sweeping grounds and check for damage. His body was later found near the grove of tall oaks that gives the manor its name. Who did him in? The successful publisher, the local physician, the beautiful maid, or someone else? By the time the evening's over, you'll know the truth!<br/><br/>Contents: Invitation, name tags, a map, clue booklets, the police report, complete instructions (and the solution to the crime), along with an optional CD-ROM<br/><br/>",

Cards are placed face down next to the track and another player landing on one must end his turn, reveal the card and move the indicated number of spaces (1,3,5,7 or 9 spaces back, 2,4,6 or 8 spaces forward). <br/>If the fox reaches any player's piece or a player moves his piece up to the fox, a score card is taken.

This simple abstract game for two players consists of a 5-by-5 square board, 5 red pieces and 5 yellow pieces. Pieces of the same colour start in a row at opposite ends of the board and players take turns to move a piece of their colour one square at a time orthogonally. A piece may also jump over one other piece as a move. The central square on the board is occupied by a four-leaf clover and pieces may not enter this square nor jump over it. A player wins when he or she makes a move that completes a square (I interpret this to be a 2-by-2 square) containing 2 red and 2 yellow pieces (the two colours may be side-by-side or crossing diagonally).<br/><br/>",

Every player controls a team of four gorillas; armed with bulging muscles, bad tempers, and explosive Banana Grenades. The object? To be the king of the jungle, of course.<br/><br/>&quot;Gorilla Warfare is here and ready to play! The entire game took only 24 hours to create, but I tell you this; it almost ranks up there with Empires in playable fun. I always like moving my Gorillas around like a S.W.A.T. Team. No one can sneak up on you, and if anyone gets too close, all four Gorilla's are just about in equal throwing distance to fry the primate. Of course, this is a bad idea if an enemy has a Class 5 Banana Grenade, as the explosion can wipe out a good part of the play field...&quot;<br/><br/>Outdated link:<br/>View the rules, FAq, etc at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.whitemask.com/gorilla/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.whitemask.com/gorilla/</a><br/><br/>",

It can be played either multi-player or solo, with the mobs being controlled by the game system and the players taking the role of either the forces of law and order quelling the rioters or journalists recording the event and reporting scenes of police brutality.<br/><br/>This game has been written purely with fun in mind and it is not an attempt at a simulation of urban violence per se.  The rules have been written for 1:300 scale, but can be easily adjusted for 15mm or 25mm.<br/><br/>",

The Yin forces try to capture the Yang, and vice versa. Having captured the opposing force, the winner has achieved fulfillment, and the game ends.&quot;<br/><br/>Kung Fu, made in Singapore in the 1970's, is a chess-like game. Instead of a king or general, each player has a Yin/Yang monad and takes on the role of Yin or Yang, controlling a team of Kung Fu fighters (who are dressed in Karategi). The pieces are supposed to represent movements made during the performance of martial arts and have names like Front Kick (Eagle's Onslaught), Hook Kick (Whip of the Dragon's Tail) and Forward Punch (Fist of Fury). Probably influenced by Chinese Chess, each monad is restricted to their own temple of six squares and may not face each other directly in the same file. Unlike Chinese Chess, there is a Guardian piece which stands in front of the monad and which is not restricted to just the temple. However, within the temple, it has the unusual power that when captured within it's own temple, both the Guardian and attacker are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Kung Fu is a curiosity from the heyday of Shaw Brothers films.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Children&acute;s trivia game themed on the movies of Astrid Lindgren. The deck of movie cards is shuffled and one card is turned face up. Players roll the die and move their pawn on the board. This is divided into several squares, each with a picture from a movie based on a book by Astrid Lindgren. If your pawn lands on a square containing the same picture as the one on the card, then you get that card. The next card is turned face up, and so on. Players may either just move according to the die, or they may try to land on one of the squares with a question mark. If they do, one of the other players picks up the top quiz card and reads the question with the same number as the number on the die. So, if you roll a five and land on a question mark, you will have to answer question number five. The questions are all about movies based on the books of Astrid Lindgren. One side of the die is marked with an arrow, and if you roll the arrow you just pick up the current card.<br/><br/>Each card equals one victory point, and three cards of the same movie will earn you bonus points. The player with the most points when all cards are taken is the winner.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Gameboard<br/>430 questions on 86 cards<br/>24 movie cards<br/>4 pawns<br/>1 die<br/><br/>Also released in a Norwegian edition with 350 questions on 75 cards, and 16 additional puzzle cards.<br/><br/>",

The box contains pads, pencils, a die, and a pack of over 250 cards each of which has 6 words of between 5 and 10 letters long on it.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to be the caller.  The caller takes a card and rolls the dice to see which word is going to be played (the words are numbered from 1 to 6).  The caller then announces the number of letters in the word and a letter from the middle of the word (i.e. not the first or last letter of the word).  The other players mark this information down on their score pad.<br/><br/>Going clockwise round the table players may ask for a letter to be added to either the immediate right or the immediate left of the starting letter (or chain of letters as the word develops).  The word therefore grows outwards from the original starting letter.<br/><br/>At any time from the giving of the first letter any player may try to guess the word by calling it out aloud.  If the guess is correct then the player scores 1 point for every letter as yet unexposed.  If incorrect the player loses 1 point from his score.<br/><br/>The first player to score 20 points or more is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction: &quot;Napenaltowaksche is the skirmish level portion of the Flintlocks and Tomahawks system.  The setting is mid 18th-century New England, New France and the Old Northwest.  Where a choice had to be made between playability and realism, the choice was made toward ease of play so that the result is closer to a caricature rather than a historical simulation.&quot;<br/><br/>The game name is spelled both Napenaltowaktsche and Napenaltowaksche by the designer throughout the booklet.  It's Lenni Lenape (Delaware Indian) for &quot;They will be scalping each other,&quot; and I don't think the Lenni Lenape much care how you spell it so long as you pronounce it correctly.<br/><br/>It's a skirmish level miniatures wargame, where one figure represents one person.  The game was sold either simply as the rules alone (with basic character cards and player aids to photocopy), or as a full kit with felt and wood terrain, eight painted miniatures (4 Indians, 4 colonists), chits, character cards, player aid cards, movement stick, etc.<br/><br/>The mechanics contain a fair bit of randomness.  A chit for each figure in the game is put into a cup along with three &quot;end of turn&quot; chits - draw a chit to see who moves next.  The player owning the active figure rolls a d6 and adds its current Competence (which starts at 6 and drops as you take wounds) to get a number of action points available for a turn.  Moving one cm takes 1 AP, while loading your flintlock takes 12 AP, tracked on your character card in groups of 4 AP.<br/><br/>If a figure is fired at and the shot comes reasonably close, they must make a reaction check to see what they do.  This can range from running away to holding your ground to firing wildly to charging into melee - the more wounded you become, the more likely you are to run away.<br/><br/>Rules are given for aiming and firing, melee, line of sight through the dense woodland, other terrain, etc.  This is overall a lighter set of rules rather than a true simulation.<br/><br/>",

Each piece has a magnet on it, which will repel off the board (most of the time to the tray in the base) any piece in the exact same space on the other player's side.  A spinner in the base gives you 1 to 4 movement points.  The first player to repel the other player's star piece (which cannot move) by moving onto its space, which is known, wins the game.  There are tanks which can only move on land, ships which can only move on water, and jets which can move on either.<br/><br/><br/>Another similar but officially unrelated game was released in the 1980s: Zomax.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I spot this game as a published one in about 1980 under the name &quot;Naftowa Gor&amp;#261;czka&quot; (Polish: &quot;Oil Rush&quot;), but then I used to play it using only pencil, paper and 2 six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Players act as oil companies. The board is 8x8 for 2 players, 9x9 for three ones and 10x10 for four players. Each player has 6 money units at the beginning.<br/><br/>TURN ORDER:<br/><br/>1) The active player points at a spot on a map and puts the bid he wishes to pay for it (often it's just 0). The players in clockwise order may overbid each other. When the high bid stands - the winner loses the declared amount of money and becomes the active player since then. (It is possible to take a few turns in a row if one has enough money!)<br/><br/>2) Dice are rolled to determine if oil is present. A sum of 9 or more is required. But if there is some oil on any of the fields with a common border line with the one the check is performed for, the number is reduced by 1 for each such field. If the oil is present on the fields with common corner with the chosen one, 1 is subtracted from the required number for each 2 such fields. Thus to find oil on a field completely surrounded by other oil fields (very rare situation!) a player needs only to throw 3 or more.<br/><br/>3) If the oil is not present, the field is marked as an empty one. If it is peresent it is marked as an oil field belonging to the active player, and the active player receives 1 money unit for each point he rolled over the required minimum. Thus if there was 1 fileld nearby, and a sum of 8 was required but 10 was rolled, the active player receives 2 money units. Note that it is possible to find oil and get no instant reward!<br/><br/>4) The clokwise neighbor of the active player becomes one. Go to 1. :-) Game ends when all the fields are checked.<br/><br/>5) Each player receives 10 points for each oil field he owns and one point for each money unit he has got at the end of the game. The player with most points wins. (It is possible to end in a draw).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published in 2005 by BSO Games (DTP), the description is from the GMT website, when it was on their p500 list.<br/><br/>It's Turning Point, a game covering the pivotal battle of Freeman's Farm, at Saratoga. It features all the units, from Morgan's Rifles to the British grenadiers, and all the dense, wooded terrain you would normally expect, but in a way you've probably not seen before.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks of cards, one deck for each player to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of his cards each turn, never his full deck, and his allotment is usually different (in terms of number and type) from his opponent. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and special items, such as Indian Stealth, Counter-Attack, Rifle Fire, and Rapid Movement, among others. Players may play as many cards as they wish when it's their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards &hellip; and the Turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the map of Freeman's Farm, which uses squares, rather than hexes,. You're still moving units, trying to outflank, attacking with what you hope are better odds (since you don't know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be), and using your cards, and wits, to outplay your opponent.<br/><br/>Turning Point was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",

It is useful to play the game in sessions, by breaking the pack into two or three roughly equal parts. Keep the bottom card last.<br/>The first player reads the clues on the first card to the other players, starting with the points at the top. The other players may try to answer at any time, without awaiting turns, but each player is allowed only one answer per clue. Where two or more players give the same answer together only the first is counted. Players may pass instead of answering that clue. <br/>a correct answer wins the points indicated for that clue. Players pick up counters for their points. An incorrect answer loses five points. <br/>Players take turns round to read the clues. Highest score after the last card is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Tee Off in the Comfort of Your Living Room&quot;<br/><br/>The Golf Course (gameboard) is printed in the magazine along with a sample scorecard. There are only 4 'holes' on the golf course; however, you can play 9 holes by using different combinations of tee-off locations and holes. The sample scorecard has the 'par' for each hole. Other equipment needed: a golf ball (marker) of a distinct color for each player, 2 D6 and paper and pencil to keep score (you can make or copy a scorecard for each player instead of using a plain piece of paper for scoring).<br/><br/>When a new hole is started, each player tees-off in turn. Until everyone finishes the hole, order of play is determined by whoever is farthest from the current hole. Whoever is farthest takes the next swing. On your turn, while you are on the fairway or rough, roll both dice. You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.<br/><br/>Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty. Play the stroke as usual, but then roll one die again. If it is a 1, there's no penalty. A 2, 3 or 4 adds one penalty stroke. A 5 or 6 adds two strokes.<br/><br/>Landing in a water trap incurs a two-stroke penalty, and you take your next swing from the last space you passed before landing in the water.<br/><br/>When you make it onto the proper green, you must decide whether you will (1) continue to use the movement method using 2 dice or (2) use a 'putter' (move the ball one square in any direction for each putt). You must continue to use this method for the rest of the hole.<br/><br/>There are a few more obstacles: (1) You may not hit onto or directly over an opponent's ball (2) You may not hit onto or directly over trees (3) You may not hit your ball onto a green other than the one around the hole you are playing.<br/><br/>Keep track of the number of strokes it takes you to complete a hole and write it onto your scorecard. Lowest total wins.<br/><br/>",

Features airborne units and air bombardment, artillery and engineers rules.  Allies get 3 victory points (VP's) per turn for control of the Arnhem Bridge and 2 VP's per turn for the pontoon bridge near Arnhem (if it&rsquo;s not blown).  XXX Corps units that leave the north end of the map in supply get 2 VP's per factor.  The Germans get 4 VP's for each turn they hold Arnhem Bridge plus 2 VP's per factor for destroying Allied airborne units while only 1 VP for other Allied units, per factor destroyed.  Isolated units (including airborne) can still attack for two turns after that they can only defend.  Side with most VP's wins.  Allies have secret drop zones at the start of the game that they must commit to irregardless of German units present in the hex with only the Polish brigade being able to alter their landing zone.  A rare game to find as it was published in Panzerfaust as a mini-game.<br/><br/>",

Just what you always wanted from Tri Tac Games.<br/><br/>The back woods in central Pennsylvania and a quack in the night start the nightmare of the opening days of what mankind would later call &quot;the Duck Wars&quot;. They've come from the swamps to prey on Campers and Cub Scouts. This is a crazy board game that is kind of like an RPG. Fun for the whole family as you attempt to stop the duckbilled horror.<br/><br/>Join the Scouts as they revenge the death of their Scout Master at the Beak of the Giant Mutated Duck.  Contains 6&quot; X 9&quot; Hex grid, 40 paper counters, lots of fun (beer, pretzels and other embellishments not included).<br/><br/>No. 1 in the Duck Trilogy<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction in the rules:<br/><br/>On May 10, 1869, the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific met at Promontory Summit to establish the first transcontinental railroad for the United States.  The route taken by the Union Pacific just grazed the tip of Colorado at Julesberg and headed west through Wyoming.  Colorado, however, wanted railroads and soon got them.<br/><br/>In the Colorado Railroads Game, players assume the roles of the big financiers who put together the rails that roamed the Rockies.  Somewhat in the tradition of Heartland Trefoil's 1829, and Avalon Hill's 1830, players buy shares of stock in various railroads, take control of them, and build track from city to city, and city to mine.  The railroads earn money by operating trains between stations.  Player money is earned through dividends to stockholders.  Unlike the above mentioned games, the rails are drawn right on the map, and owned by the railroads who built them (As in Mayfair's Empire Builder system.)  The economic conditions change varying from boom times to depression, and mines appear and disappear at random throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 5 vehicles - 3 normal cars (2x1 spaces), a bus (3x1 spaces) and a Smart car (1x1). On your turn you have 3 choices: 1) Place a vehicle face down, 2) Turn one of your vehicles face up and choose its direction of travel without altering its position (so the larger vehicles can choose two directions, the Smart can choose four), 3) Move one of your vehicles one space in its direction of travel. <br/>The aim is to be the last player to be able to move. Even if one cannot move at some stage of the game if your way is subsequently cleared you can still move then.<br/><br/>",

The game uses a deck of cards, comprising: 75 bird cards (3 of each species), 6 Hazards, 6 Protection cards and 1 Appeal card.<br/><br/>6 cards are dealt to each player at the start of the game. The players then pick a card from the deck (or discard pile) and then play. Sets of species are built (Male, then Female, then Young) and a completed set forms a trick and is put to one side. Sets are built up in the spaces along the edge of the board facing the player; the species has to go in the appropriate habitat (as indicated on the card).<br/><br/>Partial sets can be protected by Protection cards and destroyed by Hazard cards. The Appeal card allows you to take one card from another player, in return for the Appeal card, which can then be used again by its new owner. Some of the species are &quot;Rare Species&quot;. Completing these sets gains the player the appropriate counter.<br/><br/>To end the game you have to get a certain number of sets of species, with the rare ones counting for 2 or 3, depending on the value on the counter. Points are then totaled, with each species set being worth 50 points, with the appropriate multiplier (x2 or x3) for the &quot;Rare&quot; species, and cards in front of each player (but not yet in completed sets) being worth 10 points each.<br/><br/>",

However, the suits are red hearts, yellow sunbursts, blue five-pointed stars, and white daisy flowers.  There are also four Donald Duck cards of a &quot;wild&quot; shamrock suit.  The #1 cards are Mickey Mouse, the #2 cards are Minnie Mouse, the #3 cards are Pluto, the #4 cards are Thumper, the #5 cards are Goofy, the #6 cards are Dumbo, the #7 cards are Clarabelle, the #8 cards are Flower, the #9 cards are Daisy Duck, and the #10 cards are Chip 'n' Dale.  The last card is an instruction card.<br/><br/>Game 1:  The four #1 cards are placed face-up on the table.  The remaining cards are shuffled and dealt to each player.  The player to the left of the dealer begins by playing a #2 card on a #1 card of the same color; this player can discard a second card by playing a #3 card of the same suit or any other #2 card.  A player can only discard up to two cards per turn. A Donald Duck card is to be played as an #11 card to complete a pile.  The first player to discard all his or her cards gains 10 points.  A player must gain 50 points to win the game.<br/><br/>Game 2:  The second game is similar to a version of Crazy Eights or Uno.  Each player is dealt five cards.  The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack with one card turn upright.  Players discard cards by matching either the suit or number or by playing a wild Donald Duck card.  When a wild Donald Duck card is discarded, it is played sideways so that the next player will have to match the card underneath by suit or number or with another wild Donald Duck card.  The winner is the first player to discard all of his cards.<br/><br/>",

I played many wargames and although some were close to what my vision is of a perfect game there was always something to bother about.<br/><br/>'I played many many wargames, and many of them disappointing me. In my opinion a game should have a fine mix of these elements:<br/><br/>* fast pacing, simple and only relevant statics<br/>    * depth, a good mix of planning, bluffing, fast thinking and random elements<br/>    * flexible, can you implement scenarios, new elements, characters and objects?<br/>    * rich, a fantasy world provides a rich world, there are almost no limits<br/>    * epic, can you remember the games you played a year ago?<br/>    * cheap, well you can actually download Warbands for free from this site. In return I ask you to enter the forums and join the discussions.<br/><br/>'These key-elements I kept in mind developing Warbands, I show no hesitation using elements from existing games to develop Warbands. Its really fun, fast-paced and has a lot of tactical depth.'<br/><br/>In the game Warbands you are represented by a hero-mage figure controlling a party of a few or maybe a dozen characters on a battlefield. This complete party is called a warband. Each character in the wardband has an unique name. With you controlling this warband you can play the provided scenarios or the ones you created yourself but the game is also designed to battle versus an enemy warband. In an arena or in the open, battle it out till the enemy character is destroyed.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.warbands.info/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.warbands.info/</a><br/><br/>",

Species hatred flares as humans have employed these new lifeforms where humans deem fit. Life has been hard for the Hybrids and the Risen, often worked to their deaths in colonial construction.<br/><br/>As well, many humans are fearful that they may be placed the loser in species conflict. Older folk are afraid of the frog, rat, and feline folk that now live next door.<br/><br/>All the while the Corporate Lords take their due as new leaders of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Welcome to Pacifica, your role is as a thief and a soldier. Leaders of Buka Units such as yourself will do battle, live as a rogue, and all the while laugh at those who do not know honor and freedom. Southeast off the shore of Japan, is where you are needed as the the 1,000,000 souls of the Pacifica Ocean Settlements are at odds with seeming rebels. These insurgents may be backed by powerful forces, so beware.<br/><br/>Pacifica makes its pay from oil drilling, tourism, research programs, and especially, the Titan Naga Platform that taps and collects geothermal energy from the earths core.<br/><br/>Of course, the internet now exists as both the wire of mother earth, and as playground. Webcrawlers with HUD net access fly as Deva across the shadowy illusion that is the Cybernet. Pays to keep a few of those people around.<br/><br/>Some, like yourself, will make their pay by covert operations. Welcome Buka rogue,<br/><br/>Enjoy your stay.<br/><br/>The game is a build-it-yourself PDF download.  It includes a modular board, units (infantry, vehicles, and weapons) a rulebook, and 44 cards used to represent background &quot;cyber-combat,&quot; or the opponents' wrestling for control of the computer system of the building they are in.  Physical combat is decided by a more conventional roll-to-hit system.  Rules are included to simulate combat in flooded and fully submerged locations.<br/><br/>This game is out of print.<br/><br/>",

The game deals with the both the  strategic and tactical aspects of the Peloponnesian War.<br/><br/>There are two large monochrome (light and dark blue/black)map parts that depict Ancient Greece in 480. There is also a small 8 page rulebook, a battle results table and a counter sheet with adhesive printed counters that must be cut and peeled. There are a 138 counters, both men and ships. Basically, the game is a very early homemade DTP effort (long before the term was invented)from Orland Park, Illinois.<br/><br/>Fairly rare in wargaming circles, yet a simple and quick simulation of one of history's great wars.<br/><br/>",

Players are limited in their placement by a roll of four dice, which are used to generate coordinates. Four example, a roll of 1,2,3,5 could be used as: 1+2=3 and 3+5=8, to generate x=3 and y=8 or x=8 and y=3. Or 2+3=5 and 1+5=6 for x-y of 5,6 or 6,5 and so on. If a player tries to occupy a previously occupied space, there is a challenge which is resolved with a 2-die roll-off with the higher roll winning.<br/><br/>The game includes a grid board and 52 markers per side, all on light cardstock that needs to be cut out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a children's game based on the classic three-shell game.  One player takes the role of Scoop, an ice cream vendor promoting &quot;his surprise ice creams.&quot;  Four wooden ice cream cups are used to hide stacks of three wooden counters each.  Each wooden counter represents a scoop of ice cream in a particular flavor--vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or mint--with all of the scoops of a particular flavor being hidden under a single ice cream cup.  The cups are then switched around--from 4 to 8 switches per round depending on what the players agree on beforehand--and the first player to Scoop's left tries to guess which cup a particular flavor (it's a little unclear from the rules, but apparently Scoop selects the flavor to be guessed) is under.  If they're correct, they get one of the &quot;scoops&quot; of that flavor, and they become Scoop (i.e. they get to switch the cups around) for the next round.  If they're incorrect, they lose one of their &quot;scoops&quot; from a previous round (if available) and the player to their left gets to guess.  Players have the option of passing if they don't want to risk losing a &quot;scoop.&quot;  At the end of the round (after either a player has guessed correctly or all players have passed or guessed incorrectly).  All of the cups are lifted and any lost &quot;scoops&quot; are returned to their respective stacks.  The game continues until all of the &quot;scoops&quot; have been won.  Cups with no &quot;scoops&quot; under them remain in the game.  The player with the most &quot;scoops&quot; (wooden tokens) is the winner.  The game comes with attractive wooden components, and ice cream vendor's hat to designate Scoop, and a sturdy box that's really quite a bit larger than necessary to hold everything.<br/><br/>",

I am not sure if this game has been renamed?<br/><br/>Sure Shot Baseball is a two person game played much the same way as outdoor baseball.  The game consists of nine innings of 3 outs each.  The &quot;pitcher&quot; rolls a plastic marble down a slide and it heads toward a batter controlled by their opponent.  The &quot;batter&quot; tries to hit the ball out of the stadium by turning a batting knob.  If it goes out of the unique up-curved field the &quot;fielder&quot; then tries to catch it.  Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The &quot;runners&quot; stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.<br/><br/>Each &quot;batter&quot; gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.<br/><br/>There are a few other simple rules.  The game is quite tricky to learn and play competitively.  But it is definitely a fun experience if you enjoy baseball!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3D5 by the Lolo Company is essentially a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game played in a 5x5x5 cube, allowing 109 possible winning combinations.<br/><br/>The one twist relative to a simple 5 in a row Tic-Tac-Toe game is that the center space of the cube is a &quot;free&quot; space, that can  contribute to five in a row for either player. Optionally, players may specify up to nine additional free spaces beyond the center space as part of the set-up (game can with 10 neutral marbles).<br/><br/>An interesting feature of this game is that it comes with a set of tweezers to manipulate the balls in the grid. The grid levels are only about 2 inches apart.<br/><br/>Another odd feature is the posts that separate the layers. There are spacers between the layers with an elastic running through the center of the posts. Thus you can rotate the layers of the game and get it fold. There is a special peg provided to screw into the bottom tray holding the marbles to keep the game folded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; or &quot;Pearl-Pyramid&quot;<br/><br/>Quick playing abstract pyramid stacking game for exactly 3 players. Each player uses a pool of 25 &quot;pearls&quot; in their color and placement starts on a 5x5 base grid, with pearls in subsequent layers being supported by four underneath.  A completed pyramid will thus contain exactly 55 pearl bricks.<br/><br/>Each player in turn will add exactly one piece to the construction, and the aim is to have the most external pearls visible in the completed pyramid. Players will be placing their pearls only onto the base of the pyramid, making sure all placed pearls touch what's already there (orthogonal or diagonally). Placement of pearls on the additional layers is triggered automatically by what is present underneath. The moment that a square group of four pearls is created in the same layer, a special &quot;filling&quot; placement interrupts the regular turn progression. To resolve which pearl gets placed on top of the four pearls underneath players need to look at how many different pearls are present. If one color is in the majority (3:1 or 2:1:1) then another pearl of that color gets placed on top. However, if two players each have two pearls  present than a pearl of the third player becomes the peak. If all four pearls are from a single player then the player who would have the turn after this colour's player gets to place the bonus pearl. When the bonus pearl itself triggers the completion of another group of four in the next layer then again bonus pearls are resolved before the normal turn-order is resumed. When the 25th base pearl is placed the completion of the pyramid is triggered and the game ends. The winner is the one with the most external pearls present.<br/><br/>Three variations are also included.<br/><br/>Publishing history: Peter Pallat was one of the original designer &quot;Altmeisters&quot; of the German game industry.  It was his designs that found their way into many family homes from way back in the 1930s, through Ravensburger, then known as Otto Maier Verlag, and others. He remained an active designer throughout his life, but his career went through a renaissance when, in his older days, he found a welcome and supportive group of younger designers and admirers, who, in their turn, had become torch-bearers of German game design. One of these, Reinhold Wittig, published a handful of Peter Pallat's games and ideas in small editions through his own Edition Perlhuhn designers imprint, giving him the recognition for his longstanding input into our hobby he fully deserved. These games later found their way to publishers like Abacus and the Danish Abra who released wooden versions of some of these. As did this game. &quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; appeared with Edition Perlhuhn in 1978 and was republished by the Danish Abra as part of their abstract wooden game series of the latter part of the 1980s. It is hard to get hold of these days.<br/><br/>",

Every player has a small plastic &quot;trawler&quot;, which looks suspiciously like a ferry boat. The predetermined courses often divide and circle back - the player throws two dice and decides if uses both or only one of them to reach the richest fishing ground (herrings just get him 100M (Mark), most profitable (400M) are redfish).<br/><br/>Manufactured in the socialist/communist German Democratic Republic, the game's objective (make the most money with your ship's payload) seems a little odd, if not &quot;capitalist propaganda&quot;.<br/><br/>After the players think they have caught enough fish (there is a limit), they have to return to their home harbors (which can lie in the GDR but also in West-Germany, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, ... - imagine that, until 1989 almost no citizen of the GDR was allowed to travel these countries!). The first players reaching their harbors (there are seven color coded harbors, in contrast to the maximum of six playing pieces) get bonuses. The richest player wins.<br/><br/>The game had no money bills or tokens - instead every player had to write down his progress on separate sheets of paper (not included).<br/><br/>",

The problem of deadlocks in connection games on squares grid is resolved by letting each player diagonally connect across the squares which are that player's color.<br/><br/>In the original version of the game the grid was 17x17 (i.e. 16x16 squares) and the game consisted of five sub-games - one for each quadrant of the board and one for the entire board. The object of each sub-game was for White to connect left and right edges and Black to connect top and bottom, and the winner of the game was the player who won the majority of the sub-games. Each player player played one piece a turn.<br/><br/>Later versions of the game were played on a 15x15 board, dropped the sub-game idea, and had players play two pieces per turn in a prescribed relationship to each other.<br/><br/>",

These are reduced as the unit is damaged, so they gradually loose effectiveness before being destroyed. This means there is some bookkeeping involved, but it means the rules a great for quick skirmish games.<br/><br/>The statistics themselves are generalized: each is the combination of many factors the unit may have. For example, all the guns, ammo, rate of fire, targeting efficiency and range are represented by a single number. As the number is reduced through damage, it can represent individual guns being disabled, hampered aiming, ammo destroyed etc.<br/><br/>This may not be that realistic but it speeds gameplay and reduces bookkeeping. This is after all a game of fun - at different ranges<br/><br/>",

Components include a plastic bag with one see-through side, four collecting cards and 40 wooden pieces in five shapes, each in two sizes, with four pieces of each size in red, yellow, blue and green.<br/><br/>With up to four players, each player takes a card. Players take turns holding the bag with the clear side facing away (so the other players can see the pieces inside). The current player selects a piece by touch that matches a piece of the right size and shape on his card. If it is the right color, he places it on his card. The first to fill his card wins.<br/><br/>A variant for any number of players is to place up to three cards in the center of the table. Players try to select by touch a piece that matches any piece on any card. A player who draws one of the right color places it on a card. Otherwise, he keeps the piece. When the bag is empty, the player with the fewest pieces in front of him wins.<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to use words, noises, gestures and expressions to mislead the active player into thinking he is touching the correct (or incorrect) color.<br/><br/>",

Enhances creativity and lateral thinking and ideal for anyone wishing to improve their public speaking skills. 3 to 8 players. Ages 8 to adult.<br/><br/>At the heart of the game are the 500 &lsquo;Opinion&rsquo; cards. When a player lands on an Opinion Square he or she becomes &lsquo;the Candidate&rsquo;, draws an Opinion Card and reads it to the other players. The Candidate then selects an opponent from amongst the other players who is now called &lsquo;the Opposition&rsquo;. The Candidate argues in favor of the Opinion for up to a minute. Players cannot choose sides - they must argue the Opinion as it stands - whether they agree with the statement or not.<br/><br/>The opposing player then argues against the opinion. The remaining players vote for the best argument - not for the argument they agree with - but for the best defended position.<br/><br/>Because the voters are not casting a secret ballot, but have to justify why they think an argument was good or bad, this part of the game can get pretty raucous as players try to convince each other that someone&rsquo;s argument was absolute balderdash.<br/><br/>Opinions, however, is not just about arguing an opinion. There is a whole story to the game which unfolds as players race for the Presidency. Good and bad press, in the form of the 500 Press Cards, alternatively encourages or plagues players as they seek support for their campaigns. Get arrested in a riot, take a vacation in the Caribbean, rescue a kitten and meet the Queen as your career unfolds (or unwinds!). get caught in compromising situations or rewarded for your service to the community as you work your way to the top.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players are shepherds in medieval Spain seeking to expand and make wise investments in their flocks.  Throughout the game they choose from among the roles of Lambing, Market Day, Place Investments, Cry Wolf, Bear, Barter and Stray Sheep.<br/><br/>In lambing, the players can choose to cooperate and help the other shepherds or go it alone, in hopes of receiving a larger return.  As the players all cooperate, the predator threat from the wolves and bear is minimized.  If any player chooses not to cooperate, then the predator threat grows, usually threatening the non-cooperative players the most.<br/><br/>If the Cry Wolf role is chosen, then the players must (in an order determined by earlier play) roll a twelve-sided die to determine whether their flock has been attacked. Once a flock is attacked, the remaining players&rsquo; flocks are safe for the rest of the round.  There are many different ways a player can minimize the predator threat to herself.<br/><br/>In order to make investments, a player must sell his sheep (which are also points at the end of the game) and then place the gold received as investments in a Ram, Best Pasture, Market Stand, Guard Dog, Gaita, or Divine Intervention.  The largest investment in each of these areas provides advantages throughout the game as well as additional points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Cry Wolf! uniquely employs a modified &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo; in lambing which is integrated with a typically increasing and dynamic predator threat.  The majority area control of investments combined with the timing of placement being determined through variable phase order also provides challenging strategic choices.<br/><br/>",

There is a map of the world on which players move ships from port to port (along a track), and a standard track running around the outside of the board on which players move ambassador pieces.  On a turn a player rolls the die twice and must use one roll for each piece.  Control of commodities is purchased on outer track spaces, but your ship has to be at an appropriate port to do so, establishing a relation between the pieces.  Other spaces on the outer track reward or punish players controlling various commodities, and there are also spaces which allow one to become a Merchant Prince controlling one of the six regions of the world (and charge additional &quot;rent&quot; to players).<br/><br/>Another interesting bit is that the game is nominally set in the 25th century, which is used to justify dividing the world into six regions rather than the nations of 1937.<br/><br/>",

The fence cards have different patterns on them, which limit how fences can be played.<br/>  Each player also has one 'Stampede!!!' tile that can be used to cause every critter on the board to move at once and possibly escape.  Beware!  There are Stampede!!! tiles mixed in with the critters, as well...<br/>  Once every critter is either caught or escapes, the game ends and the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Draman Del is an ancient fortress city in a mountain pass, the only pass between the west and east lands.<br/><br/>The west is represented by a confederation of kingdoms (Nath, Drakand, Draman, Randrom, Svariji, Land people) formerly known as &quot;Draman&quot;. Draman Del is the only fortification against the east people, the barbarians called Zenith; if it should fall, the barbarians may swarm over the west kingdoms.<br/><br/>The Seven Black Generals all host a shard of the soul of the evil god Zadrak and have been asleep for thousands of years but now, unknown to all, they are awakening. One of them, Xishayah, under the name of Kan Zenith, has gathered the nomadic Zenith tribes and is leading them to attack the west. To do this the legendary fortress of Draman Del must fall before General Adran arrives with reinforcements.<br/><br/>The beautiful map shows a top-down view of the Draman Del fortress. The entire city was built using a 3D modeling program and rendered it with textures and shades. On one side are placed some useful charts.The map is 22x17 inches.<br/><br/>Inside The Siege Of Draman Del you will find:<br/><br/>-A set of rules,<br/><br/>-Four mapsheet (game board)<br/><br/>-One countersheet with a total of 287 counters<br/><br/>-Tables and charts<br/><br/>-PDF Version only<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;RACECRAZE:  A Strategic, Fun-Filled Racing Game!&quot;<br/><br/>A Nascar-like themed racing game from a small publisher. The mechanics of this game are simple: &quot;Qualifying&quot; position is based on random card draw. Each turn, roll three (standard) dice, and optionally roll two more &quot;special dice&quot; (33% +3, 33% -3, 33% take a card). Move your car on the track (16 spaces to 20 spaces around from inside to outside track; no track &quot;choke points&quot;) by the total amount. Cards either move car forward, backward, or force player &quot;into the pit&quot; before proceeding. Player turn order is re-ranked each turn by position+laps, and each race (of 5) ends after a predetermined number of laps.<br/><br/>Each player is awarded a number of points at the conclusion of each race based on finishing position. Winner has the most points after the fifth race.<br/><br/>",

Prey stones are placed on the ribs. Players spin an unusual spintop, resulting in 1-3 red and 1-3 blue arrows pointing up. Depending on the number of red arrows, players move their playing pieces from rib to rib and collect prey stones, but only if the hunting stone is showing the whale. The hunting stone can be flipped instead of moving. When all prey has been collected, the player with most prey wins. However, if three blue arrows show six times during the game, the whale wins and the player loses. Depending on which arrow they spin the spintop with, players can influence the outcome of their spin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game belongs to a series of 4 games by Scandecor, which come in a square plastic board (Play Cavalry, Play Balance, Play Ecology and Play Numeric). )<br/><br/>The game is played on a 12x12 board. The game can be played with 2 or 4 players. Half of the players take the industrial pieces, the others the nature pieces. When 2 players play, each has the following 47 pieces: <br/>- 18 roads/rivers, 12 straight and 6 curved<br/>- 24 houses/trees<br/>-  4 factories/volcanoes<br/>-  1 pollutions/earthquakes (disasters)<br/><br/>If playing with 4, each player gets half the pieces and the 2 additional pollution/earthquake tiles are used also.<br/><br/>The game begins with an empty board except the 2 or 4 disaster tiles, which are placed in the corners of the board. The players then start to place roads and rivers on the board and as soon as the first road/river is placed, they can also start to lay down the other pieces. Houses and factories can be placed 1-2 spaces besides the road, trees and volcanoes 1-2 spaces besides the river.<br/><br/>Factories/volcanoes protect the surrounding spaces from being overbuilt by the opponents. These restrictions make it more and more difficult to place the tiles on the board. Winner is the player/party who can lay down all their pieces.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to be the first, who can play all of their pieces.<br/><br/>",

Each group has 1 leader, 2 special pieces and 3-5 normal pieces.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to capture 2 of the opposing leaders first.<br/><br/>Movements can be done space by space or by jumping as far as wanted, but the 3 groups should always stay together. Isolated groups member will be flipped over and are blocked until the end of the game. This can be a hard problem, because the normal pieces can only capture opposing people by isolating themselves, while the 9 &quot;better&quot; pieces don't have that restriction.<br/><br/>",

There were numbered/colored Glunk cards that were placed around the board in designated outlined locations.<br/><br/>I only remember it being one of those frenetic games, as players raced to grab certain types of cards using the included one foot+ long wands with a suction cup at the end. Many times the suction wasn't strong enough and frustrated players with smash the wand down on the card numerous times until it would adhere. It was a noisy, chaotic affair, and the gimmick wore off quite fast. Made good for some temporary hysterics though..<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>&quot;Played this is a child, so the game's objective is not remembered.&quot;<br/><br/>Response: This was kind of a Demolition Derby type of Go Fish. There were two sets of cards. Player Cards and Glunk Cards. The Glunk cards were shuffled and placed face down in the middle of a 4' by 4' heavy vinyl sheet. The Player cards were scattered face down around the Glunk cards. Each player would take turns counting 3-2-1 and tuning up a Glunk card and calling the colour of the Glunk pictured. The card would be placed face up on top of the deck.The person turning the card would have to quickly get out of the way as blows would begin raining down as players would try to stick their suction cup tipped Glunk stick to the back of each card in rapid succession, looking for a colour match. No hands allowed, except to replace the non-matching cards face down on the sheet. When a match was found the player would call it, keep the card and claim the Glunk card to form a pair. The winner was the player with the most pairs at the end of play.<br/><br/>(Note:*My brother's solution to cards not sticking well, was to LICK the suction cup in between cards. I ended up with many bruises resulting from being bashed while playing. The force of the blows was quite something, seeing as the sticks were made of thick, rigid plastic. Within two years all were broken and the vinyl sheet - white when turned over, became my thrifty mother's picnic table cloth.)<br/><br/>",

Three sets of rules are included so that children of different ages can play.<br/><br/>The basic game for ages three and up is a simple, non-competitive matching game.  In this game, players turn over clue cards with colors or shapes and then attempt to find a playing piece that matches the color or shape (purple starfish, green seashells, and yellow sand dollars) and add it to their playing board.  The second game, for ages four and up is similar, but it introduces wild cards and has a competitive element.  The third game, for ages five and up, challenges players to create an original, repeating pattern using the shapes.<br/><br/>No reading required. Chunky playing pieces, easy for little hands to hold.<br/><br/>(This is not the same game as the 1994 Parker Brothers 'The Little Mermaid Under the Sea Card Game'.)<br/><br/>",

To defeat  the enemy, you must either sink his flagship or immobilize his fleet.<br/><br/>Flagships has one basic rule: ships may be sunk only by a superior force, either a single more powerful ship <br/>attacking by right or a joint force of ships, one of equal power to the target ship attacking with the support of any other member of its fleet. No ship may ever sink a more powerful ship, even during group action.<br/><br/>Each player commands a fleet of nine warships: one flagship, two frigates, two sloops and four corvettes.<br/>Only a flagship may sink the enemy flagship, and only if it has the required support.  <br/>Frigates, dominant in an open sea, can lose maneuverability as the fleets close for action.  <br/>Sloops, wayward and easily outflanked, can also be unreliable in support.  <br/>Corvettes, vulnerable at the outset, can determine the outcome of the closest battle.<br/><br/>Playing on a hexagonal shaped hex board of 37 hexagons, the two fleets are disposed as if sailing from opposite directions;<br/>Each player in turn moves one piece in any permitted direction, moving from one hexagon to the next across their common dividing line. Lateral movements (north/south) are called movements abeam. Diagonal movements are called movements forward or astern<br/><br/>The various ships move as follows:<br/>Flagship   One space forward or astern or any number of spaces abeam<br/>Frigate     Any number of spaces forward, astern or abeam<br/>Sloop       Any number of spaces forward or astern, never abeam<br/>Corvette   Any number of spaces in an arc around any adjacent space<br/><br/>Sinking:<br/>i) A ship is sunk by any enemy ship of superior power moving onto its space, and is removed from the board.<br/><br/>(ii) A ship may be sunk by any enemy ship of equal power moving onto its space, provided the <br/>attacking ship is supported by another member of its fleet, the support ship being in a position <br/>adjacent to the target vessel and on course to occupy its space.<br/><br/>(iii) No ship may sink a vessel of superior power, even during group action.<br/><br/>Support:<br/>Support is only provided by vessels lying adjacent to the target vessel. Sloops may not support an attack while lying abeam of the target because they may neither move nor attack in that direction. Flagships may not support whilst disabled.<br/><br/>Disabling:<br/>A flagship is disabled by any two enemy ships being in spaces adjacent to its own (even by sloops in positions abeam). Whilst disabled, a flagship may neither move, attack nor support an attack by any other vessel, but may form part of a cordon disabling the opposing flagship.<br/><br/>Winning:<br/>Sink the enemy flagship or leave your opponent with no legal move.<br/><br/>",

Army lists are provided for Philippian/Alexandran Macedonian; Late Achaemenid Persian; Roman Marian/Caesarian; Celtic/Gallic Barbarian; Norman Conquest; and Late Saxon armies.<br/><br/>Turn sequence is determined through an initiative system.  Armor and Shield protection is key to defining defensive capabilities.  Multiple categories of mounted, infantry and missile troops are distinguished.  Leadership is represented through several tiers of Leaders.<br/><br/>The system is primarily geared for 25/28mm figures.  Conversion instructions are included for 15mm and 40mm armies.  Armies usually compose from 100 to 300 figures per side; the standard system figure ratio is 1?40.<br/><br/>Army statistics, including General characteristics, War Machine attributes and Army List Templates are recorded on copies of forms provided with the rules.  Referral to these lists suffice for determining combat and morale outcomes in a game. Games featuring armies of this size can be completed in three to four hours once the system is understood.<br/><br/>Publisher website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.battlestandard.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.battlestandard.com</a><br/><br/>",

It is played on a special 64 square mat, with 20 pieces. Dice are used as the playing pieces, but after the roll to determine who starts, luck is not a feature of the game.<br/><br/>In Freez!, pieces are attacked and frozen; the frozen pieces remain on the board for the rest of the game. The object is to freeze your opponent's pieces. Alternatively, you can win by trapping your opponent behind a wall of frozen pieces. The game is won when a player completes a wall separating all of their live pieces from all of the opponent's live pieces, or the opponent cannot make a legal move, or a player freezes the opponent's last live piece. Playing time is 20 minutes to 2 hours.<br/><br/>",

There are 189 cards that determine the value (ranging from 7 to 16) of the movement, 27 bonus cards, 17 risk cards, 6 metro cards and 25 replenishing cards. The winner is the player who's cyclist reaches the longest distance after the finish line after the final turn. Bonus cards are very important in this game, it allows cyclists to stay in the wheel of another cyclist and as a result exploit the slipstream.

Game looks like a take on monopoly with military strategy and combat.<br/><br/>The game is a sort of cross between Monopoly and a light wargame like Risk. The board has an outer track, very Monopoly like, but a map occupies the space inside. It is divided into 16 countries, forming color groups known as Cartels. As you go around, you buy up &quot;countries&quot; to charge other players &quot;port fees&quot;. The countries can have their industry developed by buying Factories (e.g. houses/hotels). The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market. A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.<br/><br/>",

There are 3 different classes of ships to choose from.  Players can see what their opponents ships are, and narrow down the potential mission of their opponent.  As the game progresses, players attempt to block their opponents from reaching their goals.  The goal may be to abduct different types of earthlings, or destroying cities (to name a few).  On each city, there is a marker that the player flips to determine how many cards to pull, or perhaps damage to the ship.  An additional angle is not all of the cards drawn are not necessarily good, so, it may not always be advantageous to be on a city that is giving a lot of cards.<br/><br/>",

Attraktion, a game by Jaroslav Cichocki, uses pull force (attraction) in movement to form a winning condition.  Alva, designed by Alvydas Jakeliunas, is like a souped-up version of checkers.  The last game included is a classic International Checkers.  Apparently the gameboard and components happened to be compatible.  Some of the games were previously published on websites.<br/><br/>",

Ships have enough detail to make them interesting and distinctive, but not so much that they each need record sheets to keep track of them. This should allow small games of a dozen ships per side to be played as enjoyably and effectively as giant games.<br/><br/>Battleshift refers to starships shifting in and out of hyperspace during the battle. Though it is a staple of sci-fi, few games really let players use hyperspace tactically. With good planning, squadrons and taskforces can leap from one part of the battle to another, escaping from certain destruction or closing a trap on an enemy taskforce.<br/><br/>Battleshift also features a suppression system, which causes squadrons to lose accuracy as they take fire.<br/><br/>Fleets are bought at the start of the game, based on a point cost system. Fleets are composed of Taskforces, which are in turn composed of Squadrons. Each squadron may have 1 - 7 ships that must stay within 6&rdquo; of each other.<br/><br/>",

With amber armor, sunflower bombs, pistols, rifles and other dangerous weapons, the Straightedges bring squad-based war to the fairies! Goblike mercenaries strengthen this army (when they're not busy eating it), and Imps and Greater Fae likewise enjoy the new state of fairy affairs. After all, in the old days, it was frowned upon to senselessly riddle another fairy with a hail of arrows!<br/><br/>Even better, this 32-page Fairy Meat supplement features new rules for establishing ongoing campaigns!  With skill points, your fairies can learn as they kill and  become tougher than ever!  This book also includes rules for Fame, new printable warband and squad sheets, and much more! Although War is fully compatible with Fairy Meat, it is a supplemental rulebook only.

The Game of Society is written on 55 cards (22 red (virtues), 13 black (vices) and 20 green (neutral) in 4 letters A B C D which stand for Angles, Britons, Celts and Danes the principle components of the Anglo-Saxon race. 2,4, or 6 can play. If played in teams the teams are either 2 or 3 person teams. Deal 7 cards to each player. The top card, called the Providence is then turned over. This determines trumps for that round. if the trump does not suit the person to the left of the dealer that person may say &quot;NOLO&quot; in which case two more cards are dealt to each player and a second Providence card is turned over which must remain trumps for the round, if the card does suit the player he calls &quot;VOLO&quot; and the hand begins. The cards have names on them that relate to their rank in the  suit. Names like Benevolence, Christian, Industry, Press, Villain, Education, Intemperance, Virtues, Man in Home, Woman in home, Debt etc. These cards have value which determines which card wins the trick. Some cards reduce the value of a trick and therefore wind up resulting in a negative valued trick. Virtue cards are positive and vice cards are negatively valued, neutrals are just that and are worth zero. Object is to be the first to get to 7 points.<br/><br/>",

The 'pond' is filled with water before play and a plastic/polystyrene circular raft 5&quot; wide is placed on the surface. The raft is divided into two different colored sections along its axis of symmetry. Each player starts with six (three pairs of) men of varying shape and weight (and value: 5 or 10 points) which must be placed on the raft without causing it to overbalance.<br/><br/>Players use a spinner to determine which particular weighted man must be placed on which side of the floating circular raft. When one player causes the raft to overbalance, their opponents receive points based on the number and type of their own men who were on the raft at that time.<br/><br/>The first player to reach fifty points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 'Counter Agents' you control 12 agents with which you must infiltrate your opponent's base. Basically, you must get one of your pieces on to your opponent's baseline. When moving, it is important to keep 'in contact' with a piece on your own baseline. Contact is maintained by being in a direct, unobstructed line with the piece or via lines of contact with your other pieces. If you 'lose contact' your agent can be bribed by your opponent if he can make a similar line of contact between the piece and a piece in his own base. A bribed piece cannot be moved by the enemy but can be used in his own lines of contact. If you regain contact with a bribed agent you can re-take control of him.<br/><br/>The game bears some similarities to Rob Abbott's 'Epaminondas' (in the layout and victory conditions) and to Sid Sackson's 'Network' (in the way lines of contact are maintained).<br/><br/>",

The text is clearer with more and better examples. It has also been organized by a group of players like yourself, so hopefully finding information in a hurry will be easier.<br/><br/>BoF II continues as a leading miniature skirmish game, for games of Squads up to reinforced Platoon level from WW2 to present day. It includes rules for all manner of infantry and vehicle operations. There are additional optional rules to further enhance the gaming experience.<br/><br/>The rules are aimed to create as authentic a battlefield experience as possible, players are encouraged to utilize real life battlefield strategies and tactics as these will give great success.<br/><br/>BoF II continues using a similar system as Baptism of Fire and Wild Fire to create a highly interactive, unpredictable, yet the player can try and exert a degree of control and planning to implement his strategies and tactics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To score points by memorizing details from and answering questions about a passage of text.<br/><br/>Players, either individually or in teams are invited into the world of some of the greatest storytellers ever. Short extracts from famous and classic novels take you into their world of thrills, chills, comedy and romance - but can you memorize what you have read?<br/><br/>If you can, and can answer your questions correctly, you'll score points. From simple &quot;either/or&quot; questions to real tests of memory and recall.  Memorise is an exciting and tense battle of wit and nerve.  Tactics and strategy may allow you to secure valuable bonus points.<br/><br/>This game is simple to learn and, unlike most question and answer games, requires no previous knowledge.  All the answers are in the passage that you have just read - but can you memorise them?.<br/><br/>This game also gives you a flavor of the contents of a number of famous and classic novels.<br/><br/>Note: Memorise appears to be a reprint of Echelon. The text and question cards are exactly the same, but a cheaper board and playing pieces have been substituted.<br/><br/>",

William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, leads a new Government army loyal to the House of Hannover north to face Prince Charles Edward Stuart's fierce Highlanders. Bonnie Prince Charlie's Scots have been victorious in every encounter with the forces of the 'German Usurper' George II since the Jacobite flag of rebellion was raised at Glen Coe on August 19, 1745. Now as the fog lifts off the sodden moorland at 11 AM, 4500 claymore-armed clansmen, most having not eaten nor slept in a day and a half, stand to as the red-coated ranks of 9000 troops of the government army march into battle formations. As the cannon of both sides unleash grapeshot, the Duke orders his troops forward, confident in their fire discipline. The Scots, outnumbered 2 to 1 in bodies but possessing the spirit of a lion in every Celtic breast, launch themselves into an attack borne by their battle ferocity that has been victorious in every contest of arms for the past year. The throne of Britain has just been laid on the scales of combat.<br/><br/>Culloden contains:<br/>one 11&quot; by 17&quot; map;<br/>140 die-cut backprinted 1/2&quot; counters;<br/>8 pages of rules and scenarios;<br/>Just Plain Wargames Folio Format<br/>Cover Artwork by Adrian George<br/><br/>",

However, it appears that this game pre-dates Loopin' Louie by almost 25 years!<br/><br/>The front of the box proclaims, &quot;Up and down and around the old plane goes.  Where she hits nobody knows.&quot;<br/><br/>The game was manufactured by Marx Games which appears to be a division of Marx Toys as the two companies used a similar font in their logos.<br/><br/>The game uses thick horizontal discs instead of thinner vertically placed discs used in Loopin' Louie.  The discs appear to be very similar to the game pieces for the more popular game Trivial Pursuit with the interior of these discs divided into four sections instead of six.<br/><br/>",

Waves are stacked upon each other, ships cannot jump over other ships. Movement is determined by the number of waves and playing pieces on the starting space, but a wave must be left back at every crossed space during a move. In this way, the waves shift constantly over the sea giving a really floating sea feeling.<br/><br/>Winner is the player who has earned a previously fixed amount of gold pieces the first.<br/><br/>",

In the &quot;persons&quot; section, players have to mimic the persons, described in the card.

As well as enabling the battle to be replayed as it happened, the game is designed to explore &quot;what-if?&quot; questions (see &quot;Scenarios&quot;, below), such as:<br/><br/>     If the Poles and Lithuanians had deployed the other way round (Poles on the right and Lithuanians on the left) might it have significantly affected the battle?<br/>     Can a completely different deployment by both armies make a radical difference to the outcome of the battle?<br/>     Could a more intelligent use of the Teutonic infantry have made a difference to the outcome of the battle?<br/><br/><br/>The game includes an historical article, rules, A4-sized map, A4-sized page of tables, 71 game counters, 71 strength counters and a game turn counter.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents 20 minutes. Each hexagon represents about 250x250 meters. Each counter represents 1000 cavalry, 2000 infantry or a leader with their personal &quot;banner&quot; of 240 cavalry.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Final Argument of Kings is a product of the same circle of players and designers who produced the Squad Leader board game and the Johnny Reb Civil War miniature rules.  Final Argument bears a strong resemblance to the latter but was designed to tune to the warfare of the middle part of the 18th century.  These rules are appropriate for games set from the time of the War of the Polish Succession (1734) to the beginning of the Wars of the French Revolution (1789.)  It is scaled to be appropriate for battle on the European continent.  For 15mm figures, one inch on the table represents 45-50 yards.<br/><br/>Horse and foot units are each four stands and represent infantry battalions and cavalry regiments.  Artillery batteries are single stands as are army, wing, and brigade commanders.  The number of figures per unit is variable with each figure representing 40 soldiers or one section of artillery.  Stand size is variable with the number of figures so that units with more men cover a wider frontage.  (The game would be playable with other basing systems, but the game's basing has a number of subtleties that transmit the tactical feel of the time.  For example, units are longer in march column than they are wide in line as, indeed, they should be.)<br/><br/>Turns follow a set sequence with simultaneous movement and fire of various types.  Each turn represents 20 minutes of time.  Players mark orders for units that are hidden from the opposing player.  Command is an important element but does not dominate the game or become obtrusive.  There is also provision for grand tactical movement so that maneuver and closing to battle may happen quickly without taking too much time nor sacrificing tactical detail.  Combat tends to be bloody with stands taking figure losses as a result.  Morale of units is a key game concept.  Units have a basic morale point that is altered by loss of strength and the local situation faced by the units.  Battlefield events trigger morale checks.  There are no saving roles.<br/><br/>",

The dice are added up and the total is multiplied by 10 to determine the yardage.  To simulate a hook or slice, the black die is rolled to determine which lane the ball lands in.  Shots from sand traps, putts and chip shots are done with special dice that have non-standard number distributions: <br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Brown <br/><br/>         Sand Trap Shot <br/><br/>          1:2:3:3:3:4 <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Red <br/><br/>         Chip Shot<br/><br/>          1:2:2:3:3:4 <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Green <br/><br/>         Putt<br/><br/>          1:2:2:2:3:4 <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Alternately, these shots can be done by taking the appropriate card and following the instructions.  As the player's marker (ball) gets closer to the green, they will wish to roll fewer white dice to ensure they do not overshoot the hole.  Markers landing in hazards suffer penalties.  The course includes 9 holes with water hazards, sand traps, out of bounds areas, and trees.<br/><br/>",

In the small scale a base of figures represent 120-150 foot or 60-75 horse.  The larger scale enables simulation of the biggest battle of the era.  Each base represents 240-300 infantry or 120-150 cavalry.<br/><br/>The rules cover all the unit types of the era including Ronin and Warrior Monks.  Further, the author includes nearly two dozen classical Japanese army deployment patterns.  Besides the rules, the booklet contains extensive lists of leaders and their ratings as well as army lists, ten historical battle scenarios and a scenario generator.<br/><br/>",

An excerpt from the Author's Notes inside is as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;A to Z Rules For Ancient Warfare is a fast playing set of rules for 25mm and 15mm miniatures. It is compatible with all basing systems, army organizations and army lists. It will enable you to play a game with 300 to 400 figures per side in about four hours.<br/><br/>The heart of the rules is the initiative-impulse movement system, the command control system and the morale system. These are the most critical areas determining the flow of the game. They are also areas of great flexibility and changes can easily be made to meet the requirements of different army compositions or scenarios.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is designed to be a fun educational exploration of salmon information.<br/><br/>Players begin as salmon eggs which hatch into fry.  The fry grow into fingerlings in a lake and then proceed to the ocean.  This course is reversed as the salmon returns to the same spawning bed were it was born.  Along the way there are many hazards to the growing salon; from river dangers to being eaten by animals and people.<br/><br/>The game is a standard roll-and-move variety.  The frequent hazard spots move the player back or forward a number of spaces; make a player miss a turn; or require a particular number to be rolled before continuing.  The last hazard, three spaces from the finish, is particularly nefarious as it sends the player all the way back to the beginning.<br/><br/>The game comes with a map of the Sockeye spawning rivers of BC Canada and a detailed description of the life-cycle of a Sockeye Salmon.  The game artwork is beautiful, from the board to the fish-shaped playing pawns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Light, quick skirmish game of warfare during the 19th Century.<br/><br/>From the Introduction<br/><br/>The late nineteenth-century has always been a popular subject for wargaming, and there are already plenty of rule sets around.  But when HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) was planning their Victorian British in Home Service uniforms figure range they decided to publish their own rules to go with them.  Why?<br/><br/>Firstly, because the emphasis in Ever-Victorious Armies is rather different from that of most rule sets.  The authors were especially interested in the role which the British army might have played in a European War of the period, and so they wanted to cater for this sort of hypothetical scenario. They also wanted to be able to fight &quot;alternative history&quot; campaigns, involving fictional armies based fairly loosely on real-life prototypes.  This required a &quot;broad brush&quot; approach, catching the essence of the period, but without concentrating too intently on the tactical and organizational minutiae of a particular conflict.<br/><br/>The other factor which HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) sought to emphasize in this war-game is the &quot;game&quot; part.  Some of the best known rules for the period -- as for many other periods -- are a bit too much like work to play.  Authenticity is all very nice but real warfare has been aptly described as a combination of ninety percent boredom and ten percent confusion.  HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) have tried not to reproduce this aspect too faithfully in Ever-Victorious Armies.<br/><br/>Ever-Victorious Armies is based on individual figures, which are removed to simulate casualties, thus minimizing record-keeping.  It requires little if any paperwork, no little boxes to tick off, and only one kind of dice.  The command and control rules require each on-table unit to be given orders at the start of the game, to which they must try to adhere as long as morale test results permit. The orders should specify the objective and route if the units are to move, or the position to be defended if not. An army's Commander-in-Cheif may attempt to modify the orders of one unit, per turn, by utilizing a messenger figure to convey a new set of written orders.<br/><br/>The rules ideally require figures to be based so that they are individually removable, but multi-figure &quot;blocks&quot; -- like those produced in 2mm and 6mm bi Irregular Miniatures -- can be used instead, if you prefer to use the smaller scales.  In this case, simply treat each block as if it was a figure.<br/><br/>A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be completed in an evening. After a few attempts players will be able to remember most of the rules which are needed, and so will be able to keep the game moving without constantly referring to the rulebook.  This leaves the players free to enjoy the games and admire their carefully painted figures -- which is what it is all about, after all.<br/><br/>",

Under the auspices of Operation Shingle, Allied units from both the United States of America and Great Britain conducted a beach landing in the area surrounding Anzio in an attempt to seize the strategic Alban Hills and cut the supply to German troops fighting further south near Monte Cassino. Ultimately, the invading forces had the potential of capturing Rome, described by Churchill as &ldquo;the keys to Europe&rdquo;. Planning for the invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord, was well advanced and any success or failure at Anzio would surely lead to ramifications for the larger invasion planned for France.<br/><br/>In Anzio &ndash; Drive to Rome, each player takes command of either the Allied of Axis forces, and each player moves his supplied pieces in an attempt to fulfill the victory conditions as set out further below. The game commences on 22nd January 1944 following the Allied invasion and finishes on 1st March 1944 unless the automatic victory conditions are fulfilled by either player.<br/><br/>",

The trick comes in that the dice are placed with a particular horizontal or vertical orientation, and that when a dice is placed, adjacent dice may be converted if the facing side of the new die is higher in value than the facing side of the original die.  Also, to give a bit more strategic depth, players may store up to 3 dice that they don't like the rolls on -- and may use one of these instead of rolling on any turn.  But, they must use all the stored dice by game end.<br/><br/>",

To contest your skill with your rival, aim the target, toss the fan, and then refer scoring chart for victory points (VP). Although its elegant image made some fantasy like &quot;game of Heian Era from a millennium ago&quot;, it is only legend. According to evidences of manuscripts, it might be flourished from middle of Edo era (about 1770s).<br/><br/>Skilled veteran makes victory points constantly. Beginner may hit big score luckily. Because of this easily enjoyability for everyone, it won popularity once among commoners.<br/><br/><br/>    Difference of Tosenkyo from Darts<br/><br/><br/>As same throwing game, Tosenkyo is frequently compared with Darts. The most significant deference of Tosenkyo from Darts is way of scoring. VP of Darts are gained from stabbed area directly. But in Tosenkyo, after hitting fan dropped the target down from the Base box, VP would be determined between distance and over/under positions of fan and target (and sometimes Base of target). Beginner cannot win almost against veteran in Darts. But in Tosenkyo, scoring system has some happening factors. Some beginner may hit big lucky score and win against constant veteran. This makes the game unexpectedly thrilling and exciting.<br/><br/>In fact, adequate proportion of luck factor against cool rule is the joyous essence of Tosenkyo.<br/><br/>Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.tosenkyo.net/whats-e.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.tosenkyo.net/whats-e.htm</a><br/><br/>",

Move your ships. Fire your weapons. Launch your torpedoes. And watch your enemies explode into brilliant flashes of molten metal! Everything a budding megalomaniac... err, defender of the galaxy... could want!<br/><br/>G.O.B.S.! is designed to allow you to build big, custom spacefleets and fight quick, explosive battles with simple rules and little or no record keeping. Just move, shoot, and (probably) explode. What could be more fun? Best of all, you can use G.O.B.S.! with any spaceship miniatures you like, from those expensive metal jobs to cheap plastic toys to scratch-built wonders made from household items. (Yours truly is contemplating a fleet made from seashells.)<br/><br/>In G.O.B.S.!, a ship&rsquo;s speed and combat worthiness are determined by the size and apparent purpose of the miniature(or whatever the manufacturer happens to call the thing). Players may then customize the armament to reflect their preferences.<br/> Big ships are slow, clumsy, and easy to hit. They also carry lots and lots of weapons and are both very dangerous and hard to destroy.<br/><br/>Smaller ships are fast and nimble, and very hard to hit. However, they carry few weapons and are very easy to destroy.<br/><br/>The movement and combat systems of G.O.B.S.! are designed to reflect these general principles.&quot;<br/><br/>Download G.O.B.S.! at:<br/><br/>Homepage: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.thegobspage.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.thegobspage.com</a><br/><br/>",

Each player controls a faction of rebels and is trying to get their faction to control five (of twelve) cities or three Royalist cities. Players receive production for their holdings, build units, move and fight, etc., in a reasonably familiar fashion. There are rules for supply and fairly elaborate rules for scouting.<br/><br/>There are two unusual features of the game. One is that the Royalists take part in the game but are not controlled by a single player - when it is the Royalist's turn to build or move the player to the left of the last player to do something takes control of them. The other is that every turn has an alliance phase, in which the players may make or break alliances between their factions. The player order for each turn is determined by drawing cards, and all factions in an alliance move when one of the faction cards is drawn (the members may vote to wait for a later card rather than moving at the first opportunity).<br/><br/>",

The Touhou games are known for their intricate and complex bullet patterns, unique fantasy setting, many characters, and prodigal amount of fan-derived works...this card game included.<br/><br/>&quot;This is a two-player turn-based dueling card game. Each player starts out by choosing four characters (repeats are allowed), and designates one as the leader. Your leader has an initial health point (HP), border value (BV) and evasion value (EV), which will be used throughout the match, as well as some special abilities. Your starting spell point (SP) is zero. The other characters are to allow you access to other cards; the character requirements can be seen at the top of each card.<br/><br/>After you've picked your team, you get to choose 40 cards (duplicates are allowed up to a total of three) that comprise your deck. Obviously you will pick cards that you can actually use.<br/><br/>You will keep track of your HP and SP using counters.

        "description": "A Canadian-made horse racing game, endorsed by champion jockey Sandy Hawley.<br/><br/>Game summary;<br/>The players each start the game with the same amount of game money with which they buy horses and bet on them in 6 races.  The horse cards are dealt to the players and each player decides to buy one or more of those dealt. Horses not purchased are returned to the bank and are offered again after the first race.  The odds paid to the winning bet are determined by dealing the &quot;odds&quot; cards to the players' horses.  Each player may bet up to $1000 to win on horses that the player owns.  A race consists of 4 or 5 quarters.  There are 5 identical decks of &quot;race cards&quot; that have on their face one of the ten available horses.  For each of the quarters a &quot;Race Card&quot; deck is shuffled and then laid out in a row on the game board, the horse pictured on the last card is in the lead of that quarter.  The leading horse earns a bonus for the player.  The horse pictured on the last card of the last deck is the race winner.  The winning horse earns the bet times the odds for the player.  After 6 races, the horses are sold back to the bank for the original purchase price and the richest player is the game winner.<br/><br/>From the game box:<br/>&quot;The high stakes horse racing game.

Each player moves the units into play three at a time, one in each of air, land and sea lanes.

There are also 8 Face cards (King, Queen, Jack, and Ace) that give players special abilities during the game.  If players can place a card that connects to two cards simultaneously, they may play an additional card the same turn.  Players start their turns by drawing a card, so playing more than one each turn is vital.  Each card also has text on it (Blue or Red), that create special circumstances (Rotating cards 90 degrees, Flipping them 180 degrees, and Moving them to another location on the &quot;board&quot;).  Some cards played allow you to automatically play additional cards, and some force you to draw more.<br/><br/>",

Bishop was officially credited with 72 kills, despite having started the war in the infantry and flying in combat only between March and August 1917, and April to June 1918. He was the first Canadian promoted to Air Marshal in 1939 and was in charge of air force recruitment and training at the time this game was published in 1941. For more details on his life, see <a target='_blank' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop</a>.<br/><br/>From the rules:  Starting at the Recruiting Depot, players move through the Manning Depot to the Initial Training School, where they are classified as Pilots, Observers or Airgunners.<br/><br/>Each player then follows his course through its various stages till completed --- goes overseas --- serves with the Fighting force and finally returns home.<br/><br/>The game is driven by exact die rolls (getting to key spots and ending the game requires an exact roll) as the player moves through the contiguous points on the board.

        "description": "Penguins Paradise is a children's game where players try to be the first penguin to travel around the South Pole.  Players roll a die to move.  Some spaces have a fish marker where you can draw cards.  Cards move penguins to different locations on the board, as well as forward and back.  Cards also let you do special things during the game.<br/><br/>Players may play a card on their turn instead of rolling to move, or after rolling and moving.  Cards may be played on yourself or an opponent.  You can hold up to four cards before you must play one.<br/><br/>",

The 7 banners of the 7 warring states now replaces the 6 heroes.<br/><br/>I've increased some of the unit numbers and decreased others to enable the additional 7th player, to take into account the new crossbowmen, as well as to rebalance the game towards a slightly higher emphasis on missile troops.<br/><br/>Gorgon is now 7th Month Hungry Ghost Festival.<br/><br/>Thanatos is now Zhan Shen.<br/><br/>Helen is replaced by the Mandate of Heaven.<br/><br/>City/Tireme replaced by the duality of Civil/Military City/Fortress.<br/><br/>Agamemnon, Athena &amp; Poseidon have been replaced by Bian (Tablets),a Bamboo Bian, a Stone Bian (for Civil City) &amp; a Bronze Bian (for Martial Fortress) respectively.<br/><br/>Chariots are now split into lower value Cavalry &amp; higher value Chariots.<br/><br/>Trojan Horse is now a Yunti Che.<br/><br/>Elephant is now Chao Che.<br/><br/>Harrows are now Crossbow Traps.<br/><br/>All other units remain basically the same except labeled in their Chinese equivalent.<br/><br/>Go here for more info: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.act.com.sg/zhanguo/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.act.com.sg/zhanguo/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played on a 8 sided hexagonal board, with groups of 7 stones, arranged in a hexagonal formation, at the center of each side, with opposing colors facing each other (a diagram is available on the game's website.)<br/><br/>On each turn, a player: (a) selects a group of connected friendly stones, (b) name one as pivot, and (c) rotate the group any multiple of 60 degrees around the pivot, provided all the landing places are either empty, with opponent stones, or one of his own cells that the move is just vacating. Any opponent stones landed on are captured. Passing is legal, and compulsory if no moves are legal.<br/><br/>The winner is whoever captures all his opponent's stones.<br/><br/>Blockdance does not have great clarity, i.e., it is very hard to predict what is the exact outcome of a sequence of moves. However, part of this difficulty vanishes once a player gets used to these pivot moves, and even if there is not much strategy, the game is highly tactical and fun.<br/><br/>",

Actlete cards are based on real performers from various ComedySportz cities around the country.<br/><br/>Each Actlete has 5 attributes, and 11 points to divide up among the attributes (they must be between 1 and 3).

The more cards a player uses to reach the target number the more points the math problem is worth. If a player finds a way to use all of their cards to reach the target number, the math problem is worth double points. Each card can be used either as a number or arithmetic sign by turning the card.

Each piece has a movement cost.<br/><br/>When pieces move, they must go in two directions (like a Knight in Chess).  If a piece can move 4 spaces, it can move 1 in one direction and 3 in another, or 2 and 2.<br/><br/>The object for the Swimmers is to have at least one Swimmer make it to shore on the opposite side of the board.  The Sharks must prevent all Swimmers from making it.<br/><br/>The Boat is a protector, and as long as a Swimmer is in an adjacent space, a Shark can not take the piece.<br/><br/>There are 3 spaces marked with a Star.  When a player moves their piece onto the Star space, they may draw a card.<br/><br/>Cards typically consist of value amounts you can add to your movement for a turn.  There are a number of special cards that can affect either or both teams.  Players may hold as many cards as they like.  Movement cards have no penalty to play, but special cards require the use of some movement points in order to be played.<br/><br/>",

So there's a definitely up and down to the piece's orientation.<br/><br/>Ownership of pieces is then marked by whoever has the writing &quot;right-side up&quot; from his point of view. In lieu of moving a piece on the board, a captured piece may be placed on the board instead with the restriction that the piece must have a legal move from its position when placed and that no two pawns owned by the same player can be on the same file.<br/><br/>How this differs from the parent game:<br/>Both are of the chess family of games an they share the game goal. Like the original, it's a pure abstract where the object is to capture the opponent's jade general. The key difference is that the complexity of the board situation does not get reduced during play. All pieces are always in play throughout the game, and so one will never have an end-game with only a few pieces involved. Exchanges don't remove pieces but rather potentially hand of vital material to one's opponent to use against you. Thus, what will be a good move in xiangqi can often be disastrous in drop-xiangqi and vice-versa. (The inspiration here is drawn from shogi.)<br/><br/>Capture the leader abstracts typically reduce to a simple end-game with the exception of shogi family of games. This game offers a complex end-game in a situation so that aplayer can't simply force exchanges to make a simple tactical game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Frog Pond is an abstract, 2-player game with the theme of frogs on lily pads.  The lily pad tiles are arranged in a grid, and each player has a frog token.  On your turn, you may move your frog on space orthogonally, and you must slide one row or column of lily pads one space.  (You may perform these actions in either order.)  When two or more groups of lily pads are formed, such that they are not touching, or only touching by a single corner, the smaller group &quot;sinks&quot; and is removed from the board.<br/><br/>The goal is to sink the opposing frog, while keeping yours afloat.<br/><br/>The game was designed by 9-year-old Sean Allen and self-published at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.frog-pond.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.frog-pond.com</a>.  It was packaged with the expansion: Lily Pads of Doom, in which special powers are printed on the lily pad tiles, which occur when the pad is sunk. (With one exception: the Tar Pit, which takes effect when landed on.)  To play without the expansion, you simply ignore the text on the tiles.<br/><br/>",

The scale is 1 figure equals 20 men, one inch equals ten yards, and one turn equals approximately 30 seconds of elapsed time.<br/><br/>Troop types are classified by armor protection, formation, social order and experience, and weapons. For example, an 11th century Norman knight would be classified as HC (heavy cavalry), Order (slightly loose formation), K (knights, very high on the social/experience scale), and light lance (used overarm, not couched).<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the rules is that it includes a section of guidelines for modifying troop performance based on campaign factors. For example, if troops have force marched, been previously defeated by their opponent, are out of supply, they will suffer minus factors to their die rolls for testing morale, missile fire, and melee resolution.<br/><br/>The rules include four pages of army lists that provide sample ratings for troop types by nationality.<br/><br/>Despite being almost 40 years old, God's Acre is still a good game system based on solid &quot;Old School&quot; mechanics for miniature gaming.<br/><br/>",

Cards represent <br/>rocks and geological processes, these must be collected and displayed in the <br/>right order depending on the Rock Cycle (see below). Each single card tells <br/>what are the preceding and the following cards.<br/><br/>The &quot;Burial: heat-pressure&quot; card is very important as it allows the transformation<br/>of a sedimentary/igneous rock into a metamorphic one. It is essential that the <br/>preceding card and the following card are logically ordered. The exact sequence<br/>is described in the &quot;Burial: heat-pressure&quot; card. That means that if you have <br/>&quot;Granite&quot;, you have to link it to &quot;Gneiss&quot; and nothing else.<br/>N.B. Chalk should be treated as Limestone (i.e. changes into &quot;Marble&quot;).<br/><br/>1- Shuffle cards and deal 5 each. Place the remaining deck, face-down, at the <br/>    centre of the table; reveal the first card and place it &quot;face up&quot; next to the deck.<br/>2- Players have to arrange the five cards in &quot;rock cycle&quot; order: each player <br/>    have to decide, according to the cards in his/her hand, which &quot;section&quot; of<br/>    the Rock Cycle would be more convenient to build upon. Players should not<br/>    reveal their cards.<br/>3- In turn, clockwise, each player pick either the top card from the deck or the <br/>    face-up card next to it. Then he/she has to discard one card; this will be placed <br/>    face-up next to the deck. Once the card has been discarded, the next player can <br/>    pick a card and so on.<br/>4- When a player has put all five cards in order he/she will reveal them all and,<br/>     if the other players acknowledge the right order, he/she is the winner.<br/><br/>",

He must then try to get his subordinates to carry out his detailed instructions. Unfortunately they often have their own agendas and personalities that he must deal with. He must also run an extensive civil government, which is not directly simulated, but is represented by delays and obstructions they naturally cause to military matters.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tinker Fox will generate numerous and varied types of battles with whatever troops are present in the campaign.

        "description": "Several storm cells bear down on the town of Doomsville, Oklahoma (population 213). Each contains an F1 tornado that will grow in strength and carve its own path of destruction. Do what you have always wanted to...take control of one of nature's most dangerous forces: the tornado! Using your twister, destroy as much of the town of Doomsville and the surrounding countryside as you can - do a better job than the other players and win the game!<br/><br/>To win, you will need to properly control the path of the tornado and manage its strength so that destroy high value buildings. Some buildings can only be destroyed by extremely strong F5 tornadoes, while others can be wiped out with only an F2. You will manage the strength and path using a pool of &quot;storm points&quot;. Each player starts with the same amount, but as you use them to plan your actions, the pools for each tornado will change accordingly.<br/><br/>Doomsville rebuilds itself for each game; meaning that for each game there is a method for randomly building the town and the surrounding countryside. This makes each game play distinctly different and puts the tornadoes into a fight to get the higher value buildings before their opponents.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for...? Get to wiping Doomsville off the map!<br/><br/>NOTE: This game was inspired a couple of months after a small twister (F0 probably) tore up some trees in my yard in July 2006 and discussing it with my son. Tornadoes are very dangerous and interesting facts and safety information about tornadoes will be included in the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is intended for 4-6 players and is extremely tongue-in-cheek, concentrating more on the humorous aspects of the game instead of the serious.

The Yankee Squadron, led by Bert Acosta, fought Franco&rsquo;s White planes. Each pilot was paid $1,500 a month and a bonus of $1,000 for each enemy plane shot down.<br/><br/>In MAS-WWII:MTO, we take that idea and run with it.  You can form a squadron at anytime from just before the start of World War II to the end of 1943 and see if you can prosper from the chaos.<br/><br/>We begin by focusing on the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.  With access to Commonwealth, French, German, and Italian aircraft, players can get their MAS up and running by fighting in one of the most turbulent theaters of action.<br/><br/><br/>MAS-WWII:MTO is the first product in a series that takes the fun and excitement of Mercenary Air Squadron and transplants into the era of World War II.

The lid has a slot to accept TROUBLE DISCS and there is a wheel on the side of the box which changes the active lever when rotated. The six SOLUTION CARDS are placed face down on the board.<br/><br/>Players are given a PANIC CARD and 20 TROUBLE DISCS at the start of the game. These discs must be disposed of, either into the PANIC BOX or to opponents during game play, to view a face-down SOLUTION CARD. Movement is by the throw of 2 standard dice. If a '1' is thrown a lever on the PANIC BOX must be pressed. If the lid opens the player must take all the TROUBLE DISCS inside to a maximum of 20. The PANIC BOX is reset, closed and play recommences.<br/><br/>The first player to match a SOLUTION CARD to the PANIC CARD they hold is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

A brief summary of the game:<br/><br/>2 players take turns forming words on an initially empty grid.  On your turn, first you think of a set of letters, and then you repeatedly add this same set of letters to the board to form words, Scrabble-style, until you run out of ways to add them (There can never be duplicates of the same word on the board.)  Your score for the turn is the number letters in your set times the number of words you formed with them.  On your next turn you think of another set of letters and do it all over again.  The game ends when both players pass and the player with the most points wins.  There&rsquo;s some other stuff, like challenge rules for made up words, a limit on the number of times you can use the letter S, and a pie-rule for the first turn of the game, but that&rsquo;s the gist of it.<br/><br/><br/>",

Tokens and markers are used to keep track of Bases (cities), Units (military forces), and Credits (income).<br/><br/>Six social factors, also referred to as scores, are tracked for each player&rsquo;s Faction: Population, Economics, Research, Military, Ecology, and Espionage. These factors are used to determine victory.<br/><br/>There are four types of victory defined in the game: Diplomatic, Economic, Conquest, and Transcendence. The first player to achieve any one of these victory conditions wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A custom deck of 52 cards is used to regulate combat and maneuvers. The Move Cards provide for left and right turns, hard turns, &ldquo;slides&rdquo;, and an Immelman loop.<br/><br/>Aircraft can shoot at any time during their movement by playing a Shoot Card. Aircraft with forward firing guns attack aircraft that are straight ahead, while those with a rearward firing observer can shoot at aircraft in a 60 degree arc of hexes to the rear of the plane. Damage is determined by a die roll modified based on range, which may result in 0 or less damage (indicating a miss).<br/><br/>A Critical Hits occurs when a 1 is rolled on the six-sided die rolled to determine damage. Critical Hits include the death of the observer or pilot, engine damage, critical structural or control damage, and fuel leakage.<br/><br/>The game also includes simple rules for altitude, ammunition, clouds, balloons, and ground fire (infantry, machine gunners, and flak.)<br/><br/>",

Turn Sequence: Each figure gets to move once and attack once per turn. Mortars, machine guns &amp; artillery can either move or attack during a turn.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Several different combat resolution mechanisms are included in the rules. The mechanism to be used depends on the nature of the attacking unit. For instance, a submachinegun attack is resolved as follows: &ldquo;Standing 15 feet away from the target throw 3 marbles simultaneously.&rdquo; On the other hand, for a flamethrower: &ldquo;Stand over the attacker. Drop a tennis ball from the tip of your nose.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In addition, a six-sided die is rolled to determine what means is used to resolve hand-to-hand attacks between infantry units within two inches of each other. The die roll may call for these conflicts to be resolved by means such as arm wrestling, a staring contest, or rock-paper-scissors.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Safety Rules&rdquo; note that players should wear goggles at all times.<br/><br/>",

Courtroom Clash comes with all the materials needed to play the game in this single PDF which can be used for hours and hours of fun.<br/><br/>One six-sided die is required for play.<br/><br/>",

All must be present at game start because Ikkozendo is a single stash game and, as such, there will not be enough pyramids for the Students to build koans to seek the secret rule or for the Master to build koans to disprove a rule guess. Because no more than two koans are made during a game, the players' memory of previous configurations of the koans is critical to finishing the game. Thus, if players come and go, as is allowed in Zendo, then the game can get stuck in &quot;cycles,&quot; as the same configurations are reused over and over again to disprove already-attempted guesses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Few shipping routes connected the Soviet Union to its western allies. One ran through Murmansk in the far north, kept ice-free by the Gulf Stream and built during the First World War for the express purpose of receiving military supplies from Britain and the United States. In June 1941, two German mountain divisions crossed the border from Finland, intent on capturing the port and sealing off this vital access. After fierce fighting along the Litsa River, the offensive finally failed in the face of fierce resistance by the Red Army and Navy and workers&rsquo; militia units.<br/><br/>In 1944, the Red Army returned the favor, with a lightning offensive spearheaded by elite light infantry and aimed at capturing Finland&rsquo;s ice-free port of Petsamo and occupying northern Norway. The Soviets rolled back the Germans into Norway, crushing the Army of Lappland and closing the war's Arctic front.<br/><br/>Army of Lappland covers both of these campaigns, both the 1941 and 1942 battles in front of Murmansk and the 1944 counter-offensive. The game system is the same as that used in Tiger of Malaya, and in our long out-of-print Blood on the Snow. Units are mostly battalions, with the maps covering the area along the coast of the Arctic Ocean from Kirkenes in Norway to Murmansk at a scale of two kilometers per hex.<br/><br/>Components:  <br/><br/>     1,120 1/2-inch playing pieces<br/>     Two maps<br/><br/><br/>(from Avalanche Press website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Unbridled Fury is a set of miniatures rules for the fantasy genre which is designed from the ground up for skirmish battles. These small engagements and affrays are set in worlds as diverse as the players themselves (as well as the history of our very own Earth). It has no &lsquo;official&rsquo; setting or miniatures line and allows the players to use whatever they want, in whatever setting they desire.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Game-play is fast and brutal. The game is a departure from the regular approach to fantasy skirmish games - combat feels more like an all-out brawl rather than organized groups of fighters rolling dice at each other. You can almost feel the pain of the fighters as they hurl themselves into battle. Once the players get a grip on the rules games are usually over in under an hour, which is crucial to those who have to squeeze real life in between them. Physical space required is also<br/>small - most 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; terrain boards are ideal; kitchen tables will suffice, though, and may even produce a tighter battle.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules were designed to be used with 28mm figures. &quot;[O]ne figure represents one warrior, beast or frothing lunatic, so the effect of a single figure on the game is of great importance.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Every figure has a profile, a set of equipment (weapons, armour, etc.) and possibly some 'special abilities.'&quot; The profile for a figure consists of nine categories plus any special abilities. Special abilities include Berserker, Camouflage, Creature of Darkness, Fanatic, Flier, Giantslayer, Invisible, Musician, Night Vision, Teleporter, Undead, and Were-Creature.<br/><br/>The game includes rules on creating characters, companies, and setting up games using scenario creation tables. The game play covers areas such as command, morale, visibility, ambushes, cowardice, and fires.<br/><br/>",

The game box starts with the numbers 1-9 flipped up. You roll two d6 and add them together. You then flip down enough numbers to add up to the total you rolled. Once you roll a number that can't be summed up by numbers still showing, you score by counting and summing these remaining numbers. This is the Mumbly Chance game.

        "description": "POLEMOS - FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR<br/><br/>When Emperor Louis Napoleon declared war on Prussia in Summer 1870 he was at the head of an army that most contemporaries regarded as the leading military force in Europe. No doubt he had plans of recreating the Glory of his illustrious namesake Uncle. What actually happened was a campaign that saw the Prussians invading France and the Imperial army capitulating at Sedan. Louis Napoleon abdicated and the French carried in the war under the auspices of the Third Republic.<br/><br/>As a wargames period, the FPW remains largely unexplored. There seems to be a general myth that the uniforms are boring, the battles one-sided and that information is just too hard to get to those of whose language skills do not include French and German. As it happens, nothing could be further than the truth than these stereotypes. The French can have a large variety of brightly dressed and colourful units, ranging from the Imperial Guard to the Zouaves and the North African Turcos. You can even field the French Foreign Legion! The Prussians number a significant contingent of allied German troops who all add their own colour and variety to the army, especially the large contingent of Bavarians. Infantry battalions still fought carrying their colours into action and the deployed armies make a brave show on the wargames table. The Prussians may have their superb artillery arm, but the French Infantry were armed with the Chassepot rifle. Tactics were in state of flux as armies were coming to terms with the change from Napoleonic tactics to ones more suited to the greater range and lethality of rifles and artillery. No greater example of this can be seen than the presence of Cavalry units whose purpose was still to charge the enemy with cold steel as their fathers and grandfathers had done.<br/><br/>If you've not considered 1870 before then it is well worth a second look!<br/><br/>Although the war involved unprecedented numbers of soldiers, there was a great deal of variety in the size of the battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.<br/><br/>Polemos FPW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, Commandant de Battaile will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Kommandant der Armee will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Polemos FPW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.<br/><br/><u>Basing and Representation</u>:<br/>The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos FPW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.<br/><br/><u>In Commandant de Battaile</u>:<br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 500-1000 men. <br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment or three to four squadrons. <br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery or mitrailleuse base represents two batteries each of 6 guns.<br/>A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders<br/><br/><u>In Kommandant der Armee</u>:<br/>60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two CDB bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.<br/>A 60mm square base of infantry represents a brigade or division of 1500 to 3000 men.<br/><br/>A 60mm square base of cavalry represents a brigade or division of 750 to 1500 men.<br/><br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 18 to 36 guns,<br/><br/>All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/>This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.<br/><br/>",

Players also score with a number that contains the master number written on it. The first player may not start the game with a scoring number. Then the next player must write another number using these same operations or by doubling, halving, squaring or taking the square root of the previous number.

The games ends when no further unused number between 1 to 30 can be derived from the actual number by the rules.<br/><br/>This game was presented to Sid Sackson by it author Father Daniel, with whom Sid Sackson exchanged correspondence about games in general.<br/><br/>",

The Battle of Brunete simulation was designed for two players, one controlling the Republican units, representing the Loyalists, Anarchists, Communists, Liberals, and various International Brigades which were supported by the Soviet Union and the other player controlling the Nationalists, mainly Franco&rsquo;s army, supported by German and Italian Fascists.<br/><br/>The game set consists of one &ldquo;17 x 22&rdquo; inch map sheet and one counter sheet of 90 counters (units and markers). Additionally players will need a 6 sided die for combat resolution.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Patterns&quot; was published in A Gamut of Games. A word by Sid Sackson:<br/>&quot;Patterns has many characteristics of a board game. All the cards are face up on the table, so there are no mysteries. Play is in moves, which are determined by the relationship of the cards to one another. Some players find the interplay of the &quot;patterns&quot; a fascinating challenge. Other never see it. To find out whether it is &quot;your cup of tea&quot; you'll have to try it.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player takes twelve cards from a normal deck of cards numbered from 1 to 13 (Ace to K). Then shuffles his cards and deals then in two lines of six cards each. The objective is, by moving two cards each turn, complete a pattern before the other player. The catch is that the moves you are allowed to make are based on your opponents' cards. If you do a difficult move, you win points, if you make an easy one you lose points. When you win a hand, you score the number of point you get that hand (can be zero).<br/><br/>",

Now fit the window pieces face down, at random, into the spaces.  Shuffle the cards and place the pack face down between the players.  Players take turns to turn up a card from the top of the pack and then &quot;open&quot; a window.  If the window matches the card, the player leaves the window open and keeps the card.  If not, the player must close the window and return the card to the bottom of the pile.  When all the windows have been opened, the player who has collected the most cards is the winner.

        "description": "Downward Spiral is a sole survivor board game, developed by researchers at the Institute of Behavioral Research at Texas Christian University.  The game provides substance abuse counselors with an innovative way to motivate clients and open up discussions about the consequences of addiction on themselves and their families.  In a game format that resembles the well-known Monopoly&trade;, players roll dice to move across a board filled with potential downfalls related to family, health, friendships, finances and self-esteem, which are described on game cards that players draw.  The objective of the game is to stay alive, without losing all social and financial resources due to substance abuse -- a task that becomes more challenging the longer the player stays in the game.<br/><br/>The Downward Spiral game focuses on the consequences of substance abuse on a person&rsquo;s family, finances, self-esteem, health, legal status, and life expectancy (or lack thereof).  Each player takes the role of a person who continues to abuse drugs throughout his/her lifetime.  The last player left &ldquo;alive&rdquo; in the game &ldquo;wins.&rdquo;  The game uses vignettes as well as facts and quotes to emphasize the consequences amassed in the game.  An after-game discussion helps focus the players on issues that have surfaced during play.<br/><br/>More information can be found here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.ibr.tcu.edu/pubs/trtmanual/downwardspiral.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.ibr.tcu.edu/pubs/trtmanual/downwardspiral.html</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed by Wanye Cooley to fix the issue of needing multiple playing cards decks to play poker, pinochle, rook, and tarok. This deck includes mapping so that you can use it to play either of those games as well as the games in the rulebook.<br/><br/>Rulebook include rules for several trick taking games using this custom 54-card deck with a &quot;revolutionary&quot; alphabetic design. Similar to &quot;Wizard&quot; and other trick-taking games you must guess the number of tricks you will take each round, but the total number guessed cannot equal the hand-size for the round (forcing at least one player to lose each round).<br/><br/>Hand size starts at 8 then decreases by 1 each round until it is only 1 card, then it increases (1 card each round) back to 8.<br/><br/>The deck includes rules for three games:<br/>UG I-is the standard 2&ndash;6 player trick-taking game<br/>UG II&mdash;is played in partnerships<br/>UG III&mdash;is a solitaire variant of the game<br/><br/>From the rule book:<br/>In the future, the metric system will be adopted worldwide. The Universal Deck is the first to adopt a truly metric size, 6 x 9 cm. This makes the cards 1/8&quot; narrower than a poker deck, 1/8&quot; wider than a bridge deck, and 1/16&quot; longer than both.<br/><br/>",

The game was initially pitched to Milton Bradly but ultimately independently produced and distributed by GCM games as part of a limited production run in 1994.<br/><br/>From the game instructions: Use your Fire Trucks to Put the Fire Out at each Fire Site and then return your Fire Trucks to the Firehouse.<br/>To Put the Fire Out at each Fire Site move Trucks onto the Site. Each Firefighter must move Trucks onto each Site and Put the Fire Out. The first Firefighters to move Trucks onto any Fire Sites do not Put the Fire Out for the other Firefighters in the game. More than one Firefighter can have Trucks on the same Fire Site. You can get on and off a Fire Site only by the connecting space.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was created in the former Soviet Union.<br/>Needs 47 yellow disks for one side and 47 blue disks for the other. The traditional chess pieces are built up from these disks. A king needs 8, queen 7, bishop 5, knight 4, rook 3, pawn 1. If you move part of the disks from a piece, you change the piece to two weaker ones, or you can move disks onto a piece of your own and create one stronger piece. Pawns can only do this with their capturing move. There can be more than one of any pieces including king. A player can never be without a king. A king can be captured just like other pieces in normal chess as long as the player who just lost his last king can form a new one in his next move.<br/><br/>",
