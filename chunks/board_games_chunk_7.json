        "description": "You and the other players work at Loop Incorporated, the most prestigious time travel agency in the world. Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. It&rsquo;s a mismanaged, third-tier agency owned by the slick Mr. Loop, who cares more about making a buck than making sure the delicate weave of the time-space continuum stays tight and safe. For you and your coworkers, it&rsquo;s as good as job as any, and if you time things just right you may even get a nice bonus at the end of the day. And since you have a time machine, you can take multiple cracks at it&hellip; assuming things don&rsquo;t get too chaotic with your past selves running around.<br/><br/>Loop Inc. is played over the course of three days, with each day actually being the same day, but a different time through it. During the first day, players will get to perform three actions and send out their one time machine. Actions include gathering components, setting up advertising, and more. Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key. At the end of the third day, the player who completed the most profitable trips wins, provided they didn&rsquo;t cause too many tears in the space time continuum.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Iberian Rails is a share-holding train game in which players employ services of characters, some more reputable than others.<br/><br/>Each round, the players select their characters using an original character-row mechanism, then the railway companies take their turns. The player with the most share/s in a railway company (the CEO) controls said company, directing the company to do one of the following on its turn: build track/s; openly sell a share, and then trigger its dividend payout; and secretly sell a share, and then trigger its dividend payout.<br/><br/>Each of the railway companies has a limited number of shares (ranging from 3 to 6), limiting its potential number of  dividend payouts during the game. If a company prematurely triggers a dividend payout before exhausting its coffer to maximize city connections, then said company and its shareholders get paid less but sooner. This compromises the long term growth of the company, but may assist an investor in having enough cash in hand to invest in another company. However, things aren&rsquo;t so simple; the characters may have something to say about these well-defined plans!<br/><br/>The six railway companies have different strengths and weaknesses. Some start next to many cities. Some start next to tourist cities. Invest in a company with fewer shares and get return on one&rsquo;s investment faster. However, companies with more shares generally grow for longer. But the Engineer, the Mafia, the Bureaucrat, the Inspector, the Banker, the Ghost, the Construction Mech, the Hotelier, and the Venture Capitalist might make this generality less exact. By the way, the CEO of Ride with Cervantes selects his character first in the first round of the game.<br/><br/>The game is set in Spain. The map has 42 cities, fourteen of which are tourist cities.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a double dividend is paid out for all the shares, and the investor with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Barracks Emperors is a strategy card game set against the backdrop of the Roman Crisis of the Third Century, during which at least 45 different men made a claim to the throne of the Roman Empire.  In this game, 1-4 players represent prominent political factions attempting to gain control over the men who would be Emperors of Rome.  Players deploy the influence available to them (represented by the cards in their hands) to claim imperial reigns (represented by the historical Emperor cards arrayed on the board.)   But they must be very careful, because politics is a complex game, and sometimes attempting to exert your influence necessitates aiding someone else in their own plots.  Play your cards cleverly to capture Emperors and score the most points to win.<br/><br/>At its heart, The Barracks Emperors is a trick-taking game, but not one like you&rsquo;ve ever seen before. In this innovative design, all 13 tricks are available for play simultaneously, in an interlocking grid that forces you to balance the value of every card you play against the value that same card may have for another player on a different trick.  Plus, every card grants you an additional special ability that you might be able to use to spring a surprise on your unwitting opponents.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>Historical emperors, co-emperors, pretenders, and even Gallic Emperors who broke away from Rome during the Crisis of the Third Century are all represented as individual cards in the game, each with interesting facts about the rise and demise of the man depicted.<br/><br/>For fans of Time of Crisis: The Roman Empire in Turmoil, 235-284 AD and Time of Crisis: The Age of Iron and Rust, you will find some of the concepts and flavor from that deck-building wargame, adapted in this all new standalone game.  You don&rsquo;t need Time of Crisis to play The Barracks Emperors, but you&rsquo;ll recognize Influence Cards such as Praetorian Guard, Foederati, and Pretender, now used in an entirely new way.<br/><br/>An innovative card drafting mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy to how you play your cards while also mitigating the luck that would come with being dealt a full hand of cards at the start of each round.<br/><br/>This game is designed for 4 players, but also includes options for 2 or 3 players, plus an easy-to-play solitaire adaptation for the solo player.<br/><br/>",

Players simultaneously reveal two dungeon cards each and quickly put their hands on the cards they want their heroes to fight. If you win, you claim the card as loot or equipment that increases the abilities of your hero. Equipment cards are placed partly under your hero card, with the ability symbol sticking out. This way the four different types of abilities &mdash; Melee, Ranged, Magic and Stealth &mdash; are built up in one direction each, out from your hero.<br/><br/>For particularly strong monsters, your heroes can combine their power by hitting the monster with both your hands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arracourt is a Battalion Combat Series (BCS) game depicting the forlorn Axis counterattack to stop Patton&rsquo;s drive across France in September 1944 and the stellar example of mobile US Combined Arms that stopped that offensive dead in its tracks.<br/><br/>The rapid movement of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army eastward to Nancy has led them at the end of a supply net that is being re-allocated to put emphasis on the British in the north (which resulted in Operation Market Garden). The US 4th Armored Division in the lead performed a double envelopment of Nancy and is waiting for other elements to catch up.<br/><br/>For the German part, Hitler sees an opportunity to do two things simultaneously: To strike at the US spearhead stopping their advance and to try out his newly formed Panzer Brigades&mdash;complete with Panthers just off the assembly line but manned by crews fresh out of training.<br/><br/>The result was a classic defense studied by the US Army still today as the &ldquo;school solution&rdquo; of how to defeat an armored foe in a mobile set of battles.<br/><br/>Arracourt is a game of those battles with both sides using all the tools of mobile warfare with both sides maneuvering to attack and defend the ground of their choosing. The game is straightforward for the beginner BCS player and works very well as a starter kit before trying any of the others in the series yet is still challenging for the BCS veteran. All scenarios are on one (or less than one) map.<br/><br/>There are very few special rules to employ, well, except for dealing with Bazooka Charlie &hellip; a US L-4 artillery observation pilot who rigged his wings with bazooka launchers so he could go out daily and try to kill German tanks.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Arracourt Campaign (13 turns)<br/>     Saga of the Panzer Brigades (5 turns)<br/>     Battle of Lun&eacute;ville (Small) (2 turns)<br/>     Patton&rsquo;s Vanguard (12 turns)<br/>     Battle of Arracourt (Small) (4 turns)<br/>     Ghost Division (Small) (4 turns)<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Components:<br/><br/>        BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>        Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)<br/>        BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>        Arracourt game specific rulebook<br/>        Turn Record Track card<br/>        One 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; full color game map<br/>        352 5/8&rdquo; Counters (one unit sheet and one marker sheet)<br/>        Six scenarios, all one-map or less, and four are five turns or less<br/>        Box and dice<br/><br/><br/>(from MMP website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bobby Lee covers the eastern theater of the American Civil War around the Virginia area from 1861-1865.  It comes with a beautiful card-stock map of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Eastern Virginia and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Sam Grant so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>All artwork and graphics in the game Bobby Lee was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz.<br/><br/>",

It is similar to the latter, in which the purpose is to capture the enemy's flag after secretly placing your units; but here are included new graphics, board, components, and rules.<br/><br/>Stratego: Revised Edition has two rules sets: those of Classic Stratego; and the main ruleset including special movement and attack rules---new for most of the pieces.  All pieces' powers are printed in the rules and on the gameboard. The board is smaller (8 x 10 vs. 10 x 10), and there are fewer pieces (30 vs. 40) than in Stratego.<br/><br/>This edition is set in a fantasy realm with pieces such as Dragons, Dwarves, and Elves replacing the traditional Napoleonic soldiers and theme of Classic Stratego.  One player is the Fire (Red) Army from Volcandria, and the other player is the Ice (Blue) Army from Everwinter (hence, the game's nickname Stratego: Fire &amp; Ice).<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Stratego<br/><br/><br/>",

This is a two-player game (although teams or even solitaire play would be just fine): one player assumes the role of the Axis (Germany and its allies) and the other player assumes the role of the Soviets (i.e., the Soviet Union).<br/><br/>The individual ground units represent Divisions of 10-15,000 soldiers, Corps (from the Latin word &quot;Corpus,&quot; meaning body) of approximately 25-50,000 soldiers, or Armies of approximately 75,000 or more men. The Soviet ground units are mostly armies of approximately 40,000 men each, with a few cavalry and airborne corps of about 10,000 men each.<br/><br/>Air units represent about 200 combat aircraft early in the war, and gradually more as the war progresses. Each hex on the map represents 30 miles of actual terrain from side to side, and each Game Turn represents the passage of 7.5 days (or up to 15 days during inclement weather).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 1941 -- the German juggernaut rolls over the Soviet Army. As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;<br/><br/>Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks.

The cards represent 4 different types of valuable goods and caravan handlers.<br/><br/>Gold is collected along the path and at the midpoint of the game and the end (when the first player reaches Kantschou and then Daidu). The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round, all players start together again at Kantschou. The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.<br/><br/>Play is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space (e.g. one of each good or 3 cards the same colour). Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one player's move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn, a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand.<br/><br/>The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Standard is more expensive and more efficient, while narrow gauge is cheaper and rather inefficient. These rectangular track tiles are laid across adjacent hexsides, and all companies are able to utilize a shared track network provided they are connected to it. Different types of track will of course call for different types of trains. Stock purchases put funds in the company coffers, and the company uses this money to pay for track. Trains, on the other hand, are paid for in stock value itself. Those trains can also be &quot;rusted&quot; by the purchase of newer models. Companies can also &quot;token&quot; station spaces on the map, increasing their routes while potentially blocking access for rivals. These, too, are paid for in stock value, by decreasing that value by an entire row in the game's capricious two-dimensional stock market.<br/><br/>This is not only a game, but a game system played on multiple maps. Each map has unique twists, and a set of companies with unique asymmetric abilities. This base set gets the party started with two maps. Portugal is intended as an introduction to the system, but asks players to contend with difficult mountainous terrain. The challenging Detroit map, set in part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, finds players taking on debt to keep underfunded railroads afloat, all with an eye toward reaching Chicago and its double-route bonus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Without taking turns, players race to empty their hands by matching the color, shape, or number of symbols on their cards in hand to the top card of the two discard piles in the center of the table. As soon as a player lays down one card, they can draw another, up to the hand size of three cards. If both players can't play, they can both draw a card directly onto the discard pile at the same time and then continue play. The first player to empty their hand and draw pile wins.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes variants for three- and four-player games.<br/><br/>Blink: Bible Edition is the same game with Christian faith icons.<br/><br/>",

It comes in a beautiful metal box and features two new items, the barrel and the fez. While the basic Geistesblitz rules still apply, the fez can be placed over any of the other items. It is a new challenge to know which item is hidden underneath the fez at all times.<br/><br/>Balduin, the house ghost, found an old camera in the castle cellar. Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting&thinsp; &ndash; including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...<br/><br/>The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Duuuszki: Edycja limitowana, five items sit on the table waiting to be caught. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?<br/><br/>If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.<br/>If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue barrel.<br/>The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>The new key feature is now the fez. Fez is used to cover one of the other elements. When the players are obliged the catch the fez they instead say the name of an item under the fez. When the players are obliged the catch the item under the fez, they instead catch the fez to show the item that was covered. Whenever fez is caught the player holding it may cover the same or new item.<br/><br/>",

You want to meet the needs of each client &mdash; tourists, commuters, local university students, the elderly, and parents with children &mdash; while also considering congestion and traffic conditions. Who can create the bus route that pleases the most passengers?<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts 24 rounds, with you being the start player for half of those rounds. On a turn as the start player, you roll the six white dice in the game, then choose three of them, with the other player taking one of the remaining three dice. With the die results, you mark spots on the game board with an erasable pen to extend your bus route and pick up and drop off passengers. With bonuses, you can re-roll dice or roll an extra black die. After deducting traffic (and other) penalties, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game includes two maps: On the City Map, you must be mindful of the river as its bridges restrict your course at various points of the map. On the Mars Map, you can warp from one corner of the map to one of the other three corners, continuing your route across vast distances!<br/><br/>Let's Make a Bus Route: The Dice Game includes a solo mode that features mostly the same rules. The challenge is that you play the game twice on the same map with different colored markers, and re-using the same road in the second game causes traffic and negative points. How well can keep the routes separate to cover ground and make the most happy customers.<br/><br/>",

The card shows ratings for movement and attacks, plus a special ability. The game can be played on any flat surface, although a four-foot-square table is recommended. Players place everyday objects on the table to act as terrain.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player activates a character. He may then move and attack by flicking the corresponding disc. A moving disc that hits terrain suffers no damage, but hitting other discs causes one damage to the active character. An attacking disc suffers a point of damage if it hits terrain and causes a point of damage to another character if it hits its disc. Knocking a disc into terrain or off the table inflicts an additional point of damage. A character is eliminated when it takes five points of damage. A character's ratings determine how many times it can move and attack each time it is activated. Optional item cards, if used, can be acquired during play and provide additional actions.<br/><br/>Disc Duelers includes several play options, including classic elimination, point capture (points scored for eliminating a character, but that character returns to action), soccer or volleyball with a neutral disc representing the ball, and a race.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Yak, the village elder has given you (and others) the task of constructing a great stone tower to guide the merchants and their yaks in the Himalayas. Each turn, a yak pulls its cart into your village. Will you find stones for your tower, or food for your reserves? Or will you need to visit the market to find what you need?<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, each player builds their own stone tower by acquiring stones from visiting merchants. You start the game with one good of each type (meat, milk, bread) and three cards in hand: build, restock, and market. Three or four carts being pulled by yaks start on the game board, with each player having one cart in front of them and each cart containing three stones and some food. Each cart has a restriction on it, e.g., &quot;no bread&quot; because its yak is gluten intolerant.<br/><br/>On a turn, all players choose a card in hand simultaneously and place it face-down. Starting with whoever holds the baby yak token, players then take their turns in order by revealing their card. If you played:<br/><br/><br/>    Build: Spend 1-5 food tokens, placing them in the cart in front of you, to buy 1-3 stones from that cart. You must follow the restriction on that cart. (No meat for the vegetarian yak, please!) If you acquire crystal stones, you must pay one extra food for each such stone. Place the stones in your tower, with all stones after your first needing to touch. Your tower is at most five stones wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Restock: Take all the food of one type from the cart in front of you and add it to your reserves up to your limit of eight items of food. Then draw a stone from the quarry bag and place it in the cart. (A cart can hold at most four stones.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Market: Take two food items of your choice from the market, which starts with two foods of each type and which is refilled only when a cart exceeds its nine-food limit during a build action. Then draw three stones from the bag, place one in a cart of your choice, then return the other two to the bag.<br/><br/><br/>Stones come in eight colors, with eight of each in the bag. Eight crystal stones are also in the bag, along with five fog stones. Whenever fog stones are drawn, all players reverse the direction of all the carts, then the active player sets the fog aside and draws replacement stones, with carts reversing again should fog be drawn anew. Once the right number of non-fog stones have been drawn, place the fog stones on the mountain track. This track will be filled twice during the game, after which only a single fog will remain in the bag.<br/><br/>To end a round, return your chosen card to your hand, move the yak carts one space in the direction they face, then pass the baby yak clockwise. Continue playing rounds until someone completes the fourth level of their tower. Complete that round, play one additional round, then score the towers. A crystal stone can be a color of your choice, but each crystal in your tower must be a different color. You score points (1) for each group of two or more stones (e.g., a group of six is worth 16 points), (2) for the number of groups of at least two or more stones, (3) for individual stones (only 1 point each), (4) for triggering the end of the game, and (5) for having the most remaining food.<br/><br/>For an additional challenge, play Yak with the &quot;master builder&quot; variant. Reveal three of the eight objective cards at the start of play. By having the most non-crystal stones of a color or placing them in certain locations in your tower, you score additional points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game the players are ancient gods that are trying to make their chosen tribes prosper and conquer the land. The twist is that the gods/players don't know all their chosen tribes at the beginning of the game, these are given to them only every other round.<br/><br/>There are 24 different tribes which start on predefined spaces on the board. These tribes are divided into four different levels and have as many counters on the board at the beginning of the game as their level indicates (1, 2, 3 or 4 tokens).<br/><br/>The biggest part of the game are the battles between the tribes. The funny part is that the players are not restricted to use their tribes in the fighting, they can make other tribes fight among themselves.<br/><br/>If you read French, check out the link to the official web site in the links section.<br/><br/>",

Gunslingers can go searching for wanted outlaws in the badlands or take on jobs to escort stagecoaches or deal with a gang of Desperados.

To win the game, you just need to start your turn with exactly 10 cards in your hand but if you think that'll be easy, you're wrong (wronger than a duck wearing shoes- and that's pretty damn wrong).<br/><br/>Players draw a card on their turn and can choose to &quot;place&quot; up to three trap cards out of their hand. As a second part of their turn they either pick up one card or play one action card, which are all unique and can have wide-ranging consequences on the other players or game as a whole<br/><br/>The game ends when a player wins when someone starts their turn holding exactly 10 cards.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a hilarious and unpredictable game, I hear Cards Against Humanity is pretty fun!

At the beginning of the game, everyone makes an ambiguous clay sculpture called a Cluzzle. For the rest of the game, players ask &ldquo;Yes or No&rdquo; questions to figure out the other clay puzzles.<br/><br/>You don&rsquo;t have to be an artist to play. In fact, the longer it takes others to figure out your clay sculpture, the more points you get. However, you only get points if at least one person figures out your Cluzzle before the end of the game. This means you&rsquo;ll want your sculpture to be a little ambiguous, but not too ambiguous.<br/><br/>And this is exactly where the humor lies! The result is a hilarious game for all ages, where anyone can win and everyone will have fun. So grab your friends and family. Your ridiculously poor sculptures will inspire laughter that will be remembered for years to come!<br/><br/>Did you know that Alanis Morissette, Alan Moon, Stephen Glenn, Tom Vasel, and others created personalized Cluzzle Cards for the game? You can learn why the objects they chose are personal to them on the North Star Games website.<br/><br/>Cluzzle was modeled after a 1988 Klaus Teuber game called Barbarossa.

        "description": "One of Avalon Hill's family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!<br/><br/><br/>This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.<br/><br/>Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.<br/><br/>Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.<br/><br/>Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &ldquo;comic book&rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are spellbound. As a novice mage leaving the tower for the first time, you thought you were invincible. Taking on evil Baba Yaga the witch was, perhaps, not a good idea. Her hands became a blur, her mouth moved and her spell hit you between the eyes. It was two days before you woke up, four days before you could speak, and seven days before you remembered your name. No whisky was even involved. Some parts of your body have been enlarged &ndash; and some shrunk. Shoes are going to be expensive for sometime. The less said about your nose, the better. It is now time to take matters into your own (now quite large) hands.<br/><br/>The Spell de Spiel is hidden in spellbooks scattered throughout the land. Find the books and cast the spell, and you can banish the witch and return to your normal size. However, watch out! The witch is powerful. Maybe the good creatures of the land will come to your aid. Centaurs may gallop, dragons may fly, and even the crusty old librarian could research some dusty tomes. Vampires, for once, are keen to get their teeth into the action. Even the truculent dwarves might arrive in time to help (with their small-man syndrome axes). You need to act now. The witch grows ever stronger. Skeletons and goblin spider-riders are not traditionally known for their sense of humor. Can you recover the spellbooks, defeat the Witch and her allies, and have bards sing your praises for evermore?<br/><br/>It is a time for justice, a time for change, a time for heroes. With big feet. And big noses. Spellbound &ndash; the story is yours for the telling...<br/><br/>Spellbound, a co-operative, deck-building game playable in one hour for 1-4 players, is Fragor Games' Spiel 2012 release with 1,000 copies available. (Note: This game is an English language edition due to some of the cards having English text. German rules will be made available with card translations.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. 2: Airborne Over Europe is the second game in Mike Denson&rsquo;s Last Hundred Yards series. It includes two major campaigns featuring numerous missions covering small unit actions conducted by US airborne forces in the Normandy and Market Garden operations.<br/> In the Operation Overlord campaign, follow the elements of the American 82nd and 101st Divisions beyond the Normandy beachheads. After being scattered over a large area in Normandy on the night of June 6th, they struggle to assemble and secure their objectives to support the advance of the American units landing at Utah Beach. Later missions feature them defending against the inevitable German reaction and counterattack. Follow Lt. Dick Winters as he leads his platoon in taking out the artillery battery at Brecourt Manor near Ste. Marie-du-Mont and then faces a counterattack from elements of Col. Von Der Heydte&rsquo;s 6th Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment.<br/><br/>In the Operation Market Garden campaign, follow the 82nd Airborne Division after landing south of Nijmegen in the early afternoon hours of September 17th as they race to secure critical bridges over the Waal and Maas rivers, as well as those over the canal between them. Follow Lt. Foley and his men as they defend Devil&rsquo;s Hill against German counterattacks on the Eiesenborne Ridge Groesbeek Heights, a mere 2-3 miles from the German Border.<br/><br/>While the 82nd lands around Nijmegen, the 101st Airborne Division lands north of Eindhoven and begins its own race to secure its assigned bridges over the river Dommel in Eindhoven, the Wilhelmina canal in Son and Best, and the bridges over the Zuid-Willemsvaart and river AA in Veghel. Experience the counterattack by the German Kampfgruppes H&uuml;ber and Walther as they cut the main highway near Veghel. It took two critical days of hard fighting for units of 101stAirborne and British XXX Corp to reopen the corridor.<br/><br/>This game will introduce airdrop and night rules, as well as new terrain to the series. Successfully landing airborne troops at night, assembling them from a dispersed condition, and advancing against unknown enemy resistance to secure your objectives will prove a thrilling challenge in this new game.<br/><br/>Note: This game is a stand alone game.

        "description": "Another of Reiner Knizia's fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.<br/><br/>The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.<br/><br/>Note to reviewer: There is no difference, except for colour, between the 3 different commodities in the original 1996 Palmyra.  Because the 3 stocks are very different in game play in the newer Buy Low Sell High game, the newer game should have a separate listing from Palmyra.  It is effectively a different edition 2 game.<br/><br/>",

Players are limited by the order in which their cards are dealt and the order of the monsters in the dungeon, so a strong strategy is required to win.<br/><br/>Puzzle Dungeon features twenty double-faced monster cards. The front of each monster card features an average monster of that type: a vampire, a goblin, or haunted armor. The back of each monster card depicts that monster as a monster king. There are four of each type of monster. When the third monster of a type is defeated, the fourth is flipped over to the monster king.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/> Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

One player assumes the role of King (or Queen), while the others represent the great Lords and Ladies of the Houses of Westeros. Some are loyalists who want order in the realm, others are conspirators who seek to undermine the throne, and all of them have a secret agenda of their own. Who is truly loyal, and who is simply hungry for power, honor, and coin? It's up to the King to figure it out before it's too late.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts seven rounds. In each round, players reveal a number of mission cards, each of which has an associated influence type: crowns, ravens, or swords. Each noble plays influence cards face down to one or more missions and places their House Sigil at the mission where they played the most cards. Then each mission is resolved by shuffling the influence cards there and tallying up successes and failures. If a mission succeeds, Order is generated; otherwise Chaos is generated. Nobles earn rewards (coin, honor, power) based on whether the mission with their House Sigil succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>The King can play decree cards during the game to grant favor to nobles who seem loyal, or cast suspicion on suspected conspirators. Decree cards award Order if the King was correct and Chaos if the King was wrong.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, if Order exceeds Chaos, the King wins and any loyalists who achieved their personal ambitions win. If Chaos has the edge, then any conspirators who achieved their personal ambitions win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The use of various symbols and devices to signify individuals and groups dates to the age of antiquity. Warriors often decorated their shields with patterns and mythological creatures.<br/><br/>Heraldry refers to the design, display and study of armorial bearings, a shield used to identify a person or family. The concepts and systems of regular heraldic designs were developed by heraldic officers between 1000 AD and 1300 AD during a period known as the High Middle Ages.<br/><br/>Originally conceived to assist with identification in battle, the beauty and intricacy of various heraldic designs meant that they survived the abandonment of armor on the battlefield and preserved the honor of the family line. To this day, we still see their use by individuals, organizations, corporations, towns, cities, and regions.<br/><br/>To blazon arms means to describe them in the language of Heraldry, which has its own vocabulary, syntax and grammar based strongly on an anglicized version of Norman French.<br/><br/>A game of Blazon allows you to act as a herald, designing your own heraldic shield by acquiring elements, placing them on your Shield board, and earning distinctions through careful choices.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>Players score Prestige by placing Element cards on their Shield board. Players can score bonus Prestige by earning distinctions for their shields. The player with the most Prestige at the end of the game wins and is crowned the King of Arms.<br/><br/>Playing Blazon<br/>Blazon is played in sequential turns. On your turn, you must take either an Acquire action OR a Blazon action.<br/><br/>If performing the Acquire action, you may draw two Element cards from either the Tincture deck, Device deck, or one from each. You may keep both of these cards or exchange one (or both) for cards from the face-up display.<br/><br/>Performing the Blazon action allows you to place Element cards from your hand onto your Shield board. You choose which card to place, ensuring that you meet the matching Device or Tincture requirement on your Shield board. To place a card, you must discard any number of cards from your hand, the combined Prestige Value of which equals or exceeds the Prestige Value of the Element card that you wish to place on your Shield board.<br/><br/>Herald Actions<br/>Once per turn, at any time during your turn, regardless of which action was taken, you may discard one of your Herald tokens to take any one of the following Herald actions: Discard and refresh the display, Take any single card from the display, Place an Element card of any value on your shield for the cost of 1, or Take the top card from the Tincture or Device discard pile.<br/><br/>End of Game<br/>The end game is triggered immediately when any one of the following happen:<br/>&bull; A player lands on or passes 50 Prestige on their Prestige track.<br/>&bull; A player fills every space on their Shield board.<br/>&bull; A player claims their final Distinction award.<br/><br/>",

You and your Heroes can easily disrupt these Rituals, costing you only your precious, valuable time...but ignoring them may close off your last path to the outside world, and the last light your people will ever see.<br/><br/>Tread carefully and work together to reclaim the FIRE OF EIDOLON<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over seventy years later, and the divisions still run deeper than the straits which separate the Republic of China (the ROC) from the People's Republic of China (the PRC). Times have changed greatly since the PRC failed to conquer the island of Taiwan from the nationalists' Republic of China at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the states that were even then separated by politics and economics have grown further apart as both sides now hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.<br/><br/>Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist leadership of the PRC have decided that its time to end its rhetoric and posturing and bring the long-lost democratically governed ROC island into the fold of the Socialist Harmonious Society.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tUnitsGround units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the PRC and ROC and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/>Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include<br/><br/>     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan<br/>     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict<br/>     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport<br/>     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMaps and TerrainThe game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame SystemA game turn is generally composed of:<br/><br/>Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.<br/><br/>Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.<br/><br/>Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.<br/><br/>One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns<br/><br/>Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements<br/>Victory Determination<br/><br/>Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.<br/><br/>The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.<br/><br/>There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan – The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.<br/><br/>In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the long separated island in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on?

You start with a hand of three cards, so add the card you drew to your hand, and then choose one card to play, following the directions written on your chosen card.<br/><br/>As cards are drawn and played from the deck, the rules of the game change from how many cards are drawn, played or even how many cards you can hold at the end of your turn. No one can win until a Goal card sets the conditions for winning, which is typically collecting certain Keeper cards in front of you. Goals can keep changing, though, so you never know for sure how to win.<br/><br/>With Adventure Time Fluxx, you get to join Jake the dog and Finn the human for some ever-changing fun. Draw a card, Play a card, and change the Rules. Get Mathematical against Candy Zombies, visit the City of Thieves to steal from your friends, and maybe, if things work out just right, you might even get to Floop the Pig!<br/><br/>",

Do you choose Montgomery&rsquo;s historical &lsquo;Husky&rsquo; plan, Patton&rsquo;s alternate plan, or a hybrid plan of your own?<br/><br/>In this game you will find a few new unit and asset types, and also new challenges for both sides. For the attacker, the challenge is the tough Sicilian terrain; and for the defenders, it&rsquo;s the worsening Italian morale.<br/><br/>Each victory area and functioning port that the Allies secure adds a &lsquo;Fading Italian Morale&rsquo; Event Chit into the selection cup, and as each of those are drawn, worsening effects on Italian units are felt along the entire front.<br/><br/>If one side has not secured an automatic victory by the end of turn 9, the Axis player receives bonuses, both for German units that have exited off the island through Messina and also for areas on Sicily that are still Axis-controlled, so there is pressure on both sides to fight for every area.<br/><br/>Event Chits include:<br/><br/><br/>     Replacements<br/>     Fading Italian Morale,<br/>     the Patton Soldier Slap, and<br/>     flanking battalion-sized invasions.<br/><br/><br/>",

The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>During your turn you can choose to do one thing:<br/>From a common pool of freight cars, you choose 3 cars to add to your trains, matching types, or placing them in your own holding yard. <br/>Pull 1 to 4 cars from your holding yard and add them to your trains (matching type) <br/>Add another Locomotive and another opportunity to score.

        "description": "Saboteur: The Lost Mines is a board game inspired by the famous Saboteur card game. While it uses ideas of the basic game, the expansion, and the two-player game, it is also very different.<br/><br/>In this game, players are divided in two clans; each clan contains loyal dwarves, selfish dwarves, and a saboteur, secretly working for the opposite clan. Players have their own pawn, and the dwarves must move over the paths in order to physically reach the four goal cards, one of which contains a sleeping dragon that you don't want to wake, so try to avoid that one, if possible. The (non-dragon) goal cards yield a variable number of points, depending on the displayed, but secret, treasure cards.<br/><br/>Sabotage isn't performed against a specific player, but directly on the board by playing blocking path cards or adding tokens. In this way, the sabotage affects always all players, including yourself. As opposed to Saboteur: The Duel, path cards you play don't have to be linked to your own start card, which offers many more sabotage options. Even so, no player is ever out of the game, either temporarily or permanently.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In Posthuman, you journeyed to the last bastion of organized human society in the area: The Fortress. A year down the line, you have become an active part of that society and honed the skills you need to fulfill your role there, but the mutants are gaining ground...<br/><br/>Posthuman Saga is a standalone survival game in the Posthuman universe. You play a seasoned member of the Fortress' militia, sent out beyond the defensive perimeter to explore and hopefully reconnect with outposts the Fortress has lost touch with, while searching for scavengable sites along the way. You have to forge across a crumbled land where resources are spare and mutants roam the ruined mansions and forests alike.<br/><br/>Like the initial Posthuman, this is a sandbox-style survival journey, but the game system in Posthuman Saga differs from that of the first game in the series. Players win by  completing various objectives that suit different characters and playing styles. It has an emphasis on tactical choices on two levels: the journey expressed through an innovative modular tile map puzzle and the individual  story and combat encounters. The latter are fast, card-based affairs involving tough choices with future consequences. Posthuman Saga boasts over one hundred, finely crafted story scenes with a simple, push-your-luck mechanism that supplements the emergent narrative afforded by the game. Mutation is a way of life in the Posthuman world, and it can have its advantages, but it can easily get out of control...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: villagers and werewolves. The villagers don't know who the werewolves are, and the werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the villagers one at a time. A moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game. The game takes place over a series of days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the villagers or all the werewolves are eliminated.<br/><br/>Ultimate Werewolf Legacy uses gameplay similar to Ultimate Werewolf, but you no longer have single standalone games as players and the village itself have attributes that are retained between games, with events that take place in the first games having effects that ripple through remaining games. Make a bad decision early on, and it can haunt the village for years to come! Players can earn titles, which provides them with special abilities in future games, regardless of their role. Players are each given a public family card in addition to their secret role card, and they team up with the other members of their family to work together...unless one or more of their family members is secretly working against them.<br/><br/>As for the village, there are multiple paths that the game may take, and as a result the experience you have playing through the entire game will differ from someone else who is playing with another set of people. This also allows players to play through the campaign multiple times, with a different set of roles, rules, and environments each time.<br/><br/>At the center of Ultimate Werewolf Legacy is an oversized, 80+ page diary, that walks the game moderator through every session. The diary has been designed so that players with no previous Werewolf playing experience can both play and moderate. The diary is structured into five distinct chapters with three game sessions in each chapter, as well as an introductory preface game session. Players can jump in and out for individual sessions, but ideally they'll play all the sessions in a chapter. Each chapter can be played in a single evening. At the end of the sixteen-game session campaign, the diary will be a record of exactly what happened in your village, and who was ultimately responsible for what it became over time.<br/><br/>Replay packs that contain a new diary and an additional set of family cards will be sold separately, allowing players to play through the entire campaign again.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you roll four dice up to three times, putting aside any dice you want to save. If you combine a &quot;hit&quot; with a symbol on a desperado, you rotate that desperado disc, moving him one step closer to freedom. Each desperado requires a different number of steps to reach freedom, and once free, when you hit that same desperado, he now robs money from the other players.<br/><br/>Certain dice combinations allow you to draw multiple bonus cards and choose one or two that you like, and if you skunk out and don't do anything else, you take the top card as compensation. The cards let you take special bonus actions like not paying opponents and using symbols in different ways.<br/><br/>Win by freeing all of your desperadoes before anyone else or by being the last one in the game.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when the last monument is complete, at which point the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are two types of turns, with no rounds or phases. On a player's turn, they must either charge their transmutation device and program it openly, or use its energy to take as many actions as they have already programmed. Information is open, and the only luck is in the shuffling of tiles to set up the game. Player choices determine how the game unfolds.<br/><br/>The game features unlockable unique player powers, a board that players construct differently each game, and 5 ways to build your engine. You will be encouraged to plan ahead, but required to adapt your strategy in order to come away victorious.<br/><br/>",

One day, a number of derelict robots suddenly recharge and appear to be operating outside their original programming! As the leading scientists in robot technology, you are tasked with directing the planet defenders to catch the derelict robots.<br/><br/>In Planet Defenders, players pay batteries to control the three planet defenders, moving them among the planets and collecting energies. Players can enhance their actions by spending energies or batteries to upgrade their technology. They earn research points (RP) by catching derelict robots and collecting technology cards.<br/><br/>When the robots from two different areas are depleted, complete the current round so that all players have an equal number of turns. At that point, the player with the highest RP wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Garolium Scraggart, beloved ruler of the people, has died. Despite an upbringing of real hardship she rose to the highest rank in the royal court and did what she could to make sure the poorest in Brighthelm were not&nbsp;forgotten. She died too young, her work half done.<br/><br/>A tournament has been announced to find her successor. Brave knights have travelled down royal highways. Bold paladins have knocked on royal doors. So too have bards, lords and heroes. All looking to take over Scraggart&rsquo;s reign and rule the realm to their desires.<br/><br/>And every one of them has been sent back to whence they came.<br/><br/>Because Garolium herself had devised the tournament. It was the last thing she did, and she decreed it would only be open to those of the most limited means. Those whose potential had been locked by the chains of ill-fortune and poverty. Brighthelm's paupers. She had spent her whole life building their ladder and nobody was going to kick it away.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Play a pauper in Garolium's tournament. Along with your bird companion, explore the wild and treacherous land of Brighthelm as you strive to learn three of the five virtues: generosity, fellowship, bravery, knowledge, and magnificence. Battle a bestiary of creatures, undertake quests, find ingredients to craft powerful recipes, and discover the sights and wonders of an exciting new world along the way. But beware! You're not the only pauper in town...<br/><br/>In Paupers' Ladder, the land of Brighthelm is illustrated with a playing board and over 400 cards depicting equipment, quests, recipes, monsters, ingredients, encounters, cities, villages and more besides.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>The aim of Paupers&rsquo; Ladder is to learn any 3 of the 5 Virtues. Virtues are learned in different ways. For instance, you learn the Virtue of generosity by discarding a certain amount of gems from your purse. When a player has learned 3 Virtues, they have won the game.<br/><br/>You control 2 characters: your Pauper, and their Bird companion.<br/><br/>&bull; PAUPER<br/>There are 8 different Paupers to choose from, and each has their own unique piece of starting equipment. Your Pauper&rsquo;s character card is where you&rsquo;ll keep track of your progress towards learning Virtues.<br/><br/>&bull; BIRD<br/>There are 4 different Birds to choose from. Birds start the game untrained. You can pay to train your Bird to learn a unique ability.<br/><br/>PLAYING YOUR TURN<br/><br/>On your turn you use both your Pauper and your Bird, in either order. Each character may move from the Region they occupy into any adjoining Region, or stay where they are. Paupers&rsquo; can pay to travel extra Regions. Your character now explores the Region they occupy.<br/><br/>When a Region is explored, you choose to either:<br/><br/>&bull; Play a card that&rsquo;s already in that Region by following the instructions on it.<br/><br/>&bull; Draw a card from the top of that Region&rsquo;s deck, place it there and follow its instructions.<br/><br/>The Region card you play will be one of the following:<br/><br/>&bull; EVENT<br/>Events include things like friendly citizens, equipment and villages.<br/><br/>&bull; HAZARDS<br/>Hazards are creatures and traps that must be fought.<br/><br/>&bull; INGREDIENTS<br/>Ingredients are used by your Pauper to learn recipes.<br/><br/>When you have moved and explored with both your Pauper and your Bird, play continues to the next player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your friends have decided to journey to the Antarctic harbor of Neko in hopes of seeing the cute penguins living in the backdrop of the stunning glacier landscape. To get to Neko smoothly, you each try map out the stops along your journey in order to see the most penguins. Your chances improve the farther your ships travel, the more harbours you visit, and the more goods you deliver. But avoid doing things that interfere with the Antarctica ecology and cause the penguins to move away!  Will you be the one that sees the most penguins?<br/><br/>A Pleasant Journey to Neko is a dice strategy game for 2-4 players. The game plays in four rounds across two periods, each with a mid-game scoring phase. In each round, players roll and draft their dice, which are used to exchange resources, activate existing card abilities, or bid on more cards.  Players can also take a number of free actions, including exchanging resources, adjusting their dice, buying and moving ships, and opening harbors to build more ship lanes.<br/><br/>Try to plan ahead by building ship lanes that create custom hubs!  These spaces give you additional locations to trigger powerful new actions.  But don&rsquo;t forget about advancing your ships too!  Not only do they score you points, but they can combo with the dice in the hubs you have created.<br/><br/>A Pleasant Journey to Neko has a unique dice drafting mechanism and card laying system. Over a hundred card combinations exist, making each game different and surprising. Also, don&rsquo;t forget about the advance mode, where you will face more challenges on  your way to Neko. Are you ready to go see the penguins?  We wish you a pleasant journey to Neko!<br/><br/>",

Will you finally discover the creatures who hide in the forest shadows?<br/><br/>Shadows in the Forest is a thrilling, immersive play experience that brings a distinctive twist to game night - you play it in the dark! One player moves the lantern around in search of Shadowlings, mysterious creatures who avoid the light. The lantern illuminates the forest and trees, casting real shadows on the game board. The rest of the players work together, strategically moving their Shadowlings to stay out of the light in this innovative board game for kids and families.<br/><br/>If one of the Shadowlings is hit by a beam of light, he is enchanted and can no longer move. The other Shadowlings will try to free him again. To do this, they have to wait until the light has moved far enough away so that another dwarf can reach him in the shadows.<br/><br/>The Shadowlings all want to meet under a tree while the lantern tries to cast a spell on all of them.

        "description": "Chancellorsville 1863 is a card-driven game on the American Civil War Battle of Chancellorsville. Playable by 1 to 2 players in 1 hour, the game comes with a card-driven solitaire engine.  Designed by Maurice Suckling (designer of Freeman's Farm 1777), the game uses many of the concepts from that game.  However, added hidden movement, much more maneuver, and other design tweaks make this a truly unique game.<br/><br/>Each turn players will play 1 of their 3 in-hand formation cards to maneuver or attack enemy forces, gaining momentum cubes based on the formation activated.  Each formation is a Confederate division or Union corps.  Each formation card will allow a major and possibly an additional minor activation, major allowing two moves for a formation while the minor allows one move.  After each formation moves combat can occur if a move ends in a location with an enemy formation.  Tactic cards may be played during the formation's activation giving it movement or combat bonuses.<br/><br/>At the end of the formation card activation players may spend their momentum cubes to buy tactics cards which may give them benefits in combat or movement in future turns.<br/><br/>Players then draw a new formation card refilling their hands to 3.  Hooker, Lee, and Jackson have bonuses that can be played once a game, adding to movement and combat.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by destroying enemy formations through morale/strength loss, or the Union occupying the three victory locations which represent cutting off the Confederate army from Richmond.<br/><br/>Additional rules allow for fixed defensive positions, Jackson's Flank March -- and even his death.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple card game of cycle racing. Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).<br/><br/>One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.<br/><br/>If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.<br/><br/>You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.<br/><br/>The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.<br/><br/>Timing is everything if you plan to win.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players place these minions into one of four locations in the city. Minions grant the players special abilities on their own, but playing Minions of certain factions into certain cities grants the player additional abilities.<br/><br/>Players score points by acquiring Potions and Trinkets (which may also be used for additional abilities at the cost of points) and by placing Influence markers in the various Locations.<br/><br/>",

The problem with trying to study quarks is that you can&rsquo;t find just one quark; you need to find them in groups called hadrons, or some other exotic particles, like the Pentaquark.<br/><br/>In Pentaquark, you are trying to give science a little helping hand by collecting the five quarks that form this particle at the detector of a massive particle collider. Move cards you need to the detector, discard others so they may come back as anti-quarks, and try to minimize the number of quarks scattered and lost. If too many cards are removed from the game, the Pentaquark has slipped through undetected once again!<br/><br/>",

Winning the race does not win the game, however.  In addition to the payoffs for visiting each island (lower the more players who have visited it before you), money is also made on each turn when you roll your three dice and assign them as movement points to your opponents' ships.  The better &quot;salary&quot; offered, the more likely you are to attract the best dice rolls to your ships -- but then, you'll have spent more money.  And most money is what wins at the end of the game.  There is more than one balancing mechanism in play, with opportunities aplenty to hit the leader.  It's a lighthearted dice fest, but with interesting decisions and no obvious best strategy.<br/><br/>",

Pick-a-Seal will be launched in Essen 2014.<br/><br/>The nanuks are determined not to be sitting &quot;bears&quot; due to global warming. Sourcing a supply of canned fish may be a way to survive the diminishing sea ice &mdash; and if nothing else, it gives them a good reason to travel all the way from the North Pole to Germany to party down with their doggie friends there!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Polar Bear, first published as Formissimo, features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Dog but with two new variants! To set up the basic game, lay out 30 cards in a grid and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Polar Bear includes two game variants. In the first, the player who has obtained the most cards in the preceding round cannot grab a card that's identical to his top card in the current round. For the second variant, shuffle eight &quot;bonus round&quot; cards into the deck. If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card. The dealer then continues filling the grid. (If the grid contains fewer than ten cards when a bonus round card comes up in the deck, discard this card and continue to fill the grid.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players have to transport drums and load them on ships. For this, they have two workers, a large one and a smaller one, and a set of 5 cards for each worker to move them. There is a scale with counters (for each worker 1 counter) depicting which worker moves first, second and so on).<br/>                                                 <br/>In a turn, all players secretly choose one of the numbered cards from each of their card sets.<br/><br/>For the worker which is the first to move, the player revealed the appropriate card and moves his worker the amount of spaces as stated by his card. When one of the workers land on an occupied space, the (passive) worker is pushed to the opposite side of the warehouse. When this place is already occupied the (passive) worker won't move. The (active) worker will be moved back to the next unoccupied place.<br/>When all players have made their moves, the warehouses are checked if there is a worker next to a chamber. Players take as many drums in their colour as barrels in the room they are next to. The barrels are placed in one or more of the ships in the harbour (4 ships); players may decide freely.  <br/>                                                  <br/>When a worker is next to a room where broken barrels are, the player must take as many drums in his colour from any of the ships. When a worker is next to a room depicting also a silver coin, the player gets a silver piece from the common stock.<br/>Majorities with barrels on ships are important for scoring points. When a ship is fully loaded, or if it is the leftmost ship, loaded or not, it gets scored at the end of the round after which it is taken away (barrels/drums goes back to the players stock); the other ships move left accordingly and a new ship is taken from a blind stack of ships tiles.  <br/>There are scores for first, second and third positions (the latter in a game of 3 or 4 players) on the ship. <br/>For the next round the last worker (in play order) will become first worker (shifting the counter on the scale).<br/><br/>For three silver coins an extra worker for the current round can be bought, but this worker always must be the first to move in a round. This worker gets no penalty if his move ends near a room with broken barrels.<br/><br/>The configuration of the warehouse cards each game is different, as these are loose tiles. When the stack is depleted, the game ends.<br/> <br/>Game Summary<br/>The board shows a randomly ordered group of 7/8 (3er/4er) warehouses, each with 2 rooms containing 0-4 good barrels or 0-2 broken barrels, and 0-1 coin. This is surrounded by a looped movement path with stops in front of each storeroom. Players each have 2 dock workers (Big and Little) which start at opposite ends of the board (off the path initially), and 2 sets of movement cards numbered 1-5 (one set per worker). There are 4 piers, each with a random boat with room for 3 or more barrels. At the start, pier 1 has a &quot;pilot&quot; boat -- occupies space but cannot load goods. Finally, token movement order is set randomly at the beginning of the game: chits corresponding to all workers are placed in a row in random order.<br/><br/>Each round, players first have the option to pay 3 coins to hire Lazy Jack for this turn (if several want to hire him, priority goes to player with fewer VP). Place the Lazy Jack token with one of your workers. Then, everyone selects and simultaneously reveals a movement card for each worker. If you hired Lazy Jack, play an additional card of the same type (Big/Little) as whoever you placed Lazy Jack with. The workers than all move in token movement order, with Lazy Jack moving first. If they land on another worker, they shift that worker to the opposite side of the movement path, unless that space is already occupied; in that case, the moving worker moves backwards to the first empty space on the path.<br/><br/>After all tokens have moved, resolve the warehouses in order from one side of the board to the other. If a coin is present, take one from the bank. If there are good barrels in the storeroom, take as many from your stock and load them onto any boat(s). If you take the last open spot, score 1VP and the boat sails: players with barrels on board score VP based on majority (last place scores nothing; ties will score average of sum of ranks, rounding up). Immediately move other boats forward in the pier track, and place a new boat at the last pier. If there are broken barrels in the storeroom, remove as many of your barrels from the boats (exception: Lazy Jack does not unload).<br/><br/>If there are now 3 or fewer boats in the piers, the game will end -- score all boats and most VP wins.<br/><br/>If not, the boat at pier 1 scores, then sails away (immediately advance all boats and draw a new one). Finally, if you had dipped into the last 6 boats this turn, randomize the token movement order. Otherwise, the token last in movement order moves up to 1st position. Return Lazy Jack to supply, and start another round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.<br/><br/>Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.<br/><br/>The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.<br/><br/>The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with:<br/><br/>     Dia de los Muertos (2007)<br/><br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs.<br/><br/>At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry.<br/><br/>The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit.&quot;<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Aliens: This Time it's War is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive melees. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards.<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco, but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance.<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. No icons are used.<br/><br/>Aliens: This Time it's War can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     The Colonial Marine player wins if she manages to &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit&quot;.<br/>     The Colonial Marine player wins if she reaches and survives the Sulaco Loading Bay battle.<br/>     The Alien player wins if Ripley and all the Colonial Marines are either killed or cocooned.<br/><br/><br/>",

The aim is to find out who committed the murder, which weapon they used, and where in the mansion they did it. How do you solve the case? By careful questioning of your fellow players you can deduce which information is concealed in the crime envelope. The trick is to be clever with your questioning... Everyone develops their own system! <br/> This version of the game plays faster than older versions of Clue, with the help of bigger spaces on the board, special Red Cards, and a new layout of the mansion so you can walk between rooms. The bedroom has an ensuite, and you can wander from the kitchen straight into the dining room.<br/><br/>All new artwork brings this classic murder mystery to life, with a high level of detail.<br/><br/>It also comes with cool red dice!<br/><br/>Note: In this version of Clue, when playing with the 2-player/Team rules: before you deal the black Clue cards to the players, you take the top four black CLUE cards from the deck and place them face down in a row at the side of the board. When the other player/team cannot answer your question, you get to secretly look at one of the four cards at the side of the board.<br/><br/>You also don't use the Red Bonus cards in a 2-player/Team game.<br/><br/>",

You've heard the rumors of ancient runes and the lost pages of a scattered tome that tell of ancient and evil monstrosities, calling for their return. You've heard tales of those who came before you in this search losing grip on their sanity as they grew nearer to the truth. As you press on, you can't help but notice that you feel less attached to reality yourself. Some days you lose track of time and can't account for hours of the day. The whispers of secret gates to another world are growing  stronger, and while no one knows who is building them, you have a dreadful hunch...<br/><br/>Could you be the hidden architect of the Gates of Delirium?<br/><br/>In Gates of Delirium, players have a hand of split action cards: one side sane, and the other insane. Every round, one player decides whether the round is sane or insane, and all players must play that side of their cards. During sane rounds, players search for maps and lost pages to a secret tome, while assigning investigators to help them in their cause. During insane rounds, players collect ancient runes and work to build gates to release the monstrosities that their sane selves have been trying so hard to understand and prevent. Earn the most victory points by the time the last monstrosity is released to win Gates of Delirium.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Following on the success of No Retreat! Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.<br/><br/>This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.<br/><br/>To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/>But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?<br/><br/>Italian Front Scenario Listing<br/><br/>    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.<br/>    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.<br/>    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).<br/>    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.<br/>    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario. It also makes for an excellent fast-playing Tournament scenario.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 1 month per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 10 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Divisions<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>        One 17&quot;x22&quot; two-sided map<br/>        Two 17&quot;x22&quot; one-sided maps<br/>        47 Event cards and 8 Leader cards<br/>        One sheet of 88 round markers; 24 hex markers<br/>        One sheet of 88 two-sided square unit counters<br/>        Rulebook<br/>        Scenario Book<br/>        Player Aid Mat<br/>        Two 6-sided dic<br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Carl Paradis<br/>DEVELOPER: Jack Stalica<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler<br/>MAP ART &amp; RULEBOOK LAYOUT: Charles Kibler<br/><br/>",

        "description": "15,000 B.C. &ndash; a great ice age is ending. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the animal species.<br/><br/>Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.<br/><br/>Players will use six major animal classes &ndash; mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect &ndash; to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>All of this leads to the end game &ndash; the final descent of the ice age &ndash; where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...<br/><br/>Dominant Species: The Card Game consists of ten rounds of competition, each round occurring on ten of the twelve different Biome cards. The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.<br/><br/>Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.<br/> Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.<br/><br/>The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins. Play proceeds from Biome to Biome in like fashion until the game ends and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/>    Dominant Species<br/><br/><br/>",

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers. Following last year's smash hit of Drive on Paris, Al Wambold returns to show this under-represented battle in great detail, much of which, from original Dutch records...and, yes, Dutch researchers were used to confirm the accuracy of the map!<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 8 hours<br/>Hex: 0.6 miles / 1 Km<br/>Units: Platoon &amp; Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook<br/>One 16-page Fallschirmjaeger specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>",

Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.<br/><br/>Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Ted Raicer the award-winning designer of Paths of Glory and World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin comes a fresh new look at the most titanic and brutal land campaign ever waged, the war between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Stalin's War is a unique card-driven, hex-based game, a combination that allows players to experience a broad range of strategic and tactical options as they maneuver their forces across a large hex map that stretches from Berlin to the Urals.<br/><br/>Stalin's War allows player to recreate WWII's greatest battles of encirclement as Axis Armies and Panzer Corps clash with Soviet Fronts and Armies on a front a thousand miles wide. Simple but effective rules allow you to use your mechanized forces to blitz the enemy's front line and exploit deep into your opponent's rear. Can you as the Soviets survive the slashing Panzer attacks of Operation Barbarossa and Case Blue in 1941 and 1942? Can you as the Axis player stand against the crushing Soviet Deep Battle operations that destroyed Army Group Center in 1944? Stalin's War will test both player's operational skills to the limit.<br/><br/>But there is more to Stalin's War than directing your forces on the map. Both sides have their own deck of 55 cards, needed to launch offensive operations, mobilize their forces, replace losses, introduce new weapons, and deal with the larger strategic context of a World at War. Card Events include combat leaders, weapons (from German Tiger Tanks to patriotic Soviet mice nibbling the electrical wiring of the panzers), the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Manstein's Backhand Blow, Stalin's and Hitler's meddling, the Battle of the Bulge, and much more.<br/><br/>Stalin's War allows players to combine the best of WWII operational play with the strategic depth and tactical chrome of a card driven design. A genuine new look the the most important theater of WWII, this is a game you want to play again and again.<br/><br/>(Taken from rear of the game box)<br/><br/>Scenarios <br/>In addition to the full campaign game, a shorter tournament scenario is included that comprises 8 game turns and covers the time period of June 1941 through to Winter 1943.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Briscola is a traditional Mediterranean points-based trick taking game for 2 to 6 players. It uses a 40-card deck Ace through 2 minus the 8,9 and 10 with the Ace being the high and worth the most (11 points), followed by the 3 (10 points), King (4 points), Knight/Queen (3 points) and Infantry/Jack (2 points). All other cards do not score any points.<br/>Each player is dealt 3 cards with one turned up as the trump suit. Play does not need to follow suit and the winner of each trick replenishes their hand first. The total points in each game are 120 and whoever has the higher scoring wins a manche of the game.<br/>Play with 3-6 players just takes a few minor adjustments to the rules or cards and the versions for 4-6 are played with partnerships.<br/>Usually this game allows speaking between teammates, but no gestures (or only over-table gestures).<br/>Two interesting variants are:<br/>- &quot;Briscola scoperta&quot; in which all the cards are face up and visible by all players.<br/>- &quot;chiamata&quot;, played with 5 players (3 vs 2). It has an initial bet on the expected final scoring. Who bets the highest amount calls a card, whose owner becomes (secretly) his partner and play with the caller against the other 3 players. So the players (except the called one) do not know exactly who are the opponents and the partners.<br/><br/>",

A player is Garibaldi in hiding, the others are the Austrian patrols hunting him. Garibaldi wins if he succeeds in reaching the safe point and can run away, otherwise the Austrian patrols win if they catch Garibaldi.<br/><br/>In turns, using the cards, it's possible to move on the gameboard, a big-sized board that reproduces accurately a map of the territory at that time. The player who controls Garibaldi, with the help of a special screen, makes his moves secretly, while the other players have to work together to stop the moves of the escaper, trying to find him.<br/><br/>Garibaldi: La Trafila is a game of deduction and bluff, recommended for all families: the rules are simple, but the gameplay stimulates reasoning and cooperation, offering the possibility for expert players to adopt more refined strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 1862 and the US Congress has decreed that a railroad be built that will span the continent - linking the east coast and the west coast by rail for the first time.  The Transcontinental Railroad will be a epic feat of engineering - combining advanced construction techniques with raw human power and determination.  A fortune is to be made for those who can build the track the fastest!  Your task is to build an efficient team of workers, plan out your route and race the other players to connect both coasts first!<br/><br/>In Pacific Rails Inc., players are the Presidents of rival railway companies.  Using worker placement and resource management, players compete to build a continuous track from one side of the board to the other.  When the two sides meet, the end of the game is triggered and glory await those who have built the best railway.<br/><br/>The core mechanic of the game is worker placement.  On your turn, you either place a worker onto an action, or remove an existing worker.  If you place adjacent to one of your own workers, your actions are powered up.  Planning out a sequence of action is vital to get the best results.  Keep an eye on the other players and try to block them if they are building up to a super move.<br/><br/>You are also building up your team during the game.  Your engine starts with just the foreman.  You can hire extra Specialists to your train that allow you to build more track, lobby Congress and give you powerful actions.  Add in some carriage bonuses and you are on the way to creating a powerful engine that will allow powerful actions to be chained together producing epic turns that will show your mastery of the rails!<br/><br/>Once you have your track ready, you need to plan out the best route.  You need to have the tracks ready to match the terrain you wish to cover and decide which cities to connect and which to skip.  You must be able to complete a connection to the next city in one action - so make sure you're not missing any tracks!  Also watch what your rivals are up to - points are on offer if you can get them to use your connected cities.<br/><br/>In addition to the fun game play, Pacific Rails Inc has amazing art by Damien Mammoliti, well known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more.  From the box cover all the way to the game board, the artwork is highly-detailed and beautifully crafted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the world of the Gnomes of Zavandor.<br/><br/>Like most gnomes, you have two great passions: sparkling gems and wondrous machines. <br/>The sought-after gemstones can be found around the mining town of Diamantina. They can be bought and sold at the gem exchange, shady traders are always willing to engage in a little wheeling and dealing, and then you can use the gems to claim valuable mining rights, artifacts and jewellery. Who will become the most successful gem trading mogul?<br/><br/>Zavandor is a fantasy setting which revolves around a capitalist economy based on trading in gems - sapphires, rubies, mystical gems etc. Other games in the family include Mines of Zavandor, and The Scepter of Zavandor.<br/><br/>Gnomes of Zavandor features two central boards. The first is a grid with markers indicating the current price of each of the gem types, and also indicating whether the price is going to go up or down next turn. Gems can be bought (or sold) for cash in the first phase of each turn. Buying gems makes them more valuable in subsequent turns; selling them reduces their value, and this is reflected on the grid. These gems can be used to buy tiles from the second board, a star-shaped arena featuring &quot;mining rights&quot; tiles positioned randomly around it. The position on the board indicates the cost to purchase these mining rights; the cost will be a mixed selection of coloured gems. At the end of each turn, players gain new gems according to the mining rights they have acquired and this affects the central economy, generally reducing the value of the relevant gems when they are purchased for hard cash, in future rounds.<br/><br/>The initial phase of the turn involves buying gems, selling gems, taking gold, trading with the central supply, and purchasing cards and tokens (with gems rather than cash). The items available for purchase include equipment improving your efficiency, jewels providing victory points, and mining rights. The second phase of the turn involves mining for new gems. Each player takes the gems they are allowed according to their mining rights. At the end of each turn, the market values are adjusted according to the actions which have occurred; the price of the available equipment is discounted (this rule is optional); and another area of the star-shaped board becomes accessible with more mining-rights available to purchase in the next round.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has reached a victory-point target, dependent on the number of players in the game. Victory points are achieved by purchasing mining-rights, equipment, and most significantly (but also most expensively) jewellery.<br/><br/>",

However, it's much more than just a reprint, with the game expanded noticeably and a new revision of the rules, taking lessons learned throughout the series.  Art has also seen a major update, along with a number of other improvements:<br/><br/><br/>     The new maps will use the style Terry Moore Strickland showed so well with Beyond Normandy. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     There&rsquo;s twice as much playing area from which to choose, as there has been a move from four to eight maps<br/><br/><br/><br/>      In addition to infantry, the Germans also now have two full squadrons of cavalry. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A new concept is added for the first time to the series, the vehicles known as prime movers. These are tracked or semi-tracked vehicles like the Soviet Komsomolets or the German SdKfz-7. They have better performance off the road than the game&rsquo;s standard trucks, but cannot carry infantry. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Soviets received a much greater overhaul than the Germans. New artillery pieces include the 107 mm cannon and 76.2 mm mountain gun. A new &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; type of infantry is available, anti-tank rifle platoons. There are two new flavors of armored car: the FAI and Ba6 in addition to the Ba10m found in the first edition. The stable of tanks is vast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Romanian army is now represented<br/><br/><br/><br/>     All 50 scenarios from the original Panzer Grenadier have been included, as well as 62 new scenarios, for a total of 112.<br/><br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Panzer Grenadier<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Arctic Front: Finland's War, 1939-1944 – A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book: Deluxe Edition<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Blue Division<br/>    Campaigns & Commanders: War in the East, 1939-1945 – A Panzer Grenadier Campaign Book<br/>    Edelweiss: A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book<br/>    First Axis: Slovakia at War 1939-1945 – A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book<br/>    Fronte Russo: A Panzer Grenadier Expansion Book<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves – Lithuania's Army<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: North Wind<br/>    Red Warriors<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: War on the Equator<br/>    White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book<br/><br/><br/>",

You may never have more than 6 cards in hand.<br/><br/>During the fight phase you can deliberately attack or deflect your enemies, depending on your choices and possibilities. You choose the amount of cards to spend from your hand.<br/><br/>To face an enemy you will need to consider the enemy position and discard a Weapon card correspondingly. You can only use one of the positions shown on the card for each Weapon card you discard.<br/><br/>At any time, you can turn a Weapon card by 90 degrees clockwise to hit an enemy in a specific position by discarding the topmost card of your Weapon deck.<br/><br/>By attacking an enemy you will defeat only the topmost enemy of the overlapping row and will you gain honour points.<br/><br/>To deflect an enemy you must discard the corresponding Weapon card, and you must take a Deflect token and place it on top of the corresponding Enemy row. During this turn, you won&rsquo;t receive damage from that row, but you won&rsquo;t get honour points.<br/><br/>In the Enemy phase, all of the Enemies from the rows without a Deflect token on top, will attack you. The enemies will damage you based on the positions they occupy in their row. You will discard an amount of cards from your Weapon deck corresponding to the damage received by the enemies.<br/><br/>When using the deflect tokens, discard the topmost card of a row (without receiving honour points), before starting a new round.<br/><br/>You will lose the game if you run out of Weapon cards for the third time while there are still enemies to fight. To win the game you will need to survive having gained at least 40 honour points.<br/><br/>The mini-expansion, Eiyo: Yamabushi, is packaged inside the base game's box.

Players choose their favorite mech to battle it out, with each mech offering a different loadout of cards to start the game and unique powers.<br/><br/>Each turn, players play a card face-down. When both players have chosen a card, they reveal them. Cards resolve based on their speed if they haven't been interrupted. Weapons deal damage and interrupt the enemy, while defending avoids weapon hits. Upgrading offers you additional cards to add to your arsenal but is vulnerable to being interrupted. Lastly, recharge reloads spent cards.<br/><br/>As cards are played, they go to their owner's cool-down pile, where they remain until they're reloaded. As players take damage, the armor on their mech is destroyed. When enough armor is destroyed, an armor core becomes vulnerable and can be destroyed to stun that mech for the next turn. The game ends when a mech's armor is completely destroyed down to the last core.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the many planes of existence turn and churn, occasionally worlds come into alignment.  For brief moments in the multiverse's timescale, these Conjunctions allow objects to slip from one world to another, sometimes unnoticed, sometimes causing chaos.<br/><br/>One such Conjunction occurred between Earth and Neemoss, during the Dark Ages.  Two dimensions could not be more different.  Physics in this alternate plane is more akin to magic and its corrupting effects create worlds of monsters and cruelty.  When items from Neemoss appear on Earth they are still imbued with their magical essence, which is soon discovered by healers, alchemists, fakirs and all manner of snake-oil peddlers.  But things become decidedly worse when the Conjunction strengthens and the first Witches from Neemoss cross into our plane of existence.<br/><br/>Help the Heroes master their newfound magical powers as they defend their lands from the malevolent Witches and the disciples they summon. Or control the Witches as they complete their rituals to ravage the Earth!<br/><br/>Dark Rituals: Malleus Maleficarum is an asymmetric &ldquo;One vs Many&rdquo; miniatures board game for 2 to 5 players with an expansion for a solo mode where one player controls the Witch Master. In &quot;one vs many&quot;, a team of people control a small band of Heroes defending villagers from a single player controlling the vile Forces of Evil.  All players manage a pool of stamina that is used to pay for their character&rsquo;s actions.  Game play is dynamic with little downtime: turns alternate between the two forces with a player on each side taking one or two actions each turn, so long as they still have stamina.<br/><br/>Play is organized around scenarios with unique objectives.  The scenarios can be linked into a longer campaign or played individually if your group is more casual. Story driven scenarios, game mechanics, detailed miniatures and lush modular boards bring the game world to life.<br/><br/>Can you use the magic of Neemoss to defeat the invading horde? Or will you complete your Dark Rituals to summon the ultimate evil?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published and packed with Operational Matters: An OCS Guide (w/ Sicily II game).<br/><br/>(from the publisher:)<br/><br/>Sicily II is a full-sized game covering the amphibious invasion of that island in the summer of 1943. This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig's original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe and the upcoming games set in Western Europe. We think Sicily II is a perfect way to give new recruits their baptism in the fire of OCS, and is also a worthy entry in the series for players who have already earned their stripes.<br/><br/>Here are some of the game&rsquo;s highlights:<br/><br/><br/>     The entire campaign lasts just 16 turns.<br/>     There are six scenarios in all (three using the entire map, and three using just a portion).<br/>     The Allied airborne fiasco is recreated with simple scatter rules. <br/>     The amphibious landings can be played out using standard OCS naval rules, or players can mostly skip these and begin with the bulk of Allied forces already ashore.<br/>     The Luftwaffe&rsquo;s Do.217K makes its series debut, armed with exotic Fritz-X missiles.<br/>     Rules for Italian unit wavering and surrender make every game different.<br/>     Several interesting options are provided, including revised Axis deployment and variable entry of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division.<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 3 to 4 days<br/>Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>    Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 16-page Sicily II rules booklet<br/><br/><br/>Players will have to use OCS v4.2 rulebook/charts &amp; tables for another OCS game or download them from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm</a><br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 Hours<br/><br/>",

The three maps cover the area from the far north of Denmark, through Germany and Austria to the industrial heartland of Italy.<br/><br/>The standard rules constitute the fast game, and contain all the rules necessary to play &quot;The Next War&quot; land game - a complete game that can be played independently. The most notable mechanic is the combination of combat within the movement of land units, with the ability of units to greatly exceed the basic movement allowance at increased risk of fatigue/attrition.<br/><br/>Optional rules cover weather, supply, chemical/nuclear warfare, air and naval operations, airborne/airmobile and amphibious operations, helicopters and special forces, and electronic warfare and add can considerably to the record keeping and playing time.<br/><br/>The campaign game covers the first 60 days after mobilization in three basic scenarios, Sudden War, Spring Maneuvers, Tension. The differences between these three concern the timing of the outbreak of war and the resultant state of readiness of the respective forces. Due to the large number of optional rules, however, the players may in fact choose from a vast array of possible Campaign Game situations.<br/><br/>Six smaller scenarios depict smaller areas of operations over briefer periods of time in the regions of Berlin, Vienna, The Baltic, Fulda, North German Plains, and the Main Front (Fulda + North German Plains).<br/><br/>The game components: three 22&quot; x 35&quot; map sheets plus one 6&quot; x 8&quot; and one 10&quot; x 12&quot; map extensions, 2400 die-cut 1/2&quot; counters, one 32 page rules book, one 40 page Scenarios and Situation Briefing book, two identical 4 page Charts &amp; Tables folders, and one 17&quot; x 22&quot; Air Allocation Display.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Clash of Arms May 2008 Works in Progress flyer:<br/>Description:<br/>Legion of Honor is a highly innovative game that recreates the personal drama of the Napoleonic wars. Using a quick-playing, card-driven game system, each player assumes the role of a French soldier -- or grognard -- starting out as a young sergeant or sous-lieutenant trying to make it in life beginning in 1792. Fortunately for the enterprising grognard, he can look forward to over twenty years of almost continuous war provided courtesy of the Directory and Napol&eacute;on!<br/><br/>Game play is broken down into a series of campaign seasons that span the period from the Brunswick Manifesto in 1792 to The Hundred Days of 1815. Each campaign season consists of a number of 'In Garrison' rounds and 'On Campaign' rounds. During these rounds, major historical events take place, from the arrest and execution of Louis XVI to the coronation of Napol&eacute;on, from great battles to the &quot;whiff of grapeshot.&quot; History is fixed, with events happening like they actually did, that is, with one exception: will the English christen that climactic battle of 1815 The Battle of Waterloo or will the victorious French name it La Bataille de Mont Saint Jean?!<br/><br/>Against this historical backdrop, grognards take advantage of the opportunities that Fate provides to advance their station in life. Will you be lucky enough to be assigned to the Army of the Orient with Napol&eacute;on himself or will you be marooned in the Army of the Rhine et Moselle? Will you exhibit reckless bravery under the Emperor&rsquo;s eye at Austerlitz, or will you sit out the 1805 campaign, recovering from wounds suffered in a pointless minor skirmish? It&rsquo;s both up to you and to Fate. Each grognard has a number of qualities that are key to game play:<br/><br/><br/>     Rank: From Sergent to Marechal (is there a baton in your knapsack?)<br/>     Title and Office: Reserved only for the most senior grognards<br/>     Legion of Honor: Has your bravery been suitably recognized?<br/>     Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s Notice: You can&rsquo;t command a regiment without this<br/>     Glory: Are you known as a bold fire-eater, forever brave?<br/>     Money: Has fortune shined on you in more tangible ways?<br/>     Health: Will the predations of war force you into retirement?<br/>     Charm: Of course; this is a game about Frenchmen, n'est pas?<br/>     Fencing: Useful for skewering a fellow grognard who insults you<br/>     Standing: Does your commander hold you in high esteem or contempt?<br/><br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Winning the game is achieved in a number of ways: having the highest award in the Legion of Honor, having the highest military rank, or having the most glory or wealth. The game is entirely suitable for  solitaire play through six players (and perhaps even a few more). Legion of Honor consists of two short scenarios of 4 hours each that cover the Republican Period and the Imperial Period. The grand scenario spans both periods and takes 8 hours to play.<br/><br/>",

Have you enjoyed a good historical novel about Ancient Rome and you would have liked to move to this period in the middle of battle? Would you like to be able to change History or revive exciting historical events? If you have answered affirmatively to any of these questions then this is your game.<br/><br/>ONUS! Traianus is a historical battles wargame, similar to a miniatures game, where two sides confront each other in an Ancient battle. This game is focused on the armies of the great superpowers of the apogee of the Roman Empire, during the reign of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian, between the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. In this game, different action cards recreate varied kinds of orders and battle events, that allow every match to be unique and to any combat to be epic, unpredictable and exciting.  ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).<br/><br/>Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements. Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated; meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.<br/><br/>Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1878 the Polish genius Rychnowski isolated an electrical fluid with remarkable lifting capabilities &ndash; a single, pivotal event that would change the world. The smartest military minds of the coming generation &ndash; Zeppelin, Jellico, Fisher and others &ndash; diverted their attention to the glorious new technological revolution and sea-going battleships were abandoned around the world. In their place, armored giants took to the skies.<br/><br/>In 1906, Great Britain launched the HMS Leviathan, the first of the &quot;super air ships&quot;, sparking an arms race around the world. By 1910 the most powerful nations boasted large High Fleets, and the start of small skirmishes left the world uneasy... Welcome to Leviathans!<br/><br/>Leviathans is a game published by Catalyst Game Labs that simulates combat between warships that have taken to the air in an alternate history 1910. The king leviathans, the battleships, are the largest vessels. Maneuvering in support are the smaller ships of light cruisers, destroyers, and others ships. Will you captain your fleet for king and country, expanding your nation's power and becoming legend? Or will you fall from the sky, forgotten?<br/><br/>You will determine the outcome!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the time of the 20th century, a century of skyrocketing technological development, a century of new economic and political relations, a century of two World Wars, a century of revolutions. For the first time in history, the creation of a single world government became possible. You command a subdivision at &quot;The Committee&quot; &mdash; a secret organization working towards becoming that government.<br/><br/>During the game, you dispatch your network of agents to infiltrate political, financial, and research institutions. You make treaties with prominent organizations, both well-known and secret, and carry out covert operations. You head up history-shaping projects, including Comintern and Unified Nations. Most importantly, you compete with other subdivision heads to become the only puppet master of the world!<br/><br/>All you do is shrouded in secrecy. The world knows nothing of you, and it will stay that way. Even as you stand at the head of The Committee and become the ruler of the world!<br/><br/>Deep State: New World Order is a dystopian game of world domination and global conspiracies. The game takes place over several rounds, and in the course of a round, players begin with the action phase, which is followed by the takeover phase. Those two phases repeat, then at the end of the round comes the treaty phase.<br/><br/>During the action phase, each player performs one action, the most important of which is to send your agents to infiltrate political, financial, and research institutions represented by objective cards in the Infiltration Zone. You must race for objective cards as other players can send more agents to intercept the card they need. Players can also advance toward World Domination projects, including Comintern, Unified Nations, Spyware, and Deep State itself, which gives players tangible advantages in the game. They may also choose to carry out covert operations that provide a lot of influence while requiring the sacrifice of agents.<br/><br/>During the takeover phase, players take their captured cards and return some of their agents from them.<br/><br/>The treaty phase begins when all objective cards in the Infiltration Zone have been captured. Each player can then make one treaty that gets them working with mighty organizations, some known the world over, while others hide in secret.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players calculate their influence (victory points) that are generated by their objective cards, by participation in global projects, and by their treaty cards. Many cards interact with each other, generating even more influence. The player with the most influence wins the game, becoming master of the world we know.<br/><br/>",

Create the coolest and biggest longboards to establish your surfboard-shaping shop as the best in town.

More specifically, on a turn you take two actions, with three types of actions being possible:<br/><br/><br/>    Add a card from the deck to your personal supply, that is, cards lying face up in front of you.<br/>    Take a card from your supply to start or lengthen a board; all cards in a board have to be the same color (or wild) and each new card on a board must be equal to or greater in value than the card below it.<br/>    Place one or more cards in your supply in an opponent's supply, then take a single card from their supply of value less than the sum of what you gave them and use this card to start or lengthen a board.<br/><br/><br/>Each board card features 1-3 stickers, which count as points when the surfboard is complete, that is, when it contains at least four cards. When a player has 3-4 complete boards, at least one of which contains 7+ cards, they can choose to end the game. If that doesn't happen before the deck runs out, the game ends at that point. Players then score sticker points on completed boards, lose points for incomplete boards, and score bonus points if they have the longest completed board or the most completed boards or if they have completed any of the four random objective cards put into play at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary&hellip;<br/><br/>The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.<br/><br/>No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.<br/><br/>Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!<br/><br/>With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>RAN is the 12th volume in the &quot;Great Battles of History&quot; Series, and the second game on the battles of the Samurai (following GMTs Samurai (Vol. V). RAN covers several of the less famous of the Sengoku Jidai, the Age of Warring States (more or less), in which powerful Daimyo - Japanese feudal lords - strove to both maintain and extend their power bases while seeking to attain the office of Shogun, the power behind the throne of the Emperor.<br/><br/>RAN simulates the highly personal form of warfare developed by the Japanese samurai, wherein formal battles played out almost as backdrops to individual feats of courage, bravery and devotion much of it outstanding, some of it rather foolhardy, all of it very Homeric. Although political and tactical victory was the bottom line, collecting the severed heads of enemy samurai reigned a very close second in importance. In terms of tactics, this was, as in Europe, the Dawn of Modern Warfare, with the introduction of guns - arquebuses - by the Portuguese. Even with the revelatory effect of musketry, Japanese battles were still pretty much a swirling, non-linear affair.<br/><br/>RAN, the name the famous Japanese film director, Kurosawa, chose for his samurai version of King Lear, roughly means &ldquo;Chaos.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Battles of RAN (all battles are one-half map, except for Tennoji):<br/><br/><br/>    MIMASETOGE (6 October 1569): The Takeda are trying to return to their castle base, and the Hojo are trying to intercept and ambush them with twice their number. A startling Takeda victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    MIMIGAWA (11 November 1578) Interrupted while besieging Takajpo Castle, the Otomi retreat into the woods, then burst out to attack the Shimazu relief force, only to be outwitted by clever Shimazu tactics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    NAGAKUTE (17 May 1582): Tokugawa vs Ikeda, in a nice, small battle (less than 10,000 men each). Set piece affair fought over very difficult terrain &hellip; mountains, rice paddies, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    NUNOBEYAMA (14 February 1570): The Amako vs The Mori<br/><br/><br/><br/>    OKITANAWATE (24 March 1584): The Ryuzoji vs The Shimazu<br/><br/><br/><br/>    SURIAGEHARA (5 June 1589): Date Masamune (and his 23,000 men) hold off an initially effective attack by Asahina Yosohiro's 16,000 man army on relatively flat terrain. Key use of reserves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    TENNOJI (7 May 1615): One of the biggest battles of the era (and the only full map battle in the box). After Sekigahara, Hideyori, son of Hideysohi, challenges Tokugawa... the result is a battle with over 250,000 men and a swirling affair with lots of arriving reinforcements. <br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>    5 Countersheets<br/>    2 22 x 33 battle maps, backprinted<br/>    1 Battle Rules Book<br/>    1 Battle Scenario Book<br/>    5 Charts &amp; Tables Cards<br/>    2 Record sheets<br/>    1 ten-sided die<br/><br/><br/>DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Gentle wind, fields of bright flowers, and in the background, the romantic staccato of machine gun fire in the morning. In these typical French countryside landscapes, thousands of men are about to fight. And die. Bravely like heroes, or cowardly like wussies. But only heroes really matter. Those you see in Hollywood Golden Age war movies. Here lies the inspiration for Heroes of Normandie; here is what the game has to offer: explosive and fast-paced battles; the pleasure of butchering your enemies through MG42 walls of lead; and the ability to crush Nazi bastards under tons of shells &ndash; basically, blood and guts.<br/><br/>A miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy war game inspired by Hollywood war movies. A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies. Deploy your units and don't turn back!<br/><br/>What's new in the Big Red One edition:<br/><br/>     50-Card decks (instead of 70) with new Alternate Bonuses, for even faster gameplay and reduced setup time.<br/>     New and improved rule book<br/>     New scenarios<br/>     New and improved Aircraft system, available in Bloody Omaha<br/>     All new artwork for the Heroes<br/>     New Blast Templates<br/>     New Heroes<br/>     New Tactical Objectives<br/>     And last, but not least, Flamethrowers in the core box (instead of in expansions)!<br/><br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In New Haven, set in colonial New England, players must develop the riches of the land and build a thriving settlement. Players place tiles strategically to a shared game board to cut timber, quarry stone, plant fields of wheat, and fill pastures with fat sheep. Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!<br/><br/>New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.<br/><br/>This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.<br/><br/>Once a player is done building, any value he hasn't used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you'll be rewarded with additional tokens.<br/><br/>The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.<br/><br/>New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.<br/><br/>",

These actions set the stage for the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s autumn drive on the Soviet capital, and many historians believe the bitter fighting here ultimately doomed the Axis to failure in Russia.<br/><br/>The game begins on 8 July with Barbarossa still in high gear. In August, the advance stalls as Hitler diverts most of the panzers from the map to forces around Leningrad and Kiev. Soviet counteroffensives will push Army Group Center close to the breaking point by game&rsquo;s end on 8 September. The asymmetry of the two armies will be familiar to veterans of past OCS campaigns, especially Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg II. There is the expected qualitative difference in typical Action Ratings, along with stark contrasts in logistical capabilities and replacement rates. There also some unique twists in the situation, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Three of the panzer divisions are getting their first taste of combat, so their Action Ratings are reduced.<br/>     The rivalry between Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth makes it difficult for these generals to coordinate their panzer armies, and might prevent the ring from closing around Smolensk.<br/>     Soviet tank divisions are shown for the first time. They pack a wallop, but their quality leaves a lot to be desired.<br/>     The Soviet 1st Motorized Division is presented as a somewhat elite multi-unit formation that includes some heavy KV-1s and T-34s.<br/>     The contributions of small militia, tank, and anti-tank units are reflected by the Soviet Alarm Pool.<br/>     Other chrome accounts for &lsquo;tree bark soup&rsquo; (used by cut-off units), planes diverted to terror-bomb Moscow, and special markers for artillery ammo &amp; katyusha effects.<br/><br/><br/>Smolensk is a small and fairly simple entry in the series, with special rules kept to a minimum. We think players will enjoy the fact both sides must attack and defend. By the end they will learn three things about this campaign: the Soviets are more than just punching bags, the Germans are challenged to hold their early gains,<br/>and the road to Moscow will be paved in blood.<br/><br/>Seven scenarios are included:<br/>Intro Scenario: Vitebsk, 1/2 turn, using about 1/4 of the map<br/>Smolensk Campaign, 8 July to 8 September (19 turns)<br/>Late July Start, 22 July to 8 September (15 turns)<br/>1st Counteroffensive, 22 July to 1 August (4 turns)<br/>Early August Start, 8 August to 8 September (10 turns)<br/>2nd Counteroffensive, 8 August to 22 August (5 turns)<br/>3rd Counteroffensive, 26 August to 8 September (5 turns)<br/><br/>",

Each game includes its own mapboard and counters and shares only a minimum of components with the other, however, they share the same basic rules system.<br/><br/>A strategic battalion level game, Air Assault On Crete simulates the first totally airborne invasion in history, with the Germans overwhelming the rag-tag Allied survivors of the ill-fated Greek Campaign.<br/><br/>Traditional turn sequencing: Axis bombard, move, combat; then Allied movement and combat.  Units have attack, defense, and movement values, as well as stacking limits.  Standard terrain effects.  Zones of control, but there's no mandatory attacks.<br/><br/>Invasion of Malta--1942 re-creates the hypothetical German-Italian invasion of Malta.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5<br/>Counters = 520<br/><br/>",

Both players have identical sets of ten fighters, with three fighters in each of three colors with values 1&ndash;3 along with a tri-colored boss valued at 4; these fighters are placed in small stacks of varying size onto a line that's eleven steps long. On a player's turn, he rolls the three colored dice and can make up to three moves accordingly, with the blue die moving a blue fighter, etc. Moving a fighter that has other fighters on top of him moves these other fighters as well.<br/><br/>If, as a result of movement, his fighter (or stack of fighters) encounters an enemy, a fight between the two top cards in each stack occurs, the result of which is decided primarily by the color (via a rock-paper-scissors mechanism) and secondarily by the number (highest wins). If the boss wins a fight, its power is reduced by the enemy's power for the remainder of the current fight; if two fighters draw, they both retreat one step toward their own village, possibly precipitating other fights on the same turn. The fight continues until either pile is depleted.<br/><br/>The first player to either defeat all of the opposing fighters or reach the end of the line (and clear out the opponent's fighters in his village) wins.<br/><br/>",

Along the way, enchanted idols from the mighty Egyptian Gods may assist you in your journey.<br/><br/>Your primary goal will be to locate parts of Artifact sets. When these sets are completed, they are placed inside King Tut&rsquo;s tomb to help the preparations for his burial. The priests who collected the most parts of the set will cleanse a portion of their spirit as their reward.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to completely cleanse your spirit (indicated by reducing your points to zero), you will so impress the new Pharaoh that he appoints you to be the next High Priest of Egypt. Will you meet the challenge and earn the new Pharaoh&rsquo;s favor to become the most powerful priest in the land?<br/><br/>Tutankhamun features familiar gameplay from the earlier versions, while adding new Egyptian god powers and implementing a modified scoring system with new Scarab Rings and a new two-player scoring change.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;All hope abandon ye who enter here. Welcome to the grimdark. Welcome to DAYNIGHTZ&trade;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dawn breaks on the refuge, and the sunrays bring you the feared news&hellip;the day has come, the day to go back to the city. When this damned thing started, you joined a group of survivors that had gathered in the woods, fleeing from the city. With tremendous effort, you erected a makeshift refuge to fend off the foul creatures, waiting for the army to come and save you. However, help is not coming, you know that now. And so do the traitors who quietly left the refuge last night, taking most of the remaining supplies with them. Now you are forced to go back to the city: It&rsquo;s the only option if you want to survive another day&hellip;<br/><br/>This is the starting point of DAYNIGHTZ&trade;. You get to pick a group of up to 4 survivors, each with its own character sheet that shows its attributes and abilities, a backpack and some equipment. Now you&rsquo;re ready to start your adventure in a nightmare world, where the dead rule above the living.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhat is your goal?That depends on the game mode chosen:<br/><br/>-&gt; In campaign mode you will have to brave narrative missions where you will have to fight and take difficult decisions, that will determine your progress, culminating in one of three possible endings.<br/>-&gt; In survival mode you will roam from city to city, with complete freedom to do whatever it takes to survive another day on this hell on earth.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow are you going to achieve your goal?The game is divided in 3 segments: Adventure Phase, Travel Phase and Refuge Phase.<br/><br/>1) Adventure Phase: This is the most important phase of the game. In it, players will roam the streets and alleys of the city, exploring locales, suffering encounters and generally trying to keep a low profile while striving to achieve their goals (established by the campaign mission in the campaign mode or by their own interests in the survival mode).<br/><br/>One of the many things that set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other games is that is played on TWO LEVELS. What does that mean?<br/><br/>On one hand there is the City board, consisting of a labyrinth of streets, alleys, surprise zones and locations. On the other hand, whenever the players want to explore a certain location, or due to the triggering of events and conditions, players will lay out tiles to represent that particular location. Each location has its own set of tiles, depending on its nature. For example, the Firemen Park location consists of the parking tile, the locker room tile and the offices tile.<br/><br/>2) Travel Phase: Once the Adventure Phase is finished, survivors will have to trudge back to their refuge with their meager loot. In this phase survivors will have to face different situations, like zombie encounters, coming across abandoned structures (farms, etc) and being assaulted by other survivor groups.<br/><br/>3) Refuge Phase: This is a management phase, where survivors will have to handle, upgrade and defend their base. While in the refuge survivors can do a lot of stuff: recover from their wounds/infections, level up, stock supplies, farm food, upgrade the refuge&rsquo;s defenses&hellip;The refuge, though, will be attacked regularly by either roamer&rsquo;s packs or other survivor groups, who can also steal and sabotage your base. That is more likely to happen if you&rsquo;re away for extended periods, so try to do your city supply runs as fast as possible&hellip;<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the core mechanic?DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is based on a double profile system, for both the zombies and the survivors: during the day, zombies use their worse profile, while during the night, zombie use their better profile and survivors will use their worse profile, unless they&rsquo;re equipped with a light source&hellip;which are obviously very scarce and run out very fast! The day and night cycle is controlled through a timetable located on the City board.<br/><br/>On top of that, other elements can make the brave survivor&rsquo;s life even more difficult:<br/><br/>- Threat Counter: Consists of a counter that increases as a result of diverse things happening, like survivors making noise, environmental effects, zombies amassing, etc. The higher the Threat counter, the higher the risk the survivors are taking by staying in the city.<br/><br/>- Threat Encounters: Each end of turn you will verify the conditions stated in a card. If you meet the conditions, you will suffer a Threat encounter. That might not happen very frequently but&hellip;beware when it does happen!<br/><br/>- The Hunter: The Hunter is the most dangerous zombie in the game. Luckily, it only appears at night; unfortunately, when it appears it will attack all the survivors who are out in the open (in streets and alleys). So keep this in mind: you don&rsquo;t want to be wandering around in the open at night!<br/><br/>- Survivor&rsquo;s health and stress: DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is a very realistic game. Thus, the more wounded your survivor is, the more difficult it will be for him/her to accomplish actions (in combat or out of it). Also, your survivor will be able to do less actions the more wounded he/she is. Stress is also key, as your survivor will be affected by events depending on their stress level, which can also impact on their attribute checks.<br/><br/>- Infection: Survivors can get infected when wounded by a zombies, while searching corpses or by other special effects. Once infected, the disease will deteriorate the survivor and if not treated, will end up killing him/her. Of course, the infection will be more easily neutered in its early stages; the more you wait, the harder it will be to remove it. While infected, your survivor will periodically succumb to its effects, which can make them bleed, make them slower, etc.<br/><br/>To help them deal with the situations that they will find themselves in, the survivors can use a lot of items that they will find in their city wanderings. However, all said items will either need consumables in order to function or will wear away with use&hellip;<br/><br/>The players will also encounter other survivors and animals during their travels, which, depending on the decisions previously taken and the success in the encounters, can join their group as allies. Allies can give a series of bonuses to the survivors, but will not remain with them forever: allies have their own loyalty system, which depends on the actions taken by the players. The way you treat them will determine how they treat you!<br/><br/>All the points above, plus others that you will discover during gameplay, set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other zombie-themed games. We have worked really hard to achieve an immersive experience, exploring the dark themes of the zombie apocalypse, and we welcome you.<br/><br/>PS: If you want to keep with all the info about the game, you can follow us in:<br/><br/>",

Hire new crew, upgrade your ship, and give your treasure to the Pirate King for fame and glory!<br/><br/>Rattle, Battle, Grab the Loot takes the fun of rolling dice and combines it with a rich scenario deck to make each game play differently. Each round, the players battle it out with merchant vessels and other ships, trying to grab as much loot as possible. One player takes dice from all the players, rattles them in their hand, then tosses them into the game box to resolve the battle. Where your dice land in the box, in addition to the symbols rolled, determines the results of the battle, then players claim their loot. Players may now return to port to upgrade their ship, hire new crew, or give their goods to the Pirate King for his favor.<br/><br/>When upgrading their ship, players use physical pieces to assemble their vessel, making each ship look different. In the box are dozens of punchboard pieces to customize your ship. In addition to common items and crew members, there will be unique item upgrades and crew that can make your ship stand out among the crowd!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player who earned the most favor from the Pirate King wins!<br/><br/><br/>*Note: Per the publisher, unfortunately there's a misprint in the components list in the rulebook:<br/><br/>The correct numbers of Loot tokens in the box are:<br/>10 Spices<br/>18 Rum<br/>18 Fabrics<br/>10 Valuables<br/><br/>Also, the correct number of Special Loot cards from the mini-expansion is 5 (not 8).<br/><br/>",

Grow your plants in whatever container you can. Wheelbarrows, boots, suitcases &ndash; use anything you can to grow delicious eats! Will you create the most delicious garden?<br/><br/>Over the course of a game of Delicious, players fill their respective gardens with fruits and vegetables by sketching them based on cards and tokens that are revealed in the community area. Players take their turns sketching simultaneously each round as these plants are revealed. Earn the most points by planting fruits and vegetables in your makeshift containers and planters.<br/><br/>A game lasts 12 rounds. Every round, 2 Vegetable cards are flipped (1 from each deck) and a Fruit / Tool token is placed on each card. Each player then decides to use one or both cards (and their tokens), given certain restrictions. When you use a card and token, you mark your Garden and Play sheets, trying to get different combinations of fruits and vegetables.<br/><br/>The cards in the middle are common, but players place them in different containers within their garden setting up different combinations and scoring opportunities. Bonus tools and special powers mean that no two gardens are ever alike.<br/><br/>After 12 rounds, the player with the highest score wins. <br/>- If there is a tie, the player whose fruit planter score is higher wins.<br/>- If there is still a tie, the player who has marked the most First Potter Bonus icons wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ghostel is a semi-cooperative family game for 2-4 players that plays in 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Prey on the phobias of guests by turning into their worst nightmares. Work with other ghosts to combine forces, and scare away the hardiest of hotel patrons to earn upgrades and get even scarier!<br/><br/>The randomised guest and dice roll mechanic means each round is different from the next, but there&rsquo;s more than luck to winning the game.<br/><br/>Creepstone Manor has been closed for nearly a hundred years, standing dark and silent above the town of Creepstone, and that&rsquo;s just the way resident ghost Spookie likes it! But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie&rsquo;s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie&rsquo;s patronage. Who will be top ghost?<br/><br/>The game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day Phase and a Night Phase.<br/><br/>During the day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the night and survived will calm down from their twilight visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next night by buying more Terror Dice, Scare Tactics to improve their scaring and Spookie favours to give those extra little bonuses.<br/><br/>During the night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their creepy tactics to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.<br/><br/>",

Missiles launched from the territory of Russia and Belarus began to destroy civilian and military infrastructure. Russia's troops invaded Ukraine. However, thanks to the determined resistance of the Ukrainian army (AFU) and the territorial defense forces in the early days of the aggression, the occupying army suffered a significant loss in personnel and machinery.<br/><br/>AFU: Armed Forces of Ukraine is a deck-building card game. We offer you the chance to test your strength and defeat the invaders.<br/><br/>The game consists of two phases. During the first phase, you need to think and plan your strategy and start building up your army. Every turn, you have to correctly distribute your resources in order to repel the enemy's attack, get as many bonuses as possible, and mobilize troops.<br/><br/>During the second phase, the game becomes even more interesting thanks to various events that will affect the players. Unlock objects, destroy the enemy, and do not forget about the achievements to prove your mastery of this game. Skillful management of the troops of the Armed Forces and preventing dismay will help you deliver a crushing defeat to the enemy!<br/><br/>",

Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).  After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal.  The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.<br/><br/>Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.<br/><br/>",

Succeed in a variety of missions on randomly generated worlds with unique ecosystems, without luxuries like radios, landing gear, and medical supplies. Trust in your partner is paramount since, without radios, you can&rsquo;t communicate (in real life) after separating on the game board.<br/><br/>Survive, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a meager paycheck.

The missions we undertake are of vital importance to galactic prosperity. However, budget setbacks have forced us to reduce operational expenses. That&rsquo;s where you, the willing explorer, can help!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tExplorer DutiesThe Federation has several active missions for you to choose. Each offers unique challenges and potential sub-objectives we would love for you to accomplish off-the-clock. Thanks to the randomly generated universe, every mission attempt will be different.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve selected a mission and crashed into the planet (landing gear has been deemed &ldquo;optional&rdquo;), you must begin surviving. Your goal is to complete the mission and rebuild your ship. You will fail if you die of hunger, loneliness, or multiple grievous injuries. Don&rsquo;t fail!<br/><br/>Be forewarned: communication will be a challenge. Radios will not be provided, so the only way to communicate with your partner is to be in close physical proximity. Plan ahead! This not only allows you to strategize, but also prevents the psychological meltdown that comes with being alone on an alien world.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAlien CreaturesEach planet has a unique ecosystem. Experts have identified upwards of 32 creatures in the known universe, each with their own behavioral patterns.<br/><br/>Explorers will be tasked to Realistically and Objectively Log Events Performed Logically by Animals and Yourself (ROLEPLAY). Creature behavior is dictated by their diet, temperament, and other factors. Explorers are provided a quick guide to educate them on default creature movement, but we encourage explorers to embrace their inner-alien and log the creature actions with creativity and vibrant storytelling.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe Far Away Recruitment KitYour exploration kit can be delivered straight to your home.

        "description": "Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel captures the spirit of Qwixx &mdash; with players still trying to cross off numbers in four colored rows as best they can &mdash; but this game uses cards instead of dice, allowing for more tactics and planning as you draft and play a hand of cards.<br/><br/>As in the original game, in Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.<br/><br/>If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.<br/><br/>When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck. A player determines the color of this card only when playing it on her turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Established in 1810, Circleville, Ohio derives its name from the circular portion of a large Hopewell earthwork upon which it was built. The Circleville earthworks, as described in 1772, comprised an 1,100-foot diameter circle connected to a 900-foot square. Town director Daniel Dreisbach plotted the town directly atop the earthworks, integrating the town plan into the landscape. An octagonal courthouse stood directly in the center of the circular road system in the center of town.<br/><br/>To the dismay of Dreisbach, however, the people of Circleville hated the circular roads. People complained that the round roads forced everyone to build on oddly-shaped lots and caused confusion. By the mid-1830s, enough dissatisfaction arose with Circleville's unique radial concentric road layout that the townsfolk petitioned the State Assembly to change it.<br/><br/>The Circleville Squaring Company, authorized in 1837, undertook a project to convert the &quot;peculiar&quot; town plan into a more conventional grid. Circleville occupies a unique place in the history of American town planning as one of the earliest examples of urban redevelopment in the United States.<br/><br/>In Squaring Circleville, you work for the Circleville Squaring Company to manage the process of deconstructing and reconstructing the town of Circleville. You will move around the courthouse rondel getting permits to perform work, such as deconstructing and constructing roads and demolishing and building structures.<br/><br/>As the game proceeds, you become more experienced and are able to do an amazing amount of work in the same amount of time. In the end, only one player will be recognized as the best at &quot;squaring the circle&quot; and wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1870.<br/>The World is at War.<br/><br/>The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.<br/><br/>Warcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.<br/><br/>Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.<br/><br/>We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>",

Players are secretly dealt characters that belong to one of three teams: vampires, werewolves, or humans. The vampires and werewolves win by destroying the other team, while the humans are generally trying to simply stay alive (though some characters may end up aligning with one of the other two teams).<br/><br/>Since everybody starts knowing only who they are, they must start working on deducing who the other players are and whether they are friend or foe. Acting quickly may help you gain an advantage by weakening the opposing team before they realize which of the players fighting is their ally, but moving hastily with limited information may see you accidentally eliminate a teammate and set your side back in the conflict.<br/><br/>On each turn, players either try to gather information, find new equipment, or try to harm (or aid) another player. Different areas of the map influence what you may discover and who you may interact with while certain cards and abilities mean you can never be certain that things will go according to plan.<br/><br/>",

It is the National game of Ghana and the word &quot;oware&quot; means &quot;He She Marries&quot;. The mythology behind the name is believed by many to be the result of a wedding between a man and a woman and the dowry (represented by fields (pits) and seeds. Basically, you're playing for fruitful paddocks.<br/><br/>The game as played in Ghana is a social event and is commonly played on the street. Heckling, banging the fist and mocking are all allowed. The game is also used in education among the Asanti children for the development of maths skills.<br/><br/>Most of the oware available in Ghana is hand carved and comes with traditional symbols of the Asanti people carved into the wood. The traditional playing seeds are Bonduc seeds, a bright green seed with a hard shell. Stones and sometimes recycled glass are used.<br/><br/>As for the other games in the Mancala Family, the rules differ from country to country; however, for Oware there is an international organization which sets the standard.<br/><br/>The basic object of the game is to capture more seeds than your opponent. This is done by landing the last seed you are &quot;sowing&quot; in a pit on the opponent's side which already contains one or two seeds. Other rules allow multiple captures and the avoidance of &quot;stalemates&quot;.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.<br/><br/>The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em.

That someone could create an invention to seemingly power cities and other technologies forever, without publishing any findings, remains the biggest scientific folly in the era of PSE.<br/><br/>We took the crystals for granted. The supply seemed endless and their energy seemed unending, but we underestimated the growth of populations and the greed for crystal power. As PSE&rsquo;s across the world try to keep up with the demand, the crystals are breaking.<br/><br/>In Delta, players set out on an adventure through the Delta region of Kamargo, to try and gather more information about the crystals that power up the PSEs. as players observe the mechanimals such as the tortoise, flamingo, horses, and bulls. Send your crew to the different sections of the board to try and maximize your actions, and later on add new crew members to your team and even set out on special missions.<br/><br/>Manage your hand well, gather enough knowledge, and emerge as the victor in this exciting steampunk adventure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During the course of the game, you will place supplies on the ships&rsquo; bows, while moving around their body pieces so that your clan has majority control of a ship when it sets sail. Stern pieces are used to show which ships have already set sail.<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player will perform one of the remaining available actions. Actions include: taking first pick of actions next round, rearranging ships' pieces (x4), placing bets on ships (x2), adding supplies to a ship (x2), increasing the value of supplies in the market, or setting sail.<br/><br/>When a ship sets sail, players will share its supplies in order of how many times their clan's shield appears on the body pieces of that ship. Starting with the player with the most shields, players will claim a supply token of their choice from the bow of the ship and place it facedown on their scoring circle. These supply tokens will score points based on their value in the market at the end of the game. Additionally, if a player placed a bet on the clan that had majority control of the ship, then they take their winning bet and place it facedown on their scoring circle.<br/><br/>The game ends after seven ships have set sail. Players calculate their final scores by adding together the value of their supply tokens with the value of their winning bets. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players can either secretly pay off or openly move a spy one space on their turn. Each player has an account of $10,000 and can bribe spies in increments of at least $100. If you move a spy, another player may challenge the move. The two players then slowly reveal how much money they each have on the spy in question. If the challenger wins, the move is rescinded. If the defender wins, the move stays and the challenger loses his next turn. Players need to cooperate against whichever player is closest to victory.

        "description": "From the publisher: &quot;Since time immemorial, the Kindred - vampires - have stalked unseen by the mortal masses upon whom they prey. Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Exploration and adventure are created by the game board being made up of randomly placed tiles which are uncovered as the knights reach them.  Tiles can be fixed locations or glades where a randomly chosen role card can reveal a spell or a denizen.  Denizens act in different ways, depending upon its nature or the throw of a die.  Some help the knights, others hinder.  Players compete against each other, but can also work together to defeat a denizen.  The first knight to complete his or her quest and exit the Mystic Wood wins the game.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     The Mystic Wood Extension Kit<br/><br/><br/>",

With a map that extends from the Sinai desert to the Nile river, battles ranging from close support of front-line army units to deep strikes into Egypt can be simulated.<br/><br/>Using the Downtown: Air War Over Hanoi, 1965-1972 air combat system, modified to depict the unique features of the war above the Canal Zone, the game will feature all the major aircraft types to feature on the southern front. Features new to the game will include SA-3 and SA-6 missiles, man-packed SAM systems, Shilka self-propelled AAA and AS-5 cruise missiles.<br/><br/>Designed by Terry Simo based on Downtown: Air War over Hanoi by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood. <br/>Art also by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood and Nicolás Eskubi<br/><br/>",

More than 700 British bombers are dispatched to the distant city of N&uuml;rnberg. As the bomber stream crawls across the German Reich, it is set upon by swarms of nightfighters. Following the bombers' contrails the figthers infiltrate the stream in great numbers and before the moon can set, they pick off bomber after bomber. The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles back towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely. Soon afterward, the C-in-C of Bomber Command, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, calls off the Battle of Berlin.<br/><br/>BOMBER COMMAND is a game of the night war in the skies over the Reich in World War II.<br/>The game recreates the great RAF bombing raids against the heart of Germany and the defence of the German Luftwaffe's night fighter arm.<br/><br/>Based on an air combat system derived from the award-winning Downtown and The Burning Blue 'raid-scale' games, Bomber Command details the tactics of night fighting.<br/><br/>The German player must manage flak, Himmelbett zones, Wild Boar and Tame Boar tactics. RAF 'main force' raids are supported by Mosquito diversions, &quot;Gardening&quot; operations (mining of seaways) and decoy raids. Two card decks--one for each player--are used to resolve the complex interactions of electronic countermeasures and radars, along with other operational factors such as Mahmoud patrols, Flower raids, and Beleuchter illumination units. A detailed bombing resolution system depicts the difficulties of marking targets and area bombing at night.<br/><br/>There are two scenarios:<br/><br/>1. Berlin covers raiding from the 1943 Hamburg firestorm to the great Battle of Berlin and the RAF's defeat over Nuremburg in March 1944.<br/><br/>2. Downfall recreates the period from the Summer of 1944 to the collapse of the Luftwaffe in the face of fuel shortages and the RAF's &quot;bomber support&quot; effort.<br/><br/>The game is fast-playing and raids typically resolve in 2 hours or less.<br/><br/>",

Each turn two ten-sided dice are rolled to make two two-digit numbers that determine where you visit (a roll of 3 and 7 creates the numbers 37 and 73). All players write each of those numbers in a location on their map. The regions they can write in are restricted by cards turned up in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>New abilities to take riverboats and ferries will help you tour the city and become a jazz legend.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player draws a route on their map, starting with a low number and visiting adjacent locations with higher and higher numbers.

        "description": "In Fancy Feathers, by order of your baroness, you begin to search for noble pheasants for the pheasantry, moving along a path via a simply but really tricky mechanism, collecting valuable cards and avoiding annoying ones. Sadly, you are not alone. Snatch the most beautiful birds to finish the game with the most precious animal collection.<br/><br/>When setting up, choose six of the twelve card types included in the game. In total, 924 different combinations are possible! Shuffle the cards, then remove from the game as many cards as three times the number of players, then lay out five cards face up in a row, placing the player tokens in a random stack. On a turn, move your token as far along the row as you wish to land on a card or another player token. If at the start of your turn you were alone on a card and at the back of the row, collect the card you were on, along with any others behind you. After you move, if necessary, lay out cards from the deck so that five cards lie in front of the player who is farthest down the row, then whoever is farthest back in the row takes the next turn.<br/><br/>Once the final cards from the deck have been placed in the row, you can choose to exit the row instead of moving, and the game is now over for you. Once all players have exited, tally your scores to see who has the most points.<br/><br/>Fancy Feathers works with up to six players. but to play with more than two people, you need additional copies of the game to have the required numbers of animal cards and wooden discs.<br/><br/>",

Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the D-Day on the American beaches at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.<br/><br/>Normandy: The Beginning of the End, while utilizing &quot;Paths to Hell&quot; standard rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:<br/><br/><br/>     Landings<br/>     Battalion officers<br/>     Paratroopers rules<br/>     Recon rules<br/>     Amphibious Tanks<br/>     Waffen SS<br/>     Fallschirmj&auml;ger<br/>     Free French troops<br/><br/><br/>One A4 chart with many overlays including a whole beach making a large map. Normandy: The Beginning of the End has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.<br/><br/>Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit officers to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units.<br/><br/>Representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.<br/><br/>Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase<br/><br/>The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other mopboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios. Each map hex represents a distance of approximately 150 to 200 metres.<br/><br/>The following components are included in this game:<br/>&bull; 2 3/4&rdquo; countersheets with German/American and Free French vehicles (AFV and transports) and weapon units (Mortars, MG, AT, AA guns, infantry guns, artillery,&hellip;).<br/>&bull; 2 5/8&rdquo; countersheets with German/American and Free French troops and officers.<br/>&bull; 1 5/8&rdquo; countersheet with common markers.<br/>&bull; 4 Isomorphic mapboards.<br/>&bull; 8 Overlays.<br/>&bull; 3 Charts &amp; Tables cards.<br/>&bull; 2 Battalion Battle Stress Charts<br/>&bull; 17 scenarios.<br/>&bull; 1 Standard rulebook.<br/>&bull; 1 Exclusive rules booklet.<br/>&bull; 2 Six-sided dice.<br/><br/>",

In Trollhalla, you join forces with your fellow trolls to sail the seas in search of islands filled with pillage and plunder. Crunchy livestock, nervous monks, panicked princesses, piles of gold, and casks of grog await you! But watch out for Billy Goats--if you&rsquo;re not careful they will knock parts of your precious stolen cargo out of your boat!<br/><br/>With so many goodies lying about on these islands, it feels like you&rsquo;ve died and gone to troll heaven, or perhaps someplace even better -- Trollhalla!<br/><br/>Object<br/>Players take turns placing trolls on the board. Trolls emerge from below each ship&rsquo;s deck ready to plunder and scout the seas of Trollhalla! Trolls placed on ships claim plunder from nearby islands when a ship sails. Trolls placed in the sea will scout for destinations and determine where these ships sail, and also award players cards that perform special actions. The player who uses his trolls to fill his private boat with the most valuable collection of plunder wins the game!<br/><br/>",

There are one 22&quot; x 17&quot;map, and two &frac12;&quot; counter sheets including Nationalist, Republicans, Italian, French, German, Portuguese and British units. The sequence of play is quite classic: Mutual Administrative Phase (Events, replacements, reinforcements, withdrawals), Nationalist Movement-Combat, Republican Movement-Combat, Victory/Attrition Phase. Supply is checked for both sides at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>The main trouble designing this game was how to simulate the first months of the war and the transition to a more conventional conflict during and after the battles for Madrid (October 1936-March 1937). The main unit during the firsts stages of the war was the &quot;column&quot; formed by a mix of police, army, paramilitary forces, volunteers, etc. The &quot;column&quot; tactics was used during the Moroccan wars, and consisted in separating a force in small independent groups, highly mobile but with few possibilities of supporting each other. These tactics were mostly used by the Nationalists, but also by the Republicans. For the Nationalists, it worked against the militias of the early months of the war but failed against a better organized, armed and commanded army during the battles for Madrid. To simulate this, most early Republican units have two steps: the first would be the &quot;column&quot; or &quot;militia&quot; side, the second the &quot;Ej&eacute;rcito Popular&quot; (People&rsquo;s Army) side. After passing a &quot;Conversion&quot; or &quot;Militarization&quot; phase, the Republican columns are flipped to their EP side. The &quot;Militarization&quot; , that began during the Fall of 1936, was the conversion of the politically enthusiastic but poorly led and trained militia in more orthodox military units. The Nationalist columns are divided between &quot;Army of Africa&quot; columns and the rest. Their colonial units are two-steppers and are withdrawn and substituted by brigades and divisions during 1937. The O.B. of the first months of the war is also a problem. Between July and November 1936 both sides formed dozens of small military and paramilitary units, called &quot;battalions&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;, &quot;regiments&quot;, etc., etc. It is rare to find two authors that have the same OB, and the few that offer an Order of Battle are rather imprecise. Sometimes the same column receives different names. One author names it after their commander, other after their area of operations, and so on... so I had to compare and check which column was cited in most of the sources.<br/><br/>",

Every round of Imaginarium is as different and individual as each person. So call your friends and immerse in the magic atmosphere now!<br/><br/>Box contents:<br/><br/>- Game board with clouds.<br/>- 98 large cards with crazy pictures<br/>- 7 colorful, specially trained flying elephants<br/>- 49 tokens with numbers, 7 of each color.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Place your elephants on the start cloud of the game board. Shuffle the deck and deal 6 cards to each player.<br/><br/>Each turn one of the players becomes the leader. He chooses one of his cards, lays it in the center of the table, face down, and says his association with this card.<br/><br/>Other players choose a card each from their hand, which best matches the leader&rsquo;s association, then proceed to lay it in the center of the table, face down. The leader shuffles placed cards and puts them in row, face up.<br/><br/>Players must guess which card the leader has in mind. Each player chooses a token with the number correlating to his guess-version, then places It number-down on the table. When all players have made their decisions, they turn over the tokens.<br/><br/>- If all players have guessed the leader&rsquo;s card correctly, then his elephant retreats three steps back. The elephants of the players stand in place.<br/>- If none of the players managed to guess the leader&rsquo;s card correctly, then his elephant retreats two steps back. Other players move their elephants forward on as many steps as the number of people who chose the same card.<br/>- In all other cases, the leader&rsquo;s elephant and the elephants of those players, who guessed his card correctly, move up three steps. Moreover, all players, including the leader, move their elephant forward as many steps, as the number of people who chose the same card as them.<br/><br/>In the end of each turn all played cards should be discarded, and each player gets one card from the deck. Next player in the clockwise direction becomes the leader. The game ends when all the cards in the players&rsquo; hands are played. The winner is the one whose elephant moved the farthest.<br/> Special fields<br/><br/>Some clouds on the board are marked with special symbols. If the leader&rsquo;s elephant stops on one of them, his association gets restrictions:<br/><br/>- (number 4) &ndash; The association must contain exactly four words.<br/>- (question mark) &ndash; The association should be made in the form of a question.<br/>- (Adidas logo) &ndash; Association should relate to any well known brand. The name of the brand doesn&rsquo;t have to be mentioned &ndash; the association may be made with its slogan, campaign, etc.<br/>- (TV) &ndash; Association must be related to movies, cartoons, TV series or TV programs.<br/>- (book) &ndash; Association should be presented in the form of a story.<br/><br/>",

Fortunately, being a peaceful people you have chosen not to fight over what little there is. Instead, you set out in your seagoing Wa&rsquo;a (canoe) to fish and gather crops from the many nearby islands. The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village. Can you win the race against time and the sea, and prove that you are the best gatherer of all?<br/><br/>In Tahiti the goal is to collect crops (coconuts, taro, bananas, spice) and fish from the surrounding islands to score points with bonuses for making full sets and acquiring the most of their family favorites which are hidden from the other players.<br/><br/>The game starts off with just your home island and its immediate neighboring islands. Players build up the archipelago of fertile islands with the guidance of Haumea for the first part of the game until all islands are in play. Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.<br/> During all this the players travel by Wa&rsquo;a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa&rsquo;a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa&rsquo;a. At the end of the year, the one who most efficiently gathers food for their family wins.<br/><br/>",

Tokens are moved in a clockwise direction along the track on the game board according to the value on the cards played. The first player or team to move all of its tokens to the target area first wins.<br/><br/>What distinguishes Dog Royal from Dog are two twists: First, Dog Royal includes a number of special cards not present in the previous game. You can move 1-7 spaces, switch the location of two tokens, draw one token to another like a magnet, equal the value of the card previously played, and more.<br/><br/>Second, each of the four tokens controlled by a player bears a symbol &ndash; king, knight, citizen, jester &ndash; and each such token has a special power. The king, for example, cannot move more than seven spaces on a turn, so all cards with a higher value cannot be used to move the king, but the king cannot be bumped off the track by any token other than another king. (Players can choose to keep the symbols face-down and treat all tokens the same, if desired.)<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn he takes two actions:<br/><br/>&bull; He launches a stone across the ice, flicking it with his finger toward the target on the other end of the game board.<br/><br/>&bull; To improve the positioning of his stone or the chances of it staying in place, he can choose to use either a small or large hammer or a totem. With a hammer, the player moves the stone according to the size of the hammer. As for the totem, the player sets it on top of the stone; if the totem falls off the stone, the player can shoot it again on a later turn.<br/><br/>If your player or clan has one or more stones closer to the center of the target than the other clan, you score points. The first player/clan to collect six points wins.<br/><br/>A note about the different editions.<br/><br/>Caveman Curling (2012)<br/>Kairn (2010)<br/><br/>There are significant production differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling, though the game play is almost identical between the two versions. Kairn (200 copies) was designed and self-published by Daniel Quodbach in 2010. Blackrock Editions and Scorpion Masque produced 1000 copies of Kairn and released it at Essen in 2011. Gryphon Games version of the game has yet to be produced, pending the conclusion of a current Kickstarter campaign that was organized to gauge demand for its version. Caveman Curling is scheduled for mass production in January, 2012, and to be released in late February, 2012. The first and only production copy of the Gryphon version will arrive in the US on December 14, 2011 and a video will be made showing the differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling.<br/><br/>",

Now you have to deliver . . .<br/><br/>In Nanuk, each player bids for how long he can stay on the trail and how much he will bring home. Each boast must be greater than the one before, until one hunter refuses to raise the bid, saying &quot;You're doomed!&quot; Then the hunt begins. Will the hunt leader make good on his boast, or will the doomers be right? Every player decides secretly to help . . . or to let it fail.<br/><br/>Beware Nanuk, the great polar bear, who can end any hunt in failure. If you find an inuksuk, it will protect you &ndash; once. If the hunt is successful, the hunters share the animals collected. But if the hunt fails, the doomers score instead.<br/><br/>Nanuk is a fast-playing, highly social game of bidding and bluffing for 5 to 8 players.<br/><br/>",

Take turns in arranging the songs on your timeline in chronological order, while taking a trip down memory lane.<br/>The first player to collect 10 hits is crowned the HITSTER!<br/><br/>HITSTER is the perfect game for an evening with lots of laughing, singing, dancing and sharing memories. Simply open the box, scan a song card and let the music do the rest to create an instant party. So what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>     Scan: The DJ scans the card using the HITSTER app and follows the on-screen instructions. A song should start playing.<br/>     Place: Position the music card: The player to the left of the DJ positions the card face down (without peeking at the underside) in the correct spot on their timeline by placing it to the left/right or in between the other music cards in front of them, with the earliest song on their left.<br/>     Flip: Flip the music card: If it is in the correct position, they get to keep the card. Otherwise, discard it unless another player has correctly placed a HITSTER token. Cards of the same year can be in either order, even when that song was released earlier in that year. Now the DJ plays a new song and it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/>     Win: Play continues to the left until one of the players has 10 cards correctly positioned in their timeline. That player is the winner of the game and earns the title of HITSTER!<br/><br/><br/>Tip: add the Hitster tokens into the mix for an even more exciting game.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     With more than 300 guilty pleasures HITSTER: Guilty Pleasures will create an instant party for everybody&hellip; guaranteed!<br/>     Everybody is invited for the HITSTER party!

Each animal has a unique way to earn you money: Kangaroos score by the square of their number, so if you want to score them, you should try to get a large group; lions are worth big bucks, but if you score lions, then only the lions score; camels are a decent $5 each, but they score zero if any lions are present; squirrels steal money from the other players; and moose score the most, but each moose must be paired with a squirrel in order to score.<br/><br/>Penguins don't earn you money, but they get you penguin tokens. A penguin token can be used to add another die to your group, or to reroll as many of your dice as you wish. This makes it very valuable to start your turn with a fistful of penguins...<br/><br/>The basic version is intended for casual family play and to teach gamers the faces of the dice.  If you are rating the game for a BGG audience, please play the advanced version before rating the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "292 BC, the Colossus symbolizes the wealth of the Greek island Rhodes. Egyptian ships arrive in the harbor with gold. Greek farmers produce goods on their lands. To expand and develop, they need income, so they set sail to the harbor with goods from their lands. It is uncertain what the earnings for the olives, grapes, grain and goat milk will be this time...<br/><br/>Rhodes is a (light) expert game with high interaction, several tactical &amp; strategic options, and a unique dynamic market system triggered by ships sailing into the harbor, which automatically adjusts the prices for the goods offered at the harbor. The players collectively have control in this. Will you sell your goods, or will your fresh products end up in your storage to be used in future rounds? Smart merchants profit from opportunities in the market &mdash; but this also creates new opportunities for the farmers who receive income when other players buy their goods.<br/><br/>Interaction in markets, production, and player sequence providing interesting dilemmas for the players. Some farmers expand their lands with the earnings. Others develop smart skills to bypass the markets or to get victory points in different ways. It is also possible to create a monopoly or at least a scarcity of goods. Indeed this game has some very interesting market elements, but players who follow a one-sided strategy have little chance of being victorious.<br/><br/>",

They take turns playing cards from their hands to attack other players with stylish moves like the dreaded &quot;Running up the Wall-Spinning-Flipping-Kick&quot;. A defending player can answer back with a block card, or counter attack with certain powerful cards. If an attack gets through, the defender loses chi (health). When a player runs out of chi, he is knocked out, and the battle continues until only one Kung Fu master &mdash; the True Master  &mdash; remains standing.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Fighting is easy to learn, plays quickly and captures the flavor of Hong Kong's famous cinematic battles.<br/><br/>",

Completely re-written rules and reworked charts simulate all the major aspects of the First U-boat War, while all-new artwork immerses the player in the atmosphere of the period.<br/><br/>Your mission is to destroy as much entente shipping and as many capital ships as possible, while advancing your crew quality, winning awards and increasing your commander rank - all while attempting to make it home amidst diminishing odds of survival as the war progresses.<br/><br/>Conducting patrols is the heart of the system: each game turn you will resolve encounters against individual ships, convoys, Q-ships and enemy aircraft. Situations you will face will demand  decisions such as...<br/>How will you engage a convoy?<br/>Do you risk closing range for a potentially more lethal attack?<br/>If the engagement is at night, will you conduct a surface attack?<br/>With ammunition dwindling, will you try to follow a convoy, or will you look for easier targets?<br/><br/>Every decision you make during the U-boat war determines whether you and your crew come home as heroes, failures - or not at all.<br/><br/>The game was designed by a ten year BGG veteran and was developed and playtested with the help of the U-boat game aficionados in the BGG community.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>This third printing of the award-winning initial game in GMT's GBACW series offers upgraded components and information throughout. If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.<br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><br/><br/>    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..<br/><br/><br/><br/>    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). <br/><br/><br/>So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.<br/>     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.<br/>     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?<br/>     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.<br/>     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. <br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 Scenario Booklet<br/>    1 Great Battles of the American Civil War Rules Booklet<br/>    6 Full-color Countersheets.<br/>    3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    1 Player Aid Card (11&quot; x 17&quot;)<br/>    1 Union AM Sheet<br/>    1 Confederate AM Sheet<br/>    1 Union Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Confederate Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Gettysburg Turn Track &amp; 2nd Disorder Card<br/>    1 Orders Chart/Terrain Effects Card<br/>    1 10-sided die<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Richard H. Berg<br/>Developer: John Alsen<br/><br/><br/>(user's description:)<br/><br/>The third edition, otherwise known as the &quot;2004 edition&quot; of this very popular tactical level simulation of the battle of Gettysburg.  The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.<br/><br/>Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.<br/><br/>This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot dead by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo, a series of events propelled the great nations of Europe to prepare for war.  By August 3rd, Germany had declared war on both Russia and France and was preparing to invade France through neutral Belgium.<br/><br/>In Brave Little Belgium, you assume the role of either the Germans or the Allies (Belgians, French, and British) at the start of World War I.  As the Germans, can you quickly smash through Belgium without committing too many atrocities? As the Allies, can you slow down the German advance and halt their plans to capture France?<br/><br/>This quick-playing wargame uses a point to point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the beginning of World War I on the western front.  The game takes place over the period of time between August 4 and August 27, 1914.  Each turn represents three days. In each turn, you pull chits representing the different generals and armies in the battle.  A pulled chit allows you to move that army and battle opposing armies.  Random event chits are also included and when you pull and activate them, you can use them to help you or hurt the other player.<br/><br/>If you are the German player, you must try to get through Belgium as quickly as possible while also destroying the two major forts at Liege and Namur.  If you can do so quicker than it historically occurred, you win the game.  Anything less than this is a draw or a win for the Allies.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts an event on both sides, with the year in which that it occured on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!<br/><br/>Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Portuguese canning industry developed throughout the 20th century, going through periods of great splendor and of extraordinary importance in the social fabric of communities close to fishing centers. After the huge growth due to the immense supply of troops in Europe that World War II brought, the industry went through a period of stability with the consolidation of the quality of the products and the establishment of markets abroad.<br/><br/>Lata (&quot;tin can&quot; in English) is the name of the raw material for the containers in which the fish is packed, and it also turned out to be a popular designation for the product. In this game, players manage local canning companies in the 1950s and produce and sell the famous canned sardines or canned mackerel, the two main canned fish in the first decades of the industry, before the appearance of the very popular tuna.<br/><br/>The game takes place over six rounds. In each round, players buy a batch of fish, tomato or olive oil, which they then can use in their factory. These preserves will then be sold to markets. This operation will result in money that will be used to buy scorecards and increase the factory's production capacity.<br/><br/>The order in which each batch of raw materials is chosen is given by an auction of action points that players secretly make by sliding their disk to the left on the action track of their individual board. Whoever gives up more opportunities for action chooses the best lot, but it is clear that having more possibilities for action is vital to produce more and reach the best markets!<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points (VP), which are awarded at the end of the game by the scorecards, wins.<br/><br/>Lata is the second game in the &quot;Quinas Collection&quot;, following the success of Caf&eacute;, the first game in the line.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It's a short, brutal three laps as you jockey for position, ram your opponents, and leverage bonuses and your titan's abilities to race across the finish line!<br/><br/>The game board is an infinite circuit that wraps around at opposite sides. Each circuit has specific features that allow for interesting tactical maneuvers. Movement is governed by drafting dice from a pool rolled at the beginning of each round. If you choose a die that matches the color of your titan, you regain a life point.<br/><br/>When you ram into another titan by moving into the same space, you push that titan and deal them damage. There are also ways to lay traps on the circuit that will damage titans who encounter them. If you get KO'd due to taking too much damage, you'll spend a turn resetting right where you were knocked out, but you're not out of the race.<br/><br/>Each titan has a special ability that can be activated once each round. Moving into certain bonus spaces on the circuit also grant players bonus cards that can be played for additional effects.<br/><br/>",

Plunder your way to glory and fame!<br/><br/>In Piratoons, each turns begins with a treasure of boat parts and equipment being revealed. All at the same time, each Pirate rushes to allocate crew in an effort to plunder the best loot by placing their crew meeples on individual items as bids. Each piece of treasure goes to the player with the most crew invested in the item, but only after removing all tied bids. Therefore, Pirates need to stay alert for sneaky opportunities to cancel out an opponent's efforts or for chances to swoop in and steal a disputed treasure.<br/><br/>The unclaimed loot is auctioned off with doubloons earned by your crew and then the ship construction begins. Pirates score points for having the most money or equipment, or having the fastest, best, or largest ship. Sets of tiles and unfilled boat sections also add and subtract from your score. The player with the most points after eight rounds is the most notorious Pirate.<br/><br/>A featured component of the game is the central loot chest formed by two double-sided boards with raised edges. Before each turn this treasure chest gets loaded with random face-down treasure, then it's sealed, flipped, and revealed simultaneously to the eager Pirates by removing the board on top. The mad rush of plundering in real-time (there is a 15-second sand timer included) and the spatial puzzle to build the best ship possible are the key ingredients of the game's experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DRCongo explores a hopeful hypothesis that if enlightened industrialists worked to develop the economy of this mighty country, then it would escape the clutches of a crippling insurgency.<br/><br/>Players build industries and expand a transport network of river, rail and roads. Oil, minerals and crops are produced and if sold via the Atlantic port of Matadi, players reap rich rewards. Players develop their own cities and hydroelectricity can be sold to these.<br/><br/>The game is built in four game layers with layer two introducing insurgents and peacekeepers, layer three the Government, and layer four strategic interventions by other countries.<br/><br/>The game is played on a map showing the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and their &quot;capital&quot; towns. Transport routes are shown and include the major rivers and railways and export routes. In a turn a player may carry out one of five actions: build industry, place transport, develop city, produce resources, or sell resources. A neat and tidy economic game is made complicated by the presence of insurgents at game start, and these are suppressed and eliminated by use of players peacekeepers. This is a typical Ragnar Brothers dice combat system&mdash;simple but bringing tension and fun to proceedings.<br/><br/>",

Drawing well is not required &mdash; just being clever in selecting your hints.<br/><br/>Each round, one person is the dealer. This player looks at their word, then shuffles the card into the cards for the other players and distributes them randomly. By doing this, one player will have the same word as the dealer, but nobody &mdash; not even the dealer &mdash; knows who it is. The dealer then draws a picture, and you want to hint at your word so that ideally only the person who has the same word will understand what you're depicting. In the subsequent guessing phase, all players (including the dealer) guess which player got the same word as the dealer. Points are awarded based on the number of incorrect guesses, but the dealer and their partner have to guess correctly to even get points. How vague do you want to be in your drawing efforts to still get your message across without anyone else knowing it?<br/><br/>",

Before beginning the game, players take some time to memorize the images on the cards in the circle, after which all the clue cards are turned over.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a player's turn, s/he places the Sherlock card next to a card, then names the object on the card Sherlock is next to and turns the card over to check. If s/he is correct, s/he moves around the circle, in the direction of the arrow, the number of spaces specified by the number on the card. S/he then guesses the object on that next card; if s/he is incorrect, all the cards are turned over again for the next player. If s/he is correct, however, s/he continues moving the Sherlock card around the circle in the same fashion. If the Sherlock card lands at a card that is already face up, the player takes that card and her/his turn is over. A new card is turned over from the draw pile, everyone takes a moment to memorize it, all cards in the circle are turned over, and play resumes with the next player beginning their turn.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 6 cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HISTORY<br/>Anno Domini 1482. For the past few centuries, the Iberian Peninsula has been a complex battlefield of crossed interests, kings' ambitions and noblemen's intrigues. The Muslim power, once uncontested under Cordoba's Caliphate banners, lies languidly in the last Moor stronghold in Al-Andalus, the marvellous city of Granada.<br/>The last rulers of the Alhambra (&ldquo;The Red One&rdquo;) have been buying peace from the powerful Christian kingdoms for decades. Weakened by internal family divisions, they now face their darkest nightmare: a nuptial union between Castille and Arag&oacute;n in the figures of Isabel I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs.<br/>Through cunning diplomacy and negotiations, large armies are congregating to push to the sea the last Muslim presence in Western Europe. The Pope promulgates the last Crusade and military orders join the mixed army of Castille and Aragon, along with mercenaries all over Europe. The Nasrid Kingdom tries to gather its men and garrisons, sending messengers to North Africa for military support and reinforcing the numerous castles and watchtowers all over its lands.<br/>But deception and treason will play their part (Ferdinand II will be the main inspiration for Machiavelli's &rdquo;The Prince&rdquo;). Boabdil is conspiring to reach the throne in the city of the pomegranates whereas his uncle, el Zagal, is well known for his hit-and-run ambushes and guerrilla warfare. Will Catholic Monarchs be able to consolidate their dream of a united Iberian realm to continue towards world-wide domination? Will the Nasrid Kingdom accept the challenge and fight in a stubborn resistance until it breaks its enemies' will to continue the fight?<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/>Granada: The Last Stand of the Moors, is a game for two players in which they will decide the outcome of this decisive historical episode in less than 4 hours.<br/>Units are represented by blocks depicting their strength but also their origin: Castilians, Aragoneses, Leoneses and mercenaries for the Catholic player, and different clans like Banu Sarray, Zegr&iacute;es, Banu Bannigas and proper Nasrids for the Muslim player.<br/>The map is point-to-point, covering the ancient Nasrid Kingdom in southeast Iberia (present-day Spain). Granada, the capital, is the jewel of the realm: the game ends if it falls into the Catholic player's hands.<br/>Each season, players receive a predetermined number of cards which they can use to move their armies and fleets or rally new units. When a battle occurs, each regiment is summoned by the play of one card of its nationality, so as Tamerlan said: &rdquo;It is better to be present with 100 soldiers than absent with 1.000.&rdquo; In other words, be sure you have the right cards to send your troops into battle.<br/>As an almost Renaissance war, different weapons will also be present. Cavalry charges and crossbows will be extremely dangerous if well combined, whereas artillery will have a significant value when maintaining or defending sieges. Your fleets will fight for sea control, enabling the transport of North African reinforcements, Catholic naval movements or blocking sieged ports.<br/>Balanced and historically accurate, the game is easy to learn but difficult to master. The Catholic player will have to decide which invasion route to choose and whether he will create a massive army, leaving the Muslim player time to reinforce his strongholds, or go for a quick campaign where losses will be difficult to replace. The Nasrid player, on the other hand, will enjoy a central position but he will need to be cautious about the internal problems that can arise&mdash; the Boabdil revolt is almost an inevitable danger to face and crush.<br/><br/>As the Catholic player, will you gain fame and glory accomplishing the Reconquista and enlarging your kingdoms in one unified powerful state? And as the Muslim player, will you resist and save Granada or will you become the last King of the Nasrid dynasty?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Time scale: 1 year per 2-player turn<br/>Map scale: Point to point<br/>Unit scale: One block = 500-1500 soldiers<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;&nbsp;Mounted map&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&bull; 137 Rectangular blocks in various colors&nbsp;<br/>&bull; 11 rectangular tiles<br/>&bull; 2  Sheets of stickers (for blocks)&nbsp;<br/>&bull; 2  Draw bags&nbsp;<br/>&bull; 20 square castles (10 white, 10 black)<br/>&bull; 20 round watchtowers (10 white, 10 black)<br/>&bull; 26 small cubes (13 white, 13 black)<br/>&bull; 7  Wooden markers (various sizes and colors)<br/>&bull; 3&nbsp; Decks of cards (74 Christians, 67 Muslims, 17 Naval)<br/>&bull; 1  Victory Points track<br/>&bull; 2  Player Aids and 2 Battle Reference Cards (identical)<br/>&bull; 1  Rules booklet<br/><br/><br/><br/>GRANADA: <br/>&quot;El &uacute;ltimo baluarte de los Moros&quot; es un juego para dos jugadores que representa la campa&ntilde;a entre 1482 y 1492, durante el reinado de los Reyes Cat&oacute;licos Isabel I de Castilla y Fernando II de Arag&oacute;n, contra el Emirato de Granada de la dinast&iacute;a nazar&iacute;. Como Isabel se hab&iacute;a casado con Fernando en 1469, esto significaba que los dos poderosos reinos de Castilla y Arag&oacute;n ahora permanecer&iacute;an unidos, libres de la guerra entre reinos cristianos que hab&iacute;a ayudado a Granada a sobrevivir. Este per&iacute;odo marc&oacute; el final del dominio musulm&aacute;n independiente en la Pen&iacute;nsula Ib&eacute;rica y la captura final de tierras ocupadas por los primeros invasores musulmanes desde el a&ntilde;o 711. La conquista de Granada bajo Fernando e Isabel reflej&oacute; la modernizaci&oacute;n de la guerra que se produjo en toda Europa en el siglo XV. En particular, el ej&eacute;rcito de ambos monarcas era m&aacute;s grande y estaba compuesto por mucha m&aacute;s infanter&iacute;a que los ej&eacute;rcitos cruzados anteriores en tierras peninsulares y despleg&oacute; eficazmente artiller&iacute;a de asedio para asaltar las otrora inexpugnables defensas y murallas de Granada.

        "description": "That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged is a solitaire game covering the pivotal World War II years of the mid-1940 through 1942 period in the often overlooked Battle for the Mediterranean. You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.<br/><br/>Built upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.<br/><br/>ULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.<br/><br/>North Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.<br/><br/>Raiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.<br/><br/>With That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail? Play this game and find out!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale<br/>Game Length: 75 minutes<br/>Scale: Each unit is one Axis Front, each turn is a variable number of days or weeks.<br/><br/>NOTE: The game is currently out-of-print.<br/><br/>",

The tenacious defense of Quatre Bras by the Anglo-Allied troops saved the Prussians from receiving the full weight of the Arm&eacute;e du Nord.<br/><br/>Ligny, The Last Victory, 16 June <br/>Finally unleashed, the Guard pushed the Prussians back from the Ligny brook. Bl&uuml;cher himself was wounded and separated from headquarters. But Napoleon&rsquo;s hoped-for knock-out blow remained undelivered.<br/><br/>Wavre, Grouchy&rsquo;s Blunder, 18 June <br/>Napoleon separated the two wings of his army, ordering Marshal Grouchy on the track of the Prussians while he pursued Wellington.  Grouchy&rsquo;s prescribed route was wide of the mark, and took him to the outer flank, allowing the Prussians to interpose themselves between the two French wings&mdash;Bl&uuml;cher achieved a strategic reversal of the opening.<br/><br/>Waterloo, A Near Run Thing, 18 June <br/>While Grouchy frittered away time engaging the Prussian rear-guard at Wavre, Ney conducted the mid-phase of the battle like a rear-guard action in the Peninsular Campaign, failing to provide infantry support for his spectacular cavalry charges. Wellington fought a successful defensive battle, managing to cling to his ridge until the arrival of three Prussian corps. The broken French army retreated toward Charleroi; Grouchy&rsquo;s intact wing moved south-east toward Namur.<br/><br/>La Souffel, Rapp&rsquo;s Last Stand, 28 June<br/>Three days after Waterloo, Rapp woke up and began a slow withdrawal from the Rhine, pursued by the vanguard of Schwarzenberg's Army. On June 26 the heavily-outnumbered Rapp skirmished with the Austrian III Corps. Two days later he made a stand along the Souffel River, and the Austrians attacked.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: <br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/>Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns.

As experts in the time-honored business of firefighting, players attempt to extinguish their hand of cards while facing difficult challenges that hinder their abilities and choices. Players must decide when to play it safe and when to put it all on the line in this easy-to-learn game that is sure to turn up the heat around the gaming table!<br/><br/>Ladder 29 is played over several rounds in which players are dealt 13 cards each, pass three cards to the player on the left, then in reverse scoring order select a hotspot card; this card details the number of points awarded depending on the position the player goes out and a challenge that applies only to that player for the round: a player may only be able to lead singles, end runs in even numbers, or have limitations on what suits can be played in sets. The bigger the risk taken, the bigger the potential reward.<br/><br/>The first player to &quot;extinguish&quot; their hand by playing all 13 cards wins the round and earns the most points possible on their hotspot card. Play continues until additional players go out, with all except the one who goes out last earning points for their finishing position.<br/><br/>",

One by one you take turns picking up the top card and giving it to any (other) player you want. The cards can be a Bite (which brings you closer to becoming a wolf) or a Wound (which brings you closer to dead), or cards that cancel other cards. When a Night card is revealed, the full moon comes out and werewolves and humans get to pass cards anonymously, which is how the infection spreads and turns humans into wolves. Charms negate Bites and Salves negate Wounds.  3 Wounds (net) kill either a human or a werewolf. 3 Bites (net) turn a human into a werewolf, and only wolves can pass Bites at night.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted at the end of the third night, Wolf Zero(es) begins to GROWL and slowly other wolves (even dead wolves) join the growl!

Instead of tediously checking every car, every lap, the game uses a &quot;highlight reel&quot; method of generating exciting race action. You get right to &quot;good stuff!&quot; NO math exercises or constant index calculations and re-calculations--this game is NOT about crunching numbers. It's about high-octane thrills and super-charged race day drama! The result? A full race in as little as 45 minutes, packed with everything fans love about big-time pro stock car racing!<br/><br/>&quot;RED WHITE &amp; BLUE RACIN' offers an assortment of different stock car experiences. The game comes with an &quot;all star&quot; set of driver cards representing stars of the past decade. For an additional charge, you can purchase a set of cards based specifically on last year's racing season, including everyone from the champion in the point standings to the drivers who ran only a race or two, and track cards for every racing venue at which a points race was held. There's also a &quot;Stars of the 1980s&quot; card set, allowing you to revive memories of racing's exciting past. Or create your OWN pro racing universe with a card set from our fictional pro stock car circuit, Stock Car Racing America--or SCRAM for short!&quot;<br/><br/>RW&amp;B Racin' allows you to play through a race, including qualifying, with the use of 6 dice and a game chart.  Each turn a section of drivers, top, middle or bottom will be &quot;highlighted&quot; and drivers from the group will get a chance to move up in the race or maybe even take the lead!  But along with the excitment of the race comes &quot;trouble&quot; which can lead to a trip to the pits or even taking a driver out of the race.<br/><br/>Utilizing a simple yet elegant system, each driver is rating on gas (passing), brake (defending against getting passed) as well as 6 racing skills.  Also represented is how good a driver is at qualifying as well as how good the pit crew is at fixing the damage along the way.  It is a quick system to learn, but you will be amazed at how it captures the essence of stock car racing.<br/><br/>For more information and for a more detailed description of a couple of turns, check out the Plaay.com website.<br/><br/>",

When a virus attacks a tulip, the resulting colour patterns can be stunning, but the same virus weakens the tulip and makes reproduction a challenge. These rare tulips have always been quite expensive, even to this day. Many associate Tulipmania with these rare, high-priced tulips, but scholars report that this first bubble market, where buyers pay far more than something is physically worth because of the resale value, actually stemmed from the common tulip market over December 1636 and January 1637.<br/><br/>The Dutch, well-known for their trading prowess, were the centre of the tulip trade. During this time, the bubonic plague was killing off 1 out of every 7 people per year, so the common man saw little reason not to invest foolishly with a chance of making a substantial profit. These conditions created a situation where the prices of tulips skyrocketed by the day, until the prices hit a point that could not be sustained. The wily investors knew when to sell off, so those who profited most are those who sold just as the market started to turn sour.<br/><br/>You are playing one of those wily investors. You have a network of buyers and colleagues, all of whom are also trying to become wealthy. Your goal is to make smart investments, artificially raise prices, fleece your network at the best time, and then make your escape from Tulipmania with the most money.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    JKLM Online (Real-Time and Turn-Based)<br/><br/><br/>",

The two players each represent an abstract idea - Justice and Oppression - while a third, non-player faction, Compromise, both helps and hinders them while seeking, insidiously, to maintain the untenable and abhorrent status quo.<br/><br/>This is a card-driven game, but it's a rather atypical variation on that form. An Events Display contains cards belonging to both players and is public information. Cards played from the Events Display have effects depending on the type of card, and many cards can be placed into a player's Reserve, where they can be used throughout the game to take other sorts of actions. The size of one's Reserve is limited to the player's Organizational Capacity. This Capacity can be increased over the course of the game and also influences the strength of a player's actions, the minimum number of their cards drawn into the Display, and victory point opportunities.<br/><br/>The game is asymmetrical in that each player's mix of cards within the deck either play to their strengths or emphasize their weaknesses. Like many of Ms. Holland's games, it is about deadlock, with each side countering the other until one of them blinks. Advantages multiply over time and a single mistake might make your position irrecoverable. Tempo and momentum are terribly important because, at its heart, this is a racing game.<br/><br/>Both players score victory points for passing laws and forming political parties, and Justice scores victory points for growing support for their cause. Assuming neither player wins an instant victory by dominating the laws or reducing their opponents support to zero, the game ends when either the supply of victory points or the deck of cards is exhausted, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the American Civil War begins: the game's argument is that the Civil War was both inevitable and necessary, and through its mechanisms, the game seeks to illustrate why that is the case while still providing a deep and engaging play experience.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Thornmar Abbey, an ancient order of holy knights watches over a sealed portal to the underworld. The knights must protect the elders&mdash;ancient sages who sustain the seal. After decades of peace, the seal has weakened and demons are emerging from the rift. The demons seek to battle past the valiant knights and kill enough of the elders to fully break the seal before morning. Imbued with the power of the gods, only these brave knights stand a chance of protecting the elders and stopping an army of monsters from flooding into the world.<br/><br/>Knight Fall is an asymmetrical team game for one to six players. One team controls the knights, who must protect the elders and withstand the demons until dawn. The other team controls the demons, who seek to break the seal to the underworld before morning. &nbsp;<br/><br/>During the game, you choose a unique knight or demon, each with a variety of special powers&mdash;such as the Flame Knight&rsquo;s ability to surround his foes in fire, or the Bone Crusher&rsquo;s power to summon skeletal minions. The cards you play from your hand to perform actions can each be used in different ways, and a set of unique location tiles allows you to create the monastery with a different layout every game.<br/><br/>Knight Fall also features a campaign mode for one to two players. In this mode, you read stories while exploring the map of a haunted valley, drawing your path as you travel. Wander through crumbling churches, a sinister forest, and a dark mountain to stop the demons before the final battle at Thornmar Abbey. You must do whatever you can to keep your Knights alive; the death of each knight means one fewer hero to combat the invading demons in the final battle!<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

When either side reaches the top of their track, the Day of Black Sun event is triggered, giving a significant advantage to the side that reached the top.<br/><br/>In the second phase, players continue as before, but must also now fight the Final Battles at Wulong Forest, the Fire Nation Palace, and Ba Sing Se in an attempt to end the Hundred Year War. Players that stay ahead of the Fire Nation and succeed in all three battles will win the game. If any one team is completely defeated, or if 10 or more total Heroes are defeated, the players cannot stop the Fire Nation and have lost the game.<br/> At the start of each turn, the active player will choose one of three locations to visit. The Fire Nation will then attack, activating villain abilities in one location, and damaging Heroes in play.<br/><br/>After resolving the attack the active player will assemble a pool of dice based on their starting set-up and additional Hero card abilities. Players will roll and assign these dice in order to match symbols on Hero and Team abilities, Hero cards they wish to recruit, Villain cards they want to attack, and in Phase 2 Final Battles they must complete. Players match all of the symbols shown on a card to complete the related task.<br/><br/>The difficulty level can be adjusted based on players&rsquo; familiarity with the game and the degree of challenge desired.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dateline: Germany, 1933<br/>Jan. 30: Hindenburg names Hitler Chancellor.<br/>Feb. 27: The burning of the Reichstag. Hitler blames his political opponents and enacts repressive laws.<br/>Mar. 5: The Nazi Party wins the Federal elections amid a climate of fear and intimidation. From this point on, with a precise and constant rhythm, Hitler dismantles all of the democratic institutions of the fragile Weimar Republic and inaugurates a reign of terror, gradually establishing a ruthless and violent dictatorial regime.<br/><br/>The above is history, but what would have happened if instead of bringing Europe into a maelstrom of war, the infamous Austrian corporal had abandoned his plan of global domination and taken the path of peace? Would World War II still have broken out? Or would the Nazi hierarchy and German industry still have pushed the F&uuml;hrer to war with Poland? What would the dream of a Greater Germany have been without Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the other German territorial claims? Would the Western plutocrats or the Soviet colossus have fought the fascist dictatorship anyway and nevertheless inexorably triggered global conflict?<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period 1933-1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each takes the role of one of the three ideologies &mdash; Democracy, Nazism and Communism &mdash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game. (When played by two players, the two Ideologies exclusively under player control are Democracy and Nazism, while control of Communism alternates between the two players from turn to turn according to specific rules.)<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one year and is divided into three or four rounds. Players choose one political action and one event per round and attempt to perform the political action by rolling a die and applying some modifiers. They can affect the outcomes of their attempts by expending the ideology's political prestige. Events are activated immediately before the political actions are attempted; no die roll is required. If the political action succeeds, the card effects are applied accordingly. In any case, even when the attempt is unsuccessful, the political action cards played provide a varying number of political points (PP) that can later be expended by the players to perform activities.<br/><br/>After political actions, players perform their action round with the PP provided by political action cards. Players can influence the political allegiance of minor countries, exploit the economic resources belonging either to minor nations or to their controlled powers, recruit and activate coup cells to attempt coups d'etat to overthrow a minor country regime, send military forces to local conflicts or intervene in a civil war in a minor nation. All of these activities, as well as the effects of successful political actions, can bring victory points (VP) when the political allegiances of minor countries come under the influence or the control of Ideologies, or when territories or nations are conquered.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players check the outcomes of coup attempts, then proceed to a new round. During the clean-up phase at the end of each turn, players perform end-turn checks and calculate the production of military resources (MR) by the exploitation of economic resources claimed on the map. MR are put in the ideologies' force pool and expended to maintain the minor nations allegiances. The remaining MR provide additional VP and can be employed during the subsequent turns to intervene in local conflicts and civil wars.<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 108 strategy cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence their outcomes. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggles among the major powers, the race for armaments ahead of World War II and the buildup of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. All of these elements combine to determine victory.<br/><br/>",

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. <br/> Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.<br/><br/>This is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games. The first game, Stonewall&rsquo;s Sword simulates the Battle of Cedar Mountain in 1862.<br/><br/>",

During each game, the crew, outfitted with glitchy handheld sensors disrupted by a proximate nebula, search their labyrinthine vessel for equipment, weaponry, and supplies to load onboard escape shuttlecraft Remora. Along the way, the alien lifeform will ruthlessly attempt to stop the crew from carrying out this plan.<br/><br/>The crew and alien lifeform both have a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The alien can move around the starship, attack, cocoon, activate a malfunctioning android, sabotage equipment and the vessel's wiring, scurry into vents, and more; while the starship crew can fire flamethrowers, search, move or run, protect themselves with shock-prods, hide, shut security doors, and other actions.<br/><br/>Lifeform is a standalone, dice-less game that tells of twelve commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror. Featuring an innovative self-destruct game mechanism, and alternate playable endings, depending on crew success, Lifeform presents a tense, suspenseful adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.<br/>     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.<br/>     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.<br/>     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.<br/><br/><br/>If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.<br/><br/>When one player has at least ten influence points &mdash; which are on both people and expedition cards &mdash; and has fulfilled at least one expedition, the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points and at least one Expedition wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pitch, by whatever point-variant is played, is in the similar vein as Spades and Bridge as a trick taking game.  Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.<br/><br/>The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.<br/><br/>Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.<br/><br/>Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.<br/><br/>Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.<br/><br/>Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.<br/><br/><br/>Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are four possible points in a hand:<br/><br/>High: highest trump card in play <br/>Low: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick<br/>Jack: Jack of trump, if in play<br/>Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.<br/><br/><br/>        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Starting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.<br/><br/>If you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.<br/><br/>After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.<br/><br/>The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.<br/><br/>First team to 21 points wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Five Cucumbers is a trick-taking game with the goal of NOT winning the last trick!<br/><br/>It's not easy. You have two choices on your turn: Take over a trick by playing a equal or higher card or you must play your lowest card. It is not enough to keep a low card in your hand for the last trick as you will also need some high cards for taking over key tricks.<br/><br/>The player who wins the final (seventh) trick screwed up and must take cucumbers. Each player collects their cucumbers at the end of a round, and if a player has more than five cucumbers, he is out of the game; five cucumbers is the most you can have! In this way more and more players are excluded from the game until the final two are playing for victory!<br/><br/>Five Cucumbers is a modern variant of the trick-taking game Cucumber (Agurk, Gurka), which is well-known primarily in Scandinavia. We are excited to bring you our new version!<br/><br/>",

Play cards from your hand allowing you to gain followers, manage follower placement within your compound, and sabotage rival cult leaders. As you draw cards, Undercover Investigations can pop up and add investigators to your compound stopping you from recruiting followers. Not gaining the type of followers you want? Make exchanges with follower meeples in the supply to help you complete your agenda and fill your compound. As you recruit followers you will activate powers making it easier for you to fill your compound. When a player fills their compound, the end of the game is triggered.

        "description": "Dungeon of Mandom VIII is a press-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.<br/><br/>The start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.<br/><br/>The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.<br/><br/>Dungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.<br/><br/>",

Your goal in Kharnage is to take control of something strategically essential, astoundingly beautiful, and envy of all other nations: a hill. Yes, just a hill. Admittedly, it is a nice hill. It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there! To do so, you're going to have to drive off the armies of the other players by simply causing as much mayhem and bloodshed as possible.<br/><br/>Each turn, you choose one battle card. The player with the lowest initiative value begins and:<br/><br/><br/>     Deploys new units and applies skills if needed, or<br/>     Attacks (shoot or assault) one opponent with all points, or two opponents by dividing their points.<br/><br/><br/>The next player then begins their turn, doing the same. After all players have taken their turn, the player who destroyed the largest number of units wins 5 domination points, the second 3 domination points, and the third 1 domination point. The last one has only their eyes for crying.<br/><br/>Each time a player totally destroys an opponent army, they must yell &quot;KHARNAGE!&quot;, loud and clear, and stomp the table. They then take a Kharnage token worth 1 domination point. The other players must cheer them on by yelling &quot;YEAH!&quot;; if not, they lose a Kharnage token if they have one.<br/><br/>After four rounds, the warchief with the most domination points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Queen is dead! Long Live the Queen!<br/><br/>After a terrible epidemic, the Queen has passed on, leaving behind her twin daughters: the determined Princess Black Rose and the ambitious Princess White Rose. The Queen expected to live for a very long time and had not taken the time to declare which of the two would succeed her. Thus, the battle lines are drawn; each Princess has gathered her courtiers around her and is prepared to risk it all in pursuit of the throne. Will prestige be enough to rule the kingdom, or will it&nbsp;take intrigue and violence?<br/><br/>As a loyal servant for their Princess, each player must&nbsp;manipulate her supporters and use their abilities effectively to gain enough prestige to dominate the proceedings or humiliate the opposing Princess into relinquishing her claim to&nbsp;the throne.<br/><br/>In Long Live the Queen, each princess is placed opposite the other, with five character tiles placed face down on either side. Beginning with the starting player, the game takes place in turns, during which a player rolls the dice to determine which position is activated, reveals or activates characters, then may reposition a tile. To win, a player must guide their Princess to victory, either by accumulating enough of each type of prestige or by causing the opposing Princess tile to be turned face down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Southern Russia, early February 1943 -- In Stalingrad, the surrounded remnants of the once might German Sixth Army are being slowly and methodically exterminated. Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.<br/><br/>Von Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.<br/><br/>Dirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/>TIME SCALE     2 days per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     8km per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE     Soviet corps and divisions; German regiments, kampgruppen, and battalion-sized<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:<br/><br/>Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.<br/><br/>Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.<br/><br/>The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. <br/>Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.<br/><br/>The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RoadZters is a flicking game, very much like Bisikle, also from CEPIA Games. The whole concept is in the ZBall, a marble with a unique internal mechanism. Very easy to control, you can spin it in different ways to do high precision shots. The goal of the game is to flick your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Players have to compete on a 13ft track with obstacles in order to win the car race - but if you fall off track, you lose your turn! No cards or electrical devices are involved.<br/><br/>In RoadZters, the cars are also jumping ramps - so be bold and use your opponents to fly past them! The challenge is to control the effects of the ZBall and show a lot of self-control in challenges (slopes, fences, jumps, mouseholes, etc.). Will you manage to deal with pressure?<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Z-ball<br/>4 placeholder cars<br/>10 straight track parts<br/>16 curved track parts<br/>10 pillars<br/>10 fences<br/>1 jump<br/>1 mousehole<br/><br/>",

Then look no further! Rolling Stock Stars is an 18xx inspired card game that&rsquo;s for financiers who want to take it to the next level - it&rsquo;s a pure financial game with no map. Missing an auction by just one dollar can spiral your corporation into bankruptcy or lead to a hostile takeover.<br/><br/>In Rolling Stock Stars, players represent investors who purchase companies through auctions and later convert them to corporations. Subsidiary companies in corporations synergize with each other, bringing in more income. Additionally, each corporation has a unique power that allows you to explore a wide array of strategies. The game runs through transportation history starting from the early Prussian Railroads in the 1830s and eventually ending with airports.<br/><br/>In order to stand the test of time, you&rsquo;ll need to manage your corporations with brutal efficiency.

The player controlling that city can see all the cubes that must be delivered but can pull goods only from the right or left end of the row when loading them on the trains.<br/><br/>Once the clock starts, all players take their actions simultaneously, in any order, and repeating any action as often as necessary. To transport cargo, a cube must first be loaded onto a short or long train piece that is at rest in the player's home city train yard. No train can move without a crew peg, and no crew peg may travel beyond the adjacent city. In order to transport cargo to more distant cities, a train needs to stop and have the crew peg swapped or cargo exchanged between trains. While all this is going on, players must avoid dropping or spilling cubes when picking up or handing the train to another player. Additional terrain components such as tunnels and bridges can be placed between cities and act as additional obstacles to negotiate. When time runs out, calculate the score by multiplying the TWO LOWEST counts of cubes delivered to a city. Points are subtracted for dropped cubes, or cubes delivered to the wrong city and also for crew pegs that traveled beyond their adjacent cities.<br/><br/>With six players, each takes one of the six main cities, each producing goods which are delivered to the other five locations. In some scenarios with fewer players, each player may control multiple cities.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, they won't always listen. Before collecting resources, you have to drop all the workers in that resource's space through &quot;The Passage&quot;, a three-dimensional, mountain shaped tower where they will tumble and get stuck, leaving only a few to get out and actually collect that resource. The rest will have to wait to be knocked loose on a future turn.<br/><br/>So if you send a worker to the forest to collect wood and berries, they might end up in the mountains collecting herbs, on the plains hunting for fur, or in the &quot;Love Tent&quot; making...your population larger. They might also bring some predators out of The Passage with them &mdash; or not come back at all.<br/><br/>Players use the resources their workers end up with to arm their workers with spears and drums, to build a larger cave, or to create an invention, which earns victory points for their tribe. The first player to have 10 victory points wins!<br/><br/>",

The 4-8 player range works best.<br/><br/>One player (&quot;God&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; or the &quot;Demiurge&quot;) thinks up a rule (a &quot;law of nature&quot;) that governs the correct play of the cards.  Usually, the rule only involves the most recently correctly-played card, but it can be more complex.<br/><br/>The other players (&quot;Scientists&quot;) take turns playing cards (&quot;performing experiments&quot;) and race one another to see who can come up with a good hypothesis about the rule.  The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score.<br/><br/>Additionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a &quot;prophet&quot; who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves.<br/><br/>A very simple rule would be &quot;Alternate between black and red cards&quot;.  A simple but hard to discover rule would be &quot;Alternate between cards which have closed loops in their number or letter designations (e.g. 4, Q), and cards which don't (e.g. 2, K)&quot;.<br/><br/>The game was first published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in June 1959.

        "description": "An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;<br/><br/>",

They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.<br/><br/>But the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.<br/><br/>Victory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.<br/><br/>Victory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.<br/><br/>Players who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.<br/><br/>The main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player&rsquo;s offensive. A TO marker represents an area of logistic and administrative support from the Chief Commander of Stavka. Theaters of Operation markers are somewhat similar to PLUTO markers although slightly more tricky to handle.

Each player controls two lemmings that must make their way across a game board of hexagonal spaces; most spaces contain grassland and can be entered no matter which card a player lays down, but some spaces contain special terrain (water, hills, etc.) that can be entered only when the appropriate card is played.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2-6 cards in hand, with the number dependent on the player count. On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Discards any number of cards from hand, then refills her hand to six cards, or<br/>    Plays a card, then moves one of her lemmings.<br/><br/><br/>Each card is one of five landscape types and numbered 0-4. If the card played is equal to or lower than the value of the top landscape card of the same type, then the player adds the values of all landscape cards of this type, then moves her lemming up to this many spaces, crossing grassland and the depicted landscape type freely. If the card is higher than the top card of the depicted landscape type, then discard all cards of this type and start a new pile. Before moving her lemming, though, she places a bonus landscape hex of this type on the game board &mdash; ideally stifling the future movement of her opponents while scooting her own lemming further toward the goal.<br/><br/>If one or more lemmings are in your intended path of movement, you can push them aside before moving into the space, spending one point of movement for each lemming so moved. You can push your own lemming, if you set them up right &mdash; even across the finish line.<br/><br/>The first player to move both of her lemmings across the finish line wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the experiential table top game that is going to redefine what it means to play a game. Nyctophobia, which means &quot;fear of the dark&quot;, is a cooperative game of survival in which up to four players must work together to escape a maniacal predator chasing them in a pitch-black forest. But there's a wrinkle: Would-be survivors play the game with blackout glasses. Players cannot see the board and have to rely on touch to navigate their way to safety. So, are you afraid of the dark?<br/><br/>In more detail, Nyctophobia is a cooperative tactile maze game for 3 to 5 players. All but one of the players play the game completely unable to see the board. The blinded players make up the Hunted team. They are tasked with finding the car space on the board and surviving until the police arrive to rescue them. The sighted player is the Hunter, who is tasked with chasing down the Hunted and reducing one of the Hunted to zero health before the police arrive.<br/><br/>Nyctophobia includes two versions of the Hunter that you can use: the axe murderer and the mage. The axe murderer is stalking you and your friends in the forest, plodding forward without care or thought, chopping down the trees that separate you to get to you all the quicker; this is the most basic and carnal of all of the experiences you can encounter in Nyctophobia. The mage, by contrast, is a trickster. It's not enough for the mage to hunt her victims. Messing with their mind, manipulating the forest around them, and leaving the blind opponents more lost than when she found them is her aim. The mage can rotate the map, move trees around the forest, and generally confuse the players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "No good at quizzes? Great, because in this game we give you all the answers before you start. All you have to do is work out which of the eleven color cards in your hand correctly answers one of Colourbrain&rsquo;s crafty questions.<br/><br/>Get it right and you could be in luck. Now you need the other teams to get it wrong to walk off with the points &mdash; while they turn green with envy.<br/><br/>Each turn a player draws a card that shows a word. The active player also chooses a color-card from his hand that shows the color best matching the word. The other players also choose a color-card from their hands. Answer correctly and your pawn moves closer to the finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To explore Colorado, you will be armed with a marker and your map.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal map, and they start in one of two locations, opening that region for future exploration. Each player also has a hand of cards, and the cards in the deck come in six colors, with each color having cards numbered 1-3. On a turn, you ask another player to give you a card, e.g., a red 3. If they have one in hand, they must give it to you. If not, they must give you either a red card or a 3 &mdash; their choice. If they have no reds or 3s, they give you a card of their choice.<br/><br/>If you already have the card you received in your play area, discard it and take a gold nugget; if not, place it in your play area. All players then take one of the two actions listed on this card:<br/><br/><br/>    Red and green cards either give you a nugget or let you pay 1-3 nuggets to play a card of value 1-3 from your hand; when you play a card from your hand, it can't already be in your play area, and you immediately take one of the two actions listed.<br/>    Gray and purple cards either let you draw three cards from the deck or discard two cards of the same suit to play a card from your hand into your play area.<br/>    Blue and orange cards either let you check off a space on your map in a region you've already opened or check off the next space on your railroad; if the space you checked has a reward, gain it immediately.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, if you have all three cards of a color in your play area, discard them, then check the flag on a map region that is adjacent to a region that you have already opened. Finally, if you have fewer than three cards in hand, draw until you have three cards.<br/><br/>The purpose for all of this activity is to claim medals, which earn you points. You earn points for each region you open, and if you're the first player to open all regions of a color, you gain a medal worth bonus points. If you check all the spaces in a region, you earn a medal. If your railroad reaches the end of the line, you earn a medal. If you check all spaces with a certain symbol on your map, you earn a medal. Once a player has collected, the game ends at the end of that turn, then you tally all points to see who wins.<br/><br/>Use shrewdness and discernment when calling or giving cards that you can take advantage of without helping your opponents too much. Ideally, you will be able to earn the points of the many medals scattered on your individual sheet route, as well as on the common bounty board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players vie for control of six railroads in Argentina.  A deck of cards (3 Offer Stock, 4 Develop Settlements, 5 Construct Track) is used each round to determine player actions.  The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.  The player with the most money after the final payoff wins.<br/><br/>The fourth game in the Prairie Railroads Series.<br/><br/>",

The players represent various Factions vying for control of Arrakis, the desert planet. Each of the 6 playable Factions has a small set of thematical special abilities that allow them to break certain rules in the game.<br/><br/>Each turn, you will need to politicize, ally and employ the means of Kanly wisely, recruit new troops, ship them to the surface, and attack in just the right spot. Fate, in the form of the dice, can be controlled to a certain degree but still might thwart your plans; Sandstorms and the mighty Shai-Hulud plague the surface of Arrakis; A charismatic leader might tip the balance in a forlorn combat in your favour.<br/><br/>The game ends when one Faction or Alliance is in control of a certain number of Arrakis&rsquo; strategic Regions at the end of their turn, or after 6 whole rounds.<br/><br/>Inspired by and based on both, this game tries to find a middle ground between the complexity and duration of Dune and the excessive simplicity of Dune Express while staying true to former&rsquo;s general feel and steering closer to the lore of the original novels than both. Sounds a bit ambitious, I know.<br/><br/>",

All the players are responsible for the bird, mouse, and chipmunk's safe journey to their home in a tree at the end of the gameboard path.  Unfortunately the tomcat &quot;Max&quot; is a natural hunter and chaser (he can't help himself) and is a continual threat.  The goal is for the players to work together to get the three animals to the safety of the tree.<br/><br/>All the animals move based on the roll of two dice, each containing three black pips and three green pips.  A black pip moves Max one space, while green pips can be distributed by player consensus (teaches logic, consultation and decision making) among the other animals to move them.  Max moves more often and further than the other creatures who share the green pip rolls.  The players can opt to move their animals before or after Max; they may also use four cat treats to call Max back to the starting position, allowing the other animals to escape possible capture or lengthen their lead.<br/><br/>Each animal has their own special short cut on the game board to speed their journey or dart from Max; if they end a turn on their shortcut start space, they may immediately move to the other end; if they overshoot the entrance, they miss it.  However if Max ends a turn on any short-cut entrance, he takes it immediately (but will not eat any animal on the shortcut start.  Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and can't be returned to the start with a cat treat.  The other animals will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.  The players all win or lose depending on how successful they are at saving the bird, mouse and chipmunk from Max.<br/><br/>",

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.<br/><br/>Red Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before. If the Soviet player can weather the Nazi storm, she will rise from the ashes and become the powerful enemy that defeated Germany. You will see the tables turn as in no wargame before.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 2 weeks to 2 months<br/>Hex: 22 miles / 35 kilometers<br/>Units: Corps/Division for the Germans; Corps/Army for the Soviets<br/><br/>Game Details:<br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-30 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gulf Strike was designed to be the state of the art in Land, Air, and Sea modern simulation. Since its original release, Gulf Strike has shown its ability to simulate the changing character of the Gulf Wars from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its potential aftermath. In fact the original 1983 edition correctly anticipated the type and character of units the United States would send to the region in the event of a crisis. Seven complete scenarios cover the recent history of the region, plus the current Desert Shield operation, and portray the multitude of alliances possible to counter threats arising in numerous quarters. Complete air, land, and sea orders of battle for several dozen nations allow you to fight each conflict to its unpredictable and often startling conclusion.<br/><br/>",

See whether you can uncover the truth in echoes: The Microchip.<br/><br/>echoes is a co-operative audio mystery game. Using the free app, players listen to mysterious noises and voices that are connected to the playing material. Together they look for hints in the sound bites to bring the story parts in order and solve the case.<br/><br/>In more detail, your task is to assemble the 24 parts of the story in the right order; each part is represented by an object &mdash; either a game board or a card &mdash; and its associated echo. The entire story is divided into six chapters, with each chapter being represented by a game board. By scanning the objects with the app, you'll hear the echo connected with each object, and by using conversations and noises in the echo, you try to figure out which three object cards are associated with a chapter and in which order they should be placed. If you're not correct, the app will inform you which cards are incorrect or in the wrong place; if you are correct, you can listen to the entire chapter all at once &mdash; and you should since new, additional hints can then be heard.<br/><br/>The objects themselves also provide you with clues from time to time, so neglect no details.<br/><br/>",

Players can delve into the deck-building aspect of the game by customizing their own Team and play style. Heroes can be picked through an initial draft mode in which players alternate selecting among 30 different characters.<br/><br/>The unique aspect of the game is the interaction with the board, which adds an interesting tactical aspect as well as a strong thematic feeling to the concept of the card duel.<br/> No dice are involved in the game. Randomness is limited to the draw and is mitigated by the Farming and Backing phases in which players can manage their hand and retreat from their position on the map in order to draw more cards from their deck.<br/><br/>Hero cards can be used for multiple purposes: they can be played during combat or they can be discarded in order to gain Experience points and gold used to buy and upgrade powerful items during the game.<br/><br/>Combat takes place every turn on each Lane and is determined by a simultaneous action selection mechanism and a back-and-forth phase in which players take actions like playing Gank cards or activating combos and special abilities.<br/><br/>In addition, to increase tension during the match, there are also objectives (monster cards) that player can conquer through a simultaneous resource bidding occurring during specific turns.<br/><br/>The final goal of the game is to invade the opponent's base on the map, destroying the enemy towers and breaking through one of the Lanes on the board.<br/><br/>",

Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history.<br/><br/>Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they're needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer's Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide.<br/><br/>To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them.<br/><br/>The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns.<br/><br/>Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins.<br/>&emsp;<br/><br/>",

If you start your turn on a Hex tile that grants you a specific Resource, add the corresponding Resource token to your Resource Pool.<br/><br/>Phase 2<br/>During this phase, you get 4 Action points to spend, and you can use them to perform any of the Actions below in any order. Each Action costs 1 Action point. You can perform the same Action more than once on your turn if you still have Action points tospend. You do not have to spend all 4 Action points each turn, but unused Action points do not roll over to subsequent turns.<br/><br/>Your Actions include:<br/><br/>    TRAVEL: Move your Character from your current Hex tile (the Hex tile where your Meeple currently stands) to any adjacent Hex tile.<br/>    COLLECT: Move a Spell, Counterspell, or Resource card from next to your current Hex tile to your Spell Book by spending the required Resources shown in the card&rsquo;s Collection Cost. After you Collect a Spell or Resource card, immediately replace it with the top card from the Main deck. If you Collect a Counterspell card from the Counterspell deck, you do not need to replace it with a card from the Main deck.<br/>    REFRESH: Move the card next to your current Hex tile to the discard pile and replace it with the top card from the Main deck. You cannot Refresh a card from an Ancient Rune Hex tile or a Dusty Desert Hex tile.<br/>    REROLL: Choose any number of rolled Resource dice and roll them again. You cannot Reroll Cursed Crystals.<br/>    PROTECT: Remove 1 Cursed Crystal from your Resource Pool. Heads up: Any Cursed Crystals remaining in front of you will hurt you at the end of your turn!<br/>    CAST: Spend Resources to use a Spell card effect from your Spell Book. You can use each Spell card effect only once per turn. In addition to an Action point cost, some Actions (such as COLLECT and CAST) require you to spend Resources. Remove spent Resources from your Resource Pool by returning that Resource to the central area of Resource dice and tokens.<br/><br/><br/>Phase 3<br/>During this phase, you may absorb any remaining Shadow Fragments in your Resource Pool by moving your Shadow Tracker up by that amount. If you&rsquo;ve absorbed enough Shadow Energy and you are in your Base Form, you may immediately transform into Shadow Form.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow to WinWhen the dust settles and the echoes of the last spell fade, there can be only one victor.

As soon as you count five eggs in the pile, be the first to hit the pile to win one point! You must win three points to win the game. But, be careful not forget that when a hen passes by and there is an egg in the pile, the hen cannot help sitting on an egg, which means that egg disappears! And if a fox passes by and a hen is sitting, the fox hunts the hen and the egg comes back! Otherwise it would be too simple!

        "description": "This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.<br/><br/>",

The attacks, which covered an area spanning 90 by 80 kilometres (56 by 50 mi), were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a striped hyena, wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid.<br/><br/>Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 610 attacks, resulting in 500 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. The beast was reported killed several times before the attacks finally stopped.<br/><br/>",

Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. <br/>Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in. Leningrad survives capture only to endure a brutal, epic 900 day siege.<br/><br/>Can you, as the Axis commander, succeed where German High Command failed?

        "description": "Age of Rail: South Africa, title #4 in the &quot;Iron Rail&quot; series by Capstone Games, is a new version of 2011's South African Railroads, which was an extensive re-development of Pampas Railroads' sister game, Veld Railroads. Your goal is to have more money than anyone else, and you earn money by holding shares and getting dividend payments from railroad companies.<br/><br/>After an initial auction for the first shares of these companies, players take turns, choosing from one of four different actions: build track, develop settlement, offer stock, and pay dividends. These actions are limited; only one dividend action exists, for example, so when a player chooses this, the action remains blocked until that player's next turn, at which time they must choose a different action. Two &quot;offer stock&quot; actions are available, and three &quot;develop settlement&quot; actions; &quot;build track&quot; is an unlimited action and can be repeated on the next turn.<br/><br/>When players buy stock, the spent funds go into the company's treasury and can be used to build track. By developing settlements, you increase the value of stations, and a railroad's income increases when it links to stations. When dividends are paid, the company's income is divided by five (the number of shares) and paid to the owner of those shares, which might be the company if not all the shares have been offered.<br/><br/>After the sixth dividend, the game ends &mdash; but that final divided includes bonuses based on the number of company links and is paid out solely based on the number of shares issued, not all of the shares in existence.<br/><br/>",

And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...<br/><br/>The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.<br/><br/>If you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.<br/><br/>Your monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.<br/><br/>You should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.<br/><br/>In MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!<br/><br/>Finally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history. Somehow you will feel that all the glory should be given to you alone!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;This War Without an Enemy&quot; is a 2-player strategic block wargame, funding for launched on Kickstarter on 21st January 2020. The game centres on the First English Civil War, when the Royalist forces fighting for King Charles I were opposed by the English Parliamentarian troops and their Scottish allies, the Covenanters, in a struggle for political, economic and religious control of England.<br/><br/>The game engine will be familiar to anyone who has played a card-driven block wargame, but it adds a number of innovations in order to faithfully simulate both the warfare of the mid-17th century and the unique nature of this conflict that engulfed not only England but also Scotland and Ireland. The game features individual cards deck for each side, two thirds of which contain events. The card decks are adjusted from year to year to reflect the historical progression of the war. The regional nature of much of the conflict is recreated using a system of Leader and Regional blocks as well as rules for regionally-based recruitment. The usual block game mechanics for field battles have been modified with special rules for artillery, cavalry and infantry, while a completely new system has been designed for storming and sieges.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to acquire Victory Points through the capture of cities held by the opponent. In addition, the Parliamentarians can move closer to victory by capturing the King, represented by his own block. Five scenarios are included:<br/><br/>     The Full War: up to 26 turns. <br/>     The Early War: an introductory scenario of 8 turns.<br/>     The Mid-to-Late War: up to 18 turns.<br/>     The Mid War: an introductory scenario of 6 turns.<br/>     Prelude to War: up to 27 turns.   <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the crazy cat-collecting game Here, Kitty, Kitty!, your neighborhood has a cat problem, the problem being that the cats don't all belong to YOU! Unfortunately you can't just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All's fair in love and cat-collecting!<br/><br/>In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved.<br/><br/>The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reign of Witches is the 2020 Hollandspiele Hollandays Sale promotional freebie game, shipped to folks who purchase at least two games during Hollandspiele's annual sale. The subject of this small two-player card game is America's Quasi-War with France, viewed through the lens of factional conflict within the Federalist Party. One player assumes the role of the supposedly obnoxious and disliked President John Adams, and is opposed by that ten dollar founding father without a father, Alexander Hamilton.<br/><br/>The players purchase cards from a market, play those cards in front of them for influence in three categories - Politics, Military, and Opinion - and activate those cards for special effects. Political influence comes easier for a veteran intriguer like Hamilton than for the somewhat guileless Adams. Each player has an advantage within their preferred branch of the Military - Navy for Adams and Army for Hamilton. Opinion allows players to wage a war of words, usually by discarding enemy cards that have not had their powers activated.<br/><br/>Your goal is to best your opponent in at least two of these categories when the Coup of 18 Brumaire brings the Quasi-War to a close. But there's one more wrinkle: your score across these three categories must also best that of the non-player Thomas Jefferson, who has been quietly accumulating power and influence while you and your opponent are tearing each other apart. Beat Jefferson and you (or your preferred candidate in Hamilton's case) win the election of 1800. Come up short and Jefferson wins. This historical result is the most likely, but with skill and a little luck, you can defeat your opponent with enough strength intact to secure ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Players must contend with the effects of plague, tax rebellions, slanderous pamphleteers, and events from abroad. From the Haitian Revolution to the Battle of the Nile, from George Washington to Napoleon Bonaparte, this short little game with a tiny deck captures the chaos and flavor of a fascinating era in American history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player becomes a famous Walking Dead character while taking on the roles of Leader, Savior, Survivor, or Loner.<br/><br/><br/>    The Leader of the survivors is revealed to all and attempts to protect everyone while staying alive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Saviors, who hide their identities, aim to kill the Leader of the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Survivors, who also go incognito, aid the Leader in staying alive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Loner, who is of course working alone, tries to defeat everyone else while accomplishing his own objective.<br/><br/><br/>BANG!: The Walking Dead is interchangeable with the original BANG! game and plays much the same way. Players try to determine who is on which teams, then use their cards in hand to  attack others and heal themselves, ideally ending up with their team on top.<br/><br/>",

Goods come in four types &mdash; carpets, vases, dates, and (non-date) fruit &mdash; and these goods will be available at markets, with one more market in play than the number of players. Each double-sided market indicates how many face-up and face-down cards are placed there, in addition to the special power of that market.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, players bid to see who selects goods first from a market, with the bidding rules being set by the back of the topmost goods card in the deck. Whoever wins the bid pays their money to the bank, while everyone else keeps their coins. (Coins are victory points, so you might not want to throw away too many of them!)<br/><br/>The winning bidder chooses a market, uses the power of that market (if they wish), then takes all of the goods from that market, flips them face up (if needed), then loads the goods on their camels. A camel can hold goods of only one type, and if a goods type is on a camel, then you must continue placing that good on the same camel. Each camel has a goods limit, however, and if you exceed that limit, then you must throw away all of that type of good.<br/><br/>Each other player in clockwise order then chooses an unchosen market, optionally uses its power, and collects and loads its goods. Each player then has the option of selling goods from at most one camel, with each type of goods paying out in different ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Dates: Cards show 1-4 dates, and the more you sell at once, the more money you receive.<br/>    Carpets: Cards come in six colors, and you can't sell the same color twice in a batch. Again, the more you sell at once, the better.<br/>    Vases: Cards come in three types (with some overlap), and you can sell only one shape at a time<br/>    Fruit: Cards come in four types worth different amounts, and you can sell only the lowest-valued fruit.<br/><br/><br/>Place a 1 coin on the unchosen market, flip all the other markets, refill those markets with cards, then start the next round. When the deck runs out, complete one more round &mdash; selling once from each of your camels &mdash; then whoever has the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

The abilities of the playing figures change from one move to the next. Only if you realize the advantages of the division of four possible actions, make clever use of the different strengths, and plan ahead can you outsmart your opponent through tactical play and thus win the game.<br/><br/>Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Katarenga is a two-player abstract consisting of a variable board, 16 pawns, and rules of movement derived from Chess. Each pawn&rsquo;s move is governed by the colour of the square it moves away from (red = rook, yellow = bishop, green = knight, blue = king). For each game the board is constructed from four double-sided quarterboards, each of which can be placed either way up and any way round, yielding a total of over 24,000 different 8x8 boards. In the basic game your aim is to get two of your pawns to the opposite side without being captured. The same equipment can be used for playing a variety of other games with the same rules of movement and capture. Can you invent more?<br/><br/>",

Each time a card is played, the player adds a number to the sequence, and marks the generated number - the sum of the last two numbers - on the keypad (places a marker on the key). Because the keypad is a magic square (the sum of each row, column or diagonal is 15) the object of the game is to line up three markers or place three on the same key.<br/><br/>Hack Trick gameplay is deceptively simple, but you&rsquo;ll see, that it hides many combinations. In his turn, the player may ask the sum of the opponent&rsquo;s hand, than play a card or draw. When he plays a card he may capture opponent markers, moreover, he may sacrifice a marker to force his opponent to play a card in the next turn, or contrarily, protect himself from being forced. Markers can be used in five different ways, but be careful, the player who runs out loses!<br/><br/>Finally, the winner will be the player who knows how to defend and attack the positions, when to gather information, when to use the doubles, when to start a forced series, but above all how to find the right balance between forming a strong hand and tend to the final goal on the board.<br/><br/>",

Selling and buying shares on the stock market, seeking new sources of funding, laying track and placing stations, running trains and paying dividends are all basic elements of 18xx games.<br/><br/>In addition, 1865 Sardinia has several features that make it different from other 18xx titles. The most important distinctions are:<br/><br/>     a traffic based system that makes calculating company's revenues easier and faster<br/>     foreign investors (Dragons) trade in certificates in addition to human players<br/>     an absorption mechanism that allows companies to acquire each other<br/><br/><br/>Other interesting points:<br/><br/>     before phase 5, all companies start as minor companies with 40%/20%/20%/20% shares<br/>     converting a company from minor to major requires a direct route from a company base to a historical destination city<br/>     private companies become 2 trains when transferred to a company and also provide extra traffic<br/>     buying trains from bank makes the share price jump up<br/>     the last 2, 3, and 4 train comes with a discount<br/>     withholding money in company doesn't reduce the share price<br/>     tiles can be replaced with another tile of same color, provided the current connections are retained<br/>     bankrupt players are given enough loans to keep them in game, loans are then deducted from final score in the end<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDragons<br/>     during stock rounds, the Dragons will also trade<br/>     each stock round begins with a Dragon and Dragons also play between each player<br/>     dragons are interested in company's rank, an indicator based on the sum of trains phase and tokens on board, followed on a special table on the board<br/>     dragons will immediately sell certificates in companies ranked red and will buy certificates ranked green, according to a fairly simple and consistent algorithm.<br/>     players can buy shares from Dragons, but must pay a premium for well-ranked shares<br/>     share prices are adjusted down when shares are sold by Dragons or the company president<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTraffic system<br/>     when a company places a station marker, it gets to collect traffic chips from the board along the route<br/>     mines also produce traffic chips, but diminish in value as the game proceeds<br/>     each traffic chip is worth $10 in revenue<br/>     revenues are the smaller value of total revenue in traffic chips and train capacity available<br/>     phase 2 trains, for example, have 8 capacity each, so if company has two of those for 16 capacity and 14 traffic chips, it will make $140 in revenue, while adding three chips would increase the revenue to $160 because the capacity hits the roof at that point<br/><br/><br/>",

So you gather followers, fight off enemies and climb the steps to divinity.<br/><br/>STORY<br/>Realm of the gods: Loki, the trickster god framed Thor in a moment of distraction causing the hammer of Thor to fall on Tyr. Tyr the god who was guarding Yggdrasil, the tree connecting the worlds. Knocked out for a moment Tyr left Yggdrasil ungaurded. An opportunity for mortal viking to climbs the tree and become god. But only those who are worshipped and worthy can become a true god. Beware: when power is up for grabs, competition is an the horizon. And the gods... well they will play their part.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY (AND WIN)<br/>In Valda, every player finishes 5 phases during their turn. As a viking chieftan you roll dice to harvest rare resources for your tribe. Then you scavenge and explore the worlds by drafting and playing cards and actions. Building temples in the different God-domains is an important goal to gain divine abilities and get access to more powerful spells. But beware, enemies can attack you with the weapons of the Gods. Defend yourself and use your resources and shields wisely. Fight and build with honor to receive the grace of the Gods. Which God? That depends on your playing style. You like the aggressive playstyle, then is Surtur your man, you like having many options to eventually use the ultimate combo, then Freya is the one for you, and so on. Having a seat at the table of the most beautiful Asgardian palace beside the likes of Odin and Thor, that is your only goal. By playing cards, using your abilities and building temples you also gain valuable followers. The viking chieftan who has the most followers when the game ends, is worthy enough to climb the world tree Yggdrasil and becomes a God! Oh.. and he also wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Knowing that neither your courage nor your health insurance lets you take part in such a dangerous race, you and your friends instead choose the safe way to enjoy these races and start betting on the mopeds.<br/><br/>While the six mopeds race three times around the racetrack, trying to avoid getting stuck behind other mopeds or at the choke points, you assess the situation round by round and bet on your favorite mopeds. Who will finally win, place, or show?<br/><br/>In Full Throttle!, no one controls the mopeds, with them racing around the track in a &quot;self-controlled&quot; manner. Each round, reveal racing cards and move the mopeds around the track. Then draft the racing cards to be used as your hidden bets. The undrafted cards are reused for future movement of the mopeds. Choose your bets carefully because the cards you choose will make those mopeds go slower.<br/><br/>After three exciting laps around the racetrack, the race ends after the first three mopeds cross the finish line. Have you collected the best set of racing cards to win Full Throttle!?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Galaxy: The Dark Ages is the much-awaited sequel to AH's Titan: the Arena.  Originally, this game was Knizia's Grand National Derby, but two successive changes in theme have added much chrome to the design.  The basic idea remains intact: there are eight alien races, and at the end the only three will remain; bet on the aliens you think will make it to the end.  Numbered cards, starships in this case, are played below the alien homeworld cards.  As soon as each alien has a ship card and there is a definitive loser, said loser alien race is removed and a new round starts.  Several of the alien powers differ from those of TtA.  This version of the game adds further detail by calling the betting chips &quot;starbases&quot;, which may be targeted by opponents' ships to lower their value.<br/><br/>",

After fighting different Bull Demon minions, the climax of the game is the battle against the Bull Demon King. Game cards and custom dice combine for fast, tense action and critical choices enhance the Pilgrims&rsquo; skills during the game.<br/><br/>Journey is designed for 1 to 4 players, each controlling one of the four Pilgrims: Tripitaka, Monkey, Monk Sha and Cho Hakkai. The game's AI controls the Demons and other creatures. Diverse playing styles are possible, with a strong emphasis on cooperation because the players win or lose as a team. Each game will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the quest and the style you play.<br/><br/>The core game comes with ~10 quests, each with different goals and unique rules. Do you ruthlessly hack and slash, killing all demons in the Pilgrims' path? Or take a more virtuous path, cleansing the demons' souls, saving villagers and collecting good karma. Your decisions affect the Pilgrims' abilities, skills and equipment. Killing demons may be quick but can you risk accumulating that bad karma? Side quests may enhance your Pilgrims' skill and karma, but with more demons spawning, can you afford to spend that time?<br/><br/>Solo play is almost identical to multi-player games. Instead of multiple players controlling 1 or 2 pilgrims each, 1 player will control all four Pilgrims. There are no other changes to the game.<br/><br/>",

Plus any of the new survivors from Wasted Wilds can be played in the other Maximum Apocalypse games as well!<br/><br/>If you're unfamiliar with Maximum Apocalypse, it is a cooperative roguelike game filled with adventure, exploration, survival and strategic choices. It was built from the ground up to be very modular and infinitely replayable.  Maximum Apocalypse has inspired a Role Playing Game and spawned numerous expansions featuring everything from Bugs, C'thulhu and Kaiju. There is a vast wasteland out there to explore and Wasted Wilds has been designed as the perfect starting point! The Frozen Wilds campaign walks players through a mission by mission tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A computer malfunction at the Bedlam Zoo has short-circuited the gates for all the enclosures and the animals are escaping and making their way to the zoo exit. You will work together with your fellow zookeepers to round up all the animals and lock their enclosures before it's too late.<br/><br/>Zoo Break is a crisis-management game that requires dynamic and cooperative problem-solving. You will spend your turn deciding how to use limited actions to move about the board, collect and trade supplies, capture animals, and lock cages, all while evading injury and coping with other challenges caused by the animals marauding through the zoo. Escape and Move cards control the animals with maximum variability, leading to endlessly different game scenarios.<br/><br/>Success hinges on the keepers' ability to anticipate, adapt, and make strategic decisions, applying their skills and resources to regain control of the zoo. It's complex and suspenseful enough to keep adults riveted, but also playful and inviting to ambitious, game-loving kids. (Difficulty can also be regulated using a simple card selection mechanism at the start of the game.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Get Me Off This Planet! is a fast-paced, &quot;gateway&quot; game where you use the moon and spacecraft to get your Aliens off the planet before it explodes!<br/><br/>The game has a casual space theme and never takes itself too seriously. Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is easy to learn, fast-paced game, where everyone feels engaged and &quot;in it&quot; until someone has won or the planet explodes!<br/><br/>The objective of Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards, and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes, the player with the most saved Aliens wins.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s special about Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is that lift off points (space vehicles) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off. For example, a rocket ship takes a lot of resources and can carry 6 aliens from various players. This creates a great dynamic where initially all players are working together to get, say, the first half of their aliens off the planet, but once it starts thinning people become more competitive and tricky about things using action cards to manipulate the moon, change the board, create tornadoes, etc.<br/><br/>",

The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!<br/><br/>In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...<br/><br/>This all new deluxe tin edition features a reworked version of the rules, all new artwork (by Felideus Bubastis), screen printed meeples, and the Ghost Meeple mini-expansion (with rules).<br/><br/>",

If a player creates the shapes depicted or create colored groups of the appropriate size, she'll gain or lose points as shown on the task card(s). Each player then randomly determines a different starting tile for the round and places it on her board. Then the building cards are revealed one at a time, and all players take the tile shown and add it to their board by placing it in the top row of their row, then letting it slide down into place among the other tiles. This continues until all tiles have been placed.<br/><br/>Players then score (or lose) points for the round, and the player with the highest score after three rounds wins!

All players now write down each number rolled on any prefecture of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue prefecture and a 2 in one yellow prefecture. If the purple die is rolled, you can place this number in a prefecture of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-purple die as any color. However, neighboring prefectures &mdash; including those in different areas connected by blue lines &mdash; can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a prefecture of the appropriate color. (If all the prefectures in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)<br/><br/>After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on her map wins.<br/><br/>",

These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!<br/><br/>Lost Legacy: Fourth Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: The Werewolf and Undying Heart. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set. As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>    Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>    Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>    End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.<br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>Note: Undying Heart was previously released as Lost Legacy: Undying Heart but AEG published it with a new title and with some card name changes.<br/><br/>",

Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.<br/><br/>The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.<br/><br/>Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks. As action cards are used they open up new possibilities and empower the character&rsquo;s battlecrests. Build up to decisive strikes or refocus to get powers back. Every character has a unique set of actions and preferred tactics, so no two battles play the same.<br/><br/><br/>Shots ring out in the overgrown forest.

A font of ancient knowledge provides her with a flexibility that mere mortals lack.

The tribe obeys the laws of the Four Elders, themselves guided by the most venerable of the Elders, the Neta-Tanka. When the Neta-Tanka enters the twilight of life, the Frostrivers gather at the Sacred Grounds to designate a successor. During this ceremony, each clan presents a young leader who will need to demonstrate generosity and the ability to provide for the tribe in order to become the new Neta-Tanka.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>When it is your turn, place a worker on the board. All the players place their workers, one at the time, until everybody has placed all their workers.<br/><br/>Then, in the order of the turn, the players trigger all their workers.<br/><br/>Think ahead, because some actions require other actions to be triggered beforehand! For example, if you want to get pelts, the &quot;Hunt&quot; action must have been triggered earlier in the turn. And when you skin the game to get the pelts, then the meat becomes available for the other players. It is crucial to remember the turn's order when you place your workers, or they might have nothing to do when you resolve your actions!<br/><br/>Another key point of the game is that the spots on the board are linked with each other. Triggering 2 actions that are linked with each other gives you a boost (by improving those actions, or giving you extra resources, ...).<br/><br/>There are different ways of scoring points in the game.

Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.<br/><br/>In this two-player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.<br/><br/>There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1918, along with the hypothetical Fuller or 1919 offensive. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups so you could, for example, try the French 1909 plan vs. the German Schlieffen Plan.<br/><br/>Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.<br/><br/>",

Each player tries to gather the necessary components in order to produce magic elixirs, powders, talismans and even magical creatures. For each completed creation the player scores points &ndash; and the harder the task, the more points a player scores.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 76 cards, with each card featuring one of 16 elements on its bottom half and a magic formula or spell on its top half. Each player start the game with four cards in hand, and four cards are laid face-up in the &quot;Desk of Elements&quot;; players can use these public elements to complete a formula in hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws until he has five cards in hand, then he plays one or more cards from his hand. He can:<br/><br/><br/>    Discard a card onto the Desk of Elements; he scores one point if that element is not currently present on the Desk.<br/>    Take elements on the Desk to complete a formula on a card in his hand. He scores points equal to the number shown on the formula, then places the element cards face-down over the bottom half of the card so that all players can see the formula. His turn then ends.<br/>    Use one or more previously completed formulas, along with any elements required and available on the Desk, to complete a more difficult formula. He can use formulas in front of himself or other players to do this. Any elements under formulas reused this way are returned to the Desk. Any opponent who loses one or more formulas this way scores half the points of the more difficult formula just completed. The player's turn then ends.<br/>    Plays a spell from his hand to take a card from the desk into his hand, to decompose one completed formula or to transform one formula into another. After playing a spell, he must take another action, which could be playing another spell.<br/><br/><br/>After the deck runs out, players continue to take turns until no one has cards remaining in hand. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The rules include detailed treatment of movement, terrain, search and destroy operations, special operations, firepower, airmobility, riverines, brigade-level formations, limited intelligence, and auxiliary units in each scenario.&quot;<br/>That's the blurb from the back of the original Victory Games edition of the game.<br/><br/>There are several small scenarios and a couple of campaign games. Each year is divided into four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter), and each season has two turns (so, roughly 6 weeks per turn). The map scale is roughly 6 miles per hex and units are, generally, battalions or regiments. During the operational phase, players take turns (who gets to operate is determined by the NLF player) conducting operations with their units to destroy the enemy, clear the roads, take towns and cities, or just reposition units. In the Campaign Game, during Seasonal Interphases, each player decides whether and how many additional units and/or resources to bring in to the fight. The game features hidden VC units, airmobility, riverines, national morale, pacification, ARVN effectiveness, and many other nuances that allow the player to grasp the some of the experience of what it might have been like to conduct the war in Vietnam.<br/><br/>An updated reimplementation of the Victory Games' classic.<br/>This edition changes some of the rules as well as clarifications.

The timer, meanwhile, will &quot;eat&quot; the cards, one at a time, if they aren't snatched.

The Red Joker brings OKKO and his party once again on our tables!  The game will be included in the company&rsquo;s Chronicles series and it will be an entirely standalone game. Although this addition to the series will have many differences to its ancestors, those who are familiar with Guardians Chronicles, will get into this game in no time, as the basic rules will be quite similar to it. If you haven&rsquo;t heard of this great story, its time to find out about OKKO&rsquo;s incredible universe!<br/><br/>OKKO is a demon hunter along with his companions Noburo, Noshin and Tikku he wanders the lands of the Pajan Empire. Noburo is the most faithfull companion of Okko. He is a Hanyo (half man &ndash;  half demon) who hides himself behind a red mask. Noshin is a monk who can communicate with the Kamis and has a special preference for&hellip; sak&eacute;! Tikku is a young fisherman (at that time) who wishes to become a monk by the guidance of Noshin. The four of them are on a mission after Tikku&rsquo;s request to help him find his kidnapped sister. This quest will lead the four of them to situations and places far from what they had ever imagined&hellip;<br/><br/>The Heroes in OKKO Chronicles will have a character card with characteristics and talents. They will also come with Power Cards which will represent the Hero&rsquo;s special abilities, secret techniques and other unique skills.<br/><br/>This latest addition to the Chronicles family will plunge you into the heart of a dark and fantastic incarnation of medieval Japan. Journey to the four corners of the war-torn kingdom of Pajan as you join the ronin monster-slayer, Okko, and his brave companions as they hunt down a variety of fearsome supernatural foes.<br/><br/>Whether you choose to harness the devastating power of fickle Elementals or rely on the cold surety of ancestral steel; you must combine your martial prowess with all your cunning if you are to uncover and destroy the demon in your midst.<br/><br/>Developed from those used for Guardians' Chronicles, OKKO&rsquo;S CHRONICLES introduces completely new mechanics. Still easy to learn and fun to play, these rules have their own unique flavor and specific features that allow you to become totally immersed in this fascinating universe. These developments include:<br/><br/><br/>     Weapon, Armor and Item cards with which to equip your Heroes, allowing you to tailor them to the situations they face.<br/>     A unique investigation system to enable the Heroes to unmask the terrible Oni hidden among the occupants of the daimyo&rsquo;s palace.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch depicts the period of English history in the 15th century that became known as the Wars of the Roses. It is based on the premise that the powerful noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist royalty as pawns in a greater game for the control of the kingdom. Players manoeuvre Noble pieces representing the leaders of 24 major families in England and Wales, in order to gain control over a Royal piece of their own, while also eliminating rival Royal pieces and weakening their opponents. It is a game of political and military action, and the ability to react to unforeseen events. You win by a combination of military, political, and diplomatic skills.<br/><br/>There are four games in Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch:<br/><br/><br/>     The new Kingmaker II for 2 to 5 players, for those who prefer a shorter game with a greater variety of win conditions, including prestige gained through domination of the government, cities, and the church.<br/>     The original Classic Kingmaker for 2 to 6 players, where the only path to victory is through controlling the last crowned Royal piece.<br/>     Extended Classic Kingmaker with extra Crown and Event cards along with additional optional rules for Parliament and battles, in which dice can be used to determine whether Nobles and Royal pieces live or die.<br/>     The Solo Challenge, for solitaire play.<br/><br/><br/>Each player controls a Faction consisting of one or more Nobles. Each Noble piece on the board has a corresponding Noble card displayed by the controlling player in their Faction space. Players can strengthen their Nobles with a Title, an Office and other cards, such as Bishops, Mercenaries, and Ships.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn, you draw a card from the Event deck, and all players follow its instructions. During your turn, you may move your Noble pieces, fight battles, and conduct sieges. You may also have the opportunity to call Parliament to gain the benefit of additional Titles and Offices, and perhaps the chance to crown a new King. At the end of your turn, you draw from the Crown deck, which may enable you to add a new Noble to your Faction or increase the power of a Noble already in play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two millennia ago, a loose federation of planets combined to form the Galactic Empire. From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?<br/><br/>Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)<br/>     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)<br/>     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)<br/>     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)<br/>     Research (select an available technology)<br/><br/><br/>In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.<br/><br/>The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.<br/><br/>",

The tribes compete for opportunities to hunt dinosaurs, recruit tribesmen, and discover new technologies, vying to be the first with enough knowledge and prestige to invent fire and usher in the age of modern humanity!<br/><br/>You have two resources to manage: Food and Teeth.  You must spend Food each turn in order to keep your Tribe from starving.  Teeth indicate prestige among the tribes.  Use Teeth to bid for the conch and to acquire Cavemen and Caves.<br/><br/>Each turn, cards are drawn from the deck to fill a common Card Pool.  Players take actions based on what is available in the pool.  For example, if a Beast is drawn into the Card Pool, you can hunt it for Food and claim its Teeth as a sign of your bravery.<br/><br/>If you hold the conch during the Action Phase, you benefit by taking your Action first and taking a second Action after everyone else has gone once.  Players can bid Teeth to take control of the Conch from another player.  This can be important to get the first pick of the cards in the Card Pool.<br/><br/>The game features 21 different inventions that allow players to evolve diverse strategies, capitalizing on their tribe's individual strengths. There are challenging decisions every turn as players must evaluate what resources are available, guess what their opponents will do, and weigh the amount of risk they're willing to take.<br/><br/>",

You have cards representing Night Terrors, and the more of them you combine in the right order, the more monsters will come to life, and the more horrifying they become. Create monsters that will make your opponents gasp in horror. Nourish them with your own fear and make them stronger. Only then will you achieve victory and become the Master of Terror!<br/><br/>Each Night Terror is also associated with one of four Legions of Horror: Necromunculi, Constricti, Mansters, or Chimeridae. A Terror's legion is indicated by the color of the card's background: blue stands for Necromunculi, brown for Constricti, green for Chimeridae, and red for Mansters. A creature can be made up of any Night Terrors, but players are better off weaving Creatures out of cards that all belong to the same legion.<br/><br/>The game continues until one of the players completes five Creatures&mdash;this player immediately becomes the winner.<br/><br/>During your turn you perform two actions, after which the next person to your left takes their his? turn. You can select any pair of actions out of three possibilities (you can also perform the same action twice).<br/><br/>Possible actions <br/>A) Take a card from the deck <br/>B) Discard as many cards as you like from your hand and take half that number from the deck<br/>C) Play a card from your hand and activate a Creature abilities (if the Creature is complete).<br/><br/>As soon as you complete a Creature (by adding a head to torso), perform all of its abilities top to bottom, starting with the Creature's head, proceeding with its torso, and ending with its legs. Abilities are activated one at a time in a very specific order. You cannot refuse to perform the abilities.<br/><br/>If the completed Creature is comprised of Night Terrors <br/>of the same legion (in other words, if all three cards that make up the Creature have the same background color), each of your opponents must discard one card of that legion from their hands before its abilities can be performed. If your opponent does not have an appropriate card, they must discard any two cards.<br/>Creature Abilities<br/><br/>&bull; Herald: turn over two cards form the deck. Place them in front of you according to the usual rules if you can.   Discard any cards that you cannot play.<br/>&bull; Weeper: take any two cards from the deck.<br/>&bull; Mocker: play one card from your hand according to the usual rules.<br/>&bull; Executioner: add the top card from any other player's Creature to your hand.<br/>&bull; Scavenger: discard any vulnerable (incomplete) Creature.<br/>&bull; Devourer: discard the top card from any of your Creatures other than this one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, hopeful people sent glowing paper lanterns floating toward the heavens. Out of nowhere, clever magical phoenixes appeared, soaring through the sky. As they flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch changed the lanterns into new stars! The phoenix who can create a constellation of seven new stars will be the champion of a world looking for light!<br/><br/>Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is a new entry in the classic Tsuro series. The game shares a bond with the foundations of the venerable original: play tiles, move pawns, and stay in play, but it introduces a revolutionary board that allows for the double-sided tiles to flip and rotate throughout the game, creating diverging paths and opening up new strategies.<br/><br/>Featuring gorgeous phoenix miniatures, beautiful lantern tokens, and unique gameplay elements such as life tokens that allow your phoenix to be reborn from the ashes once per game, Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is a new chapter in the legacy of Tsuro!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bardwood Grove is a tableau-composition euro game where each player assumes the role of a fantastical Bard. Set in The Five Realms universe (Merchants Cove, Rise to Nobility, Cavern Tavern), players will adventure to the Halfling Realm, the home to the finest, highly-talented, and most-legendary Bards of all the land.<br/><br/>As Bards, players will manage a unique tempo dial mechanism to build temporary Song tableaus from your deck, while exploring and activating locations around the lush woodland city. Each Bard starts with asymmetric skill decks that match their style, such as the Bardbarian, Sword Dancer, and Wardrummer. Learn new Bardic skills, tell tales and perform gigs, soothe the dissonant creatures invading the Grove, and contend with other Bards for the most Glory and Fame. Once all Glory has been collected, the Bard with the most combined Glory and Fame wins!<br/><br/>Each turn, players draw two cards from their unique skill deck and play one to their Story (discard pile) for instant benefits, while the other is added to their Song (tableau). Bardwood Grove challenges players to carefully craft their Song tableaus, coordinating them with their Composition cycle that governs how frequently they sing. As players strategically use resources to upgrade their decks, Songs will release powerful combos and allow players to interact with multiple locations. This creates a unique ebb and flow to the game, as players build their songs, and then decide when and where to sing them.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that Bardwood Grove is full of hidden secrets. As the game is played and decisions are made, players will unlock content and evolve the game naturally.  An achievement system tied to the choices and performances of each game will guide players through a series of unlockable content.  As new content emerges through each play, the game will provide players with new content that is based on unique outcomes and player decisions. Grove locations will change, additional Bardic skills can be unlocked, Bard decks become more powerful, new Bards arrive in town, and a variety of characters (both good and bad) can enter the game.<br/><br/>Unravel the mysteries of Bardwood Grove!<br/><br/>",

Yes, the dice have been replaced by small beer barrels, and the active player each round is the innkeeper who shares their brew with players who keep their requests modest.<br/><br/>The game includes nine barrels &mdash; two of them being special ones &mdash; that are rolled out of a dice cup. The normal barrel bases show numbers, while the special barrel bases show symbols that allow the innkeeper to double other values or cancel them. After each roll, only the values/symbols of &quot;standing&quot; barrels count.<br/><br/>After the active player has rolled for the first time, the other players secretly place cards with numbers in front of them. The active player then decides whether to reroll, change the values, or end their turn. Once their turn ends, the guests reveal their cards and sum them. If the innkeeper's total is less than this sum, they win this round, keeping all the beer for themself while the guest with the highest card actually loses points! If the innkeeper's total is higher, each player scores the value of their played card, and the innkeeper keeps the rest.<br/><br/>When one player has at least 75 points, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Hymn Vol. One includes two games: Gettysburg: The Tide Turns and Pea Ridge: The Struggle for Missouri.<br/><br/>Battle Hymn is a new brigade-level game system that simulates the chaos of the America Civil War using a simple activation system combined with a detailed combat system. The system&rsquo;s designer, Eric Lee Smith, originated the &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; activation system in his game &ldquo;Panzer Command&rdquo; and later used it in &ldquo;Across Five Aprils,&rdquo; Battle Hymn&rsquo;s forerunner, both published by Victory Games. Units are organized by command, usually divisions, and activate for movement when the command&rsquo;s activation marker is picked from the cup. The system uses traditional mechanics for movement, with units differentiated by type, but adds a level of detail to combat that feels almost miniatures like. In fact, the system is designed for easy conversion to miniatures. When one side has the initiative they decide when their combat phase occurs, without it, you don&rsquo;t know when it will happen.<br/><br/>Units have strength point steps, which are either &ldquo;formed&rdquo; or demoralized, and losses are taken point by point. Based upon the latest research into Civil War combat and tactics, units suffer attrition in both losses and demoralizations until they finally shatter and are removed from the map. There are two combat phases, each of which consists of two rounds of combat. Engagements are fluid, with retreats and advances setting up unexpected confrontations during the second round of combat.<br/><br/>Battle Hymn is a &ldquo;player&rsquo;s game&rdquo; designed to play fast and provide lots of fun and historical insight. With scenarios taking as little as an hour, up to eight hours for the full campaign, there is plenty of variety. The system is streamlined and does not have the complications seen in other games, such as logistics and leadership hierarchy. Here, it's all about strategy, movement, and fighting.<br/><br/>Gettysburg: The Tide Turns needs no introduction as to subject, but the treatment is noteworthy. Using a graphics approach based upon the maps produced by the US Government after the war, the map is a pleasure to behold. There are six scenarios in the game, some of which have alternatives for additional variety.<br/><br/>Pea Ridge: The Struggle for Missouri simulates the decisive battle of Pea Ridge, which determined that Missouri would stay in the Union. It could have gone the other way. This is a classic meeting engagement with the Confederates on the offensive and outnumbering the Union for once.<br/><br/>Optional rules include hidden movement and more randomization during combat (more historical and also simulates async computer play).<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>Note: Some scenarios have alternatives making them in effect two or more scenarios.<br/><br/>Gettysburg<br/><br/>Pickett&rsquo;s Charge - 3 turns, 45 minutes<br/>The Best Three Hours (Devil&rsquo;s Den) - 3 turns, 1 hour<br/>The Accidental Battle (Day One) - 11 turns, 3 hours<br/>Longstreet&rsquo;s March (Day Two) - 9 turns, 3 hours<br/>The Tide Turns (Day Three) - 7 turns, 3 hours<br/>The Battle of Gettysburg (campaign) - 31 turns, 8 hours<br/><br/>Pea Ridge<br/><br/>The Surprise Attack (Day One) - 9 turns, 2 hours<br/>Missouri Redeemed!

        "description": "In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.<br/><br/>Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.<br/><br/>During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.<br/><br/>There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.<br/><br/>Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.<br/><br/>Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar is more than a game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a hobby. Build armies of plastic warriors drawn from the many warring factions that inhabit the Mortal Realms, paint your models to personalise your collection, and take them to the tabletop to play fast-paced games of strategy and action that will allow you to tell your own stories within the Age of Sigmar.<br/><br/>The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar features the most comprehensive look at the core rules since the first Generals Handbook, and like those changes, the new ones will have an equally huge impact on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Artefacts of the Realms<br/>The Mortal Realms are enormous, and the factions that fight among them are characterised as much by which of the realms they hail from as by their Grand Alliance. Previously, we&rsquo;ve seen this represented largely through creative paint jobs and appropriate basing, with some hobbyists using clever conversions to identify where their force comes from. Now, in the new edition, you&rsquo;ll be able to represent where your army hails from with 84 new magic items. When you&rsquo;re writing your army list, you have the option to pick a Realm for your army to be from. As well as providing you with loads of opportunities for roleplaying (not to mention painting and converting), you&rsquo;ll be able to replace one of your normal Artefact picks with a special artefact from your chosen realm.<br/><br/>Battling in the Realms<br/>The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar turns the Mortal Realms into rich backdrops for all of your battles. These aren&rsquo;t just optional expansions, but a core part of the game. Each of the Mortal Realms has a set of unique rules that create unusual challenges and opportunities for the armies fighting in them. Firstly, each realm has a command ability, apart from Shyish, which has two, and Ghur, which has wandering, feral monsters instead. Available to every Hero fighting in that realm, these abilities ensure that your army fights in a thematically appropriate way for the realm it&rsquo;s in. Secondly, each Realm has a set of Realmscape Features &ndash; a random in-game effect that&rsquo;ll often have a significant impact on how your game will go. Last, but not least, each of the Mortal Realms has a massive selection of spells associated with it, representing the unique powers that Wizards are able to harness. Each realm has seven spells, ALL of which will be available to ANY Wizard fighting in that realm. Finally, choosing a Realm has a range of impacts on certain warscrolls. Each endless spell, for example, is more powerful when cast in its associated realm.<br/><br/>Command Abilities and Command Points<br/>There are loads of awesome command abilities in Warhammer Age of Sigmar, but in the previous edition, some would almost never see play because they belonged to models who weren&rsquo;t being used as generals. In the new edition, every Hero can contribute and use their command ability, whether they&rsquo;re your general or not. There&rsquo;s a twist, however &ndash; to use any of your command abilities, you&rsquo;ll need a new resource, known as command points. Command points represent the tactical cohesion of your forces &ndash; you&rsquo;ll receive one to add to your pool every turn, and you&rsquo;ll get an additional point at the beginning of the game per warscroll battalion you&rsquo;ve used. That&rsquo;s not all! There are now three command abilities every single army and every single general can use &ndash; a tweaked Inspiring Presence, At the Double and Forward to Victory.<br/><br/>Endless Spells<br/>Magic is changing in the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, offering you something never seen on our tables before &ndash; physical sorceries with models and rules of their own. Endless spells are cast like normal spells, but rather than resolving their text with a mere roll of the dice, each summons a model to the table. This miniature then persists throughout the game until it&rsquo;s dispelled. Endless spells are moved at the start of each battle round after determining who gets the first turn, with players taking it in turns to pick a spell to move, starting with the player that has the second turn that round. You&rsquo;ll be able to move any Endless Spell with this move, not just the ones you control, representing their wild and untameable nature.<br/><br/>Look Out, Sir!<br/>With the new command ability system making Heroes more useful than ever, the last thing you want is to watch a critical support character get shot off the table before they get to do anything interesting. In the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, we&rsquo;ve balanced this with a new ability for Heroes that&rsquo;ll make your smaller and more vulnerable characters a lot more durable at range. By keeping your heroes close to your units, you&rsquo;ll make them much harder for enemies to kill at range.<br/><br/>Magic: Casting and Unbinding<br/>Magic is most interesting when each army&rsquo;s magic phase is distinct and defined by the unique character of the wizards involved. To do that, the new edition sees a change to two classic spells &ndash; Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield &ndash; to offer more incentive to use the unique spells each Wizard has access to. You&rsquo;ll still find these spells a valuable part of any wizard&rsquo;s toolkit, but they&rsquo;ve been toned down in comparison to others. Secondly, you can now attempt to unbind a spell at a massive 30&Prime; range, up from 18&Prime;, making unbinding much easier and also giving you a chance to deny your enemy key spells even in the first turn of the game, where you may not have had a chance to move your wizards into defensive positions.<br/><br/>Measuring and Piling In<br/>We know most people play Warhammer Age of Sigmar measuring from bases already, so this is just a case of enshrining it in rules and making way for a more tactical era of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Piling in has changed to work with the new, official base-to-base system, to allow you to get as many models into combat as possible. Where previously, you could only pile in towards the closest enemy model before having to stop, now, you can pile in even if you&rsquo;re right next to someone &ndash; provided you don&rsquo;t move any further away from the nearest enemy model. This should make large units a bit easier to use and should make surrounding enemies a bit simpler. Secondly, you can&rsquo;t choose not to attack with a unit anymore &ndash; the combat phase only ends when every single eligible unit has piled in and participated.<br/><br/>Shooting in Combat<br/>Shooting in the new edition is changing slightly. While you&rsquo;ll still be able to shoot whilst in combat, you won&rsquo;t be able to shoot out of it. This makes for a more dynamic game as far as shooting is involved. Taking a few fast-moving, durable units in your army will be key for quickly occupying shooting units that&rsquo;d usually play havoc with the squishier elements of your forces, while defensively, you&rsquo;ll want to screen your key ranged troops with support troops.<br/><br/>Summoning, For Free!<br/>In the new edition, summoning has been changed to work better for everyone and to properly reflect the unique character of each army that uses it. Rather than summoning units through magical spells, every army that could summon units before now has a unique resource that allows them to bring fresh reinforcements onto the tabletop that fits with their army&rsquo;s background. The big change for matched play, though, is that summoning now no longer costs reinforcement points! Instead, you earn your summoned units with in-game actions: bloodshed, spreading plague, mastering magic, and other thematic goals.<br/><br/>Turn Priority<br/>In Warhammer Age of Sigmar, the game is split into battle rounds, and players roll at the beginning of each round to see who goes first. This means, in effect, a player may occasionally get to take two turns in a row. In the new edition, the studio have added an extra level of depth, choice and chance to this mechanic, as well as removing some of the randomness, to make for more tactical games. Previously, players would roll off to determine who gets to decide who gets the first turn in each battle round, with the winner getting to choose. This works in much the same way in the new edition, but now, if the players get a draw, the player that went first in the previous battle round wins the roll.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.<br/><br/>",

They have five claim cards in hand, one for each sack and a &quot;skip&quot; card. Nine egg cards (valued 4-10) and three amber cards are shuffled, then two cards are removed from the game.<br/><br/>In each of the ten rounds, someone reveals the top card of the egg deck, then each player simultaneously chooses and reveals a claim card. All players who didn't choose &quot;skip&quot; divide the eggs equally amongst themselves, then place these eggs in the sack that matches the card they played. Each player then sets aside the claim card he used, leaving it out of play for the next round, after which it returns to his hand.<br/><br/>If an amber card is revealed, then if only one player plays &quot;skip&quot;, he claims the amber, setting it next to his sacks; if no players or two or three players play &quot;skip&quot;, then no one gets the amber.<br/><br/>If a sack ever holds more eggs than the number on the sack, it rips and all the eggs fall to the ground and break. Pity. That player covers that sack with the matching claim card, which is now out of play for him.<br/><br/>After ten rounds, the game ends, then players tally their scores. Each sack that holds exactly the right number of eggs is worth that many points; each sack holding fewer eggs is worth half as many points as the number of eggs in it, rounded down. Each amber is worth 4 points. The player with the most points is the ostrich egg champ!<br/><br/>",

Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles &mdash; but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!<br/><br/>In more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board.<br/><br/>Once everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave. Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins.<br/><br/>If someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again.<br/><br/>",

No game tells the story of World War II in Asia and the Pacific like Dai Senso!<br/><br/>Dai Senso! takes the playable, unpredictable and enjoyable Krieg! system used for World War II in Europe and adapts it to tell the story of Japan&rsquo;s struggle from a unique perspective. Most other Pacific wargames focus on the operational aspects of the 1941-45 war. DS starts in 1937 for a true strategic experience from the beginning of World War II in Asia. As the leader of Imperial Japan seeking complete domination (&quot;hakko ichiu&quot;), will you strike at China, Russia, the British Empire or the United States? Whichever way you choose, you must eventually face the grim struggle of total war. All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies and Western Allies.<br/><br/>Best of all, Dai Senso! can be linked with its new European companion game, Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!<br/><br/>Dai Senso! means Total War in Japanese. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it&rsquo;s all-out warfare to achieve victory!<br/><br/>",

While at that mansion, you're going to try to nick as many jewels as possible, but *gadzooks* the mansion turns out to be filled with jewel thieves who are all trying to do the same thing. Can you out them publicly, while staying unknown yourself and bagging a nice collection of gems?<br/><br/>In Suspicion, ten characters start on the perimeter of the game board, and each player is secretly one of these characters. On a turn, you roll two dice, then move the two characters shown (or characters of your choice if you roll a joker). After this, you play one of the two action cards in your hand, and carry out one of the actions on that card: stealing a type of gem in the space where your character is located, moving any character, asking someone else whether their character can be seen by someone on the board, and so on.<br/><br/>Gems come in three types, and when one of the piles is empty, the game ends. Everyone guesses who is which character, then all identities are revealed. For each player you've guessed correctly, you score 7 points; for each set of three different gems, you score 6 points; and for each individual gem aside from the sets, you score 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

That envelope is placed in the center of the gameboard. The rest of the deck is shuffled and distributed to the players as evenly as possible. Each player now assumes the role of one of the suspects. The object of the game is to deduce which are the missing cards. In turn, the players will roll the dice and move their pawns to various rooms. Once in a room, the player may float a rumor as to which are the missing cards. If the person to the rumormonger&rsquo;s immediate left can disprove the rumor by showing one of the cards mentioned, then the player must secretly reveal the card. Play continues until one person can identify the missing cards correctly, that person is the winner.<br/><br/>The version&rsquo;s additions:<br/>Each person has been given a unique power which may be used only once per game. There is an Intrigue deck which may or may not grant a player an extra action. Those Intrigue cards which do not grant an extra action are called Clock Cards. The player who draws the eighth Clock card is eliminated from play. Any player who draws a Clock Card thereafter is also eliminated. The &ldquo;one&rdquo; on one of the dice has been replaced by &ldquo;?&rdquo;. Any player who rolls &ldquo;?&rdquo; must draw an Intrigue card.<br/><br/>",

The 98 cards in the set include new heroes, villains, equipment, locations, constructs, and features two different approaches to play. The Sinestro side is built around attack and forcing his opponent to take bad cards, while the Green Lantern side prefers drawing extra cards and a strong defense.<br/><br/>In more detail, players take on the roles of Green Lantern and Sinestro. Each oversized character card has a cost of 9, 12, or 15 and has a unique ability. As they are defeated, the characters grow in difficulty to take down, and their abilities also improve. Players start off on an even playing field with identical decks of cards. They then use the cards in their hands and special abilities to buy bigger and better cards. As the game progresses, each player's deck becomes unique, strengthened by their decisions. Players attack and defend until Green Lantern or Sinestro stands supreme over his iconic rival!<br/><br/>The DC Deck-Building Game: Rivals &ndash; Green Lantern vs. Sinestro is fully compatible with the earlier Rivals &ndash; Batman vs. The Joker and the Confrontations set. It is also compatible with all other Cerberus Engine games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deep within the rain forests of the Yucatan, rival teams of treasure hunters have recently discovered the lost city of Codinca. In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found.<br/><br/>On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?<br/><br/>In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.<br/><br/>On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was designed and then published as a contract order from a Swiss insurance company ASSURA SA. It is intended to promote one of their product, ANIMALIA, an insurance for pets and animals.<br/><br/>One of the goals set early in the process was to design a &quot;real game&quot;, not a mere advertising product, playable with the whole family. That's how the game ended up being playable for 2 to 6 players, age 7 and up. It's a light card game, which is enjoyable among adults and children alike, the latter ones having a chance of winning thanks to the luck factor induced by card-drawing.<br/><br/>&quot;You're determined to be awarded the title of Best Breeder and you have three season to win as many medals as you can with your show animals. But beware, your opponents are all trying to do the same thing and they certainly won't hesitate to use their animals' special powers to spoil your plans. Stay alert, keep an eye on your opponents' animals as well as your own - and see who gets to the top of the medal table!&quot;<br/><br/>The players are animal-breeders who compete to present the finest collection of show-animals over the<br/>course of 3 seasons and each season is split into 3 phases.  In the first phase, players take turns drafting 5 animals into their collection.  In the second phase, players compare the elegance of their animals by counting the stars at the top of their cards.  Bonuses are awarded to the 2 players with the most elegant animal collections.  Medals are awarded in phase 3 at the end of each season.  Players earn animal medals for having multiple animals of the same family, or 5 different animals. The breeder with the highest number of medals at the end of the third season is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

INTRODUCTION<br/>With the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds!<br/><br/>Approaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword&rsquo;s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering.<br/><br/>Luckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned&hellip; and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon. Daryn looks into your eyes before you enter the crack in the barrier. &quot;Please, you are our last hope&hellip;&quot; You nod a little, then jump in&hellip;.<br/><br/>2. THE MISSION<br/>Get out of the dungeon alive as rich as you can. And if you are able to, bring the Amulet of D&rsquo;eugor!!<br/><br/>Download the game on the Free Games section here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.jackdgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.jackdgames.com</a><br/><br/>",

To make these duels more challenging, an all new initiative system has been created using activation cards that might grant players a jump on their opponents, but limit their flexibility in the process.

Sid Sackson's Extra!, some changes from the game first seen in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games under the title Solitaire Dice, is one of the &quot;new&quot; titles in this series.<br/><br/>In Extra! all players play at the same time off the same roll of five dice. Each player divides the dice into two pairs and a lone fifth die. The value of this fifth die is placed in a reject tally chart and one box underneath this number checked. For each pair of dice, the player marks a box next to the sum of these dice (2-12) on a scoresheet.<br/><br/>Each player can have at most three values on his reject chart; when a player checks off the final box in a column on this chart, he is out of the game. Once all players are out, they tally their points, losing 200 points for each sum row that they start without meeting a certain threshold. For rows marked past the threshold, the player scores positive points, with less common sums being worth more points. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us is a micro-sized strategy game that plays with ... well, 2 to 4 players. From the publisher and designers that brought you the hit strategy game Belfort, you can now get your strategy game fix in 10-15 minutes with this new micro game from TMG (Tasty Minstrel Games).<br/><br/>In the game, players play cowboys as they place tiles and create areas within the town. Unfortunately each tile could have your cowboys on them, or other players' cowboys - or cowboys from all players! Once an area is fully surrounded by fences you score that area. Look out for silver bars as they allow players to re-arrange one tile that has yet to be locked down!<br/><br/>",

The colors (suits) of cards are painted on both sides, therefore suits are known to all players, and one of the other players sorts your cards by color first, then number in ascending order. But because not all cards are dealt to the players, you cannot have complete information of your cards.<br/><br/>With such limited information, you bid for how many tricks you will win, and try to win that many tricks or to foil the contract another player made.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>自分の手札の内容は自分では見ることが出来ず、ほかのプレイヤーの手札から自分の手札を推測しつつ行うという、驚きのトリックテイキングゲームです。<br/><br/>プレイヤーは、自分の手札でいくつのトリックを獲得できるか、予想します。<br/>しかし、手札となるカードは、一般的なゲームとは違い、自分から見える側が裏になるように持つため、自分の手札は自分では見ることができないのです。逆に、他のプレイヤーの手札は、その内容が見えるのです。<br/>他のプレイヤーが持つ手札から、自分の手札を推測することが大事なのですが、これだけでは、手札を推測するということは至難の業。<br/>そこで、このゲームでは、各カードのスート（色）だけは裏からもわかるようになっているのです。<br/><br/>自分の手札となっているカードの色構成と、他人のカードの内容から、うまく手札を推測し、予想を的中させましょう。<br/><br/>",

Too bad this is not today's reality...<br/><br/>In this Utopian society, we all will work much less. Our robots can do nearly everything already. There is no need for great envy. It is simply about equality, justice, and the fair allocation of the complete and still necessary work, which then gives us ALL more leisure time.<br/><br/>Success means we will have time for the activities we like the most: fishing, farming, fencing, flying, ..., as well as gaming, building, painting, traveling, composing, and more. If somebody wants to work more than needed, they should do that. This is about the freedom! So let us rethink this: joblessness is not a disgrace, it is the new goal!<br/><br/>We are members of a team striving to realize this utopian ideal. We try to develop completely self-sustaining homes that function as efficiently as possible. They must generate enough food and energy to allow the residents the greatest possible freedom (thus, leisure time). The more people in our development who no longer need to work, the closer we are to reaching our goal! The player who builds the best development will win the game, and their development will become reality!<br/><br/>Futuropia is a luck-free economic game. To ensure you always encounter new challenges, we offer multiple game set-up variations, which create a variety of gameplay situations, ensuring new experiences and replayability. The solo game offers you an option to learn the mechanisms and processes of Futuropia before you play it with other players. See our hopeful future in...Futuropia!<br/><br/>",

They shop for specific colors, often ranging into neighboring hues to achieve a nuanced, scrappy look. Quilters love a sale, where they may buy fabric just to have it on hand. If they can't find the colors they want, they sometimes hand dye their own fabric. They use their time and skills converting fabric into blocks, which they combine to make quilts. Often, quilters work on more than one quilt at a time to keep things interesting. They may embellish their quilts with intricate quilting stitches. The best quilters make good color choices, combine blocks skillfully, use their time well, and win generous purchase awards when they enter their quilts in shows.<br/><br/>In Quilt Show, &quot;quilters&quot; collect fabric cards, which can be exchanged for block tiles. The quilters race the clock as they amass block tiles that they can combine into one or more quilts at a time. They can mix block tiles of a single color or a single pattern to make a quilt. Three times during the game, when the clock reveals it is time for a quilt show, quilts are entered and prize money is awarded. At game's end, the quilter with the most prize money wins!<br/><br/>",

Each card shows one of four environments, as well as 1-2 animals that live in that environment &mdash; although a cat can show up anywhere, so sometimes a card will feature three animals.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle 19 of the 40 cards into a deck, then shuffle the fox card into this deck. Each player takes a dry erase board and a marker. Flip the top card; for the types of animals depicted on this card, everyone secretly writes the total number of animals of these types that they've seen on all cards revealed so far. For the first round, this is easy &mdash; write the number of animals on this card! But you'll start seeing cards of many environments, and wait, how many chickens have I seen so far? How many cats? You can write only a single numeral for each round, with no reminders of which animals were which. When the fox card appears, write a numeral showing how many different animals you've seen total. Once during the game, you can circle a number to take a chance on doubling that score.<br/><br/>Once you've finished the deck after twenty rounds, flip it over, then go through the cards again, this time keeping a public tally of how many animals of each type have been seen. If the number you wrote for a round is equal to or less than the total number of animals seen, you score that many points; if the number is larger, then cross it out and score nothing for that round. For the circled number, if you correctly wrote the exact number of animals, score twice that many points; if you guess higher or lower, score nothing. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

It is intended to be an alternative to some of the longer and larger games while still providing interesting decisions and tension.<br/><br/>It features partial capitalization, in which a RR may be floated just by buying the president's share.  There are no par values and shares always trade at market value.<br/><br/>There is an original Priority Deal mechanic and a new Initial Auction system, both of which are highly regarded.<br/><br/>In the late game two &quot;regional railroads&quot; are available, similar to the granger railroads that operated in the American plains, making this game historically accurate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk&quot; is a cooperative game in which the players try to recover the last of Gladeulfeurha's statuettes.<br/>Players embody adventurers in this dungeon-crawling quest, each with a different class, skill and personality: there're the stupid barbarian, the belching ogre, the haughty sorceress, the dumb elf, the coward thief, the ever-singing bard, the cranky dwarf and the ranger who wishes he were a leader&hellip; (all the characters and elements of the game are inspired by the audio and comics saga by the same name, parodies of Fantasy RPG &mdash; &agrave; la Munchkin).<br/><br/>In each game, the group must go through 14 of the 56 available dungeon rooms in order to defeat the powerful sorcerer Zangdar. In every room, players will face choices, skill checks or battles, and maybe rewards (as xp, gold or loot cards)<br/><br/>There're 8 kind of skill checks, and each checks can slightly differ from the others of the same kind (number of players involved, special rule, etc.). Most of the skill checks use Destiny Tiles (which are 16 thick cards, which also represents monsters) and a special timer (with 3 difficulty levels)<br/><br/>     Balance Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, walk/run around and sit down again without letting the tile fall.<br/>     Climbing Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, stand up on his chair, then sit down again without letting the tile fall.<br/>     Dexterity Check: the player must build a house of cards using Destiny Tiles.<br/>     Speed Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the edge of the table, then slap it up the air and catch it before it falls back down.<br/>     Precision Check: a player stands 3 steps from the table, holding the game box, and the others must throw Destiny Tiles into the box from the other side of the table.<br/>     Intelligence Check: players play a memory game with the 16 Destiny Tiles<br/>     Coordination Check: players stands a step from the table, and must circle all the Destiny Tiles around the table, throwing them from one player to the next.<br/>     Stamina Check: the player must stand on one leg, with a Destiny Tile on his other knee and another one on both of his forefingers, without dropping down either one.<br/><br/><br/>The battles are also timed and are played with Letter Cards, that can be exchanged one by one between 2 players. They are used to spell special words (several different words for each character) as blows to the enemy. Every time a player plays cards to spell a word, he draw 3 new cards and keep on playing. At the end of the battle, if there're enough blows, the enemy is defeated. For instance, the sorceress can cast a spell by spelling &quot;wazaaa&quot; with any number of a's at the end, wounding the enemy for every extra a's. The barbarian can misspell a letter in each of his word. The bard and the ranger can make other players draw cards. And so on&hellip; For every 3 cards played with a punch symbol on it, a player takes one wound him/herself.<br/><br/>Using gold and/or xp, characters can level up (up to level 3) and gain access to more powerful attacks or skills. The party can rest up to 3 times a game to recover from one wound each. If a player dies, he shuffles his character sheet with the other available sheets and pick one : if it's the same, he  recovers all his health and keep all his loot, gold and xp; if it's another one, he dies, loses everything, and continues the game as a totally new character.<br/><br/>If the players defeat Zangdar the Sorcerer in the 14th room (4 tiles with different rules so every game doesn't end the same way), they win the game.<br/><br/>",

Play your cards cleverly or the servers will serve you food until you fall from your seat. Let the competitors be the ones to fill up until they drop and the snack bar throne will be yours!&quot;<br/><br/>The players add &quot;dish&quot;-cards or special cards to a common &quot;order&quot;-pile until one of them can&acute;t (or won&acute;t) add any more cards. Then that player has to &quot;eat&quot; the whole order by drawing the appropriate amount of cards from a draw pile. If he draws one (or more) of the &quot;No More!&quot;-cards, he accrues negative points and the round ends. <br/>The played cards are then set aside and new &quot;No More&quot;-cards are shuffled into the (now smaller) draw pile, making for an ever more tense experience as the contest goes into the later stages.<br/>When one player has collected 3 negative points the game ends and the player with the smallest amount of negative points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A variant propose to a fifth player to have the cops with the objective of sending every gang in prison. You can steal money in the street, deal drugs, vamp the characters of other players, buy/racket/rob shops or kill other characters, shopkeepers or cops. The killer has a bonus to kill, the femme fatale can vamp characters and the dealer is the only one who can deal (of course).<br/><br/>Cops are played by the player whose turn it is (so cops move each turn of each player) except in the variant where they are played by a player. They can testify against or arrest gangsters but they can also be bought.<br/><br/>Combats (duels) are resolved as follow and make one of the originality of the game. Each involved player rolls dice accordingly to the characters in duel (1D6, 1D6+2 for a killer, 2D6 for a cop) and sums them. The highest roller acts first and is the attacker.  A cardboard figure is set up for each participating character in the duel. The attacker shoots with the dart pistol towards the targets with as many darts as the difference between the totals rolled. If he shoots every opposing character, he wins. Then the defender shoots with the same number of darts. This exchange continues until one of the player has shot down all the targets of the other. A face down target mean the character has been killed. Face up means he's only wounded.<br/><br/>If all 3 characters of a player are dead at the same time, he loses.

        "description": "The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.<br/><br/>This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.<br/><br/>The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.<br/><br/>Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.<br/><br/>Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.<br/><br/>The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.<br/><br/>It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.<br/><br/>",

Show them your skills by collecting the golden monster teeth. But be aware - the lands of Taora are not as peaceful as they seem. Rumor has it, that in the dark and gloomy Netherworld, some friends become enemies...<br/><br/>Now get up and hurry! The Heldentaufe already started. Be the first who returns the teeth of glory.<br/><br/>The unique experience of Heldentaufe arises due to two distinct but connected realms: The Upper world and the Netherworld. Heroes can travel back and forth to the separate worlds through so-called &quot;portals&quot;.<br/><br/>Events and activities taking place in the Upper world are mostly serene and peaceful. You will harvest natural goods, carry out missions and trade items that you find. Somewhere hidden in the Netherworld lies a bright and shiny treasure. But what underworld would be complete without monsters and traps?<br/><br/>Players will change perspective frequently since they not only have to tell their hero which move to make next, but also command the monsters in the Netherworld, as soon as an opponent enters the dark realm. In a game with three or four players, forging an alliance to increase a player's odds in combat against monsters can be a smart choice. However, players should choose their swordmates wisely - once unearthed, the treasures of the Netherworld might lead even their most trusted allies to suddenly turn against them...<br/><br/>Due to the two distinctly different worlds, both aggressive warmongers and pacifistic characters will embrace the gameplay of Heldentaufe.<br/><br/>Heldentaufe is easy to learn and lets you experience all the key elements of a true adventure role-playing game (discovering treasures, collecting items, completing missions, and battling monsters).<br/><br/>A game for tactical players who can count on their luck in critical situations.<br/><br/>",

It is no longer just people or nations that are subject to exploitation, but entire planets and moons. As the CEO of one of these mega-corporations, in Charon, Inc. you will vie against CEOs of other corporations as you exploit the planet&rsquo;s resources and colonize Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto.<br/><br/>You will stake claims to the various mining regions of Charon, acquire resources for building facilities, use special actions (fair and unfair) to gain advantages over other CEOs, and build your empire to achieve victory in this fast-paced game of planetary domination!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more &quot;senior&quot; if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).<br/><br/>After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.<br/><br/>After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Robbers raided Pharaoh Anopheles' grave a long time ago and stole all the valuable scarab beetles. Since then, his mummy has restlessly roamed the pyramid corridors, scaring away anyone who dares intrude. Courageous heroes are the only ones who can free the mummy of the curse. Only those who possess the precious scarabs and can creep through the dark tunnels past the scary mummy all the way to the burial chamber stand a chance of breaking the mummy curse. Whoever hurries through the maze without being careful will attract the furious mummy and quickly find themselves right back at the pyramid entrance. Many adventurers have already tried and failed miserably. Can you get rid of the mummy's curse?<br/><br/>Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo, a reimplementation of the 2003 game Gulo Gulo, challenges players to make their way through a desert, then through the Pharaoh's pyramid. Before the game begins, players lay out face-down tiles on the desert path, in the pyramid, and in the mummy's burial chamber. The mummy figure starts outside the burial chamber, and the players start at the beginning of the desert.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player first explores the tomb either by flipping over the closet tile that has not yet been revealed, or by choosing the color of a desert or pyramid tile that's been revealed. The player then digs for the color chosen or revealed on the tile in a wooden bowl. This bowl contains twenty &quot;boulders&quot; (wooden spheres) and a thin Pharaoh's staff that's placed standing up in the bowl. If the player successfully removes a boulder of the proper color without the Pharaoh's staff or another boulder falling out of the bowl, that player moves &mdash; either forward or backward &mdash; to the next space on the path of that color. If the player lands on a scarab space, they take a scarab token and place it in front of themself (with a maximum of four scarabs for a player).<br/><br/>If the player creates a landslide by dropping a boulder or causing the staff to fall and touch the table, that player must retreat to the starting desert space (if in the desert) or the pyramid entrance (if in the pyramid). (You refill the bowl with all the boulders should someone cause a landslide or when all the boulders of one color have been removed.)<br/><br/>If the player lands on a tile showing one or more mummy heads, the mummy advances that many spaces, moving again if it lands on a tile showing mummy heads. If the mummy passes a player or lands on the same space as one, that player must discard a scarab or retreat immediately to the pyramid entrance. The mummy roams back and forth from burial chamber to entrance, so you'll encounter it at least once!<br/><br/>A player must have at least two scarabs to enter the burial chamber, after which the player must complete two boulder grabs in a row based on the tiles in that chamber. The first player to do so wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TRICKTAKERs is a...trick-taking game featuring role selection. After being dealt a hand of cards, the players choose from various characters (such as King or Gambler) that change how they will participate in the game.<br/><br/>The basic game consists of three rounds of trick-taking, and the winner will be the person that wins the most tricks in two of the three rounds.  Alternatively, if no one achieves that condition, if a player has taken no tricks in all three rounds, they will be the winner.<br/><br/>Not mentioned above, the game also has a higher priority victory condition and a lower one.  Each character in the game grants the player holding it a special &quot;immediate victory&quot; condition that could be achieved.  The characters also give the players ways to earn points, and this is the lowest tier of victory determination: who has the most points.<br/><br/>To illustrate some of the character abilities, the Gambler can discard cards from the initial hand to draw replacements, and will bid for how many tricks they take, possibly granting them extra points if successful. The Resistance has the potential to cause a &quot;revolution&quot; which reverses the strength of the ranks, and earns more points if they can win tricks with what would normally be the &quot;high&quot; cards.<br/><br/>",

Each player is building skyscrapers along the prestigious Fifth Avenue, competing for the best location next to the most businesses.  During scoring actions and at the end of the game, players score points per skyscraper depending on the number of different types of businesses that are adjacent.<br/>     <br/>During their turn, players make take one of four actions: take 3 skyscrapers into their supply, place a business on an open lot, take a black bidding card and move a commissioner, or score a district. Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner&rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.  Nothing further may be built there for the remainder of the game.<br/> The game ends when either there are no more businesses in the supply, or two building stops have been declared.  A final scoring round occurs for each district without a building stop.  The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is #9 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Robot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. Kids won't know it, but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.<br/><br/>Every player (&quot;Turtle Master&quot;) takes a turtle and a matching deck of cards. Stack the cards face up on the table in piles, then build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel. The youngest turtle master goes first, placing his first card down, then moving (or having his parent move) the turtle accordingly. As players progress, they build their program on the table; if they make a mistake, they can shout &quot;Undo!&quot; and debug it.<br/><br/>Before too long, kids figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: It lets the kids control the grown-ups! The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grown-up is the computer, executing commands on the board. At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults, just like programming is about bossing around computers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guide your tribe in its struggles to survive and prosper! Tribes: Early Civilization is a game for 2-4 players (The game does include rules for solo play as well) experiencing the Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze ages in 40 minutes. Players start with a small tribe and the very basics of civilization. During the game, they invent new technologies, explore new land, fend off invaders, and survive catastrophes. The tribe that first emerges as a true civilization wins!<br/><br/>Tribes: Early Civilization is a thematic prequel to Nations, designed by one of the Nations designers. It is a fast 3X game with a twist as each player has their own separate area to explore, expand, and exploit. The other two areas of the game are highly interactive:<br/><br/><br/>     The variable three-tiered technology tree in which the first inventor gets a bonus.<br/>     The actions column in which you take an action every turn and unwanted actions accumulate shells in a closed system.<br/><br/><br/>There are three basic actions tied to your civilization levels: explore, move and grow. The actions column is also where historical events come into play and where the fourth civilization level &mdash; strength &mdash; is used to gain you bonuses and make bad things happen to your opponents.<br/><br/>Several interlocking systems ensure high replayability without adding overhead or upkeep. For example: in one game shells can feel very scarce and the next abundant despite the exact same amounts being in play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>The goal of War on Terror, the boardgame is to liberate the world, ridding it of fear and terrorism forever. Naturally, only the biggest and strongest Empires are up to this task and so a certain amount of dominance needs to be proved. Alternatively, you can play as the terrorists, fighting for a world without empires.<br/><br/>Everyone starts the game as an Empire, with a couple of free villages and they can settle anywhere in the world. Although peaceful (we had to ban fighting in the first round) the 'politics' of the game already start to form, depending on what oil is discovered and how 'aggressive' the initial settlement choice is.<br/><br/>Empires then spread over the planet grabbing all available land, searching for the best oil and the most strategic borders. Some go for towns and cities, other spend their cash on extra empire cards, building up their political options. Maybe, if they're lucky, they'll get an early nuke.<br/><br/>Sooner or later someone takes a pop. Maybe the Axis of Evil has declared an Empire evil, giving them a few terrorist cards which are just too tempting not to play. Maybe someone is looking too strong already. Maybe you've got a grudge from a previous game or maybe you just want to win. Either way, war is declared or the terrorists strike!<br/><br/>Although it is possible to win the game with all the players still playing as Empires, the more likely outcome is that Empires are destroyed, bankrupted, or simply cave in and become terrorist players. As more empires fall they work together as a single terrorist player. With each new influx of terrorist cards and cash for the terrorist cause, the remaining Empires begin to wish that maybe they shouldn't have funded quite so much terrorism as they did.<br/><br/>",

The Fall of Germany begins at the eve of the great amphibious invasion of France and expands the war into the West. The War for Europe completes the picture with an examination of the entire 6 years of war in all of its ramifications. Great fleets of bombers may be launched towards enemy targets; swift Axis raiders joined by their deadly brethren, the U-Boat, can attempt to break the British supply line with America; mighty armadas may sail to challenge, in combat, for control of the seas, and much more.<br/><br/>But Hitler's War does not limit one to just the kind of tactical or strategic decisions normally expected from a wargame. The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France. Should the Allies attempt victory through airpower ? How much should the Axis invest in large mechanized armies versus the construction of U-boats ?

        "description": "Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.<br/><br/>Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.<br/><br/>Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)<br/><br/>The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon. Tannenberg can be completed in a couple of hours, making it the perfect game when time is short.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:    1-2 days per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     4.5/3.3 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Divisions and brigades<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One or two<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>        264 full-color counters<br/>        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>        8-page Rulebook<br/>        12-page Battle Book<br/>        2 Player Aid cards<br/>        One 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website)<br/><br/>",

To reach this lofty goal, each player tries to take the election tiles that suit you best and hinder your opponent's campaign.

The instructor has rigged three training bombs for you and your team to defuse, but little do you know that there is no way to actually defuse them! The bombs will explode eventually, and if you want to graduate at the top of the class then you&rsquo;ll want to cut high-value wires without triggering the explosives! Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!<br/><br/>In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &ldquo;wires&rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &ldquo;cut&rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules. Get through three gruelling bombs with the cleverest cuts to finish your final exam with the most points!<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.<br/><br/>If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.<br/><br/>Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.<br/><br/>The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.<br/><br/>If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Demand for each type of weapon differs throughout the game, but a well-crafted weapon will last longer.<br/><br/>On each turn, players can forge weapons, sell a weapon, upgrade craft (to build better weapons), or take a Kindom Card (for special powers); for players with a high-enough level of craft, a fifth action is available: forge and sell a weapon in the same turn. Players earn money by selling weapons, and it's permitted (nay, encouraged!) to sell your weapons to both sides of the same battle. The game takes place over four seasons in one game year. At the end of each season, the races fight with the weapons that the players sold. Weapons are at risk of being destroyed in battle, and surviving weapons earn money for surviving. After all, someone has to get paid to sharpen all of those weapons...<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.<br/><br/>The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the Exploding Minion.<br/><br/>The Minions bring a new game-changing card with them that allows players to Clone cards.<br/><br/>",

You will play the game above the painting that he made. You will start as Peasants, sowing the ground and selling your crop along the Via Francigena. If you will save enough florins you will be more comfortably off, trading in cloth and spices throughout Tuscany. But your dream is bigger: to enter the Council of the Nine, the town&rsquo;s government. Therefore you will have to change into Bankers and use your money to obtain the Senesi&rsquo;s consent: will you finance the artists of that time or contribute towards the construction of the new Torre del Mangia? Be careful, the florins that you have saved could not be enough! Behind every corner of the town other players&rsquo; pitfalls hide themselves: beggars, thieves, pretty women inside the inn... <br/>Be prepared for a unique game experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sugar Gliders is a board game for two to four players. Each game lasts around 20 minutes. Each player has a sugar glider, that has to collect as many fruits as possible by jumping from branch to branch.<br/><br/>The sugar glider is a small marsupial that loves nectarous foods. As its name suggests, it&rsquo;s capable of gliding through the air, much like a flying squirrel.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>- A board depicting a tree with 61 cells.<br/>- 4 sugar gliders in different colours.<br/>- 60 food tiles in 5 types: 1 fruit, 2 fruits, 3 fruits, 4 fruits, 1 big fruit (5 points).<br/>- A carrying case.<br/><br/>GAME PREPARATION<br/><br/>Each player chooses a player color and takes the corresponding sugar glider.<br/><br/>Leaving the center space empty, randomly distribute the 60 tiles face-up to the 60 other spaces on the tree, 1 per space.<br/><br/>White starts by choosing any space with a white fruit (value 1 tile), and placing his sugar glider on it. The tile in that space will be his &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;. In turn, the other players do the same.<br/>    <br/>The game can start now. White plays first.<br/><br/>GAME RULES<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, counterclockwise. On your turn, you must either make your sugar glider jump or go into a brief state of torpor:<br/><br/>JUMP<br/><br/>Move your sugar glider in a straight line a number of spaces equal to your &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; (this means one space in the first turn). If you have no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider, you must use one from your reserve. Notice that purple fruits count as 5 movement points.<br/><br/>Then you take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; that you just used, and put it beside yourself face-up. This is your &lsquo;reserve&rsquo;. If you had no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider and had to use a tile from your reserve, discard this tile to the game case; it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The tile on which your sugar glider has landed (if any) is your new &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Exceptions:<br/><br/>- The sugar gliders cannot jump outside the tree.<br/>- A sugar glider sitting in the center space can jump to any space on the board by spending any tile from his reserve (no need to match the length of the jump).<br/>- A sugar glider cannot move through another sugar glider.<br/><br/>Example: Anna wishes to make her sugar glider jump, but there is no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath her sugar glider. She uses a &lsquo;2&rsquo; from her reserve, moves the sugar glider 2 spaces in a straight line, and discards the tile she&rsquo;s used to the case.<br/><br/>TORPOR<br/><br/>You don&rsquo;t move your sugar glider. Take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; from underneath your sugar glider (if there is one), and add it to your reserve.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>The game ends when all the sugar gliders are consecutively in a state of torpor, or when the tree runs out of tiles, whichever happens first.<br/><br/>Each player sums the values of the tiles in his reserve (purple tiles count as 5 points). Highest score wins. In case of a tie, play again.<br/><br/>VARIANT FOR 2 PLAYERS<br/><br/>For shorter 2-player games, discard all the purple fruit tiles and 3 tiles of each other value. Then play on the inner board.<br/><br/>",

One player takes one mouse of each color, hides one in each palm, and has the other player pick a hand, thereby selecting what color they will be. Each player then places their mice in any configuration on the two closest grid intersection ranks. Shuffle the card deck and deal 3 cards to each player. Black goes first.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayOn your turn, select one mouse and move it into any open space around it (up, down, left, or right). You may then play one of your cards targeting that mouse.<br/><br/>Sword: Move in an L shape (move one space in any direction, then one perpendicular to your last move). Any mice encountered are pushed in the direction of your movement. If multiple mice are lined up, all are pushed. Mice pushed off the board or into one of the corners surrounding a Stronghold are captured and removed from play. You may not capture your own mice.<br/><br/>Stronghold: Leap off the grid onto an adjacent square. Mice may not enter grid corners touching your square. Mice currently in such a grid corner are pushed back one space. Mice will try to move in the direction of their side of the board first. If they cannot move into an open space, the Stronghold cannot be played.<br/><br/>    If you are in a stronghold, you may leave this position by moving to any of the grid corners touching the square and then moving once space.

Just as in a real railway business, the track in the game connects railway stations to each other. The trains (train cards) make notional journeys from one station to the next and thereby earn money. The (imaginary) passengers pay for their journeys. The more numerous and the more important the stations on a train's journey are, the more money it earns for the company and its shareholders.<br/><br/>In the game you and your fellow players can own up to 6 Mountain Railways, 4 Coal Railways, 7 forerunners of the National Railways, as well as shares in 3 National Railways and 5 Regional Railways. The Major Companies (the National and Regional Railways) belong to their shareholders. The player with the most shares in the company is the Director of that company and decides how the company will act.<br/><br/>",

What he did with that power over the course of the next forty-plus years is the stuff of legend. His unparalleled achievements in warfare, diplomacy, administration, and culture led to the sobriquet Carolus Magnus: Charles the Great: Charlemagne, King of the Franks and of the Lombards, and Emperor of the Romans.<br/><br/>In this solitaire strategy game, you assume the Frankish throne, and seek to duplicate - or exceed - Charlemagne's singular genius, while hopefully avoiding some of his mistakes, such as the famous defeat at Roncevaux (immortalized in the Song of Roland). As you conquer new territory and incorporate it into your empire, you'll need to contend with rebels and palace intriguers. Building public works and patronizing the Carolingian Renaissance will increase your prestige and wealth. Along the way you'll need to win the support of the papacy, buy off Viking marauders, convert the pagans in Saxony, contend with incursions from Al-Andalus, build a powerful army, and maintain detente with the Byzantine Empire.<br/><br/>Gamers who are familiar with the game Agricola, Master of Britain will find many similarities between it and Charlemagne: Master of Europe, though this is a longer and more complex game, with its own nuances. The core mechanism of cup adjustments is of course alive and well. Chits representing enemy units reside in one of three cups representing how they feel about your rule: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Hostile. Chits are drawn from the hostile cup and placed on the map, manifesting themselves as overt challenges to your rule. Every action you take will subtly change their stance, blindly moving chits from one cup to another.<br/><br/>",

Only the one who will collect the most mana from the rune stones will be able to complete the ritual.<br/><br/>On their turns, players place cards from their hand to link runes of the same type. A card has to be placed on top of part of at least one other card in game and has to follow at least one of the following rules:<br/><br/>1) Place runes on top of the same color runes.<br/>2) Runes have to match adjacent runes.<br/><br/>Once placed, a player can draw another card, or place a rune master on top of a rune to control it, and all the runes of the same colour adjacent to each other.<br/><br/>Once all players have placed all their rune masters, the game ends and players receive points for each rune controlled by their Rune Masters.<br/><br/>",

Now, the guilds are fighting for the top step of the political scene. Set in the wonderful world of Mysthea, Volfyirion Guilds events take place immediately after the previous title: Volfyirion; and about sixty years before the events of Mysthea.<br/><br/>The game retains all the features and mechanics from its predecessor, indeed it's a competitive and fast-paced deck-building card game for two players. At the same time, however, it adds more depth to the gameplay, thanks to 110 new cards, including new card types, abilities, and mechanics.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has renewed the solo mode: now you can fight against Mysthea world epic creatures, each of which has its own features and rules.<br/><br/>Volfyrion Guilds can be played as a standalone game or combined with the classic Volfyrion and this amplifies the alternatives for players.<br/><br/>Part of the 'Volfyirion Card Game Series'<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism, and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.<br/><br/>In Smash Up: Disney Edition, players choose two decks of fan-favorite Disney factions and combine their powers to take over bases, earn the most points, and win! Choose two from Frozen, Big Hero 6, Wreck-It Ralph, The Lion King, Mulan, Aladdin, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beauty &amp; the Beast to create the most exciting team-ups imaginable!<br/><br/>During the game, base cards &mdash; each with their own difficulties and abilities &mdash; are at stake. By playing cards from your hand, you try to have the most powerful set of minions on a base when the base is broken. When this happens, the three most powerful players on that base score points. When a player has 15 or more points at the end of a turn, they win. If two or more players have more than 15 VP, the one with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Similar to Magic: The Gathering in many ways, except there are no &quot;lands&quot; or similar methods of generating magical power.  Instead, players siphon power from their Magi or their monsters to perform attacks or put cards into play, thus controlling just how many powerful cards a player can attempt to unleash in a single turn. (in essence, you must sacrifice your own creatures to fuel more powerful attacks and techniques).  The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.  The concept also spawned a not-so-successful cartoon series and Game Boy Color video game.  Starter decks include all the required counters, a six-sided die, quick reference player aids, and a play mat.<br/><br/>",

As one of them, you must defend your territory from the enemy threatening your borders. Now it's time to command your troops and read through your opponent's strategy to take over the battlefield and prevail!<br/><br/>Kenjin is a quick and subtle card game of bluffing and tactics. You share two random battlefields with each of the players next to you: one worth 4 points, the other 6.<br/><br/>You get a hand of thirteen cards numbered from 0 to 3. They are your peasants, thugs, lords. On your turn, send two of them to one or two of your battlefields. When all the cards have been played, each battlefield is won by the player with the highest sum of card values there. Some cards are always played face up, others always face down. Some of them also have a special power: Use your peasants (0) to lure your opponent's troops to a battlefield, or to score more points if they survive. Play a Lord (2) early as it's strengthened by each new reinforcement thereafter.<br/><br/>Terrains also impact a battle's outcome: Peasants take arms to protect their rice fields, while military strength is not always enough when you fight over a palace. Once each battlefield has been scored, the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>The Ancient World: Rise of the Roman Republic is the first volume in a projected series of games that will cover virtually every war and campaign in ancient history on the same scale and scope that the legendary Europa series did for WWII. Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.<br/><br/>Volume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.<br/><br/>The focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.<br/><br/>The Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.<br/><br/>The land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.<br/>The Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations. Yet it is a very playable system in which most scenarios can be finished in an evening, and none, in Rise of the Roman Republic, take more than one map.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/>TIME SCALE     1 year per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     13 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE     Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-2<br/><br/>DESIGNER Richard Berg<br/>DEVELOPER Alan Ray<br/>MAP ART Mark Simonitch<br/>COUNTER ART Rodger B.

All are resplendent in the iconography of the Dark Angels. From the finely crafted purity seals to studded power fists, to the Librarian with codex, keys and ornate sword, through to the Bikes with angel-wing panels, they are among the most sublime Space Marines ever sculpted.<br/><br/>Ranged against the Dark Angels is the Crimson Slaughter. These Chaos Space Marine models contain attributes that will leave you slack-jawed in awe. Warp distress shows through on every detail of armour on the models. Horrific maws can be seen on swords, armour and guns. Faces emerge from flesh, as bones jut outward. Dozens of miniature eyes of Chaos peer outwards; jagged or ribbed horns curl in all manner of directions. There are macabre brain-like surfaces, grills, chains and skulls, and even more textures. The full Crimson Slaughter line-up includes: Kranon the Relentless, Chaos Lord - armed with power sword and plasma pistol; Mortis Metalikus: Helbrute, armed with multi-melta and power fist; and Draznicht's Ravagers: Chosen. They stand alongside Chaos Cultists made up of Sect Anarkus, which carries close combat weapons, and Sect Tetchvar, which carries ranged weapons such as autoguns. Both units are garbed in sinister-looking cloaks, masks and hoods.<br/><br/>As if these models weren't enough, Dark Vengeance comes with a full-colour 168-page mini Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook 6th edition; a complete Assembly Guide; a quick-play reference guide; an army roster sheet; dice, templates and a how-to-play booklet including six scenarios to enact on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Dark Vengeance is, quite simply, astonishing value for money. Whether you want to start a Dark Angels or Chaos Space Marines army, wish to add to your existing collection of models, or simply gape at beautiful miniatures, then this is an essential purchase.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Golem Arcana is a digitally enhanced miniatures board game focused on armies of magical Golems, the Knights who master them, and the Ancient Ones they call upon for supernatural support. Though the Golem Arcana game mechanics are deep and sophisticated, the game moves quickly and remains accessible to a wide audience due to the TDI stylus and mobile app managing all of the mechanics and record keeping.<br/><br/>Players create armies including Golems, Knights, Ancient Ones, and Relics, seeking a combination of attributes and abilities to suit their individual play styles or tactical preferences. While the Golems and Relics are represented by physical game pieces and cards, the Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones are digital units supplied through the app.<br/><br/>The Golems are your basic units, the body of the army itself. Relics are special equipment and constructs that can be carried into battle to help change the tide of war. A Golem Knight or Blood Knight is assigned to a specific Golem to customize its attributes or abilities through passive or active Knight abilities. Ancient Ones are assigned to the army as a whole, and provide powerful Blessings, Curses, and Miracles when the player &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; mana.<br/><br/>Players stage their selected armies on the game map formed by the terrain tiles, and engage in one of a number of possible scenarios, including Last Man Standing, King of the Hill, and Victory Points/Missions. Using a turn-based Action Point system, players maneuver their Golems, call down blessings and curses, and assault the enemy until one player emerges victorious!<br/><br/>The Base Game Set includes six modular, double-sided terrain tiles to form the board, six fully painted and assembled Golem figures (40mm+ tall) with corresponding Golem cards, a TDI stylus, two 10-sided dice, two Control Cards, and a Quickstart Rules and Lore book.<br/><br/>The Golem Arcana app, which is a free download, is pre-loaded with a starting set of digital units including several Ancient Ones, Blood Knights, and Golem Knights. Additional Knights and Ancient Ones will be available for purchase to further expand and customize the player's army options. The app also supports up to eight players in a single game on one device through included multiplayer scenarios and a Scenario Creator that lets you generate your own. Additional figures from expansions are needed to play with more than two.<br/><br/>In addition to the Base Game Set and Golem Arcana app, there are several expansions which will enhance a player&rsquo;s strategy by introducing new golems for more varied army building, as well as allowing new tactical and performance options through Relic cards, game tokens, and additional terrain tiles.<br/><br/>",

Opponents can use your buildings for their own purposes, and the final result should be one large magnificant house &ndash; &quot;casa grande&quot; &ndash; after another.<br/><br/>Casa Grande is played on a game board that shows a square grid for the building area, which is framed by a track. At the start of the game, each player receives a number of building blocks and differently-shaped platforms. Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns with some elements being similar to Burkhardt's own Kupferkessel Co. At the start of his turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money (Casa Grande Lire) based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.<br/><br/>After a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner (in which you don't get to place a building block). If a player accumulates nine or more bonus points, he receives nine Casa Grande Lire, but loses the bonus points.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has placed his last building block. The player who has collected the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Jaws of Victory: Battle of Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket: January/February 1944 is a historical simulation of the Soviet's winter offensive in the Ukraine in the early months of 1944 that trapped the better part of two German corps with a classic pincer movement by two Soviet Armies - and the German Army's desperate response to relieve their beleaguered comrades in the pocket.<br/><br/>Following the defeat of the German Kursk Offensive in July of 1943, the Soviets unleashed a series of major offensives to clear the Ukraine of the German Army.  By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st &amp; 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.<br/><br/>Seven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the &quot;outer ring&quot; in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.<br/><br/>As the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.<br/><br/>And both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2&quot; counters - 4 full size &amp; 1 half countersheets)<br/>    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book<br/>    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book<br/>    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track<br/>    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Results Table<br/>    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German &amp; 4 Soviet)<br/>    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper<br/>    One single-side printed Game Errata card<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Moderate-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-50 hours<br/><br/>",

Critical hit has re-implemented the North Africa Campaign with its 2014 Ruleset and updated maps, counters and expansions.   Unfortunately the naming convention is not consistent and republished titles are not always named the same.   For instance the expansion Facing the Blitz is the exact same game as ATS Briefing #1.   A clear and concise summary of each expansion does not currently exist that points out duplication.<br/><br/>",

Work on the Brisingamen and Freya rewards you with Free Action tokens that you can use for extra actions or for victory points.

He is accompanied by his familiar fellowship, who are charged with protecting him from the dangers he will face along the way. The players control the fortunes of this company together by moving the individual figures across the game board on a journey through many well-known places from the beloved Lord of the Rings novels. It is important to beware of the Nazgul while at the same time making sure that Frodo does not lose his confidence and freeze in despair. When Frodo reaches Mount Doom, the players have all won together.<br/><br/>The movement of the characters is controlled by a special dice mechanism. Colored dice determine which figure can be moved. Your dice value determines the number of spaces a figure can travel. By choosing the dice before and after the roll, players are faced with decisions that are seemingly uncomplicated, but nevertheless significant for the outcome of the game. Black dice, which always must be rolled, trigger threats or cause encounters with enemies or friends. The encounter cards ensure the continuous, ever-growing threat to completing the quest.<br/><br/>As in most co-operative games, players must coordinate their moves and actions with each other to ensure the desired outcome.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You and your opponent each have a display of 3 Timeslots, and at the start of the game, they show your starting 3 (terrible) Shows. There is also a Goal Card showing for the current Season, with 3 Goals available to hit (like winning a particular Timeslot, or having more Stars on your Shows than your opponent).<br/><br/>On your turn, you will pick one new Show from a display of 3, and use it to replace one of your existing Shows, which moves to your Reruns. You'll score Ratings Points for the new Show, scoring higher ratings if you put the show in its correct timeslot.<br/><br/>Next, you select one Star and one Ad from their corresponding display. Stars and Ads are displayed as pairs, so when you take one, you must take its matching pair. These go into your Green Room.<br/><br/>Then, you may attach as many Stars as you want onto a single Show (usually the Show you got this turn, but not always), as long as the Star has an icon matching the Genre of the Show. Stars add to your Show's Ratings.<br/><br/>You'll track Ratings for each of the three Timeslots independently. There are various points on each Ratings track with Viewer icons (usually between 3-5 Ratings Points). Every time you pass one of these Viewer icons, you'll score a Viewer by placing a chip into your secret bank.<br/><br/>Ads are worth money depending on various situations - usually whether you're leading at a given Timeslot. You'll pay the Ads in order to buy Network Cards (which are now marked with costs). Network Cards are one-time use power cards, similar to the Network Cards in the original game.<br/><br/>If you ever get at least 3 Shows of the same Genre between your Lineup and your Reruns, you'll score a Genre Bonus. Genre Bonuses are different for each Genre, but usually get you Stars or Ratings Points.<br/><br/>The deck of Shows has one Genre of each Show per Season. Once these are all out, you'll see an &quot;End of Season&quot; card. A player may take this card on their turn to trigger the end of the Season when their turn is over. They won't get a Show, but they'll still get a full turn otherwise (taking a Star and an Ad, placing Stars on Shows, and buying Network Cards with Ads).<br/><br/>At the end of a Season, the player leading in more Timeslots scores 1 Viewer for each Timeslot they're leading in; the other player draws 1 random Star. Then you'll look at the current season's Goals. The winner of each Goal gets Viewers or Stars depending on the goal.<br/><br/>The game ends after 3 Seasons. The player with more cards in their Green Room scores 1 Viewer. Then, the player with the most Viewers wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ION: A Compound Building Game is a card drafting game where players select from a number of available Ion Cards and Noble Gas cards with the goal of creating sets of compounds and inert noble gases.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s how the game is played: Each player is dealt eight cards, must select one of those cards and then passes the remaining. Players must choose to either bond (pair) their selected card with another Element Card or set it alone (possibly to form an ionic bond at a later time). Throughout the game, players gain additional points for building specific compounds which are listed on the Compound Goal Cards and have available a set of Action Tiles which award them additional moves throughout the game. Players score points based upon the quantity and type of neutrally balanced compounds they construct and noble gas sets they collect. After three rounds, players add their total scores from each round, subtract points from Action Tiles used, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

The game features a 'what if' conflict based on the United States Orange (Japan) plans on how to respond to anticipated Japanese aggression in the Western Pacific.

In Druids, the novices of the Stonehenge Academy must collect experience points in various knowledge domains, but you don't want knowledge from just any domain because if you enter a domain not intended for you, then you lose all knowledge previously gained that round.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player is dealt a hand of cards, with the deck containing cards in five colors, numbered 1-12 in each color. Players then play a trick-taking game, and whoever wins a trick must place the cards sorted by domain (color) in front of themselves; if they receive multiple cards of a color in the same trick, the lowest-valued card must be placed on top. The tricks continue until either all cards have been played or one player collects cards in all five colors. In this latter case, that player receives negative points for what they've collected while everyone else scores positively for their topmost card in each color. (If all the cards have been played, then all players score.) Whoever has the most points after five complete rounds wins!<br/><br/>In addition to the regular cards, Druids contains special cards that allow a player to avoid an unwanted trick or remove cards of one color from a player's holdings.<br/><br/>",

The game covers small unit action during the D-Day beach assaults and the steady stream of conflicts as the Allied troops advanced toward Germany.<br/><br/>Each player commands a squad of 5 to 12 British, American, or German soldiers and vehicles. Each card represents one soldier or vehicle. Each unit has inherent actions each turn including moving and attacking with different modes of fire. An action card deck enhances basic actions, and provides units with spur of the moment options.<br/><br/>The game uses counters to illustrate vital game information such as wounds, range, ammo, command, and morale. The range system is easy to use and simulates the movement of forces on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Frontline can also be played solitaire using the enemy Tactic cards. These cards give general, specific, and conditional orders to the enemy troops based on the current battlefield situation.<br/><br/>You can create battles by purchasing your starting forces, playing pre-made scenarios, or using the balanced randomized engagement rules.<br/><br/>",

When the players are ready, we draw a new scroll card at the middle of the table and the round begins! During the round, the players are rolling their dice as fast as possible, trying to match the symbols rolled with the symbols depicted on their spell cards to perform the spell, or in the middle scroll card to claim and cast it. Players can reroll their dice as much as they wish in order to roll the desired symbols, performing more spells the faster they play.<br/><br/>If a player rolls dice matching the requirements of a spell he places the dice upon the spell and immediately receives new dice from the dice pool. When the dice pool is empty or when a player claims the scroll card the round ends and all the spells are being cast.<br/><br/>",

The large and beautiful counters (1&quot; to 1.375&quot; square) represent squads, Leaders, Heroes, Snipers, M-48 and Pt-76 tanks, and more.<br/><br/>As these units&rsquo; commander you will move and fight over three geomorphic game boards as you try to best your opponent in one of eight, nail-biting historical scenarios. The game is card-driven, using a system similar to Flying Pig&rsquo;s Night of Man, which adds a sense of delicious uncertainty to the play. &ldquo;Can I advance my sappers or does the enemy have a fire card he's just waiting to play?&quot; Furthermore, the cards simplify the game, containing much of the data needed to play. You won&rsquo;t spend the afternoon with your head in a rule book when you play &rsquo;65. This is a game created by gamers for gamers to play.<br/><br/>Each Game Includes:<br/><br/>       3 richly illustrated, 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; geomorphic game boards.<br/>       Over 175 HUGE 1&rdquo; and 1.375&rdquo; counters.<br/>       1 deck of 54 action cards.<br/>       Full color rules and scenario booklet.<br/><br/><br/>(from the publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

This marks the end of the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and the stabilization of the front until the effort to take Moscow in Operation Typhoon in the fall.<br/><br/>AfB features a small map area and a limited number of units, making it easily accessible for fast or competition play. The entire campaign finishes in 10 turns.<br/><br/>Play begins with the German offensive in full bloom. The German player attempts to rapidly seize as much of the map (in the form of Victory Point locations) as he can. Speed is essential; while he has several cities to reduce, he knows the clock is ticking before Hitler pulls the plug on his efforts. The commanders did not realize this was in the cards, but for design purposes we assume the player feels the pistol pointed at his head. The Germans have copious air and mechanized forces to accomplish their goals...for the moment. At some point determined by the &quot;Hitler Roll&quot;, the German mechanized forces are taken off the map, their air support is cut in half, and the Red counteroffensive strikes in an attempt to turn things around.<br/><br/>The Soviet player stalls, withdraws, and conserves his forces while letting the German offensive expend itself. As the high tide passes, he prepares his rebuilt Red Army for the second half of the game: the Soviet effort to blunt the German gains and recoup their losses as best they can.<br/><br/>It that was first published in Special_Ops magazine #7 (2017).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 days<br/>Hex: 7 miles / 11.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Special Ops edition):<br/>One 16 x 28&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Autumn for Barbarossa rules booklet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-6<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unspeakable Words is the Call of Cthulhu Word Game designed by James Ernest and Mike Selinker. In the game, you and your opponents will attempt to form words from the letter cards in your hand. Each letter is worth points &ndash; the amount of points is determined by the number of angles in the letter (where the hounds of Tindalos are lurking!). You may try to make the highest scoring word possible, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ll have to test the strength of the word against a roll of the 20-sided die. Roll equal to or higher than the value of your word and you&rsquo;re safe&hellip; but roll less than the value of your word and you lose a precious piece of your sanity, represented by an adorable Cthulhu pawn!<br/><br/>Each letter is uniquely illustrated with a horrifying character from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, which adds to the dark whimsy of the game.<br/><br/>Since its release in 2007, Unspeakable Words has been received with great reviews. It was Games Magazine's Word Game of the Year and the Best Party Board Game at BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.  In 2008, a second edition of Unspeakable Words was released, this time with purple pawns. Because of the flexibility of the game, a second deck and second set of pawns can be added for twice as many players.<br/><br/>Since the inception of Unspeakable Words, Playroom Entertainment has wanted to release more specialized editions. With this Kickstarter, supporters can upgrade the Unspeakable Words game with special multi-colored pawns (five pawns each of eight colors to play up to eight players!), a dice/pawn bag and additional cards! AND...this Deluxe Edition will feature artwork by famed artist John Kovalic! Plus, if we hit our stretch goals, even more amazing things will be added to the game!<br/><br/>",

The old grouch replaced all of his employees with a bunch of primates: you and your opponents. This is the glamorous life of 1960s advertising execs.<br/><br/>Gorilla Marketing is a party game of naming ridiculous products, movies, companies, bands, college courses, or food trucks! It is played over two rounds: In round 1, you name the thing, and in round 2, you write the advertising tag line for it.<br/><br/>Round 1 starts by each player picking a category and putting it at the top of their booklet. In the movie pack, for example, these categories might be something like Horror or Western. Each turn, pass booklets to the left and roll the dice to form an acronym. Players must use the letters that were rolled and write down the name of a ridiculous movie that fits the acronym and the category of the booklet in front of them. Once your booklet comes back to you, it's time to use the crazy awards on your card to judge the best answer.  Which of these Western movies features the &quot;Closest Close-Up&quot;?  The gorillas with winning titles will earn what we're all after: bananas!<br/><br/>In Round 2, we're passing booklets around again, using acronyms to write the advertising tag lines for the winning titles from Round 1. The best tag lines will earn MORE BANANAS!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tarock is a general term for the many 2 to 5 player, point trick taking games of central Europe that use a 54-card Tarock deck.  Common to these games is a round of bidding followed by a round of announcements indicating bonuses that will be attempted during the round of play, and doublings of the game, or any of the announced bonuses. The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.<br/><br/>There are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.<br/><br/>Straw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Tapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.<br/><br/>K&ouml;nigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Harun al-Rashid was the fifth Great Caliph of the Abbasid Dinasty, and he ruled over the Middle East between the years 786 and 809. His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection of folk stories.<br/><br/>In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.<br/><br/>Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.<br/><br/>Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.<br/><br/>The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.<br/><br/>The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.<br/><br/>Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Most commonly one of the companies is selected, at which point the president may either contribute to the communal Fund in order to roll the company's die, potentially paying dividends to all stock-holders or changing the company's stock price, or may instead choose to raid the Fund for personal gain but with the potential to reduce the company's stock price.<br/><br/>Owners have greater control over the fortunes of their companies' stock and they can make great profits, however prices can go down as well as up! The companies have different characters, represented by a different mix of faces on the company die that is rolled when the company is selected on a turn and the President contributes to the Fund. As the game unfolds the players must decide how best to make money and potentially undermine some companies to reduce the fortunes of their competition.<br/><br/>Once the pawn reaches the Goal square, all stocks are cashed in for their current prices and then the player with the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Building trains is an integral part of America's history. Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.<br/><br/>The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.<br/><br/>Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.<br/><br/>Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.<br/><br/>Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.<br/><br/>The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.  The player or partnership with the most points at the end of that hand wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PQ-17 is a 2-player game of World War II air-naval operations in the Barents and Norwegian Seas, where the Allied player strives to pass convoys to and from north Russia in the face of appalling weather and determined opposition from his Axis opponent. PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.<br/><br/>Each of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.<br/><br/>Instead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.<br/><br/>Players must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.<br/><br/>To show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.<br/><br/>Because the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.<br/><br/>PQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.<br/><br/>PQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.<br/><br/>",

Aided by Corto and resisting Rasputin's attempts to thwart your plans, recruit your own bands of adventurers and get your hands on gold at the end of the story!<br/><br/>Corto is a card-based adventure game that mixes tactics and luck. To set up the game, choose four of the six quests, then place the appropriate quest boards next to one another on the table; each quest (attack the train of Russian gold, research the four aces of whale bones, meet the leopard-men, etc.) has its own deck of character and object cards that's shuffled and placed on the left side of the board. Reveal the top character from each deck, take turns placing one of your tokens on any character, then draw four cards from any combination of decks for your starting hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can either discard any number of cards and fill your hand to four cards or you can play 1-4 cards. If you play a character card, place it on an empty space on the quest board of the same color, making sure that it's adjacent to at least one other character. Place a token on the card, then either add a token to or remove an opponent's token from an adjacent character depending on the character's border color (denoting a friend of Corto or associate of Rasputin). You can also play objects on the character to affect adjacent cards. Some characters and objects have long range effects that hit any character in the same column or row. Hit a character that has no tokens, and you remove it from the board, counting it as 1 gold at the end of the game. If you played cards, end your turn by drawing two cards.<br/><br/>Players can also move Corto and Rasputin directly, using them to block spaces on the quest board, claim gold immediately, or eliminate characters.<br/><br/>In addition to having its own mix of characters, objects and advantages, each quest has a different treasure waiting for players to nab. For &quot;The Wreck of the Fortune Royale&quot;, you need to be the first to claim the aces in order to claim all the treasure for yourself; for &quot;Admiral Kolchak's Bullion Train&quot;, if you attack the train &mdash; which moves across the quest boards as players lay down cards &mdash; you claim one of the train car tokens, which might have gold on it; for &quot;On the Track of the Leopard Men&quot;, whoever has a majority of tokens on certain characters at the end of the game gains control of markers that might enhance their network of characters.<br/><br/>When two quests are fully occupied or the players run out of cards, the game ends. In addition to scoring for the gold and treasures they've collected during the game, each player scores 2 gold per character in the largest group of characters he controls and 1 gold per character for smaller groups. Whoever ends up with the most gold wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzers Last Stand is a Battalion Combat Series game depicting the Axis relief operations of Budapest from January to March 1945 in what became Germany's last major offensives in the war. The campaign game covers the Konrad Operations (I, II, and III) in January 1945. There are scenarios for each of the Konrad Operations as well as Operation Southwind in February and Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945.<br/><br/>In the final months of the war, Germany was still full of fight and believed Budapest to be the key to turning the tide. With Budapest fully surrounded by Soviet and former-Axis Romanian forces, the situation in the city was desperate. The Germans devised a plan to relieve Budapest by bringing in the SS-Totenkopf and SS-Wiking Panzer Divisions from Poland to launch a surprise attack before the Soviets closed the ring on the trapped forces in the city. Launched in the wee hours on New Year's Day, 1945, the fate of the Axis hung in the balance. The Soviets, having campaigned continuously from the summer of 1944, fought back viciously and showed their mettle against the elite SS Panzer Divisions.<br/><br/>A great proportion of the armored forces for both sides funneled into the Budapest area. All but one of the seven SS Panzer Divisions and half of the Heer Panzer Divisions on the Eastern Front (a full third of all Panzer Divisions total) ultimately fought here.

In a flurry of no-holds-barred trading, only the craftiest players will survive. . . Break out WHEEDLE and rise to the top!&quot;<br/><br/>This game is Reiner Knizia's take on Pit. It consists of simultaneous trading of various stocks, trying to get a majority.<br/><br/>Gameplay: A card is placed facedown in the center, and the remainder of the deck is dealt out. When the central card is flipped over, players begin calling out what they're collecting or wanting to trade away: &quot;Anyone have N Securities?&quot; (or, more, likely, &quot;I've got yellow, who wants yellow?&quot;) You can trade with anyone, any number of cards, including unequal trades. You may also swap one of your cards with the central card. When a player obtains a majority of all the stock types they have in their hand (for example, 4 of the 7 green cards and 3 of the 5 blue cards), play stops and the round is scored.<br/><br/>Scoring: The player who stops the play gets +5 (or -5 if they don't have a majority after all). You get +2 for each stock card if you have a monopoly of that stock, and +1 per card if you have a majority but not all of them. Warning: You get -1 for each card in your hand that matches whichever stock is the central (bankrupt) card when the round ends. You get 0 points for any card that is not part of either a majority or the bankrupt company. After each player has dealt once, the game is over and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

You sprint through rugged landscapes full of magma and lava and have to prove yourself against dangerous monsters. Only if the players complete the portal in time and defeat its monstrous guardians can they survive the adventure together.<br/><br/>On their turn, players use their equipment to perform two actions. They collect valuable blocks with pickaxes, move around the game board with boots, and use swords and bows to defend themselves against monsters. As the game progresses, they collect increasingly powerful equipment and equip themselves for the arduous adventure. To win the game together, players must traverse the rugged landscapes of the Nether maps and defeat the boss monster that awaits them at the end. On the way, it is important to collect the missing portal stones, which requires a large number of blocks. Players lose if they are late in delivering them or if the supply runs out of blocks. If a player's life points drop to zero, the team has also lost.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reiner Knizia has designed a number of games set in Ancient Rome. This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.<br/><br/>Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.<br/><br/>The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/>Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.<br/><br/>In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.<br/><br/>Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.<br/><br/>Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.<br/><br/>Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are many different versions of Rummy. Rummy 500 is the most commonly played form of Rummy. Rummy 500 is a standard deck playing card game using 52 cards.  It is one of the most popular family card games, and has a simple premise.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand.  You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the same value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit).  Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can take the top face down card from the stock, or take the top face up card from the discard pile.  After melding, laying off, or making no plays on the table, a player must discard a card face up on the discard pile. The discard pile is spread out, so that the value of all cards is visible.  If you see a card that you can use, you may take it, but you must also take all the cards that have been discarded on top of it, and you must play the lowest (physical) card in the deck as soon as you pick it up. If you only take the top card of the discard pile, you do not have to meld it immediately. (Variant: No wait, actually you do.)<br/><br/>The hand ends as soon as one player discards her last remaining card (going out). Cards on the table are worth positive points, and cards left in your hand are worth negative points.  Numbered cards from 2-10 are worth their pip value (Variant: 2-9 are worth 5); face-cards are worth 10 points; aces are worth 15 points, unless used in an A-2-3 run; jokers are worth 15 points. (Variant: All players add up the pip values of the cards in their hands, and those points are given to the player who went out.) A player who goes out without previously laying down any cards goes &quot;rummy,&quot; and scores double the points. Normally, games are played to 500 points, but players can opt to play to fewer points, or play a specific number of rounds.<br/><br/>When playing with 2, both players get 13 cards.  When playing with 3 or 4, each player gets 7 cards.  When playing with 5 or 6 players, each player receives 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are many other variations of the game.  Early versions of Rummy were often played with a 44-card deck, Ace through 11 in four suits.  In the 2-player version players are dealt 8 cards, with 3 or more players, the hand size is 6 cards.<br/><br/>One such variation, Rommé, played in Germany, requires that a player cannot start laying any cards down at all, until they have broken in with a lay down valued at 40 points or more (the exception being if you can play all of the 13 cards in your hand in one go).  In the German variant, each face card is 10, number cards are worth their shown number, aces are worth 11 (if used after the king or as a set) or 1 if used as a 1 in front of a 2 in a sequence.  Jokers are the value of the card they are representing.  This German rummy variant is also played with 2x52 cards + 6(or 4) jokers - for a 110 card deck.  Another difference from American Rummy is that one can only pick up the top discard, from a single growing discard pile - never a larger part of a spread out discard deck. Rather than scoring points based on what you have laid down in front of you, the winner (first person out), gets zero, and every other player adds up the cards remaining in their hands and takes that much in points (adding up the deadwood)  Here the player that finished has no deadwood.  When someone reaches 500 (or agreed to goal) the game ends and the player with the lowest score (least penalty points) wins.  Because of this 'breaking through with 40+' rule, this game is a bit more difficult and closer to Gin Rummy.<br/><br/>Pagat.com considers the overlapping discard pile, from which a player can take any card plus all cards above it in the pile, to be the feature distinguishing Rummy 500 from basic Rummy. However, numerous other optional rules for each variant are also listed, some of which could be considered to be equally significant, and there is no consensus across the web as to what defines one or the other.<br/><br/>",

If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...<br/><br/>The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game is going to be published by the Greek company &quot;Kaissa Chess &amp; Games&quot; during 2011. It is going to be bilingual, having text both in Greek and English. Its international debut will be at the 2011 Spiel Essen fair.<br/><br/>- Winner of BGG's Greek Guild's 1st Game Design Contest in the category: &quot;Best Game&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Butterfly Garden, you are an avid butterfly collector and the local butterfly garden needs your help expanding and diversifying its collection. Capture highly desired butterflies, put them in your trusty jar, and deliver them to the garden to gain respect from the collecting community and to help diversify the garden &mdash; but watch out for your opponents as lepidopterists can be quite devious!<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards will go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar (i.e., they take a card from the row of face-up cards and tuck it under their jar card). When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the zoo's butterfly garden to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.<br/><br/>",

Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In August 1914, Imperial Germany gambled its future on a rapid conquest of France, designed to free up the German army within six weeks to face the Russian steamroller of France&rsquo;s Tsarist ally on the eastern front. Seven German armies deployed opposite five French armies, the army of &ldquo;plucky little Belgium&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Old Contemptibles&rdquo; of the British Expeditionary Force in a series of battles that turned August and September 1914 into the bloodiest months of the entire war.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End covers the first three months of the Great War on the western front, from the Guns of August to First Ypres. This oft-gamed campaign receives a unique treatment, emphasizing playability without compromising on historical feel. Units are mostly corps of four steps (two counters per unit), along with a few especially strong (or weak) brigades and divisions, along with counters for the feared German Krupp and Skoda guns. The corps level Order of Battle accurately reflects the operational doctrine of the campaign, while also limiting the number of counters on the map to an easy-to-manage level.<br/><br/>The game scale is 9.5 miles per hex and three days per turn. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the new edition will include not only a previously published mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne, but a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End uses an Igo-Hugo system with two types of combat to demonstrate the tactical realities of the campaign: Prepared Combat and March Combat. Prepared Combat allows you to bring all your adjacent units to bear against a defending hex, but only with units that don&rsquo;t move. This gives the defender time to reinforce, retreat, or pre-empt your combat with his own attack. To avoid this, you can &ldquo;attack off the march&rdquo; during your movement, but March Combat may only be delivered by a single stack at a time, limiting the force you can bring to bear. Furthermore, March Combat cannot be used against entrenched enemy units.<br/><br/>The coming of trench warfare is reflected by a unique Entrenchment rule: starting on turn 10 players may entrench one or two hexes per turn, PLUS any hexes adjacent to enemy trenches. The result is that trenches appear first as a tactical consideration, but then turn into a strategic problem as they spread with ever-increasing rapidity along the front.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign (with rules for forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, Paris in Danger! and more) while remaining easy to play. The new GMT version will of course incorporate all errata from the original edition, but adds updated artwork, a corrected historical campaign Order of Battle, additional scenarios, and a tweaked set of rules.<br/><br/><br/>When Eagles Fight<br/><br/>Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for best pre-WWII boardgame, When Eagles Fight covers the eastern front in World War I, the last war of Tsarist Russia, Habsburg Austria, and Imperial Germany. From 1914 to 1917 the armies of the Tsar battled from the Carpathians to the Baltic against the outnumbered but logistically superior German army and the badly-led multi-ethnic forces of Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Though repeatedly inflicting massive defeats on the Habsburg armies, the Russians were ultimately undone by the skill and firepower of the German army and the collapsing political structure of the Tsarist autocracy. By March 1917 the 300 year-old Romanov dynasty was no more, and the stage was set for the coming of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. But the empire of the Habsburgs was left mortally wounded, and the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany would meet its own doom less than two years later on the battlefields of the western front.<br/><br/>When Eagles Fight recreates this titanic struggle from the initial clashes at Tannenberg and in Galicia to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. The large-hex map covers the eastern front of the Great War from the northern tip of Romania to Petrograd, and from Berlin to Smolensk at a scale of 25 miles to the hex. Turns represent one or two months, and combat units range from division to (mostly) corps.<br/><br/>When Eagles Fight has a set of low-complexity rules, without sacrificing the historical elements of this unique theater of the Great War. The combat results table is bloody and attritional, but allows for breakthroughs with the right tactics or artillery support. The greater operational skills of the German army is shown in the use of the OberOst HQ, which allows additional attacks on a select part of the front. The Russian supreme headquarters, Stavka, in turn has the ability to concentrate their limited supplies to overcome logistical shortages. And the surprise tactics of the Brusilov Offensive can allow a late game victory over the Austrians.<br/><br/>Other rules cover the slow pace of Russian mobilization, Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war, German heavy artillery, fortifications, Russian Guards forces, Cavalry Retreats, and the effects of events on other fronts.<br/><br/>But the new edition of When Eagles Fight is more than just a reprint of the original version. The Random Events Table has been exchanged for a system of random events chits allowing for more events. The effects if the Germans do not launch a Verdun offensive in France-which sometimes threw off the balance of the original design- have been revised. Changes in the stacking rules after 1914 more accurately reflect the effect of trenches on the course of the campaigns. And the map now contains the rail lines removed by Command from the first edition. The game also includes a short alternative-history scenario in which the bulk of the German army goes east rather than west in August 1914.<br/><br/>These changes make this an improved edition of an already award-winning design. Tense, historical, and just plain fun, When Eagles Fight is a game that belongs in the collection of everyone with an interest in the Great War!<br/><br/>",

Each year you start with a five card hand, crew tokens and new money, with the amount of crew and money determined by the structure of your orbital. You use money primarily to pay for new modules, and the crew gives you special effects on many of your modules.<br/><br/>During the year, the players take turns doing actions such as building, using module actions, playing event cards, repairing or passing. When everyone passes, the year ends and victory points are awarded: there are six kinds (colors) of modules and for each kind, the player(s) with the most modules of that kind is awarded a victory point. At the end of the fifth year, the player with most victory point wins.<br/><br/>Background story:<br/><br/>Welcome to the Star Scrappers universe!

Over a thousand years, united in the Interstellar Terron Federation, they have colonized many corners of the universe. The democratic system of the Terron society has encouraged the creation of many independent structures, such as corporations, commercial consortiums and mercenary guilds. By making contact with different alien species, they have caused their civilization to flourish and their influence to spread. At the base of their success lies ambition. Ambition that knows no bounds. This trait of character drives Terrons ever forward, to conquer new territories, to discover the unknown, to push the frontier of the Federation another step further. Their military forces are well-known across the Central Sector, as they strike fear in the hearts of alien beings inhabiting the Galaxy.

Most of these paths border two areas. Two hexagons are white and contain an X mark.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll five dice up to three times, keeping and re-rolling dice as you wish. Each die has a different color on each of its six sides. Once you stop, you can use the die results to X spaces on your game board, but only if you can X off all the spaces in that group. If you roll four orange and one red, for example, you can X off a group of two, three, or four orange hexagons, but not a group of five orange hexagons since you have only four orange on the dice.<br/><br/>After you take your turn, each other player can X off one space on their game board for each die that you didn't use on your turn &mdash; but only if those spaces are adjacent to ones that are already Xed. If you marked off a group of three orange hexes, for example, then each opponent could mark off one orange and one red, assuming they are adjacent to previously marked spaces.<br/><br/>When you mark off the final hex that borders an area, you score that area, earning 4-12 points depending on its size. Any other player who surrounds that area on a later turn receives only half as many points.<br/><br/>As soon as a player completes their sixth area, you finish that turn, then everyone sums their points to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

The first investigator to correctly answer these questions first<br/><br/>WHO killed Beatrice/Berenice Berwick?<br/>HOW did the murderer end her life?<br/>WHY did the murderer kill her?<br/><br/>wins the game.<br/><br/>In their turn, the investigator:<br/><br/><br/>     Rolls the query dice.<br/>     Places the results on the game board according to what information they wish to receive from their rival, the mastermind. They can then interrogate suspects, question the household staff, examine the crime scene, search for clues around the Berwick Mansions, and consult the police reports. <br/>     The mastermind reveals the requested information. With this information the investigator can draw conclusions and advance the case.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Domination of this bustling trade is the ultimate goal of every merchant house in the city.<br/><br/>In Mercante, you control one of these merchant houses. Deploy your trusted agents to purchase goods from arriving ships and sell them into the most profitable markets. You must also do more &ndash; from &quot;enticing&quot; senators to outright skulduggery &ndash; to claim your rightful place at the pinnacle of Tempest's merchant class. Do you have the business acumen and ruthlessness required to claw your way to the top?<br/><br/>Designed for 3&ndash;5 players, Mercante is a game of economic warfare. At the beginning of the game, each player controls one warehouse and two agents. On each turn, goods are purchased at auction and stored in the warehouse to be sold at the various markets when the time is right.<br/><br/>Players compete to accumulate crowns to finance their operations, and senatorial favors (victory points) to win the game. The player who accumulates the most money and favors will control all trade and profit in the City-State of Tempest!<br/><br/>Number 2 in the Tempest Shared World Game Series<br/><br/>",

The board is 33 percent larger than 1822, has 30 private companies, and 30 minor companies. The game has 10 public companies including the Canadian Pacific Railway that starts on both the east and west sides of the board.<br/><br/>The game consists of an alternating series of stock rounds and operating rounds. Initially, there is one operating round between each stock round, and then once the first 2-train is bought, two operating rounds between each stock round.  The final set of operating rounds has three rounds.<br/><br/>In stock rounds, players act as investors, buying and selling shares in the various companies. The player with the most shares in each company is the company&rsquo;s director and decides all actions that the company takes in the operating round.<br/><br/>In operating rounds, players, as company directors, run the various companies that they control. They choose whether to build track, place station tokens, which trains to run on which routes, whether to pay or withhold dividends and whether to invest in more trains, etc.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:<br/>Immediately, if the first stock round ends with nothing sold.<br/><br/>At the end of the operating round in which a company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.<br/><br/>At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which a major company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.<br/><br/>At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which the bank runs out of money.  The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.<br/><br/>When the bank runs out of money in an OR, complete the pair of ORs and then run one additional OR (for a total of 3 ORs in the final set). The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s total wealth is the value of their stock, at current prices, plus cash on hand. Concession certificates, if they are still open and held by players, count face value. Private  company certificates and company assets count for nothing. The richest player wins.<br/><br/>",

The game includes wooden segments that the players can add to cards to adjust their value. The amount of unused segments a player has will determine their bid for the round.<br/><br/>For instance, a segment placed horizontally across a &quot;0&quot; will create an &quot;8&quot;.  More exotic options are also possible, as three segments placed on a &quot;7&quot;, played upside down&quot;, can create a &quot;6&quot;.<br/><br/>The trick-taking phase uses a &quot;must follow&quot; format, with a fixed trump suit.<br/><br/>At the end of a hand, players will score points if they have taken a number of tricks equal to exactly the amount of unused segments they have leftover.  They will score for both the tricks taken as well as segment pieces that were played on cards in those tricks.  The game also includes a &quot;mis&egrave;re&quot; scoring option, where a player who takes no tricks and uses all of their segments may also score points.<br/><br/><br/>Twinkle Starship[Story]<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s time for a crazy race that encompasses the entire universe to begin, where anything goes.

In the game, you will be utilizing small segment sticks to control and manipulate the numbers of the cards, just like matchstick puzzles. For example, you can add one segment to 0 to make it 8, or add three segment to 1 to make it 3. This is a must-follow game with an unorthodox bidding system. Only when the amount of the sticks you have left at the end of a game and the number of tricks you won are matching, you are allowed to score points.<br/><br/>",

Each of them is trying to draft the best city &mdash; but talent is not enough. Only those who know how to please the Emperor, cleverly exert their influence, and invest at the right time will succeed in City of Rome.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts fourteen rounds, and in each round, players draft one of the building cards in play and add it to their hand. The drafting order depends on how closely you stand to the emperor. At the start of a round, you reveal a new &quot;action strip&quot; that has three bricks and two cogs in some order, then players take turns placing their figure on one of these five spaces; the closer you are to the emperor, the earlier you draft, but the fewer resources (bricks and cogs) you receive. (With only two players in the game, each player places two figures on the action strip and takes two complete turns each round.)<br/><br/>After drafting, you can take one build action and one produce action. To build, you must pay the cost in bricks &mdash; paying two coins for each missing brick &mdash; then place the card you're building adjacent to another card of yours already in play. You start with two building cards in play, so you'll have at most sixteen cards at game's end. These cards must fit in a 4x4 square, so plan carefully since you'll want to place some buildings next to other ones to earn the most points and to get the most out of a produce action. Some buildings give you a special action or influence tokens when you build them.<br/><br/>To produce, you must have two cogs &mdash; paying one coin for each missing cog &mdash; then use the production action of each building in your city once.<br/><br/>Every few rounds, an influence card is revealed, and whoever has the most influence tokens at the end of that round collects the card, then discards their tokens.<br/><br/>At the end of fourteen rounds, players score points for their residential buildings, temples, aqueducts, coins, and influence cards and tokens. whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Each turn the USMC player will activate one of his battalions (there are 8 in the game).  During it's activation it can move, attack, and attempt to regroup.  The USMC player further has a 3 card hand (out of a deck of 30 cards) that gives additional resources to the player (naval support, air support, engineers, tanks, etc).  The USMC player can play 1 card during their turn and 1 card during the Japanese turn.<br/><br/>As a battalion is activated it reduces its cohesion (reflecting wear and tear, exhaustion).  Battalions are further reduced in cohesion due to Japanese attacks and the marines &quot;pushing their attacks&quot;.<br/><br/>After the USMC player finishes their activation, the Japanese turn begins with the flip of a card.  From this the USMC player will face fire attacks, banzai attacks, bunkers, cross fires, infiltration, and more.  The card engine will ensure an ever changing game and no two will play the same.<br/><br/>The game will give the historical starting invasion site, however, we have included the alternate &quot;south beach&quot; landing possibility, that the Japanese had expected and prepared.  <br/>Victory is achieved by taking the island as quickly as possible while minimizing casualties.  This was the first invasion of the US island hopping strategy and high losses or a prolonged fight could have led to a cancellation of the island hopping campaign.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Knights and magicians in their service are sent to the provinces to conquer their opponents.<br/>But the methods of magicians and knights are very different. The knights turn to their swords and must slog overland from province to province. Meanwhile, the magicians can make use of the secret magical places and appear by surprise in an area that the knights believe is already secured for their own side. And so the struggle surges to and fro until one side attains power.<br/>What is unique in &lsquo;Power &amp; Weakness&rsquo;, is that two games are played at once; one game for magical control and one game for military control. Each player must decide whether to concentrate on the military or the magical field - or to try to be equally good in both - in order to attain power and gloat over the weakness of the opponent.<br/><br/>Power and Weakness is played in &lsquo;cycles&rsquo;. There is a Sword cycle and a Magic cycle. Each cycle has slightly different rules. The length of a cycle varies. During a cycle the players take turns alternately &ndash; until the end of the cycle when one of the players will receive a victory point.<br/>At the end of a cycle you check whether one of the players has won.

Advancing generous policy positions, to win over African public opinion, can endanger you with the European voters you depend on for power.

Allied countries will bring money and Victory points to the Alliance. Countries aligned with the Aliens will count as victory points for the invader.  By the end of the seventh turn whichever side has more Victory Points will be the winner.<br/> Each player represents a faction of a Human Alliance and manages one of their bases and its associated resources (money, units and cards).  Players must deal with the alien offensive using their units to fight airborne and landed UFOs in an effort to strengthen their Alliance by getting countries to join them. In order to stop the Alien offensive and beat the invader, they must also investigate new technologies as well as the nature of the Alien life form.<br/><br/>The Alien side is not controlled by any player. Its actions are determined randomly each turn, with an incremental difficulty as game progresses.<br/><br/> The game has two playing modes:<br/> -Basic mode is a cooperative game where 1-4 players form a Human Alliance that will fight to stop the alien invasion. <br/> In this game mode, if the Human Alliance achieves victory, all players win. Otherwise, everyone loses.<br/><br/>-Advanced game mode, is a semi-competitive game for 2-4 players, where each player forming the human Alliance has his own secret agenda and is able to obtain individualized victory points. As in the basic mode, the total amount of victory points and human technology level will determine whether the Alien side has achieved victory. If Humans win, only one of the players will be declared winner, according to their fulfilled agenda and performance during the Alien War.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Statis Pro Football is an in-depth, simulation-first football game that uses the AH Fast Action Card system. Individual players are rated for their ability to throw, catch, run, block, rush the passer, etc. Players are the coach for their team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.  The game rules also cover kickoffs, punts, turnovers, penalties, etc.<br/><br/>The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. A strong team will usually overwhelm a weaker team, though good playcalling and some luck with the cards can mitigate that advantage. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. The game includes optional endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for the players.<br/><br/>",

Each time you visit the dungeon you will have an over arching goal that you need to achieve, but you can also pick up side quests and even some odd jobs from the tavern to further modify your adventure!<br/><br/>6 stalwart Heroes are accompanied by their trusty fetch hound Albus. Each Hero has strengths and weakness' and it is up to you to decide if you will split the party to cover more ground or stick together in case a larger threat presents itself...<br/><br/>In the dungeon you will encounter wandering monsters who move about the board. Beware! These monsters might turn into raiding monsters and make their way to village.<br/><br/>You can mine for minerals to craft enhancements for your weapons. You can seek out and hunt down rare and legendary artifacts. You can send Albus back to the village to get a potion in a pinch.<br/><br/>If your quest is successful then the village celebrates in your honor and throws you a grand feast and presents your party with gifts. You can shop around for new gear from the ever changing marketplace, gamble some gold in the house of chance, visit a temple and pray for assistance and more!<br/><br/>Don't get too comfortable because evil never rests and you'll find yourself back in the dungeon facing tougher challenges but hopefully better armed!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Galaxy of Trian is a dynamic tile-based sci-fi board game. During the game you take command over one of a few opposing races, fighting over a territory and technology left by a powerful race Trian. You have at your disposal few kinds of basic units and spaceships allowing a great deal of interaction. Different types of ships will come with the new add-ons. Tiles are two-sided and stacked into two piles during the game, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness. Special tiles, like teleport, exmitter or trade station increase level of interaction and give even more tactical possibilities.<br/><br/>We made all possible efforts to give the game its unique, individual character and to distinguish it from others with the specific elements of game mechanisms. The goal was to make a game, which could be different each time it is played. Moreover, it was important that during the match players could decide which game variants they want to play, taking into account variable add-ons. Every add-on is a &ldquo;module&rdquo;, which can be combined with the basic version of the game and used to make your own variants. Basic version can be combined with any number of add-ons.<br/><br/>We wanted the game to be dynamic, with the playtime of about 60 min. We reached said time playing the strategic variant with the add-on &ldquo;Beginning of Conquer&rdquo;, which really pleases us. In the deluxe version, the game is composed of 84 beautifully illustrated, two sided tiles with 168 diverse graphics. There are no two identical graphics in the game; every nebula, planet and gas looks unique.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS AND RULES:<br/><br/>The matches are played in turns, which take place in a clockwise manner. Starting with the first player, every subsequent draws a tile in their turn and places it on the table. This way, planetary systems, nebulas and space (in which the spaceships travel) of different sizes are created. From nebulas we receive a certain amount of resources (crystals) every turn. The basic unit of the game is an emissary, who can fight over nebulas and planetary systems. If the system is won over, the emissary is able to take control of the research stations left by the Trian race. Stations can be leveled up. The points in the game can be obtained in various ways. By means of: closing planetary systems, nebulas, and space; leveling up the stations on nebulas and collecting resources (crystals) from them; conducting research or fights between ships. Game mechanics allow the application of different strategies and tactics. The game also includes tiles allowing special actions.<br/><br/>What defines Galaxy of Trian:<br/><br/><br/>    Simple rules which can be explained within few minutes, using clear, illustrated game instruction<br/>    Brilliant game mechanics, which will charm everyone and provide a great number of possible tactics and strategies. The game is incredibly exciting, it offers many ways to win and a great deal of interaction between players<br/>    Smooth and dynamic matches, without tie-ups and lengthy waiting for your turn. Match lasts 45 &ndash; 60 min.<br/>    Game variants adjusted to players age and expectations<br/>    As one of a few board games it is great for two, three and four players<br/>    Beautiful graphics made with great care and attention to details<br/>    Tiles construction allows countless combinations. Each time a completely different-looking fragment of the galaxy is formed. You will return to the Galaxy of Trian frequently. Simply, this game is never boring!<br/><br/><br/>",

Here's a short description from Aaron:<br/><br/>It's still trick-taker-like. Works sort of in the opposite manner than Why I Otter. In Why I Otter you score your tricks from public conditions. In An Otter Won you have personal conditions in the cards you've taken into your den that play off public otter cards in the river. It's a bit more thinky/gamerly. It also does away with rock/paper/scissors. It uses a neutral setup card per trick that may help determine if the high or the low card wins the round. The winner assigns those 3 cards (neutral yours and opponents) to which goes to which location.

For centuries, Cobalt has been ruled by corporations seeking to enhance their wealth and influence with Brass. Brass doesn&rsquo;t just fuel the economy but literally fuels the technology and transportation of the world through its unique thermodynamic properties. Every day these companies compete and battle to expand their territory and authority. Companies work to optimize their labor force and resources to mine the most Brass in each territory through corporate espionage, technology, security, and even sabotage. You work for such a company and have been tasked with expanding into a new region by constructing new corporate buildings, hiring employees, and battling other companies in the area. The player who earns the most Brass will lead his company to victory in the region.<br/><br/>Each turn, you will play Employee cards from your hand to gain resources. These resources will allow you to acquire new Employees, Buildings and Units for your deck. Along the way, you will acquire buildings to enhance your hold on the region and command units to attack other companies and mine for Brass.

        "description": "from MMP's website:<br/><br/>In September of 1862 after months of uninterrupted and spectacular successes, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virgina was poised to win the war.<br/><br/>Lee has beaten back McClellan's Army of the Potomac from the gates of Richmond, routed Pope's Army of Virginia, and built a reputation of invincibility.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lincoln had already penned the Emancipation Proclamation which would recast the war from one of a political disagreement over Federal control to a moral crusade which just could not be argued away. He just needed a victory to cast the entire war in an a new strategic light.<br/><br/>All could very well be decided by what happens in the western part of Maryland over a few days.<br/><br/>McClellan fought Lee's army back to the banks of the Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.<br/><br/>None but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!<br/><br/>None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.<br/><br/>For the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.<br/><br/>Representing many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.<br/><br/>As one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.<br/><br/>The Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.<br/><br/>The Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.<br/><br/>The game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day. Each of the other three scenarios can alternatively be played as a two day campaign game.<br/><br/>In addition to the large scenarios above, there are four smaller scenarios involving only portions of one map. One is a very short learning scenario showing the charge of Hood's Texans into the Cornfield. The other three isolate key actions of the battle: The complete Cornfield fight, the Battle for the Sunken Road, and the final attack by Burnside to take Sharpsburg and the counterattack by A.P. Hill's Division.<br/><br/>",

One card of each color is randomly removed from play and returned to the box without anyone knowing the numbers on those cards. Each player then sets up a rack with one card of each color on it, but with the racks facing toward the other players so that no one sees the numbers on their own rack. (In a game with two or three players, set up two or one additional racks visible to all players.)<br/><br/>On a round, the active player rolls the three color dice, e.g., blue, red, and yellow. Each player tries to guess what the sum of the numbers on their rack is for the cards that correspond to the die colors. If the dice showed two green and one grey, for example, you'd add the green number twice and the grey number once &mdash; but of course you can't see what your numbers are; you can only see what they aren't based on what's showing in the racks visible to you.<br/><br/>The active player then takes one of the bid strips &mdash; seven cardboard strips that come in different lengths &mdash; and places it across one or more numbers on the number line in front of them to show the range in which their sum lies, e.g., 13-16. Each other player does the same, choosing from the strips not previously chosen. If you guess correctly, you score points, with shorter strips being worth more points; if you're wrong, then you must discard any one of your colored cards face up, then draw a new card of this color and place it in your rack unseen. You now see this hidden number, which may help you deduce sums from previous rounds, but now you have to start over with you deductions for that color! Other players see the new card you just placed, so they get more info, too.<br/><br/>After 8-10 rounds, depending on the number of players, each player guesses the numbers on their racks, writing down one, two, or three guesses for each color. If you guess correctly, you score 5, 2, or 1 points for a color based on how many guesses you wrote. Add these points to whatever you scored previously, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This is achieved in part by increasing the timescale so that a turn covers a longer period of time.<br/><br/>Counters of all editions have the same layout and combat values but the movement values were changed in 3rd Ed to accommodate the different timescale.<br/>Every scenario can also be used as a starting point for the campaign game.<br/><br/>",

As is the case in any tragic event, there are those whom will use the circumstances to their advantage. Under the veil of the witch-hunt lie other motivations; power, greed, revenge and righteousness.<br/><br/>AFFLICTION: Salem 1692 is a game set in the hysteria of a witch-hunt. Use your influence to whisper in the ear of the magistrate, judge, governor or minister to protect some and have others arrested. Salem was a chance to gain property, exact revenge and prove one&rsquo;s righteousness.<br/><br/>The characters in the game were actual residents of the Salem region. This is the closest possible simulation of actual events in a game to date.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: Players will take turns placing a &quot;messenger&quot; (worker) to select actions. After all workers are placed, actions will be resolved in the order they appear on the main board.<br/><br/>EXONERATE - Take 2 Accusation Tokens off of any Colonist.<br/>FIRST PLAYER TOKEN/PROTECTION - Use a letter from the Governor to prevent one Colonist from being arrested and take the First turn, next turn.<br/>GAIN INFLUENCE/USE COLONIST ABILITY - Generate Influence and use the abilities of Colonists that you have in your Circle.<br/>ARREST - Spend Influence equal to a Colonist's adjusted Reputation to Arrest.<br/>SPECTRAL EVIDENCE - Use this token to prevent a Colonist from Generating Influence and using their Colonist ability.<br/>ACCUSE - Place accusation tokens to reduce Colonist's Reputations to make them easier to arrest.<br/>GAIN/REMOVE FEAR - Gain Fear Tokens or remove a fear token from another player (used to weaken Colonists)<br/>BRING COLONIST INTO CIRCLE - Spend Influence equal to a Colonists Base Reputation and bring them into your Circle.<br/><br/>Play will cycle between accusing, arresting and protecting your interests. Fear provides an alternative way to function when necessary.<br/><br/>END GAME: Increase Mather and Mary Spencer Hill are shuffled in with the bottom 6 cards of the Colonist deck. When either of them appears in the play area, the game immediately ends.<br/><br/>VICTORY CONDITIONS: All players will receive victory points for the Reputation value of each Colonist that have arrested or brought into their circle, victory points for the property of those they have had arrested and for the number of influence tokens they have at the end of the game. Each player will also receive points for having specific families arrested or protected, depending on the player tile they are given.<br/><br/>",

Find the most exotic animals and the most exuberant flowers, and discover the endless variety of cultures that coexist on the largest island in Indonesia. Your expedition sets out with the mission of writing a travel notebook that will help raise awareness of one of the richest ecosystems in the world. Whoever makes the best contribution to this exciting mission will win.<br/><br/>In Sumatra, players move around the island to explore its multiple landscapes. On a turn, your possible actions depend on where you're located in relation to the travel notebook token that starts the game in base camp with all the players:<br/><br/><br/>    If you're one space behind the token, you move to the notebook's space and end your turn.<br/>    If you're on the same location as the token, either you move ahead one space or you stay put, take a tile from the pool of &quot;available information&quot; tiles, and add it to your personal notebook.<br/>    If you're one space ahead of the token, you move the token to your space, move all the &quot;available information&quot; tiles to the &quot;known information&quot; pool, draw tiles from the bag equal to the number shown at your location, add those tiles to the pool of &quot;available information&quot;, then take one of these new tiles and add it to your notebook.<br/><br/><br/>Thus, you're catching up with the group, researching with the group to add info to your notebook, moving ahead, or digging into new tiles ahead of everyone else.<br/><br/>Tiles score and have effects in various ways, for example, with players gaining or losing points for meeting the most or fewest inhabitants. Flora and fauna tiles score only if you have a pair in a column, but only the highest-valued of this pair scores. Villages score only if you have more pairs of reception and GPS tiles than the number of villages, while the reception and GPS pairs net you no points, but allow you to get a tile from the pool of &quot;known information&quot;. Equipment makes it safe to explore volcanoes on the island, and if you don't have enough equipment, you might lose other tiles you've collected.<br/><br/>Sumatra also includes badges that players can collect. Be the first to collect, say, three flora tiles or a combination of two inhabitant and two craft tiles, and you can claim the badge for this, which is worth 3 points at game's end. You can also claim one diversity badge for having at least one tile in at least six rows of your notebook. The more rows you have a presence in, the higher the value of the diversity badge, but you can claim at most one during the game &mdash; and if someone else claims the six-row badge, then you'll need to have a tile in at least seven rows for the next one...<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>&Uacute;nete a esta expedici&oacute;n y descubre Sumatra desde la cima de sus majestuosos volcanes hasta las profundidades de su selva. Encuentra los animales m&aacute;s ex&oacute;ticos, las flores m&aacute;s exuberantes y conoce la interminable variedad de culturas que conviven en la isla m&aacute;s grande de Indonesia. La expedici&oacute;n parte con la misi&oacute;n de escribir un cuaderno de viaje que ayude a dar a conocer uno de los ecosistemas m&aacute;s ricos del mundo. Aquel que contribuya en mayor medida a esta apasionante misi&oacute;n se alzar&aacute; con la victoria.<br/><br/>En Sumatra, los jugadores se ir&aacute;n desplazando por la isla para explorar sus m&uacute;ltiples parajes.

Originating in Luebeck, the Hanseatic Trade League is formed, long-distance traders join forces and thereby create unprecedented wealth in northern Europe. There are many opportunities for young merchants to gain power and influence. Nevertheless, only few have the chance to be elected to the most influential position and thus lead the Hanseatic Trade League as Aelderman.<br/><br/>Aelderman is a competitive Euro-Game for 2-4 players. You embody an ambitious merchant in the medieval Hanseatic League and fight for your place at the top of the trade alliance! Through lucrative trading with other Hanseatic cities, you increase your wealth and gain more and more influence in the entire region of the North and Baltic Sea. Meanwhile, you contribute to the development of the flourishing city of Luebeck by commissioning useful buildings. Try to secure important privileges during the Hanseatic Convention in the Council Hall before your opponents take them away from you.<br/><br/>Use your limited action points wisely to trade goods and gain wealth. But money alone will not be enough to win this strategic Euro-Game. Rather you must secure as many victory points in the form of council votes as possible through influence majorities on the sea map, your reputation in the city of Luebeck and through various privileges and luxury goods to become Aelderman and win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Multi-Man Publishing web site:)<br/><br/>Tide at Sunrise continues the philosophy that began with A Victory Lost. Using tried and true mechanics but with some major twists, Tide at Sunrise will be a major test of player skill that is rarely seen in the wargaming hobby. Here, the base system is little more than the tried and true game from SPI called Napoleon at Waterloo. But not all is at it seems.<br/><br/>Here is the sequence of play:<br/><br/>Japanese Player Turn<br/><br/>* Naval Phase<br/>    * Transport Allocation<br/>    * Movement Phase<br/>    * Combat Phase<br/>    * Replacement and Recovery<br/><br/>Russian Player Turn<br/><br/>* Colonel Akashi Secret Operations Phase<br/>    * Transport Allocation Phase<br/>    * Movement Phase<br/>    * Combat Phase<br/>    * Supply and Recovery Phase<br/><br/>After the completion of both Player Turns, victory points are determined and, if the Japanese have not won a sudden death win, play continues to the next turn.<br/><br/>The game focuses on two aspects of the actual event. Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.<br/><br/>Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.<br/><br/>Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map<br/>    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters<br/>    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters<br/>    * 16 page full color rulebook<br/><br/>Game summary:<br/><br/>* Playtime: 3-5 hours<br/>    * Complexity: Simple<br/>    * Solitaire rating: excellent<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)<br/>    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units<br/>    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers<br/><br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/>* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda<br/>    * Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/>    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi<br/><br/>",

They provide precious heat to the near freezing abyssal waters of the deep as well as a bounty of minerals. Microscopic archaea and other extremophiles live off the heat and minerals to form the base of a unique food chain that hosts a variety of exotic deep sea creatures.<br/><br/>In Deep Vents, players each control their own hydrothermal ecosystem to which they add new life and geological features each turn, competing to survive in the unforgiving depths by being efficient and preying on nearby systems with a host of strange and deadly predators.<br/><br/>Start each turn by drafting a tile from the five on display &mdash; placing one archaeon, the currency of the game &mdash; on each tile you skip. Place this tile adjacent to each other tile in your ecosystem, then either grow or trigger each tile in your ecosystem, moving through them from top to bottom, left to right, and growing or triggering them individually as you like. When you grow a tile, you place archaea on it, whether a set amount or a varying number depending on other tiles in your ecosystem; when you trigger a tile, you remove archaea from it to carry out its unique effect: attacking opponents, gaining shells to defend against attacks, moving archaea to your personal supply, and decimating tiles, which leaves them as nothing but a heat source for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>If you ever need to discard archaea due to an attack and cannot do so, you must take a shortfall token and ten archaea, then discard archaea as needed. On your turn, you can pay ten archaea to remove a shortfall token &mdash; which you want to do because as long as you have one, you can draft only the first tile on display. If you end your turn with two shortfall tokens, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends if only one player remains in play (with that player winning) or after eight rounds, with players scoring points for archaea and shells in reserve and archaea on tiles. In this case, whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

That player may then utilize that location during their turn and has the option of paying the cost of the location to put it into their deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.<br/><br/>Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.<br/><br/>For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.<br/><br/>Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.<br/><br/>For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.<br/><br/>",

It is said people have a year of misfortune and woes &mdash; at the age of 42 for men and 33 for women &mdash; so to be cured and avoid bad luck, pilgrims of those ages attend the temple 23 called Yakuōji and place of the Buddha of healing, Yakushi Nyorai. In every step, pilgrims leave a coin while singing the Yakushi mantra, which favors them with spiritual healing and prevents misfortune.<br/><br/>In Shikoku, players play the role of pilgrims who are going up the 33 steps while singing mantras until they reach the pagoda. However, the &quot;Middle Path&quot; seeks moderation, not the extremes: To be the first one, or the last, is not welcome! The winners will be those who are second or next to last on the steps when a player reaches the top. The game is played in rounds, each of them with three phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Following the turn order of the mantra line, each player plays one card from their hand placing it in the mantra area along with their pilgrim.<br/>    When all players had played a card, pilgrims will be moved on the board. Players whose cards are second counting from the left and second counting from the right, don't go up. The other players go up as many steps (ICONO) as the card with their pilgrim indicates.<br/>    Move the mantra card (and its pilgrim) with the lower value from the first position to the last one of the mantra line. This will determine the turn order of the next round.<br/><br/><br/>The last player in the mantra line gets a new mantra card and other players take one of the cards (in turn order) that have been played during the previous round to have three cards in their hands.<br/><br/>After the moving phase of a round, if one or more players reach the pagoda (square 33), the game ends and the player, or players, who are second counting from the top and second counting from the bottom, win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aye, Dark Overlord! is a fantasy party game filled with humor that's fast to play and easy to learn.<br/><br/>Each player is an evil goblin servant of the evil Dark Overlord &mdash; Rigor Mortis, the Master of all Evils &mdash; and all of them are gathered at the Dark Overlord's knees to explain why they brought that last important mission, ordered by &quot;His Evil Excellence&quot; himself, to failure again. Panic wraps you in its freezing grip; what can you do to save your poor skin? Could you say you are not the one to blame, but your inept companions? Yes, of course, that's the solution! There is only one little problem: They've probably got exactly the same idea...and the Dark Overlord is not known for his mercy...<br/><br/>This roleplaying game is all about telling lies and shifting the blame on your poor fellow ones, so the righteous wrath of your Master can give them what they deserve!<br/><br/>Aye, Dark Overlord! The Red Box is the most recent name of this game, to distinguish it from The Green Box, which is both a standalone game and an expansion for this one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.<br/><br/>The four dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice.<br/><br/>Each die gives a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. You can roll 0,1,2,3, or 4. Statistically, 2 is most common- a good thing to bear in mind. The rosette in the central track is a &quot;safe&quot; place from which you cannot be bumped, but you can be bumped on others. Landing on any rosette allows you to roll again, but you don't need to move that same piece.<br/><br/>All moves must be made by one piece only.<br/><br/>First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.<br/><br/>Note - Rules update in line with guidance from Irving Finkel from British Museum.<br/><br/>The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.<br/><br/>",

That one is bathing in lava, and that is up in the sky, devouring the clouds.<br/>Wow, you think these guys are weirdos that don&rsquo;t look like any of the beings on your planet? Well, look at them again. Aren&rsquo;t they so Cute&hellip;oh no, very etuC??<br/>About this game<br/><br/>This is a climbing-ladder/shedding-type card game with the theme of ecosystem. This game is designed to be enjoyed by 2-3 players. Players play stronger cards than each other to win the game by getting rid of their hand.<br/><br/>In this game, there are two types of card ranks: numbers and colors (symbols).<br/><br/>At the start of a game, whether you are playing for numbers or colors hasn&rsquo;t yet been decided. If the subsequent card has a stronger number, you play by numbers, and if it is a stronger color, you play by colors. If you play a card with stronger number AND color, the rule remains undetermined, and the next player will have options to choose.<br/><br/>To win, it is important to plan ahead and take control of the dynamic card strengths.<br/><br/><br/>Ambiente Abissal is a shedding game for 2 or 3 players, which is to say the first person to play all cards from their hand will be the winner of a round.<br/><br/>The cards used in the game vary by player count, but there are an equal number of card ranks and suits, and each of these give the players a way to rank cards.  That is, if a person plays an Orange 2, it could be beat by any higher ranked card (number) or any card of a higher suit (color).  In addition to playing one card, the first player could play 2 cards (of the same number or same suit), which can be beat in similar ways.<br/><br/>Play continues around the table with players playing 1 or 2 cards to beat the current high play or passing.  Once all but one player has passed, the current trick ends and the last player to play begins anew.<br/><br/>Once a player has played all of the cards from their hand, they will earn points, and when a player has earned a given sum of points, they are determined to be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Legend says that the island is full of treasure, including the famous Golden Pineapple, but it also says that treasure is fiercely guarded by hordes of fearsome penguin warriors, some of which ride giant polar bears. That potential danger is why you're alone in your boat, on your own but eager to take a run on the island and try your luck.<br/><br/>For now, only the sound of the waves and the cries of the gulls disturb the peace of this seemingly idyllic island...but as soon as you set foot in the jungle bordering the beach, the drums of war start sounding and you realize that you've suddenly gained the status of prey!<br/><br/>Pingo Pingo is a hyper-frenetic action game punctuated by a soundtrack in which you have to react quickly, run, shoot a gun, in which you must be precise, brave, fast, and focused because if not, well, you might not leave the island in one piece. As soon as the soundtrack begins, the game is on!<br/><br/>On your turn, reveal the top card from your deck and place it face-up in the middle of the table. Each card requires a specific action when it is revealed. Be the first to tap on a treasure to grab it, but watch out for traps and critters, and make sure the music allows you to take this treasure. Tap on camp cards to steal cards from the other players' stashes. Adventure cards trigger actions to be completed before the &quot;Pingo Pingo&quot; cry in the soundtrack. Get up and run from one base to another to cross a suspension bridge. Grab the gun and aim well to defeat fearsome bear riders. Tap the friendly monkey sorcerer to regain life. Run to the shipwreck and back to shoot the gigantic space penguin. Grab all the previously played cards and deal them as fast as you can to escape the penguin rampage!<br/><br/>Any mistake will cost you one of your seven life points. After 15 minutes, the player with the most treasures wins the game &mdash; but don't be reckless because you can't carry more than three treasures per life point...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Alexandre Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo, the protagonist, Edmond Dant&egrave;s, is imprisoned in the Chateau d'If for fourteen years, during which time he learns about a fortune hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Eventually he escapes, boards a smuggling ship, then makes his way to the island, where he manages to recover the fortune.<br/><br/>But did he find all of value on the island? That's not what designers Arnaud Urbon and Charles Chevallier propose in Le Secret de Monte Cristo, coming from Filosofia in French, with eggertspiele and Z-Man Games releasing versions in German and English.<br/><br/>The players are smugglers who learned of the treasure from Dant&egrave;s while traveling together, and now each of them has decided to search the island for any treasure that might remain.  Each round players receive cards that show what type of treasure (gems) might be found in the castle, with the active player that round placing three smugglers in the castle and all other players placing one.<br/><br/>Once new treaure has been distributed in the castle rooms, players then take actions based on the order of the marbles showing in the game's &quot;action slide&quot; &ndash; this being a tilted rack with four slots in it, with a different action associated with each slot. The player whose marble is at the bottom of slot one takes that action, then places the marble at the top of any other slot; then the player at the bottom of slot two takes that action; and so forth.<br/><br/>Players can seize treasure from rooms if they outnumber the other smugglers present and they have the right sacks on hand for storing the treasure.<br/><br/>",

Their names have survived the passage of time: King Arthur, William the Conqueror, Achilles, Conan.<br/>Whether they were born in popular legend, in the fertile minds of writers, or in the annals of history, they live forever in our collective memory as the most celebrated figures of ages past.<br/>However, for each surviving legend, there exist innumerable others still waiting to be written. Thousands of heroes wait to prove themselves on the battlefields, to speak with fire and steel, and to carve their mark on the world around them. With the book in your hands, you have the unique opportunity to take part in the creation of these legends and to see them master their destinies in turn.<br/>Your SAGA begins here..........<br/>SAGA is a skirmish game taking place in the heroic ages, whether they are historical, mythological, or sprung from the minds of writers. It brings to life the battles between exceptional warriors - Warlords, who defy their enemies on the battlefieds at the head of their warband.<br/>This game puts you at the head of one such warband, made of thirty or so figures, and lead by your heroic alter-ego. Each warband is chosen from among the available SAGA factions and has a specific Battle Board and SAGA dice which grant them particular abilities in battle and reinforce their identity.<br/>This book contains SAGAs simple and innovative basic rules. They are easy to learn and illustrated with numerous examples. They apply to all the universes you might explore. These rules are the fruit of years of development and the contributions of a large community that plays SAGA around the globe.<br/>Once you have read this book, all that is left for you to do is choose a SAGA Universe from the array available, assemble your figures and write your legend!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Note: This book contains no battleboards or Armies, you have to buy the first supplement for those...<br/><br/>",

A chill has settled in those ancient ruins and expedition pack animals refuse to enter the underworld realm. There are new sightings of large beasts roaming the countryside and strange unnatural calls fill the night air. Hunters have gone missing without a trace and it is no longer safe to explore very far into the woods.<br/><br/>My sisters wake from the same nightmares. A skeletal hand, pale and white as snow, grasping out from darkness. Thousands of red-eyed crows flying over a field of dead. A bloody maw gaping open with rows of gleaming teeth the size of daggers. I see these images in my own dreams and I fear for what is coming.&quot;<br/><br/>~Selene<br/><br/>Of Dreams &amp; Shadows is a cooperative board game for up to six players who take on the role of Champions trying to save their realm. Set in a dark fantasy world, the players will journey from the underworld ruins of a long-dead people to the heart of untamed forests where otherworldly creatures dwell.<br/><br/>As they direct the actions of their Champions on the game board, the players will participate in a collaborative story. Scenarios introduce encounters and conflict, which are resolved through passing a test or making a choice. The consequences advance the storyline and drive a unique experience as part of the story changes based on each outcome. Failing a test could have dire results such as receiving one of several types of debilitating Afflictions. Many Scenarios will also present players with a moral dilemma where a decision could aid their cause, but not without sacrifice.<br/><br/>Opposing the players is one of three selectable Villains. Beings of myth and legend, the Villains have their own host of deadly servants to face in combat. Developing flexible tactics and teamwork among players will be crucial as there are over 30 different enemies, each with their own special ability. You must band together with your friends if you hope to survive.<br/><br/>",

When mankind gained the means to transit the vastness of space safely and quickly, a great human wave extended across the galaxy, and humans soon inhabited thousands of worlds.<br/><br/>Communities of worlds formed alliances; alliances became federations, and eventually a galactic empire was born. That empire existed for millennia, growing and consolidating, bringing most of the inhabited worlds under its control.<br/><br/>Despite its size and apparent success, though, all is not well in the Galactic Empire. There are rebels, usurpers, those who want to create empires of their own, and aliens of every imaginable form. Over the long millennia, even the form of man is taking a new shape with genetic engineering.<br/><br/>Struggle for the Galactic Empire is a solitaire science fiction game. You assume leadership of the forces of the Galactic Empire as it strives to maintain and expand its dominion while fighting off the forces of chaos that seek to destroy it. You make all the military, political, social and economic decisions to deal with the threats that arise, keep the far-flung empire stable, and still expand and bring new glory through discovery, colonization and conquest.<br/><br/>The map shows the entire galaxy divided into sectors of star systems. Production is carried out by nano-assemblers to create starships and world-sized weapons. Units include combat and colonization ships, control groups and leaders. Units have two types of combat values: weapons and morphogenetic systems. Weapons destroy the enemy, while morphogenetic systems change them into friends. Loyalties switch back and forth depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Threats are generated by over 100 randomly drawn chaos markers. They include: rebels, usurpers, independent empires, invaders and alien forces, as well as technological, economic, social, political and military events.

As a result, the game is a race to shout out multi-syllable commands such as the eponymous &quot;MaNiKi&quot;, or &quot;LoNiMaSo&quot;. The first player to do so correctly wins the target card, and whoever collects the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Littered with the modular debris of the precursor civilization, patrolled by malicious extragalactic raiders, and bordered by dense nebulae, The Edge is a last resort for the brave and foolhardy who seek a new life beyond the oppressive reach of the Lords of Unity.<br/><br/>In this game, you lead a desperate faction seeking to build a new civilization on Andromeda's Edge. You begin with only a space station, a few ships, and a handful of resources. By carefully placing your ships, you will gather resources, claim moons, acquire modules to add to your station, populate planets and build developments on them. You will battle opponents and compete with others to ascend the progress tracks: Science, Industry, Commerce, Civilization and Supremacy.<br/><br/>On your turn, you either launch a starship or return your ships to your station. Launching sends one of your starships to a region of Andromeda, either collecting resources from planetary systems or taking actions at Alliance Bases. If the region is occupied by your opponents or fearsome raiders, face off in a dice battle, with Supremacy on the line but where strategic manipulation can turn a loss into a reward. Returning to your station allows you to activate your engine, using the modules you&rsquo;ve acquired to generate energy, gain resources and carry out actions.<br/><br/>Throughout the game you will build up your unique faction, building developments (Observatories, Factories, Spaceports, Cities and Obelisks) and gaining station modules which move you up the progress tracks. Advancement on the tracks is rewarded both during mid-game events and at the conclusion, and is the key to victory.<br/><br/>",

In Tribune, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family. By applying influence and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.<br/><br/>In more detail, Tribune is a combination of worker placement and set collection. Each round, players take turns positioning their followers on the board to collect cards, achieve objectives, and attempt to take over factions. To gain control of a faction and use its benefits, you must play a set of at least two cards from that specific group. You remain in command of that faction until an opponent plays another set of this faction that either contains more cards or has a higher sum of values.<br/><br/>As soon as a player meets the required number of objectives on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game (with that card being dependent on the number of players), that player wins the game. Alternatively, you can forgo the use of a condition card and play with a point-value option; in this variant, the game ends when a player has collected a certain number of faction markers, and whoever has the most points at this time &mdash; based on the completion of various achievements &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>This edition of Tribune includes the Tribune: Primus Inter Pares base game and Tribune Expansion while featuring new mechanisms and elements from designer Karl-Heinz Schmiel.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heights of Courage: The Battle for the Golan Heights, October 1973, is a game covering the Golan Heights portion during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.<br/><br/>In October, 1973, Syria and her allies lead a surprise attack to recapture the Golan Heights in conjunction with an Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal into the Sinai.<br/><br/>For a little over two weeks, massed Syrian armor tried to swamp the Israeli defenders who were buying time to allow mobilized reserves to arrive.  They succeeded and managed to turn the tide launching their own offensive toward Damascus.<br/><br/>Heights of Courage is the 16th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. It complements the 1995 CSR award winning game Yom Kippur (which covers the fighting in the Sinai). It uses the same 8 page standard series rulebook applicable to all the other games.<br/><br/>Because both sides have offensive and defensive phases of the battle to enjoy, victory is determined by comparing the best Syrian performance in their early offensive to the Israeli offensive results at the end of the game. This forces both sides to fight tooth and nail on both the offense and defense with enormous time pressure on perform rapidly.<br/><br/>The game captures all the sizzle of the fast-paced armored battle with enough steak to give the game the appropriate level of depth. For example, it uses an innovative two tempo operational speed, to both players as the battle goes beyond the endurance of the forces involved.  Each player can select to go &ldquo;fast&rdquo; in order to fight more or &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in order to get more replacements.<br/><br/>While Heights of Courage cannot be directly linked to Yom Kippur, the game provides rules to allow players to play both games in tandem so as to play the &ldquo;whole war.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Four scenarios allow different looks at the 17 turn campaign (turn length varies based on when a cease-fire occurs).<br/>4.1 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (17 turn long version)<br/>4.2 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (10 turn short version)<br/>4.3 Operation Badhr (6 turn look at the initial Syrian offensive)<br/>4.4 Operation Al-Owda (Original Syrian plan - which can be played in the 6, 10 or 17 turn versions)<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: Half day to 3 days (depending on game turn)<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Platoon/Task Force/Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Heights of Courage rulebook<br/>One 8-page Standard Combat Series ver 1.7 rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

Help your brightly coloured frogs take control of your little corner of the rainforest!<br/><br/>Cleverly place frogs on the game board to flip adjacent tiles, hiding some frogs and revealing others. Each player is given a secret Frog Token at the beginning of the game, determining what colour frogs they are trying to get on to the board. After dealing three tiles to each player, the game begins. Tiles can be placed on any empty space on the 4x4 board, or on the back of any face down tile. Frogs may NOT be placed on top of face up tiles.<br/><br/>When placed, the arrows on the tile which surround the frog tell the player which nearby tiles should be flipped. If a tile is stacked on another, both tiles are flipped together. Only the newly placed tile causes other tiles to flip.<br/><br/>Also included are four Snake Tiles which remove any one face up Frog Tile from the game. Both the Frog and Snake are discarded, freeing up a space for a new tile to be played.<br/><br/>Players keep playing a tile and drawing back up to a hand of three until either no more tiles can be played or the board has sixteen face up frogs on show. This triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most frogs face up is the winner.<br/><br/>Plan ahead, watch out for snakes, and flip your way to victory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the golden age of Islam, many Scholars arise and amaze all in the land with their inventions and discoveries. Meanwhile The Kingdom who has just discovered the power of knowledge, starts to intrigue these Scholars in order to strengthen the monarchy and profit more from ruling the land. But The People who notice the intentions of the Sultan and his subjects, confront The Kingdom and struggle to help these Scholars. In the midst of the dispute between The People and The Kingdom, a sect called The Hashashin (The Assassins) has risen. They believe that power is the root of all corruption and must be destroyed. Therefore, The Hashashin are lead to killing these Scholars.<br/><br/>Belaad: The Land of Swords and Quills is an engine-building thematic card game for 2 to 6 players. Players are split up in three teams and over the course of the game, attempt to triumph over the other two. The Hashashin come in play if there are an odd number of players in which a single player controls the team. Every team consists of a unique set of characters with special abilities and is as follows;<br/><br/>     The Kingdom: Sultan, Vizier, Treasurer, Sheriff, Commander.<br/>     The People: Bahlool, Preacher, The Trustworthy, Altruist, Folk Hero.<br/>     The Hashashin: Sect Leader, Hashash, Spy, Assassin.<br/><br/><br/>The Kingdom and The People follow the same goal of hiring the most Scholars while The Hashashin mean to kill them. Every Scholar provides a number of scientific symbols for teams which count as victory points at the game's end.<br/><br/>The game proceed by playing action cards. Each player has four cards in hand and plays a card by turn, using the action on the card, and after that draws another card from one of the three decks. Action cards help each player strengthen their team's characters, gain coins or steal coins from other teams, declare war and hire Scholars. Every character has a certain symbol, other than their special abilities, and can be strengthened by placing tokens on said character's mat. For example, the Treasurer provides more coins, the Commander becomes more powerful in war, the Sultan gains more influence in hiring Scholars and etc.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained by two means; scientific points provided by Scholars, and military points gained from war. The game is played in 4 eras in which different Scholars emerge and at the end of the 4th era, the team with most victory points prevails.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the end of the 17th century, a French Benedictine monk in charge of the cellar at Hautvillers Abbey made an important contribution to differentiate wines from that region. As a result, it became possible to produce wines of superior quality, particularly in white wines made from black grape varieties. While Dom Pierre P&eacute;rignon initially felt the sparkling of the wine was a negative feature, the consequent increase in both quality and quantity created the path that lead to the appreciation and recognition of champagne.<br/><br/>Throughout the 18th century, several &quot;champagne houses&quot; &mdash; or Champagne Maisons &mdash; were founded, and a new business dynamic grew in the region. These houses replaced small farm and monastery production in leading the evolutionary process of champagne, and by planting more vineyards or buying grapes from other producers or both, they mastered the specialization. To promote their product, the houses hired sales agents to take samples of their champagne wines to the Royal Courts of Europe, a crucial factor in generating the glamorous fashion of drinking champagne.<br/><br/>Despite production growth, improved quality, and increasing popularity, trade did not reach spectacular rates during the 19th century &mdash; which is why the game Dom Pierre is much more about winning prestige than earning money. In the game, you are responsible for one of the oldest Champagne Maisons, producing and selling wine all over Europe, not to mention the other side of the Atlantic. The local economy will be boosted, employment increased, and your brand will become universally recognized.<br/><br/>To make all this happen will require a chain of actions that starts in your vineyard. You will need to look for continuous improvement, constantly react to your opponents, and optimize your choices to build the most prestigious Champagne Maison. In game terms, on a turn you move up a disc on the winery game board and perform an action, with the actions become more powerful as the game progresses. You will plant in the vineyards, harvest crops, buy grapes from neighbors, make wines in your cellar (some more valuable than others), allocate salespeople on four market routes and workers in the vineyard and cellar, and acquire the necessary accessories to improve production.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Historic Gaming #7<br/><br/>Hero of Weehawken is a solitaire game in which the player takes the role of President Thomas Jefferson at a dangerous moment in the history of the United States. Former Vice President Aaron Burr is somewhere out west, and rumors abound that he is threatening the nation with plans for some sort of ill-advised military adventure that could bring America to war with Spain, or even a direct act of treason against the United States!<br/><br/>To forestall this disaster, you must first determine Burr&rsquo;s real plans, then find and arrest him before he executes his plan; and, finally, gather sufficient evidence to convict Burr at trial. If your agents arrest him too soon, you will not have gathered enough evidence or figured out what to charge him with. If you wait too long, however, you may be too late to stop his nefarious plans.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to gather the right information in time?

You have to quickly study your dreams and push back the nightmares creeping in. Will you be fast enough to preserve the serenity of your nights?<br/><br/>In Dream Runners, players are presented with a common dream tile each turn. Using their individual segmented tiles, they&rsquo;ll have to create a pattern where action symbols match the position of trials of the dream: banishing the nightmares away, collecting coins to purchase new segments, keys to open chests and star fragments to earn more victory points. In return, every trial that is not covered with a symbol will diminish your serenity, decreasing your final score.<br/><br/>But as soon as one player completes their pattern, the hourglass is turned upside-down and all other players must finish their own patterns before time runs out! And suddenly, the quiet study of the dream becomes a frantic race to assemble segments...<br/><br/>After eight rounds, the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

One player, called the Patriot Player, controls the forces and destiny of the rebellious Americans; the other, the Crown Player, seeks to bring the rebels to their senses.  The exact Victory Conditions of the game may vary depending on which historical events the players choose to re-enact.<br/><br/>Many aspects of warfare have been abstracted to focus squarely on issues of supply: protecting, moving, capturing, and effectively using it to further your goals and frustrate those of your opponent.  Supplies come in two flavors, and are represented on-board by wooden cubes.  Food Supply is expended to move your units, and War Supply to fight.<br/><br/>There is no hidden information, other than what your opponent intends to do, but flexible movement rules allow for considerable bluffing and misdirection.  The game rewards boldness but also punishes the slightest error-- that is, if your opponent is clever enough to capitalize on it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzer Battles: 11th Panzer on the Chir River, is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game by Multi-Man Publishing and covers the classic mobile defensive Chir River Battles of the German 11th Panzer Division against the culminating point spearheads of Soviet Operation Uranus. The Soviets have successfully entombed the Stalingrad Pocket and are in the process of locking down the pocket even harder.<br/><br/>In December, 1942. Strong Soviet forces, including the 1st Tank and 5th Mechanized Armies, conducted a concerted attack against German positions in an attempt to block relief efforts directed at Stalingrad from the west. In what is considered a masterpiece of mobile defensive warfare, the German 11th Panzer Division fought a lightning series of &lsquo;fire brigade&rsquo; battles to contain and beat back the efforts of the Soviets to further seal the Stalingrad Area west of the Don Bend.<br/><br/>In an interesting twist of events, the German 11th Panzer Division, recently arrived from France is preparing to take part in the northern portion of the German relief attempt on Stalingrad (Operation Winter Storm). Full strength and available, the division launches into the Soviet drive in what has become a textbook example of a mobile defense and counter-attack which is studied to this day. It originated the term 'Fire Brigade' as used on the Eastern Front in WW2.<br/><br/>Under the energetic leadership of Generalmajor Hermann Balck and his Chief of Staff Oberstleutnant von Mellinthin, the 11th Panzer was able to defeat the Soviet mechanized drive.<br/><br/>German accounts stop right there, with a German victory. However, the win (if it can be called that) was a Faustian bargain. The Soviet drive was stopped, but at the cost of the German units designated to make the Stalingrad relief effort. There would be no Northern Pincer now. The Southern Pincer soldiered on alone. And failed.<br/><br/>The game covers all this swirling mobile action in turn representing two to three days and a hex scale of 500 meters.  Units are companies to regiments. Play is highly interactive (the only way to show its mobile nature) using a chit pull system by formation. The rules are a continued adaptation of the system shown in Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege 18-27 Dec' 44, It Never Snows, and Day of Days: The Invasion of Normandy 1944.<br/><br/>Scenarios (4 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios):<br/><br/>    Panzer Battles Campaign, 2 maps and 7 turns.<br/>    Containment Battles, 2 maps and 6 turns.<br/>    State Farm 79, 1 map and 2 turns.<br/>    &quot;I'll be back&quot;, 1 map and 2 turns.<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2-3 days<br/>Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.8 system rulebook<br/>One 12-page Panzer Battles specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-10 hours<br/><br/>",

Players work together to survive in a remote cabin, at the center of the board, against waves of the undead that close in from the edges of the board. If the players can hold out, survivors bring pieces of the radio needed to call for rescue. Once rescue arrives, it's up to each player to leave the safety of the cabin and make it out alive!<br/><br/>To fight the zombies, players use cabin cards, some of which are weapons that help players attack zombies at a distance or in hand-to-hand combat. If characters take too many injuries during combat, they die and return to the game as a zombie with customized rules as a member of the undead! Other cabin cards are items, which give the players various benefits and a better chance at survival. The supply of items and weapons is limited, however. Once the cabin deck is exhausted, it is not reshuffled. A separate deck of cards, called event cards, allow the zombies to have their turn. This deck not only brings a variety of zombies into play but each card also has a special effect when drawn.<br/><br/>Can you survive Dead Panic?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was the age of gods and goddess. Zeus (King of the Gods), Poseidon (Lord of the Seas), and Hades (God of the Underworld) had agreed to separate the sky, the ocean, and the underworld. Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, would take over the rest of the earth. But the Norse gods were displeased by the decision. They called warriors and disciples to take the world from the Greek gods. The gods atop Mt. Olympus also called their warriors to defend them. During this war of the gods, a mass of warriors died, and their souls were sealed in a jar.<br/><br/>And now they are waiting for you to release them.<br/><br/>In the deck-building game Kanzume Goddess, you will be one of the Gods of mythology. Each God in the game has its own special powers which players can use to their benefit. Players will purchase cards from the center of the table to add to their decks. They will use these cards to purchase more cards and to do battle with the other players. These cards can be used to damage other players, to gain more cards, to draw more cards from your deck, and to protect yourself from damage. The last player with energy left is the last God standing and the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Kanzume Goddess can be played as an individual match with 2-6 players or as a team match if you play with 4 or 6 players.<br/><br/>",

The map leading to it has been cut in parts long time ago, and hidden in different places of the Caribbean Sea. In order to win the game, you will have to face and overcome all the other pirates also searching the Golden Pineapple map. Play your cards wisely to find the treasure and become a pirate of legends!<br/><br/>RULE OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Pi&ntilde;a Pirata is played in rounds. At each round, every player receives 8 cards. The goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.<br/><br/>At your turn, you must play one card, or draw one if you can&rsquo;t. A card can be played if at least one of the pirates depicted on it is also on the top card of the play area. As soon as a player has no more card in her hand, she wins the round and gets a part of the treasure map. If a player has all 4 map parts, he wins the game!<br/><br/>The tricky part come from the Adventure tiles: At the beginning of the game, 2 tiles are revealed. Each of those Adventures is a new rule that will change the gameplay. There are 40 different tiles with a lot of different rules. Use them as their best to play more cards than you should or prevent the other players to play theirs!<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the winner chooses a new Adventure and adds it to the previous ones. The more the game is going, the more special effects are triggered for more and more fun!<br/><br/>",

Dozens of Alices abound, and now they're taking sides and forming teams to see who can put the land back together best.<br/><br/>In Alicematic Heroes, you take charge of one of these teams, and you'll have a handful of Alices to use in your efforts. Alices come in five colors, with each player having a set of player boards in these five colors. On a turn, you first summon an Alice to your kingdom, playing that card from your hand onto the player board of the same color, but only if you can pay the cost in dream power; each Alice has a cost, and you must have at least this many dream cards (yellow) or be able to make up the difference by paying dream tokens. If you can, you immediately use the power &mdash; or Megalomania &mdash; of that Alice; if you can't, choose another card or lay an Alice face down as a commoner. Playing a commoner doesn't cost anything, lets you draw another card, and builds up the power of one of your five colors, but you don't get a Megalomania bonus and your turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>If you played an Alice, you can then invade a territory in the playing area, which is composed of modular hex tiles. To conquer the territory, you need enough military power (red cards) or supplemental military (red) tokens, and if the territory is not on a hex where you occupy a city, you must have enough food (green cards) or food tokens to reach that space. If you conquer it, you receive a bonus based on the territory's color: military, food or dream tokens; Alice cards; or points. If you conquer a city, you score points and now have a foothold on that hex.<br/><br/>If you lack enough military and food, you can still place the territory under attack and finish it off on a later turn, but another player can potentially conquer it in the meantime.<br/><br/>Mystic forests cannot be conquered until they're surrounded by player-controlled territories, and only the player(s) with the most controlled surrounding territories can then capture the forest, which has a toughness and point value equal to the number of surrounding territories.<br/><br/>The game ends after fourteen rounds, then players score points for having the most or secondmost territories controlled in each hex and for having the most Alices in any of the five colors. Players can also score points for Alice Megalomania effects, and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.<br/><br/>Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace. At certain times in the game, the marketplace is cleared and reset to feature one equipment card of each type.<br/><br/>",

BlackSheep is perfect for two to four players ages eight and up. -From the FFG website.<br/><br/>There's a lot of randomness here, but also room for elementary strategy.  Players make poker hands from two shared cards (figurines of ranked animals) and three of their own (these are actual cards).  There are three such hands playing simultaneously, with players adding one or two cards at a time to any hand on their turn.  When all players have played three cards onto a hand, a winner is chosen, based on the poker ranks.  The winner takes the two shared cards (animal figurines), and new shared cards are added.  At the end of the game, scores are calculated by summing numbers printed on the bottoms of the figurines they captured and some bonuses.  The black sheep figurines are worth negative points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With no natural resources, the Government of Uruguay is concerned about the country&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels. As a consequence, it is seeking to increase the share of domestic resources, of which the most feasible are biomass and wind energy, as well as employing end-use energy efficiency measures to increase its energy security. In addition, the government aims to use the intended growth of the domestic energy sector to foster its other objectives of increasing economic growth and creating employment. (Extract from World Bank Documents, CASE STUDY 11: URUGUAY &ndash; WIND ENERGY PROGRAMME )<br/><br/>&quot;Toward noon, however, the sun's rays were extremely scorching, and when evening came, a bar of clouds streaked the southwest horizon - a sure sign of a change in the weather. The Patagonian pointed it out to the geographer, who replied:<br/><br/>'Yes, I know;' and turning to his companions, added, 'see, a change of weather is coming! We are going to have a taste of PAMPERO.' And he went on to explain that this PAMPERO is an extremely dry wind which blows from the southwest.    [...]    The PAMPERO generally brings a tempest which lasts three days, and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury, 'he said. 'But when the barometer rises, on the contrary, which is the case now, all we need expect is a few violent blasts. So you can make your mind easy, my good friend; by sunrise the sky will be quite clear again.' ( Jules Verne, 1868: In Search of the Castaways. CHAPTER XVI: THE NEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN. )<br/><br/>Pampero is a hand-management, card-driven action-selection game. Every player has a starting set of eight cards to be played on their own tableau, which contains two rows of spaces to activate actions on the different sectors of the board. Each turn, you have the option to play a card to the leftmost empty space of either row or to retrieve all cards from your tableau. After three actions, a special phase takes place &mdash; consolidation, during which you retrieve the rightmost card from any row, generate batteries from stored energy, collect income, and advance the game timer. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The conflict raged for seven weeks in late 1942. Elements of fourteen German divisions of the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army engaged dozens of divisions and brigades of the Soviet 62nd Army in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.<br/><br/>Battle for Stalingrad uses a game-system of German action and Soviet reaction, highlighting the differences in command and tactics employed by the Germans and Soviets at the time. The Ger-mans enjoyed superior application of their air power and artillery. Their efficient communications and command structure, under General Friedrich von Paulus, allowed them to maintain complete initiative in the battle until they were well into the built-up areas of Stalingrad itself. The Soviets, on the other hand, had poor communications among their forces. Lieutenant-General Vasili Chuikov was hard pressed to maintain com-mand of his army, even in the most critical areas of the city. The campaign was finally decided among the burnt out blocks of the dying metropolis, where the Soviets proved themselves masters of urban combat and the German drive to the East was halted.<br/><br/>1980 SPI Version Components;<br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (One sheet with 400 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 200 1/2&quot; counters))<br/>One 32-page rulebook<br/>One 22.25 x 29&quot; Player Aid Sheet (Setup &amp; Reinforcements)<br/>Two 6 sided Dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>2011 Excalibre Version;<br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheet (two sheets with 280 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 40 1/2&quot; counters))<br/>One 54-page rulebook<br/>One 32-page rules supplement &amp; game analysis booklet<br/>One 17 x 20&quot; Deployment Display Chart<br/>One 14 x 22&quot; Reinforcement Display Chart<br/>Two 6 sided Dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

Well, to be honest the landscape holds a few donkeys, too, and while donkeys can help carry all that gold, they'll also eat into your savings if you aren't careful.<br/><br/>Gold! consists of a 60-card deck, with cards in six colors; each color has gold cards valued 3-8 and a few donkeys worth -2. Each player starts the game with a different-colored donkey, then two cards are removed from play and five cards laid out face-up. On a turn, a player must do one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>&bull; Take the lowest valued card on display, with donkeys always being worth less than gold, and add it to his tableau.<br/>&bull; Exchange one gold card from his tableau for a lower-valued gold card.<br/>&bull; Exchange a donkey from his tableau for a gold card of any value.<br/><br/>Whenever a player collects three cards of the same color, he must score it. First, though, he can pilfer a card in a color not present in his tableau from an opponent.<br/><br/>When the last face-up card is claimed, five new cards are revealed. Once the final set of five cards is claimed, players compare their totals in each of the six colors; whoever has the highest total in a color scores the highest gold card of that color. Players then sum the cards in their score piles, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different &quot;occupation paths&quot;.  All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once.  The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while &quot;Going to Sea&quot; is good for happiness.

When you Play Scares, you can play them face down to a Ghost Hunter (so that other players won't know what you've played), or face up (which gives other players information, but allows you to activate the awesome power of the Room that Ghost Hunter is in.)<br/><br/>When you call BOO!, point to a Ghost Hunter and reveal any facedown Scares, then (if more Scares are needed and if you have them) add Scares from your hand to finish off the Ghost Hunter. Congratulations... you've scared out that Ghost Hunter and grab their gear for your collection!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the ghost who has collected the most valuable sets of gear wins the game!<br/><br/>The experienced version of the game introduces a variety of Phantoms; helpful allies that you can play to activate game-changing powers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Empires in America (EIA) is a solitaire States of Siege&trade; Series game of the conflict in North America between the French and British in the mid-18th century. This war, known locally as The French and Indian War, became embroiled in Europe&rsquo;s Seven Years&rsquo; War (1756-63), which caused that conflict to expand into a true World War (this was World War 0, for those keeping count). The French and Indian War saw small armies (with Indian allies joining them, particularly on the French side) march through vast wildernesses to fight battles which decided America&rsquo;s fate. This war was a prelude to the American Revolution that broke out two decades later.<br/><br/>In EIA you control the French (and Indian) forces and the game system controls the British (and their Indian allies).<br/><br/>Empires in America (second edition) FAQ<br/><br/>",

You will find new asset types to aid your cause such as SAM&rsquo;s, mortars, and anti-tank guns. Battle specific events include Operation Dugman 5, Strategic Reserve Releases, the GHQ Air Raid, Lt. Zvicka Greengold, Electronic warfare, the Syrian Frog-7 missile strike and more. New terrain features in Golan '73 include escarpment, wadi, and the anti-tank ditch, known as the purple line. Helicopter-borne air-assaults and special rules for the first night are included to add more historical flavor from this important campaign.<br/><br/>The Israelis start with few units but gain strength as reinforcements arrive, but will there be enough and will they get there in time? The Syrian player starts with a very strong force, but must attack at the right places and rely on rapid breakthrough across the Golan Heights in order to seize the objectives. Time is against the Syrians, with not only the Israeli reserves arriving, but also as the SAM barrier gets reduced and the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force grows. The Syrians must strike hard and fast, then fight to hold on to their gains.<br/><br/>Both players have a degree of variable setup that allows enhanced replay value, but still keeps the historical flavor. A historical setup is also provided for those that wish to more closely follow history.<br/><br/>In Golan '73, the FAB series meets modern warfare and now YOU are in command to fight one of the greatest tank battles ever fought.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.<br/><br/>There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.<br/><br/>Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.<br/><br/>A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.<br/><br/>Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.<br/><br/>Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.<br/><br/>After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.<br/><br/>The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.<br/><br/>When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.<br/><br/>Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;WWII Commander, Volume One: Battle of the Bulge&quot; is the first in a series of fast-playing area-based wargames on key campaigns of the Second World War. Battle of the Bulge is a two-player wargame of the German offensive against the Western Allies in December 1944, designed by renowned wargame designer John H. Butterfield and based on his original boardgame design that was later released in digital format by Shenandoah Studios, an imprint of Slitherine UL Ltd.<br/><br/>The simple elegance and high player-interaction of the WWII Commander games recreates the tension of key battles of the Second World War. The overall game system is easy to learn and makes a great introduction to war games, but mastering its tactics and strategy is a true challenge as the players take turns deciding which units to activate on either attack or defense. As the German player, you must make big gains and be as aggressive as possible while you hold the numerical advantage without over-committing your units, over-extending supply lines or falling prone to fuel shortages. As the Allied player, you must first withstand the initial German surprise attack and coordinate effective holding actions while defending key geographic objectives as you muster your arriving forces for counterattacks.<br/><br/>The package features premium components throughout; from the mounted game board and oversized units, to the activation cubes and wooden control discs, sure to appeal to war gamers and euro gamers alike. The rules are simple, game play is fast and furious and can be completed in a single sitting, and victory may be achieved by either side at different stages of the game.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>Time Scale: 1 day, composed of multiple alternating player turns<br/>Map Scale: abstract areas approx. 15 miles across<br/>Unit Scale: Divisions<br/>Players: one to two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: 45 minute intro scenario, 3 hour campaign<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Mounted 25 x 22 inch map<br/>    140 over-sized 3/4&quot; counters<br/>    Rules booklet<br/>    German Order of Battle Appearance Display<br/>    Allied Order of Battle Appearance Display<br/>    Two player Aid cards<br/>    50 Activation cubes<br/>    40 wooden German control discs<br/>    Seven 10-sided dice<br/>    Box and Lid<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Early in the morning on 20 May 1941, as 30,000 Commonwealth soldiers on Crete were finishing breakfast, hundreds of German transport aircraft&mdash;some towing gliders&mdash;rumbled over the Mediterranean island. The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.<br/><br/>The invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.<br/><br/>This was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.<br/><br/>The German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.<br/><br/>Although casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.<br/><br/>Operation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.<br/><br/>As the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?<br/><br/>Features include:<br/><br/><br/>     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.<br/>     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.<br/>     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.<br/><br/><br/>Thirteen scenarios include:<br/><br/>     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.<br/>     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.<br/>     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.<br/>     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.<br/>     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "St Patrick, first released as Salvage, is a simple trick-taking game that combines the fun of Hearts with the assessment of Oh Hell and the fairness of duplicate Bridge. Everyone starts at 20 points and takes damage over the course of play. The game ends when one player reaches 0, at which time the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In the original Salvage game, an oil tanker is on fire, and you are part of a rescue team sent to deal with it. You will take damage as you put out the fires, but before the operation begins you can salvage oil as an insurance against the costs you expect to suffer.<br/><br/>The key dynamic of the game is that before playing a hand you assess the strength of your cards and make a bid of how many points you are prepared to lose not to play the hand. That bid acts as an insurance, and you will be penalized only for points you lose above that bid. However, if everyone's combined bids equal the total amount of damage that can be taken, then everyone loses the amount they bid, and the hands get passed around the table so that other players have a chance to do better with the same hand.<br/><br/>In St Patrick, you now compete to retain the most life points by using relics to avoid snake bites.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wing Leader: Victories 1940-1942 is the first volume in the Wing Leader game series. It is a game of massed daylight air battles where players command squadron and flight-sized units in formations of wing strength or greater. One side takes the role of raiders, leading a force of bombers through to the target. The other side defends with fighters, trying to claw for altitude and intercept the enemy.<br/><br/>The game employs a side-view of the air battle, in which the forces maneuver vertically and end-to-end along the path of the raid. Players must gain height, exploit the Sun and cloud for advantage, and mass or divide their formations to stop the enemy. If you fail, the enemy bombers will rain down bombs on men and ships below. You are the Wing Leader.<br/><br/>This 2nd Edition includes significant updates to the original version. The updated components to the 2nd edition (with noted changes) are:<br/><br/>&bull; 1 Rulebook (Updated to Living rules v2.2)<br/>&bull; 1 Scenario Book (Updated with new scenarios and expanded by 8 pages from the original)<br/>&bull; 2 Air combat player aid (Updated - v2.2 edition)<br/>&bull; 1 Bombing player aid (Updated - v2.2 edition)<br/>&bull; 2 Wing Displays<br/>&bull; 1 Map (Updated - v2.0 edition, the same art as the Supremacy map, but non-mounted)<br/>&bull; 5 Aircraft data card sheets (Updated)<br/>&bull; 2 Countersheets (140 counters, 1&quot; x 0.5&quot;)<br/>&bull; 1 Countersheets (280 counters, 0.5&quot; x 0.5&quot;)<br/>&bull; 1 NEW Mixed sheet of aircraft data cards and counters (4 ADCs; 100 counters and markers)<br/>&bull; 1 NEW Battle Board (Same battle board as appeared in Wing Leader: Supremacy)<br/>&bull; 2 Six-sided dice<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epigo is a two or four player strategy game that should feel both fresh and familiar.  Epigo's simultaneous action selection makes every round of the game exciting, even though Epigo features relatively simple rules and mechanics.  Epigo is also modular - the boxed game includes rules for 21 variants, with more variants available on our website.  Variants modify one or more of the core rules, providing unique challenges and adding countless hours of replayability.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>To win, be the first to capture three of your opponents&rsquo; Epigons by pushing them off the edge of the board.  Epigons have a rank between 1 and 7 dictating the priority at which they move.  At the start of every round, both players choose and stack three Orders from their hand. The top Order of a stack marks the first move, the middle tile is the second move, and the third tile is the last move.  Each Order has arrows on one side, indicating the direction the corresponding Epigon will try to move.  Once both players have locked in their moves, the stacks are revealed and unraveled.  First, compare the top Order on each stack.  The higher ranking Epigon moves one space in the direction shown on the arrows.  Then the other Epigon (matching the lower priority Order) moves in the same manner.  If both players reveal Orders of the same rank they cancel and neither Epigon moves (players often try to make this happen intentionally for various nefarious purposes). After three moves, players pick up all of their Orders and start the next round.<br/><br/>When moving an Epigon, one of three things will happen: it will Slide, Push, or be Blocked.  When an Epigon moves into an empty space, it Slides into it. If that space is occupied however, the Epigon tries to Push in that direction instead.  An Epigon must have a majority of friendly pieces moving in the same direction whenever it tries to Push otherwise the move is Blocked.  The full rulebook contains detailed explanations of the movement rules, and is available on our website.<br/><br/>The boxed game accomodates up to 4 players in teams of 2, and introduces variant play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the bustling market of Kairo, traders build their stalls and try to entice customers with attractive goods, with each customer bringing money that the trader can then use to expand that stall or establish new stalls.<br/><br/>To set up Kairo, players first take turns placing three colored stalls (out of six) on the game board. They also take three stall cards (which highlight one or more sections on the game board) and one coin of each of the six colors. Five colored customers start at particular locations on the game board, with the sixth customer placed to the side. On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Draws two cards (face-up or face-down stall cards or market barker cards).<br/>    Moves a customer to a stall of that customer's color.<br/>    Plays a stall card; then builds a new stall, expands an existing stall, or moves a blocked-off stall.<br/><br/><br/>The active player can choose to move any customer, and that customer will move to the closest stall (measured on orthogonal paths) of the same color. Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &quot;call&quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall. If the active player owns the visited stall, he receives one coin of the stall's color for each tile in that stall; if not, the active player receives a one coin commission while the owner receives the normal payout. This customer is then swapped with the customer off the board.<br/><br/>When building a new stall, a player cannot place it in the same region as another stall of the same color. Regulations! Restaurants must be placed in an area designated for them, while all other stalls must go in the market area. When expanding an existing stall, the player must pay one coin of the same color for each tile in the enlarged stall. By expanding, you can earn more coins when customers visit, create longer paths to opponents' stalls, reserve area in which to expand further, and (most importantly) earn victory points. You score VPs each time you expand, and if your stall is the largest (or tied for the largest) of that color, you'll take one or two medals that provide a VP bonus.<br/><br/>Once the expansions run low in one or two colors, players can only build or expand. Once everyone has finished building, the game ends, with players earning VPs for the medals and money they have in hand. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The problem here is that you've also stumbled onto a horde of monsters! And to make things even worse, three other cities seem to have discovered the existence of your mine as well. As they rush into danger to mine the precious crystals, you have no choice but to join in the fray...<br/><br/>Age of Towers brings the exciting gameplay of your favorite tower defense games onto the tabletop! Playable either solo or with up to four players, Age of Towers sees you and your opponents competing to defend your cities against the oncoming wave of monsters by constructing defenses, placing traps, and funneling those beasts towards your opponents' cities!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn has three phases: night, dawn, and day. During night, the event card is applied and monsters progress on your path (with each type having a different movement value). Two more monsters (or your boss) appear on your path. During dawn, the towers can attack one monster of a particular type on one of the four adjacent spaces, or the boss. During day, each player can choose one action from the four available, then they can take one more action, whether the same or different.<br/><br/>Each monster type has a movement value (1-3 spaces) and maybe a special ability; all core box monsters have 2 life points. The boss, who is not a monster, is harder to kill as it has 10 life points; when a player successfully kills it, the game ends. Each time a monster or a boss leaves your path to reach your city, you lose a number of city guards equal to their movement value. You begin at 15, and even if you lose your last one, you don't lose the game; you will just earn fewer victory points than other players.<br/><br/>After the game end, each player adds their victory points from three sources: Number of remaining city guards, amount of damage to your boss, and achievements (which are drawn randomly at the beginning of the game).<br/><br/>",

Before you reveal all of the tricks up your sleeve, there is a chance for defenders to interfere with your attack. The more defenders that get in your way, the harder it will be to score. After the defenders (if any) have been revealed, you play out your hand. That&rsquo;s right! The defenders won&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s crashing the net until after they have coordinated their defense. Now that you know what you&rsquo;re up against, play your cards and see if your strategy and players were good enough to overcome the defenses and the goalie. If it is, you score!<br/><br/>",

Now if you'll excuse me, the &quot;Show must go on!&quot;<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/><br/>Take a Seat introduces an innovative mechanic named Share &amp; Write where the randomness is created by player interaction (instead of a dice or a card). In each turn players will get a reservation panel and they will have to decide whether to use the usher's ability or get direct points. Then they will need to mark a reservation in the board of their right or left (depending the turn) by scratching on any of the 4 tickets of the reservation panel.  Finally they will have to assign seats on the theater by marking the outline and the circles that correspond to the selected pieces in the previous step.<br/><br/>The game last 14 turns. Once ended you proceed to the final score. There are 3 areas to score: objective cards, reservation majorities and usher bonus. Players add up all points to get the total scoring.

        "description": "Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.<br/><br/>The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out coordinates to locate their opponent.<br/><br/>There are two players, German and British. The British player has the task of placing the Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.<br/><br/>Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.<br/><br/>The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.<br/><br/>The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.<br/><br/>Second edition changes included:<br/><br/>     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a hexagonal overlay;  <br/>     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; <br/>     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by more complex rules.<br/>     packaging was modified; the second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>WHO WANTS SOME?!<br/><br/>The Koprulu Sector is being ravaged by war. You must stand against your enemies as one of the three powerful races. Will you choose the advanced and mysterious Protoss, the rugged and tenacious Terran, or lead the ravenous Zerg swarm? No matter which race you choose, you will fight for your very survival. The war for galactic supremacy begins NOW!<br/><br/>In this version of Risk, players are controlling the three factions from the StarCraft video game, in a battle to control the sector. The players recruit and mobilize their units in order to gain control of the various areas on the board. Battle is resolved using dice as in regular Risk, but also with special power cards which are given to players who control certain areas on the board.  As in traditional Risk, players move troops and attack into territories on the board, and face off with opponents in dice battles where higher rolls eliminate opposing forces, with tied rolls favoring the defending troops.<br/><br/>Includes 4 ways to play:<br/><br/>    Basic Training (3-6 players) : the players start on a pre-set map and strive to collect three achievements (controlling certain areas, conquering 10 territories in one turn, etc').<br/>    Command Room (3-6 players) : similar to Basic Training, but the players get to set up the map  (e.g. placing mineral fields which make certain territories be worth more than others) and place their starting units by themselves.<br/>    Total Domination (2-6 players) : Closest to the original Risk. The players play until one player controls the entire map.<br/>    Team Play (4 or 6 players) : Variant of &quot;Command Room&quot; for playing 2v2 or 3v3.<br/><br/><br/>",

Its proximity to the harbor makes it a hub for travelers around the globe, all gathering here to compete against each other. These vying travelers wear a swaggering smile on their faces, and invite you to join their game. From the sharp, bead-like eyes peeking behind the cards, you realize they do not just want to have a bit of fun, but aim at winning all your money away. However, your huge reservoir of knowledge won&rsquo;t let them have their way. Who will be the smartest mind reader laughing at the end of game?<br/><br/>Play rock&ndash;paper&ndash;scissors to decide which players decide the categories for the 3 rounds to be played respectively. There&rsquo;s no limitation on categories selectable, but the category deciding player should be able to come up with at least 10 answers. For example, a category can be Asian countries, Olympic ball sports, etc.<br/>After understanding the decided category, write or draw your answers on the cards. You must fill each card with a different answer. Be careful that no one sees your answers. You are not allowed to use an internet search engine to find the answers. Your brain is the only resource available to you.<br/><br/>Players must guess the answers of others or to predict how many correct answer sets this round will have. The game ends after 3 rounds.

The spy secretly chooses one of the destinations, and flips to the chosen country's page in the handbook. Each detective is given three informant cards, and in turn each detective must play an informant to get information about the spy's secret destination. The spy must find the relevant information in the handbook and answer truthfully. The informants may provide information on various aspects such as population, industry, religion, history, economy, and so on. After a detective has played an informant, the detective must also eliminate one of the destinations on the table.<br/><br/>At any time, the detectives can decide to guess on the spy's destination. If they guess correctly, the detectives win the round; otherwise the spy wins. The spy also wins if the detectives run out of informant cards, so the detectives must manage their resources well and not spend too much time or else the spy will manage to get away. The first side to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>No prior geographic knowledge is needed to play. Since Destination X is a team-based game, it can be played in groups of any number of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Bloody April is a standalone game using a similar format to Elusive Victory/Downtown, modified to cover the unique aspects of air combat during World War 1. The game covers the pivotal air combat over the Arras sector, France from March until the end of May 1917. Players take on the roles of Royal Flying Corps commander or German Imperial Air Service commander for their respective sides and will have a multitude of taskings available to accomplish and complete their objectives. Bloody April will include both single mission scenarios and multi-mission/multi-day campaigns to allow players to play out large scale battles in a manageable timeframe.<br/><br/>Bloody April recreates entire air raids in detail. Each player will have many unique tactical challenges to overcome. Both players will have numerous taskings available such as Bombing, Recon, Artillery Cooperation, Contact Patrols, Balloon Busting, Offensive Patrols, Line Patrols and Trench Strafing. Players will also have Anti-Aircraft systems available such as different caliber &quot;Archie&quot;, AA guns and &quot;Flaming Onions&quot; incendiary weapons to hinder their opponent&rsquo;s movements. The map covers a significant portion of the Arras sector from Bethune and Lens in the North to Cambrai in the South. All the major aerodromes in this theatre of operations are displayed on map with a scale of 1nm per hex and 2 minutes per game turn. Each detailed aircraft counter will represent anywhere from 1 to 5 aircraft.<br/><br/>The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) player will be on the offensive during this timeframe and have a plethora of diverse aircraft types ranging from obsolete but workhorse B.E.2 2-seaters to brand new aircraft that would become legendary as the war went on such as the SE-5 scout and Bristol F.2a 2-seater. In all the RFC player will have over 15 different types of scout and 2-seater aircraft at their disposal. Pusher type F.E.2b/d and D.H.2 aircraft and the Sopwith Triplane will help fill your arsenal. Sopwith Pups and 1 &frac12; Strutters, Nieuport 17s and SPAD VIIs are some of the other types available. R.E.8s and F.K.8s will help augment your 2-seater fleet and will begin to replace the heavily attrited B.E.2 fleet.<br/><br/>The German Imperial Air Service player takes on the role of Jagdstaffeln (Jasta) commander utilizing Ace pilots such as the legendary &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen and his Jasta 11 comrades flying Halberstadt and Albatros scout aircraft that terrorized the British 2-seaters during this period. The German player will also have his own 2-seater aircraft such as the Rumpler and Albatros C-class 2-seaters to provide Recon, Bombing and Artillery Cooperation. The battle for the skies over Arras in France 1917 is under your control. Will it be another Bloody April ?<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Terry Simo<br/>MAP, CHARTS &amp; COUNTER ART: Ian Wedge<br/><br/>",

The tennis court is overlaid with a hex grid, and players use a rubber-band mechanism to hit the ball. The Monkeys are used only to note the location of the player on the court -- they could have just been cubes, but look much better this way. The Monkeys, by the way, are from south German television commercials.<br/><br/>The game includes options you might not expect from the name or from an unknown small publisher. Each player has a limited amount of movement when hitting or returning a shot, and then can &quot;borrow&quot; from their next move but this puts them under pressure and thus limits their ability to shoot most effectively. Other clever options include the ability to serve and volley using a clever wooden block idea, the ability to lob over a volley using a ramp, and the ability to smash a volley.<br/><br/>",

Each player then writes the results, e.g. 1 and 4, in empty spaces in the pattern, with each number being in the mirrored space of the other. If, say, you place the 1 in the leftmost space of the top row, then you must place the 4 in the rightmost space of the top row.<br/><br/>After 22 dice rolls, everyone's pattern will be filled. Each 1 on its own &mdash; that is, with no other 1s orthogonally adjacent &mdash; scores 1 point; each set of two 2s that have no other orthogonally adjacent 2s score 2 points; and so on up to a set of six 6s with no other orthogonally adjacent 6s  being worth 6 points. A starred space is present on each half of the pattern, and a scored group that contains this starred space has its points doubled. (One pattern has a set of three spaces with hearts, and if you fill all three hearts with the same number, you score 5 points.)<br/><br/>Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Their survival depended greatly upon not only their skills, but also the quality of their aircraft.

In Blue Max, two to six players take the roles of pilots belonging to one of two teams, either the Allies or the Central Powers and aim to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible. With rules that account for altitude, fuel reserves and the maneuverability of your plane, Blue Max places you squarely in the cockpit and you'll need to both master your machine and outwit your foes in order to win. The famous Philip Hall aerial combat game is back with new graphics and updated rules. Components: 1 rule-book, 1 game board (with a map on each side), 6 player screens (3 per team), 18 maneuver charts, 18 plane cards, 144 small size cards, 3 punch boards with 168 cardboard pieces, 60 tracking sheets, 6 custom dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many centuries ago, legendary smiths forged the Crown of Command, a magical artefact of immense power. Whoever wears the Crown of Command will hold power over all of the land.<br/><br/>Decades ago, a powerful wizard sealed the Crown of Command behind the Portal of Power to prevent evil forces from obtaining it. Only those who possess one of the legendary Talismans may pass through this Portal to reach the Crown. Over the years, five of the Talismans have disappeared. Enemy forces now seek to find them in order to seize the Crown of Command for themselves. Brave heroes that you are, you have banded together to go on a quest to retrieve all five Talismans and thereby stop the evil power behind these enemy forces from ruling the world. This task won't be easy as finding each Talisman is an epic adventure in itself. However, if you work together using everyone's abilities and helping one another when you can, you will surely succeed.<br/><br/>In Talisman - Legendary Tales, the players must work together as an adventure party to recover the five legendary Talismans that have been lost. During each adventure, the party endeavors to recover one of the lost Talismans. The adventures must be played in order. You may repeat adventures, and you may play one or more adventures in a game session.<br/><br/>Over the course of this story, you will travel across a wondrous land and have exciting adventures in which you must make important decisions and defend yourself against cruel enemies. As an adventure party, you succeed in each adventure once you have completed the final task and have recovered the Talisman. Be careful: You have only a limited amount of time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Bucket King 3D, a new version of Stefan Dorra's The Bucket King, players lay down sets of animal cards to try to knock over every other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to defend your own buckets and attack those of others &mdash; and if you knock out a bucket low in someone's pyramid, you might cause a cascade that takes out even more!<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player either plays cards or loses buckets; the game is played in rounds with a new round starting after anyone loses one or more buckets. At the start of each round, the active player chooses 1-3 cards in hand of the same color/animal, lays them face up in front of himself, announces their sum, then draws one card to add to his hand (regardless of how many he played). Each subsequent player must lay down 1-3 cards of the same suit as the initial player with a higher sum than previously announced or else lose a bucket. (If play circles the table to the round's start player, he can add 1-3 new cards to those previously played, then announce the sum of all cards in front of him.)<br/><br/>When a player cannot or chooses not to defend his pyramid by playing cards, he removes one bucket of that card color from his pyramid by pushing, flicking or poking it with only one finger. (If he doesn't have a bucket of the required color, he removes a bucket of his choice.) This player then starts a new round after everyone has cleared their played cards.<br/><br/>In a two- to four-player game, the game ends when a player loses his last bucket; in a five- to six-player game, a player who loses his last bucket is out of the game, and the game ends when only three players have buckets still in play. Whoever has the most buckets remaining in his pyramid wins.<br/><br/>Bucket King 3D includes 2 variants for experience players: <br/>(1)Play with the Special &quot;One&quot;!<br/>Whenever a player lays down a 1 while playing cards of the appropriate color, he can also play one other card of any color, adding the value of that card (and any others played) to his sum; he then draws two cards (one as normal, plus another card for the bonus card played) to end his turn. For example, if the required suit is blue, he may play a blue 1, with a red 4 as the additional card, announce his sum as &quot;Five&quot;, then draw two cards from the deck.<br/><br/>If he plays two 1s, then he may play two additional cards of any color and draw three cards at the end of his turn. A player can lay down at most five cards.<br/><br/>(2) Play with the Backfiring Discard!<br/>This variant is played with all the basic rules, but the direction of play may change during the game!<br/>When the active player plays cards to attack on his turn, the direction of the play is reversed if he plays an additional card of the same colour onto the discard pile. He draws cards as normal for the cards he has played in front of himself, but he does not draw any card for the additional card he has played.<br/>For example, a player has played a Blue 4. The next player plays a Blue 5 in front of himself and discards a Blue 2. Then he draws only 1 card. The direction changes now and play continues with the previous player.<br/>You may play both variants (1) and (2) in the same game! For example, a player may play a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and the direction of play remains unchanged. But if he plays a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and discards a Blue 2 (variant 2), the game continues in the reverse direction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zero Leader is based on the Corsair Leader game, with some significant changes. The game focuses on commanding and managing a Japanese aerial squadron in the Pacific in World War Two, with aircraft including the A6M2 Zero, KI-84 Frank, KI-43 Oscar, G4M Betty, and G3M Nell, covering the major campaigns throughout the war from 1941 to 1945.<br/><br/>You will need to select the right mix of aircraft under your command in order to successfully carry out the different types of missions. Each aircraft has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, a fighter like the Zero is very maneuverable and deadly to enemy Bandits, but it has limited ability to attack naval and ground targets, whereas a bomber like the Betty can carry a lot of munitions, but are susceptible to enemy bandit and anti-aircraft attacks.<br/><br/>This game also includes additional aspects of Japanese operations such as mechanical and maintenance challenges, invoking samurai spirit, as well as the ability to deploy the deadly Ohka kamikaze aircraft-bombs. There is also an air combat system which gives you more tactical options when dogfighting with enemy aircraft, including manuevering for position, increasing pilot aggression and being affected by the robustness of the aircraft.<br/><br/>Like the other games in the &quot;Leader&quot; series, Zero Leader is a solitaire game.

        "description": "Tiny Epic Crimes is a fast-paced, crime-fighting, deduction game for 1 to 4 players that offers multiple ways to play. The game can be enjoyed competitively, cooperatively, or solo.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of detectives, and depending on the game mode, will be working either together&hellip;. OR separately&hellip;. to crack the murder case. Time matters, and the first 48 hours after any crime are the most critical. Players race around Echo Ridge City collecting evidence, such as the murder weapon, forensics, or the getaway vehicle.<br/><br/>This secret evidence is sifted through using the novel Tiny Epic Decoder System, which keeps all of the murderer&rsquo;s other evidence hidden. This knowledge eliminates suspects and helps identify the true killer. But crime doesn&rsquo;t stop for one investigation. Players must answer the call of duty, juggling their time as other criminal activities arise across the city. Resolving these events allow players to gain useful alibis and powerful Force Cards, but knowing full well that their actions will take them hours closer to a reckoning.<br/><br/>In their final hour, players will stake their careers on a final guess: who they think the murderer really is&hellip; hoping that their wits and detective skills are enough to bring the correct suspect to justice.<br/><br/>Can you hold this city of crime together long enough to crack the case, or will it go cold and your time on the force run out?<br/><br/>",

Fontenoy is a tight test between the greatest captain of the war - Maurice de Saxe, commanding French forces behind defensive works against the inexperienced Duke of Cumberland commanding a mixed group of Allied troops.<br/><br/>Aside from the classic, historical battle in which the Allies try to breach the French defenses, variants will allow players to explore options which allow the Allies to outflank the French, add more forces to both sides, and even take away the French defenses for a straight-up contest on the plains of Flanders.<br/><br/>Fontenoy retains all of the aspects of the previous games of the series set in the Seven Years War.  The scale is 100 yards per hex and 20 minute game turns, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries at the scale of 1 strength point equals 100 foot soldiers, 50 horsemen, or 2 cannon.<br/><br/>Also included is the Battle of Melle, 9 July, 1745.  This is a complete battle with a small number of counters per side, played out on a half size map.  Melle is a rare meeting engagement and is a swirling, chaotic battle as each side seeks to obtain their objectives before night falls.  Melle is a quick game, ideal for BAR beginners or for those who want to play out a full battle in one sitting.<br/><br/>Microbadge: <br/><br/>",

The stars are aligning soon and only those who have dared to piece together the clues from the mythos even know what's coming. Do you and your fellow investigators have what it takes to save everything? I think not...<br/><br/>In Cthulhu: A Deck Building Game, you cooperatively work with fellow players (1-6 players) as Investigators to banish the Elder God and his minions by using Moxie (force of character, determination, or nerve) to reduce their health to zero. If you banish the Elder God before he reduces all of the Investigators health to zero you win the game.<br/><br/>There are two phases of the game, a planning and combat phase.<br/><br/>1) In the planning phase, the Investigators activate cards in their hand, research new cards at the Miskatonic University and then ready themselves for final preparation.<br/><br/>2) In the combat phase, the Elder God and his minions attack the Investigators' health and sanity. Investigators may go crazy or die out right, however, they have a chance to fight back. The Investigators use Moxie to push back the waves of the occult and supernatural.<br/><br/>Building your personal library by researching in the Miskatonic University makes you stronger and is your only hope against the Elders. Keep in mind, every bit of resource used to research is a bit not used against the Mythos. It is a balance you must solve to defeat the Elder Gods.<br/><br/>",

In addition, Astronauts are charged with completing experiments by rolling dice and assigning them to their experiment, but they don't have all the information that they need to complete them. Mission Control can spend tokens to relay key pieces of information to the Astronauts that they need to complete their tasks or to aid the Astronauts by providing bonuses to their dice or boosting systems. Mission Control also tracks the flight and experiment progress on the ground via a panel of sliders.

He commanded tribute from Israel&rsquo;s neighbors, expanded Israel&rsquo;s borders, built roads and fortresses, and kept the peace within the land. His merchants filled the kingdom with exotic goods such as spices, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Perhaps most famously, Solomon also built the Temple in Jerusalem, a golden place of worship lasting hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Wisdom of Solomon is a 1-5 player worker placement game taking place during the reign of King Solomon. Players act as Governors for Solomon, sending out workers to gather Resources, build structures, and expand Solomon&rsquo;s influence in the kingdom. The player who curries the most Favor will be crowned the winner!<br/><br/>The Wisdom of Solomon board is divided into two sections. The section on the right side of the board is a map of Solomon&rsquo;s kingdom where players will build custom houses and roads. As a Governor expands their influence in the land with new roads and houses, that Governor&rsquo;s network will become more powerful and pull Resources from more and more areas. These networks of custom houses will control the flow of Resources in Wisdom of Solomon!<br/><br/>On the left side of the board is a miniaturized version of the city of Jerusalem. Within this city is the Market area, a region of the city where workers will be sent to buy, sell, and trade Resources and also to play powerful Fortune cards that have been acquired. Elsewhere in Jerusalem is a Foreman who has the plans for building new structures throughout Israel. A Governor can use their Resources to build these structures and create new houses of influence in the kingdom, while granting the Governor new ways to gain Resources and Favor.<br/><br/>Finally, within the city of Jerusalem a Governor may visit the Levites to help build the Temple of Solomon. Workers send to the Levites can donate Resources to raise this awesome structure and gain great Favor and Fortune! Next to this Temple are the Holy Places, the most sacred of objects that groups of workers may visit and receive great things!<br/><br/>Wisdom of Solomon ends when a Governor no longer has a Custom House to build or the Temple of Solomon has been completed. When that occurs, the round ends and each person reveals their Temple Tokens. Each Governor tallies their final score and the person having the most Favor wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Penny Lane also has a tableau-building component, where players can get bonus points or currency by aligning their buildings with different &quot;links.&quot;<br/><br/>Each round consists of an action phase followed by an upkeep phase. In the action phase, a player can either select a Main Street action or pass. The action phase repeats until each player has passed.<br/><br/>To take a Main Street action, a player must choose from the communal Main Street cards, and place the required number of pennies on the open action space. The player then carries out the effect of that card. Possible actions include purchasing a building, placing a worker, rearranging buildings, or claiming the Mayor meeple to become the new 1st player.<br/><br/>Each player places purchase buildings in their lane. If they're able to connect a penny link, they get an extra penny at the end of each upkeep phase. If they're able to connect a victory point link, they get an extra victory point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In the upkeep phase, all players gain 1 penny. Players then resolve all effects in their lane as indicated by the upkeep symbol and their penny links.<br/><br/>The final round is triggered when one player has 10 or more points on their lane, and the player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>",

In High Season: Grand Hotel Roll &amp; Write, you prepare rooms, accommodate guests, make personnel decisions, and court the favor of the emperor, all while managing your money and trying to avoid loans.<br/><br/>The game lasts seven rounds, and each player has a hotel board and staff board, with eight of each being available. At the start of a round, roll dice based on the number of players, then place them on the six spaces (numbered 1-6) on the action board. On a turn, draft one of the dice, then use the associated according to its strength, which is based on the number of dice on that space when you remove it. The actions allow you to:<br/><br/><br/>    Prepare as many rooms for guests as the strength of the action, paying the cost for each.<br/>    Occupy a prepared room by paying the cost minus the action's strength; gain the depicted one-time bonus when doing so.<br/>    Advance on the emperor track equal to the action's strength; gain the listed bonuses as you reach them, with a point bonus for reaching the end of the track first.<br/>    Earn krone, the game's currency, equal to the action's strength.<br/>    Hire a staff member on your board, paying their cost minus the action's strength. Two staff members give you a permanent bonus, two grant a one-time effect, and two provide bonus points during scoring.<br/><br/><br/>If you are the first player to occupy one of the eight rows or seven columns, you earn bonus points that are unavailable to anyone else who occupies this row or column later. When you occupy all the rooms in a contiguous color group on your board, you gain an immediate bonus of points (for a blue group), krone (red), or steps on the emperor's track (yellow).<br/><br/>The bonuses and effects of the staff differ on each board, so you need to figure out how to take advantage of the opportunities available through them in combination with your particular arrangement of hotel rooms and the dice available each round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players tally their points, possibly losing some in the process for ignoring the emperor, but ideally overcoming that loss thanks to occupied rooms, assorted bonuses, and staff-generated endgame points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For over 2000 years the Chinese have tried to dominate their neighbors to the south. The last time was 1979 when the PRC invaded Vietnam in response to the latter's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That war lasted about four weeks before China withdrew, having declared its mission accomplished. <br/> Now, the old foes are at it once again. Sparring over the resource rich areas of the South China Sea, both sides have been slowly edging toward the precipice of war. That day has now come.<br/><br/>Next War: Vietnam is the fifth game in the Next War Series. This game returns the action to Asia and the powderkeg surrounding the South China Sea. This time the Chinese don't intend a limited, punitive expedition; they intend to squash the burgeoning threat from their southern border once and for all and prove, through force of arms, that the South China Sea is theirs. Building on the naval rules showcased Next War: Taiwan, players will have a chance to fight over the Spratly and Paracel Islands once again, as well as the mountainous jungle of North Vietnam. <br/> If the U.S. gets involved, it might finally land troops in Haiphong Harbor and march on Hanoi, albeit as a relief force and an ally to its former enemy. The question is what will the rest of the region do? Will they join a side or stay neutral?<br/> Next War: Vietnam will also allow players to play a combined game with Next War:Taiwan, and, with the rules in the latter game, adding on NextWar: Korea as well for what would amount to the Pacific Front of World War III. <br/> Ownership of any previous Next War Series will NOT be required to play Next War: Vietnam.<br/><br/>Units: <br/> Next War: Vietnam primarily represents divisions and brigades of the armies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency. The Vietnamese People's Self Defense Force is represented both by units and special rules. <br/> Air units represent the fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants. They are rated for All-Weather Capabilities, range, average pilot skill and training, and their capabilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions. <br/> Naval units represent an abstraction of groups of ships (task forces) and allow players to conduct amphibious invasions, naval combat, naval gunfire support, and more. <br/> Maps and Terrain <br/> The game&rsquo;s map represents the area in and around the northern border of Vietnam at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from just west of Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam to just east of Nanning, China and just north of the PRC-SRV border to a few miles south of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. <br/> The Spratlys, Paracels, and other sea areas are represented by a Strategic Display incorporating Land Areas and At Sea Boxes similar to the one in Next War: Taiwan. <br/> Game System <br/> A game turn is composed of:<br/><br/>Weather Determination wherein bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations. <br/>Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.<br/>Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. <br/>Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes. <br/>One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns. <br/>Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements <br/>Victory Determination<br/><br/>Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives, while at least one will be a campaign game encompassing the entire map. Similarly to previous games in the series, the Advanced Game scenarios will be divided into various starting points representing different levels of build-up before the game begins.<br/><br/>Next War: Vietnam puts you in command of the potential conflict. Can you, as the Chinese player, enforce your will on Vietnam and achieve your goals in the South China Sea, shaping your position in world affairs? Or will you, as the Vietnamese player, once again successfully defend against your larger northern neighbor?<br/><br/>",

Before everyone goes their separate way again, the living and the dead make a bet: Whichever group makes it back again to their own world first has say over the other one for a year. The race begins...<br/><br/>&iexcl;Adios Calavera! is a tactical race between the living and the dead for two players, one controlling the dead, the other the living. Each player has eight pieces and sets them up on a edge of a roughly 9x9 board next to the edge of the opposing player. Players are thus not directly opposite each other, but seated at a right angle. The first player to get their eight pieces off their opposing side of the board wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move one of your pieces. A piece has as many movement points as pieces on the line where it is standing orthogonally (i.e. at a right angle) to the main direction towards your goal. This includes all pieces: both your own and your opponent's, including the piece being moved. Some pieces also have special abilities, such as moving through obstacles, switching with other pieces, or taking additional movement.<br/><br/>",

They do this by attempting to be the most successful at both bringing people into the city as well as campaigning for the citizens' approval. Whoever best balances these two goals will win the election.<br/><br/>There are seven offices within City Hall. These offices deal with a different aspect of building the city or campaigning, such as the Tax Assessor, Surveyor, or Zoning Board. In a round, each player will get to activate one of these offices. However, just because you activate an office doesn't mean you will get to use it. The other players will have an opportunity to use their influence to steal control of the office away from you. Keeping it will require countering with your own influence. However, you can instead let another player control that office this round and add their influence to your own, giving you a leg up on controlling things later on.<br/><br/>In using these offices, players will buy land and build properties to create attractive neighborhoods that will bring the most people into the city &ndash; or they might place a factory next to an opponent's housing complex to drive people out. They will also tax their constituents to raise funds (with the option of sacrificing popularity to tax at higher rates), buy and sell influence to the Lobbyist, and campaign to increase their approval level.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the citizens of the city will vote based on which player brought them in and that player's approval level. Special interest groups will also collect votes for players based on certain goals, such as Wall Street backing the player with the most money. Whichever player has the most votes on election day will become Mayor of New York and appoint his or her opponents to the Sanitation Department.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Thieves Den, set in the world of 10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower, the players are master thieves who send their hirelings out into the city to nab the choicest treasures, then sell those ill-gotten gains to the underworld fences to increase the master thief's reputation. Certain treasures can also be bartered to Alazar, the wizard, for special powers.<br/><br/>Thieves Den is played over three rounds. In each round, each player drafts three location cards as potential targets for their thieving. All of these locations are public knowledge, and in the next phase the players take turns sending their minions to the locations to score the loot. You can send your thieves to any of the locations, but if you send them to another player's location, that player may also get a prize, sometimes extra treasure, sometimes more thieves. During this phase, players can also send thieves to carry special assortments of treasures to one of the fences, gaining that player reputation points. Bonus reputation points can also be earned by building relationships with specific fences.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the player with the highest reputation is the new crime lord of the town.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1829 was the first of the 18xx series. First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/>",

You carefully exchange any non-indigenous plants with native ones, recreating an environment where a variety of animals can live, including dozens of endangered species. Some of these endangered animals were victims of human violence or were found wounded and many of them were saved from illegal trade. In Sanctuary: Endangered Species, each of you will create a sanctuary for different endangered animal species. With the help of volunteers and rangers you will develop your facility, take care of your animals, and recreate their natural habitat as you try to save them from the impacts of civilization. You will maintain order and monitor animal's behavior &ndash; everything to ensure that the animals in your sanctuary are happy and safe.<br/><br/>The Sanctuary: Endangered Species is a worker placement game. At the beginning of each round, you lay out a row of cards each of which has a main action and side action. Players take turns placing their workers on those cards in order to perform actions. Each worker &quot;sees&quot; and can perform their main action and  any side actions that are within their line of sight, which is limited by other workers and by obstacles printed on the cards. These actions help you to find new animals and improve their living conditions. The key is to choose the right card at the right moment and to perform your available actions in the most efficient order.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In All on 1 Card &mdash; Alles auf 1 Karte &mdash; players need to complete the colored rows on their cards in order to score points, but they can mark off rows on only one card at a time.<br/><br/>During set-up, each player is dealt two (erasable) cards that have five rows on them, with the rows being 2-6 spaces long; the rows are in five different colors out of the six colors included on the six-sided dice.<br/><br/>On your turn as the active player, you roll the five dice, then re-roll as many dice as you wish up to two more times. After you stop, all players can then use the results of the die roll to mark off empty spaces on one of their two cards &mdash; but if you want to use a color rolled on the dice, then you must use all of that color. If the die roll shows three purple, for example, you must cross off exactly three purple spaces; if you can't cross off three, then you cross off zero!<br/><br/>The turn that you complete three or more rows on a card, you score that card, earning points equal to the collective length of the filled rows. You can also earn bonus points for completing one or both rows with sun symbols. You then take a new card from the deck.<br/><br/>The game ends the turn that a player completes their fourth card. Every player then scores for completed rows on their cards (but not sun symbols), then whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Another way to play All on 1 Card is to start by choosing three cards from the five you are dealt, shuffling the others back into the deck. When you complete a card, you choose one of three face-up cards as a replacement.<br/><br/>",

The track is constructed from three double-sided half-boards, which can be combined in a number of different ways for easier and harder tracks.

All money is collected in the holding company and every couple of turns a company round commences where the players have to decide how much money they will pay out to the shareholders and how much will be kept in the holding company for better trains, more stations, and track building.<br/><br/>In stock rounds players can invest in other players' companies or in the Stadtbahn, which can also be used by the various tramway lines to exercise special powers.<br/><br/>1840 uses the basic concept of all 18xx games, but offers quite a few innovations, like all-Diesel trains from the beginning on, that do not become obsolete, but have reduced income as they grow older.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Build the best dino zoo and impress your guests in a frantic, real-time puzzle game.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs are back and the world is clamoring to see them! In Mesozooic, it's your job as the director to plan and construct a zoo that will surpass any others. Fill your zoo with a variety of crowd-pleasing features: wow your visitors with towering dinosaur enclosures, entertain them with prehistoric attractions, and let them travel around the zoo in style on a network of monorails.<br/><br/>Over the course of three rounds, players draft the most desirable features into their hand, piece their zoo together in real-time, and score each layout to see who has created the best zoo.<br/><br/>After drafting your favorite features, you&rsquo;ll have to organize them in your zoo&mdash;but things won&rsquo;t always go as planned! Race against time by frantically sliding the cards one at a time to match up features and optimize your zoo&rsquo;s layout. Complete dinosaur enclosures, connect monorail tracks, and maintain your attractions to score points. The zoo with the best layout will score the most points!<br/><br/>When drafting cards, you can choose to customize your zoo however you like. Choose from attractions, monorails, dinosaur enclosures, or topiary.<br/><br/>Guests will be dazzled by the larger-than-life attractions at your zoo. Pterodactyls soar through the aviary, dinosaur eggs hatch in the nursery, and underwater creatures swim through the bright blue waters of the aquarium. Your zoo can include any or all of these attractions! To keep things running smoothly, attractions need to be regularly maintained. In order to score attractions in your zoo, you must keep a maintenance truck next to the attraction.<br/><br/>While visiting your zoo, guests will need to get around. Hopping on the monorail will quickly transport your guests to other corners of the park. In order to be effective, the monorail&rsquo;s route must be connected. If you can continue the track, each connection will score points for your zoo.<br/><br/>The highlight of the zoo is, of course, the dinosaurs themselves! Let guests come face to face with these creatures from another age. Create the perfect environment for gentle herbivores or powerful carnivores, each in their own enclosure. Each completed enclosure will score points.<br/><br/>Careful planning and quick thinking can give you the edge. Astonish guests with the amazing creatures from a land before time. Will guests flock to your dinosaur zoo?<br/><br/>-description by the publisher<br/><br/>",

He has decided to alter the lines of succession and will bequeath his entire kingdom either to the feline goddess Bast or to the canine god Anubis, but which one?<br/><br/>In Heir to the the Pharaoh you and your opponent play as Bast and Anubis, each one vying for the Pharaoh's affection &mdash; and for his throne! Impress the Pharaoh by digging your mighty paws into the sand. Build majestic Shrines, Sun Temples and Obelisks! Use Animal Magic to unleash the power of the gods, who will help you win the favor of the Pharaoh!<br/><br/>In more detail, the game combines intense card play with a spacious and colorfully illustrated game board. It mingles multiple mechanisms, including civilization-building (with tile placement and network building), bidding, set collection, area control, and hand management (with players required to exchange all used cards with their opponent at the end of each round). Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so. Once the Pyramid is completed, the player with the most points is declared the Heir to the Pharaoh and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Horse is a board game set in the Wild West with an average playing time of 30 to 90 minutes. The game puts one to four players in the role of a unique character in charge of a small territory in the old west. Some examples of the characters in the game are Banker, Cowboy, and Tracker. The characters have various abilities that give them advantages in the game as well as a starting bonus of some sort. Each player collects and uses various resources to build towns, cities, and rails to grow their territories. Players start the game with one city and two towns with the goal of growing out their territories to include additional towns, cities, and railroad connections throughout the areas that they control. The objective of the game is to collect the most victory points when the game ends. Players do this by expanding their territory, collecting gold, and obtaining Influence Points from certain actions on the game board. Players will need to watch each other&rsquo;s progress as the game can end in several different ways.<br/><br/>Summary of Play<br/>Each turn players roll two colored dice and place those dice on a specific action on the game board. The game has built in actions and tokens that allow players to manipulate their dice in certain ways. So players will have to decide whether to use these actions or limited tokens such as the Wild Die tokens to modify their dice. This allows players to use a majority of the dice rolls that come up each turn to further improve their position in the game.<br/><br/>The game promotes fast play as each player takes turns placing one or more dice on only one action per turn. Actions can include but are not limited to drawing cards, collecting resources, building additional towns and cities, and taking special actions such as the Sheriff, Mayor, Trader, or Tycoon. Some actions, such as Rail Baron, require a certain natural die roll while other actions require that your dice add up to a certain value. Players gain influence points during the game by taking specific actions which counts for a players overall victory points needed at the end of the game. Players will also need to focus on building their railroad connections as efficiently as they can to maximize their score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

You want treasure, of course, because what dragon doesn't like shiny bling? You need food as well, though, so pick up a few cattle or sheep along the way to keep your belly full. Grab some armor or shields as treasures from fallen soldiers who thought they could take you down, perhaps put your claws on one fancy ring, and beware cursed items that look nicee but bite your points in the end.<br/><br/>To play the game, you shuffle the deck of cards, then divide it into a few smaller decks. One player picks up the first deck, places the top card face up on the table, then passes the deck to the next player. Players keep laying out cards and passing the deck &mdash; with a number of face-up piles equal to the number of players &mdash; but players can also claim one of the piles by placing their dragon figure on it. Once all but one player have claimed a pile, the remaining player takes any cards remaining in the deck along with the final pile. You then grab the next deck and repeat this process until all the decks have been split among the player-dragons.<br/><br/>Players then compare their hauls, and whoever took the least food is eliminated from the game. (In a five- or six-player game, you separately determine who took the fewest sheep and who took the fewest cattle, with both of those players being eliminated.) The remaining dragons then tally the value of their loot to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Solar 175 is an epic, euro-style legacy experience for 1-4 players (5 in the Deluxe Edition) set in a dystopian, sci-fi future. The game utilizes bag-building, area control and worker placement. It is inspired as a fusion between classic euro games such as Orleans and El Grande and a unique thematic and evolving universe. Solar 175 is set in a prosperous expanding solar system with immersive worldbuilding and engaging narratives. The game is rich on theme and will feature interesting ethical and philosophical choices as well as engaging euro style gameplay.<br/><br/>Play occurs across three cyclical phases, the draw phase, the assign phase and the action phase. Players simultaneously draw workers from their unique embossed bag and assign these workers to jobs on their double layered player board. During the action phase players take turns to remove workers from these jobs to perform a large variety of actions to help propel them to victory.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most influence points at the end of the game, influence points can be gained via many different strategies, such as helping to build giant megastructures, influencing the upcoming election and building outposts across the solar system. Play continues until one player has built all of their 15 unique outposts tokens which triggers the election phase and end game scoring.<br/><br/>Solar 175 has an innovative end game scoring system which changes based on how the players interact with the game-world. <br/>This creates unique winning conditions in each game making each one feel fresh and distinctive.  The legacy campaign contains dozens of hours of content with engaging narrative and multiple endings. Once complete, the game is fully replayable and the game-world continues to expand and evolve endlessly.<br/><br/>",

It was a cult-game phenomenon in the Grateful Dead universe. The game flourished with the help of college students and Deadhead fans.<br/><br/>You play by rolling the five Cosmic Wimpout cubes and get points for each 5, 10, or Flash (triplet) that you roll. You can accumulate points towards the winning total by ending your turn or risking it all, because if you roll and don't score, you lose all the points for that turn, and the next player goes. Thus like life, &quot;Sometimes you are in the cosmos, and sometimes you wimp out.&quot; After certain results, a player may choose to end his turn, scoring the points he has accumulated. The first player to reach an agreed-upon score wins (300-600 for a short game with scores kept on paper, 1000-1500 more typically on the game boards), and the game can fit into a small dice tube.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, several variations of dice designs have made early versions of the game collectible. There are several silk-screened fabric boards that vary the game length and require the player to use a personalized or improvised pawn.<br/><br/>Numerous variants and house rules exist, and players are encouraged to change the rules (by unanimous agreement), even during the game.<br/><br/>",

Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.  Or he can assign a silver dwarf simply to sell gems for cash.  High score when all the contracts are gone wins, but usually someone wins before that happens by hitting 600 points.<br/><br/>",

In the middle of this organized chaos, rich and powerful merchants are gathering supplies and goods to sell them and increase their influence. You are one of them. With the help of the local people of Dunhuang, you&rsquo;ll try and become the most prestigious merchant of the city.<br/>But you&rsquo;re not alone in this business&hellip;<br/><br/>To begin the play, set up eight character tiles on the table, all of which have different skills. The character tiles are double-sided with different characters on each side, so 16 characters in total for the huge amount of combinations. Goods cards have a value from 1 to 10, with only one card with value 1 and ten cards with value 10. On your turn:<br/><br/><br/>    Move the &quot;camel&quot; on the current character tile to the next tile. If you want to move more, pay coins to move further.<br/>    Pick up the goods card on the tile to add it to your shop (in front of you) or your warehouse (your hand).<br/>    Use the character skill on the tile or collect three coins.<br/><br/><br/>Depending on the the number of goods in your shop, you can take the corresponding majority token. The game ends either:<br/><br/>(1) When no more cards are in the deck, at which point a majority token is worth 1 victory point, and the majority of each goods in their warehouse(hands) is worth points equal to the goods' value, or<br/>(2)  When any player has four different goods in hand and has collected four majority tokens, at which point they win the game immediately.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Deutschland&quot; contains historical events related to Germany, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Each squadron gets a hand of combat maneuver cards and players move one plane from each squadron engaging and evading each other. For each plane shot down you receive an ace token that entitles you to hold a larger hand of cards. Anti-Aircraft guns guard each home squadron and the lucky flyer has the opportunity to strafe the enemies planes on the ground. A great introductory wargame with easy to learn rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After tackling the Russian Front with the first game of the No Retreat! Series, wargamer and designer Carl Paradis revisits this fascinating campaign with: &quot;Absolute War! - The Russian Front 1941-45&quot;. This two-player wargame recreates the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus the Soviet Union in a fresh new way.<br/><br/>The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty and time of play. With a very low total counter count and density, this quick playing (while still realistic) simulation presents players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted and movement has been streamlined. Combat is handled by the two decks of cards (one German and one Soviet) - meaning no combat tables or dice to roll. These cards are the crux of the game system offering even more variety than regular Combat Result Tables. Like in &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; they are used to generate events and special game abilities (ex: Major Offensives, Partisan Raids, Siege Artillery, Increased Replacements, etc&hellip;) and now also effortlessly resolve all battle outcomes. The set-up for a campaign or a scenario will be lightning fast: in less than 10-15 minutes you can get the game going! This high degree of re-playability means that it will reward players' experience with increased skill.<br/><br/>&quot;Absolute War! The Russian Front 1941-45&quot; will put emphasis on strategic planning - not tedious hex maneuvering or factor-counting to attain the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; attack. Most of the time-consuming calculations will be taken care of effortlessly by the game engine, letting you concentrate instead on exercising your generalship skills against your opponent. Area-movement will provide the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. The grueling city sieges will be represented by allowing local battles to unfold, with sometimes both foes occupying and battling in the same critical map areas. With a simple &ndash; yet effective - economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Soviet Red Army and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht over the epic four years that this merciless campaign was fought on the soil of &ldquo;Mother Russia&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are simple and to the point: you have to capture as many of the ten map objectives to force a campaign decision. While destroying the foe&rsquo;s armies will also help in this endeavor, some event cards will also provide short-term goals to accomplish - gaining players&rsquo; special game advantages if met.<br/><br/>Neither side can afford to show mercy to their hated foe in this life-or-death conflict, you are in command in the largest and most grueling campaign the world has ever seen. War is hell, and this is Absolute War!<br/> Four Quick-Playing Scenarios plus a Campaign Game:<br/><br/><br/>     Barbarossa, 1941 : The initial assault on the Soviet Union. Can the Germans take Leningrad and Moscow before &ldquo;General Winter&rdquo; freezes the German war machine dead in its tracks?<br/>     Fall Blau &amp; Operation Saturn, 1942 : The Offensive towards the Caucasus Oil Fields, and the Nazis disastrous rendezvous with destiny at Stalingrad . Or&hellip;maybe the OKH will decided to strike north again at the Soviet Capital?<br/>     Operation Zitadelle, 1943: Hitler&rsquo;s last chance at getting a &ldquo;victory&rdquo; of sorts in the East after last winter disaster in the south. It&rsquo;s a do-or-die proposition for the Germans, as the Red Army can finally fight on equal terms. Will Kursk be the tombstone of the Panzers?<br/>     Operation Bagration, 1944:  The Soviet summer offensive that finally broke the back of the Wehrmacht, and made the Normandy landings look like a mere scuffle. Will you finally expel the hated foe enemies from their last foothold in Mother Russia?<br/><br/><br/>Absolute War Campaign game: From Operation Barbarossa in 1941 to the aftermath of Bagration in 1944. The whole conflict up to the gates of Germany is played out in dramatic fashion.<br/> Playing time:  Approximately 3 - 4 hours for a full campaign game, 1- 2 hours for the Shorter Scenarios.<br/> Scale: Each unit is one Army/Front: Each area is about 200 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents two months of real time.<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Lastly, recharge reloads spent cards.<br/><br/>As cards are played, they go to their owner's cool-down pile, where they remain until they're reloaded. As players take damage, the armor on their mech is destroyed. When enough armor is destroyed, an armor core becomes vulnerable and can be destroyed to stun that mech for the next turn. The game ends when a mech's armor is completely destroyed down to the last core.<br/><br/>",

When you move a piece, you move it a distance based on the strength indicated in the trough that you're leaving. Once the piece has made its way across the board, you move it back based on the strength on the other side. If you pass over an opposing piece while moving, then that opposing piece must return to its last departing base and your moving piece advances one cell further than where the opposing piece was.<br/><br/>Although it is easy to reach a situation where moving any piece implies putting it at risk &mdash; therefore making you not want to move &mdash; it is important to note that having some of your pieces taken and making your opponent advance is often beneficial to you, since it reduces the amount of possible moves your opponent can perform and gives you extra moves. So do not be afraid or reluctant to place some of your pieces in front of your opponent's, because it can be good for you.<br/><br/>Sit next to your rival and have fun!<br/><br/>",

Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.<br/><br/>Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts. The scheduled campaigns include:<br/><br/><br/>    The Invasion of Poland 1939<br/>    The Battle for France 1940<br/>    The Battle for North Africa 1941<br/>    The Invasion of Russia 1941<br/>    The Battle for North Africa 1942<br/>    The Fight for Italy 1943<br/>    The Fight for Russia 1943<br/>    The Days of D-Day 1944<br/>    The Final Days in Berlin 1945<br/><br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.<br/><br/>During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>",

You cannot block a Kumotori who is on any of the eight tiles surrounding the Stone of Balance.

Get the best equipment for this trip, recruit the most fearless crew and don't worry, even if you arrive too late to find the treasure you will always have the chance to steal it from others!<br/><br/>In every turn of The treasure of Isla Tortuga, the active player draws cards from the main deck trying to find the most useful card for his ship. Every card has a cost in one of the four possible resources, but also contributes with some to your resource pool. This way, the more cards you reveal, the more resources you get and the better cards you may acquire. But be careful, every card has a disaster flag associated. If you show three identical flags you've had it!<br/>Also, if you show an All aboard! card, you may instead try to board another player's ship to steal from them. This is why, before picking up big treasures, you may want to hire some tough crew to help you protect it...<br/><br/>There are four types of cards in The Treasure of Isla Tortuga:<br/><br/>     Decks to expand your ship, so you can fit more cards in it, or to add to your defence to repel boarding attempts.<br/>     Objects that give you extra resources or abilities.<br/>     Treasures, that give you victory points.<br/>     Crew, that either give you victory points or help you in boarding attempts. <br/><br/><br/>",

You can't just race as quickly as possible, though, because you must avoid setting off the trap.<br/><br/>To set up, choose one of the 20+ scenarios, then lay out the gear tiles in the specified path and place the appropriate sand timers &mdash; which have different amounts of sand in them &mdash; on the first gears of the path. (The path might have obstacles on it based on the particular scenario.) Gears feature both a color (orange, yellow, gray) and a shape (square, circle, crescent). Each player starts with a hand of three cards, with a card showing one of the three colors, one of the three shapes, or a sand timer.<br/><br/>Once the game starts, players play a card in turn to try to advance the sand timers and keep them from running out, refilling their hand after they play. When you play a color or shape card, you flip all of the sand timers currently on this color/shape, advancing them one space on the path if that next space is empty. When you play a sand timer card, you flip any one timer, advancing it, if possible. (If no timers are on gears matching the played card, nothing happens.)<br/><br/>If a sand timer runs out, flip it and place it next to the gear on which it was previously located. If someone plays a sand timer card, they can recover this timer by flipping and placing it back onto the gear &mdash; but only if that tile is empty. If a set-aside timer runs out again, players lose the game.<br/><br/>Once a timer reaches the last open space on the path, played cards matching that gear's color/shape will flip it &mdash; and if it runs out, you lose the game with no chance of recovery. If the sand timers fill the final gear tiles on the path without this happening, you win!<br/><br/>",

A player's turn includes the drawing and laying down of matching color segments, which continues until a head is attached or you run out of that color card. Whichever player ends up with an empty hand first wins the game.<br/><br/>There are special mechanics to propel a player forward, as well as cards intended to hinder the efforts of their opponents. These cards include: Cut, to sever a worm segment at play; Peek, to draw a card and replace it with another card from a hand; Hatch, to force an opponent to draw from the deck; Swap, to look at an opponent's hand and decide if cards should be traded; Dig, to draw a card from the deck and discard one from a hand.<br/><br/>An astoundingly easy-to-learn game of card management for the whole family that is sure to leave you holding your sides... with laughter!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A4 Quest is an adventure game in which you will face countless monsters while going through consecutive locations. Your goal will be to complete specific tasks or just to stay alive! As its name implies, each quest will fit on one A4 sheet, which can be printed so that you can enjoy the game right away! All you need is to pick your hero, arrange a few d6 dice and you are ready to go! The whole thing does not require cutting, you can play directly on the printed sheet, although feel free to split it so that it can fit in your pocket.<br/><br/>Mobility, the possibility to mix the sets, adventures, rooms, and game time under 10 minutes are the main assets of A4 Quest. You have a break at work? You&rsquo;re riding on a train? All you need is a bit of space and you can start your adventure and put your opponents to the sword! The whole game has a humorous graphic design and its style resembles a two-dimension platform games known from computers or mobile games.<br/><br/>Manage your dice by assigning them to right adventures. Choose from available actions on the field. But remember, you need to plan a few steps ahead! Arrange food so that you can rest, because if you don&rsquo;t your hero will bite the dust sooner than you think! Also, remember about your hero&rsquo;s special skills because they might save you more than once!<br/><br/>",

Combat losses and heavy straggling have thinned the Army of Northern Virginia to the point where only the best remain in the ranks. The Army of the Potomac is at hand with twice as many troops. While the safest course would be withdraw into Virginia, rest the army and seek battle on another day, Robert E. Lee decides to stand and fight at Sharpsburg.<br/><br/>On the Union side, George B. McClellan is no longer as confident of victory as he was a few days ago, when the discovery of Lee's marching orders gave Little Mac all the information he needed to defeat the enemy in detail. Now the Army of Northern Virginia is concentrated. While McClellan is sure he faces an enemy that vastly outnumbers him, he must fight and win here to preserve the Union.<br/><br/>This is the second edition of In their Quiet fields, the very first Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series game. With its intense drama and hard-hitting action, it has long been a favorite of CWB aficionados. Both players face tough decisions: the Confederate player is stretched to the limit by an opposing army twice the size of his own. And while the Union player has tremendous numbers under his control, getting his sluggish commanders into motion poses a challenge.

In Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game, you'll play as one of Gotham City's greatest villains &ndash; The Joker, The Penguin, Killer Croc, or Two-Face &mdash; and lead your gang of henchmen to try to become the King of Crime in Gotham City! But beware, as your hold on the city increases, so does the chance of your plans being foiled by Gotham's protector &ndash; Batman!<br/><br/>During the game, players collect resources of information, money and threat; threat is used to exert your rule over blocks in Gotham City, and control of blocks allows you to collect income on these blocks of either information or money. Money is used for leveling and to hire henchmen who will help you rule city blocks and fight better against other villains and Batman. Information is used for leveling and moving your villain and henchmen through the city blocks. Leveling works as follows: Each villain has a combat dial with ten levels. Each click of the dial shows a requirement that you will need to advance to the next level: information, money, henchmen, or blocks controlled. The first player to reach level 10 with his villain wins. On every even number level, players will acquire special abilities unique to their villain.<br/><br/>Each turn a player will play a Criminal Plot card which will either produce an income for the ruler of a certain block or trigger the Bat Signal, which calls in Batman! When Batman moves into a block with a Villain, a fight occurs using the two custom Batman dice included with the game. If Batman wins, the villain and his henchmen must flee to their hideout and Batman restores order in that block of Gotham City; if the villain wins, they have defeated Batman (for the time being) and Batman returns to the Batcave, increasing his combat effectiveness as he plans for the next encounter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trans Europa &amp; Trans Amerika includes two simple railway games in the same box that use the same rules, but are played on different maps, which provide different playing experiences.<br/><br/>In each game, you start each round of play with a secret set of five cities strung across either Europe or the U.S. (depending on the side of the game board you're using) that need to be connected by rail. On your first turn, you place your starting station somewhere on the game board. On each subsequent turn, you place either one or two rails that connect two points on the board; you can place only one rail if you're crossing a river or a mountain ridge with that rail. All of the rails that you place must touch your starting station or connect with other rails in a network that touches your starting station. Thus, each player builds their own network initially, but as soon as those networks connect, you can place rails anywhere off that connected network<br/><br/>As soon as a player connects all five of their cities in a network, which could happen on another player's turn, the round ends. Whoever has connected all of their cities scores 4 points; each other player scores 0-3 points depending on how many rails they would need to place to connect all of their cities. You then clear the board, shuffle the cards, and play another round. The first player to score 13 or more points wins! The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.<br/><br/>Trans Europa &amp; Trans Amerika includes 19 special cards that can be used to provide more variety in gameplay. At the start of a round, reveal one of the cards; the effect of this card applies to all players during this round, perhaps with everyone discarding their rose card and needing to connect only four cities, or having a mountain pass count as only one rail played, or placing three rails on a turn, or revealing two of their cards so that everyone can see where others are going in particular parts of the map.<br/><br/>",

This is not an easy task!<br/><br/>Each round is one day on the island, during which you must gather resources and spend them to craft items with various abilities in order to attack your opponents and ensure your survival.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "YEAR 30175: For thousands of years, the destruction of natural ecosystems and pollution have turned the planet into a desolate and practically uninhabitable place.  While the less fortunate species have become extinct, others have adapted and evolved in union with the Orchard, the last green lung, our home.  The RabbitZ!, a fearful horde of mutant zombie rabbits, come out of their burrow with only one goal... EAT! The Orchard and the vegetable people are in danger... But this time we are ready!<br/><br/>Using the technology of the Ancients, we have created great machines that are powered by the energy of the Orchard. Piloted by the brave Guardians of the Orchard, these powerful robots are our last hope.<br/><br/>Rabbitz &amp; Robots is a tower defense card game for 1 to 5 players in which players will become the Guardians of the Orchard, a group of brave vegetables who pilot combat robots and defend the Orchard from the invasion of the RabbitZ.<br/><br/>Starting with the player who has the highest value RabbitZ in their path, the game will be played in turns and clockwise. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into two phases:<br/><br/>In phase 1: Take the top card of the Burrow deck and place it at the start of your path (next to the Burrow deck) with the RabbitZ side up. If there are already other RabbitZ on your path, they will move in the direction of your Robot to make room for the new RabbitZ. The paths have a maximum of three spaces, this means that if there are already three RabbitZ in a path and a fourth one enters, it will push the others and the closest RabbitZ to the Robot will sneak into the player&rsquo;s Garden, counting as a negative score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In phase 2: Choose an action between: Super Attack, Charge Robot, Use weapons or Pass turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Burrow deck ends and there are no RabbitZs left in front of the players.<br/><br/>The player with the fewest negative points (RabbitZ value) in his Orchard wins.<br/><br/><br/>A&Ntilde;O 30175<br/>Desde hace miles de a&ntilde;os, la destrucci&oacute;n de ecosistemas naturales y la contaminaci&oacute;n han convertido el planeta en un lugar desolado y pr&aacute;cticamente inhabitable.<br/><br/>Mientras que las especies menos afortunadas se han extinguido, otras nos adaptamos y evolucionamos en uni&oacute;n con la Huerta, el &uacute;ltimo pulm&oacute;n verde, nuestro hogar.<br/><br/>Aqu&iacute;, hortalizas de todos los colores convivimos y trabajamos unidas para proteger la tierra que nos da la vida.

They say girlie movies like you've been making lately are going out of fashion, that the modern public has a yearning for plot-less action titles.  Maybe it is time to invite that rotten art critic over for drinks, and convince her of the value of your masterpieces... or tune into the old boys network and really get the show on the road.<br/><br/>In Cannes - Stars, Scripts &amp; Screens, each player takes the role of a small-time movie producer, trying to produce as many movies as possible.

You need to bring them back before they get into trouble &ndash; and you want to do so faster than your opponents so that you can save more than they can!<br/><br/>In the fast-catching game Fun Farm, players compete to spot and catch the animal shown on the cards before all their opponents. Each round, the active player reveals the top card from the deck, placing it next to any others still on the table. Each card depicts an animal, a black die (showing one color on this die), and a white die (showing one color on this die). The player then rolls the black die and the white die. If a die depicted on a card matches the color rolled on that die, players race to grab the animal toy from the table that matches the animal depicted on the card. Whoever does so first claims the card, and once the deck runs out, whoever has the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile the archangels, God&acute;s chosen messengers, move like lightning over the battlefield, commanding their forces, and bringing fear to the hosts of evil.

You can use your resources to deploy more units, increase your handsize, or gain more Command markers! At the end of your turn, you&rsquo;ll gain more resources if you control certain Areas - or even 1 Soul Point if you control the Human Soul.

But be careful, if you get three Charon cards, you lose the round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Players start each round with 5 cards in their hands.<br/>The game takes place in a undetermined number of rounds, until one of the three game-end conditions is met.<br/>The player who has the first player pawn chooses a card in her hand of cards and offers it by putting it face down in front of another player of her choice.<br/>If the card offered is a Creature card, she must say out loud the number of the card without lying.<br/>If the card offered is a Charon card, she can (and should) lie by saying out loud any number she wishes.<br/>The player who gets the card has 3 choices:<br/>- He accepts the card before looking at it, and then places it face up in front of him.<br/>- He refuses the card without looking at it. It returns to the player who offered it, and she places it face up in front of herself.<br/>- He adds a card from his hand, face down, and offers the two cards to another player. He is only allowed to lie about the Charon cards by announcing the number he chooses.<br/>In this third case, the player who receives the two cards has the same choices. <br/>Cards cannot be offered to a player who has already been offered cards in this round, nor to the player with the First player pawn. The last player must either accept or refuse the cards offered.<br/>Then a new round starts, the first player pawn moves to the left and players draw cards from the deck to refill their hands to 5 cards.<br/>Having a 1 card, a 2 card and a 3 card in front of you gives you 10 bonus points (=16 points).<br/>Players who have three Charon cards in front of them are sent to Hell and are eliminated from the game.<br/>The player whose Creature cards reaches or exceeds the number of points required, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(While this game is sometimes called by the same name, it is not to be confused with Chinese Poker.)<br/><br/>There is a family of card games known as climbing games.  There are climbing games with many variants throughout the world and known by many names(Choh Dai Di, Chinese Poker, Kings and Asses, Scum, President, Dilbert's Corporate Shuffle, etc.).  Big Two is one popular variant.  Each player starts with a hand of cards and the object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by playing combinations.  The game consists of playing combinations of cards: single cards, pairs, three of a kind, and traditional poker hands (straights, flushes, etc.).  When a player plays a combination, only a combination of that type can beat it - you must play a pair to beat a pair for instance.  Big Two has a sizable luck element but there is room for skillful play as the players learn how to best manage the cards they are dealt. Best with four players, but still fun with two and three.<br/><br/>",

Units represent companies, battalions and regiments supported by a wide range of helicopters and attack aircraft.<br/><br/>Instead of granting NATO units combat strengths far higher than the Soviet strengths to compensate for inferior numbers, the game emphasizes the doctrinal and command differences between the opposing armies that provide NATO with the force multiplier it needs to survive. Players operate asymmetric command systems, and each is challenged to get the most out of his system. The game system also creates a true &quot;fog of war&quot; environment in which deception, outguessing your opponent and tactical surprise can pay off handsomely.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>1 hex = 1 mile<br/>1 turn = 2 hours (day), 6 hours (night)<br/>Each unit step = 1 company or Warsaw Pact artillery battalion, 3-4 aircraft<br/><br/>Turn Sequence:<br/>1.

To defeat your enemy, you must maneuver yourself to get behind them and shoot at exactly the right moment!<br/><br/>Dogfight! is played over a maximum of three rounds or until one of the Biplanes has been shot down. If a Biplane is shot down, the game ends immediately and the surviving player is declared the winner! If the third round ends and neither Biplane has been shot down, the player who has taken fewer hits is the winner.<br/><br/>Both players choose a tile to play from behind their player screens and simultaneously reveal them. Each player then moves their Biplane the number of spaces equal to the value of the tile played, which may also have &quot;hit&quot; icons. The game features nine Biplanes, and they have different tile distributions. Several scenarios are also included.<br/><br/>The Biplanes must follow the direction of the arrows around the white path (except when Looping the Loop). Each circle counts as one space and the colors on some spaces affect shooting. Biplanes may move past one another and even finish in the same space, but be careful -- one wrong move and your enemy will loop behind you and blast away!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
