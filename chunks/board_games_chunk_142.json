        "description": "5 Different Treasure Hunt Games<br/><br/>Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!<br/><br/>disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:  You are risk-seeking archaeologists on a expedition for exotic treasure.  Danger surrounds you and your archrival is out to beat you to the fortune.  The player who collects the most treasure by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:  Take turns trying to locate a treasure by drawing straight lines between any 2 dots on the map.  Lines can be drawn vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.  When you draw a line that connects all four sides of a square, the find at that location is yours.  Immediately scratch off that spot to reveal a prize (or perhaps trouble).  If you locate treasure, circle the matching item on your stone scoring tablet to keep a record of your newly found wealth.  There are four different kinds of treasure:<br/><br/>GOLD COINS - Worth 1 point each<br/>BLACK PEARLS - Worth 5 points each<br/>CUT RUBIES - Worth 10 points each<br/>SOLID GOLD ICON - Worth 25 points<br/><br/>After finding a reassure, you must immediately continue your turn by drawing another line; even if you don't want to.  Archaeology is a dangerous business and sometimes you get more that you bargained for.  Head hunters are about and thief is lurking somewhere in the area.  If you happen to find either, you're in trouble.<br/><br/>HEAD HUNTER - A threatening little person who stops you in your tracks.  You lose your turn immediately (but you're too clever to lose you head).  Nevertheless, your opponent takes a turn while you figure your way out of this predicament.<br/> THIEF- An encounter with the thief is a costly mistake.  He is well trained at slipping through your fingers and takes with him one piece of the most valuable treasure you have discovered so far.  If you have any treasure, mark one piece of the best off your stone tablet.  It's gone for good.<br/><br/>Super Secret Rule of Archaeological Exploration:  Treasure is found in groups.  Find something valuable and the rest of the same treasure is sure to be connected!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OBJECTIVE:  Your are the groundskeeper of an exclusive golf course that has been invaded by six pesky moles (each a different color).  See and destroy the rascals!  The player with the most points after all six moles have been caught wins.<br/><br/>PREPARATION - Write the player's initials in the coring area.  Players then scratch the squares on the bottom of the card to determine who goes first.  The player finding the number &quot;1&quot; starts the game by digging the first hole (scratching a circle). The moles you seek are pink, blue, black, yellow, green and purple.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY - To find moles, you &quot;dig&quot; holes on the golf course by scratching any circle.  You can find all sorts of stuff in a hole - information on where the moles are hiding, bonus points, or nasty traps the moles have set for you!  After each hole is dug, the turn passes to the next player on the left (unless otherwise stated).  Use hashmarks in the scoring area to keep score.  Here is what you might dig up:<br/><br/>MOLE - 5 points<br/>GOLF BALL - 1 point<br/>POISON GOLF BALL - Minus 1 point<br/>SNAKE (Hiss!) - Lose your next turn<br/>MOLE POOP - Lose your next turn<br/>EMPTY HOLE - Nothing, zip, zero.<br/><br/>Digging up the following items will give you important information:<br/><br/>FLASHLIGHTS - Shine light on moles of the same color.  The mole will be somewhere within the &quot;total area of circles&quot; defined by the direction of the &quot;beam of light&quot;.  This helpful light also allows you to continue your turn.<br/><br/>MOLE HOLES - The mole of this color is somewhere in line with this symbol.<br/><br/>MOLE METER - A number 2, 3 or 4.  There is a mole (of this color) that number of circles away.<br/><br/>DYNAMITE - It blows up!  You must scratch off all the neighboring circles that surround the explosive and score them as normal.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Departure on the Nile puts 2 to 4 players in the 1830s to 1880s in Egypt. During this period, Egypt under its rulers and the increased influence of Europeans experienced a tremendous upswing. The first railway lines were built, cotton was grown and exported, the Suez Canal was opened, as well as schools and hospitals built on the European model. Not least, the country also opened up for the emerging mass tourism, which brought a large number of people in the land of the pharaohs and pyramids. The players in Departure on the Nile embody young investors from Europe who want to contribute to the expansion of the country and invest in the Egyptian economy, solely with the aim of achieving the greatest fortune. Departure on the Nile is a classic worker placement game in which each player starts the game with only three of their own colonial officials. The construction of buildings, however, bring specialists into the country, who can recruit players using a novel mechanism (felucca travel and rail travel) and from now on can use. The game comes with a high level of interaction so it does not have the character of a multiplayer solitaire game. All players are involved at all times, whether through the use of the buildings (owners receive a bonus), by rail travel or the use of the Suez Canal where players can receive money and influence through their share certificates. Since the game is all about earning the most money at the end of the game, every investment in the game should be well considered. The game material is relatively extensive, the random game structure (bonus tiles, majority tiles, building tiles, personalities) guarantees a long game stimulus that prevents deadlocked strategies.<br/><br/>",

But be careful as enemy frogs can TAG each other by landing on their space. The TAGGED frog is sent back to their start PUDDLE. You can also leap over enemy frogs. You cannot tag your own frogs or leap over them, so you have to manage your frogs carefully so that they don&rsquo;t get bunched up. Moves must always be exactly the number of spaces indicated by the roll of the die. A roll of 1 or 6 always gives you another turn no matter how many times it occurs. If you have only one possible move, you must take it. If you have no legal moves, you pass your turn.<br/><br/>Once a player Fills up their BIG POOL by moving all of their frogs into it, they win!<br/><br/>The game can also be played in teams of 2 vs 2. When one player&rsquo;s frogs are all safe they may move their teammates. TEAMMATES FROGS MAY TAG EACH OTHER! So take care that it is not the only option.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The famous trivia game. The questions are about the French region of Poitou Charentes.<br/><br/>There are 3000 questions in 6 different themes; History, Geography, Science and Nature, Art and Literature, Entertainment and Sports and Leisure.<br/>Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.<br/><br/>Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Successfully deliver on your contracts to gain credit and renown; fail, and you&rsquo;ll find The Man&rsquo;s confidence in your capabilities will dip. Work to upgrade your menial starting ship and crew to better push your luck within the Galactic Underground Trading Route (GUTR) and become the richest, most famous freebooter of all!<br/><br/>Space Buccaneers is game about taking on jobs and attempting to deliver their cargo to the furthest location possible along the GUTR. The trading route is comprised of a series of planetary systems willing to do business with the Den. The further along the route that you deliver, the more credit and renown you will gain. Along the course, you&rsquo;ll be attempting to resolve events by rolling dice provided by your ship and crew. These are resolved by matching the symbols on the event cards with the symbols on the dice. As you roll misses and are forced to set dice aside, you&rsquo;ll have to decide if you risk pushing on to profit from greater gains or not. If you roll too many misses, your delivery attempt will be cut short and your reputation will suffer. Events get harder as you press along the GUTR; the better your ship and crew the better your odds. The game ends when one of the players reaches the renown threshold. After which, players will have a chance to complete their turns, and the player with the highest amount of renown will be declared the victor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disney Rocket game is a 1960's Japanese variation of Pachisi. The game board features 4 Walt Disney characters which players start by placing their tokens on. Players then move around the board by the roll of a dice in a clockwise direction and up a straight to reach their goal line.<br/><br/>Variations to the traditional Parchisi are an added shortcut using a colored rocket and advantages of landing on a particular colored square.<br/><br/>The game box shows Disney characters on a TWA rocket. Erik Voskull, in his book 'Before Mario',(2014) explains that Nintendo obtained a licence in 1959 to produce games featuring Walt Disney characters and themes.<br/><br/>Also in the first half of the 1960s Nintendo introduced a cursive style logo as seen on the back of the playing board. This logo was used on Nintendo's earliest boardgames.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new neighborhood has been built and the people who live there don't know each other. A neon party is organized to get to know each other. You also live in this neighborhood. If you decorate your house with as many lights as possible, you will make a good impression. Do you know after the neon party who lives on who on which house number lives? Then you have a big chance of winning the neon party game!<br/><br/>The player tries to get many points as possible on his house number. The players don't know each other's house number. There are 2 sets of house numbers cards 1-5. One of them are placed in the middle of the table. Each player receives a secret housenumber from the other set of 1-5.<br/><br/>The rest of the cards consist cards with numbers -5 (defect neon lights) to 5(working neon lights) and a few special cards. These cards form the draw pile. If it is a players turn, he will take a card from the draw pile. He can place this card on both sides of a house number. Then it's the next players turn and he does the same. If there is a total of 5 cards on both sides of a house number, there is a scoring. <br/>First, it is determined which side of this house number has the most cards. The side with the most cards will be placed on table below the house number card. For the order house numbers, the same side will be placed below the house number card. The entire other side of the house numbers with cards will be placed on the discard pile. After this, there are no more neon light cards on table (except below the house numbers and the discard pile). Then the game continues. If there are 5 cards placed at a house number another scoring takes place. The game ends when the draw pile is used up.<br/><br/>There are 2 special cards with which you can remove cards and do 2 turns in a row.<br/><br/>The players then guess from each other which house number they have. Each correctly guessed house number earns 5 points. If someone is well guessed by all persons, he is out of the game and therefore does not participate in the final scoring.<br/><br/>Everyone counts the points on the cards under their house number. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blackpool is a strategy and racing board game designed for both, entertainment and intellectual stimulation. A fun game for parties, family gatherings, or just a casual evening with friends, Blackpool is designed to engage kids and grown ups alike.<br/><br/>Along with luck, you will need to use sound strategies to win this game. To win, you have to be the first player to get all of your travellers (the tokens are called travellers in Blackpool) out of the mystic whirlpool and land them safely back to your camp. You can use curse cards to stop others, charm cards to move ahead, and take advantage of anyone who is ahead of you by using the special piggybacking technique. You can jump on someone who is ahead of you to slow them down, or move ahead with them. Smart use of piggybacking can become the difference between winning and losing the game.<br/><br/>The race starts from the middle of the board, and the players have to move outwards. Each player has three &lsquo;travellers&rsquo; whom they have to save from the whirlpool. In order to do so, the travellers have to get to their camps, which are at the corners of the board. The travellers have to go through several rings to get to the camp. Like a real whirlpool, in Blackpool, it gets easier to move as you get further away from the center. The players movement depends on the dice roll and on the ring they are at. The first player to get all their travellers to their camp wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

New material was incompatible with the original game.<br/><br/>Description of All-Star Baseball:<br/><br/>signed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time. The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabiltyi of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball. Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately. The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number. The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense. Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details. Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard. Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Everyone's a suspect when murder is on the menu. And with a Classic Detective Murder Mystery you have everything you need to serve up the perfect murder dinner party. First the invites, you choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Then the shopping list, menu suggestions and recipes. Plus of course...a really tasty murder to solve. It will be drop dead fun, and by the end of the evening, one (or more) of the suspects, your 'friends', will be caught out as the murderer!<br/><br/>It's 1919 and the world is still reeling from the shock of the Russian Revolution. For those inside the country, the political upheavals are matched by personal tragedies, and nowhere are this truer than within the Russian royal family. The Tsar, his wife and children have all been killed, and the surviving royals are anxious to escape the same fate. Which is why they are now sailing into exile on board the British warship the HMS Winston.<br/><br/>But even here, it seems, no one is safe. On the second night of their voyage a stowaway is discovered on board. He's found face-down in one of the lifeboats, and he has a jewel-encrusted dagger stuck in is back. Who is this mystery man? Who killed him? And what does any of this have to do with the assassination three years earlier of the mad mystic, Rasputin?<br/><br/>The suspects are:<br/><br/>     Dowager Empress Marie &ndash; The mother of the murdered Tsar and the great matriarch of European royalty, she is reluctant to leave Mother Russia for the first, and maybe the last, time.<br/>     Prince Felix Youssoupov &ndash; The playboy prince whose behaviour scandalised St Petersburg and is most famous for being the man who killed Rasputin.<br/>     Princess Ivana Legova &ndash; A niece of the Tsar, she is reputed to be the richest woman in Europe, particularly since the death of her financier husband.<br/>     Grand Duke Boris Borisovich &ndash; One of the great landowners of Russia, though the source of his wealth is still something of a mystery.<br/>     Captain Pretty &ndash; The naval officer in command of HMS Winston is very young for such a position, but he has a distinguished war record and is expected to rise high in the service.<br/>     Martha Harry &ndash; An American journalist who has been covering the Revolution for the Washington Fox and now seems in something of a hurry to leave the country.<br/>     Charles Bronstein &ndash; With mixed American and Russian parentage, he has been brought along to act as translator between the royals and the naval officers.<br/>     Jane bond &ndash; An Englishwoman who was employed as a nanny for the Tsar&rsquo;s daughters and is now accepted as almost part of the family.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

On your turn, roll a colored die that allows you to flip, rotate or switch one or more tiles. (The color &bdquo;red&ldquo; on the die allows  to go directly to an adjacent tile ignoring the path system.) Then move your pawn along the paths to reach a destination. Each player has one secret destination card and tries to accomplish it. After you reached your destination, try to accomplish the task or answer the question. The other players may help you. If you succeed, read the written text (articles of the convention of children&rsquo;s rights) on the back of the tile aloud and keep the card. When all destinations are reached, the player with the most accomplished cards wins.<br/><br/>Developed by Matthias Gradinger<br/>Produced by Ravensburger Freizeit- und Promotion-Service GmbH.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this fast paced game, you and your opponent are cliche movie heroes or villains, challenging each other while recreating classic movie scenes. You should expect a lighthearted game, where your super villain character may tell his evil plan to the other contestant, who is apparently a 120 year old kung-fu master ... on the top of a moving train.<br/><br/>The game requires two standard 52 decks and a pair of six sided dice for 2 players. Things that you already have probably. You can print one page to browse your character of choice, but let&rsquo;s be honest: most of you will use your smartphones to check your character sheet.<br/><br/>There is not always a winner and a loser of a fight, if you can&rsquo;t put on a good show together, the audience will be displeased, and the director will &quot;remove&quot; the characters from the tournament. If the show was above expectations, the director may have mercy even on the defeated one too, meaning, the character progress won&rsquo;t be lost. Different characters use different subset of cards, and also alter the standard rules, giving more variety to the game, and offering more fun. Also, the fight can be spiced up with several scenarios listed in this booklet. Different environments may alter the rules, and may change the way how the contestants fight.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The excitement begins when you have to work at speed and against other players, which is sure to get the whole family shouting 'Hooa Ha! Hoo Ha!'

You must also full-body-print more colonists from personas downloaded through your ansibles - a weird kind of immigration.<br/><br/>Build, conquer or destroy - your fame or infamy will attract more immigrants.

By placing cards in front of you, you form cities which consist of temples, houses, and fountains.<br/><br/>In this game, there are 72 cards, each of which has six terrain squares. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 15 terrain cards. They then shuffle their cards to form their deck.<br/><br/>Each round, they simultaneously draw two cards from their deck. They then choose one and place it in front of themselves, and place the other on top of another player's deck face-up. This process is done in real time.<br/><br/>When you place your card in front of you, you must partially overlap it on an existing card. Both of overlapped squares must have the same terrain.<br/><br/>If at least one temple, houses, and fountain are surrounded by the forest, they form a city, earning you victory points at end of game depending on the size of the city. Fountains score 3pts each. Temples and houses score more points the more they appear in the city. For each macaw you can see in your forest, you score 1pt at the end of the game.<br/><br/>As the game nears the end, you might place a card with no chance to score. In that case, you don't place it but turn it over instead for 2 pts. However, cards that have been placed cannot be moved or retrieved to score.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game. The game can be played solitaire.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>マヤ文明＋パズル。マヤの王となって都市を作ろう。都市は神殿・家・泉の3つをセットで森で囲わないといけません。しかも1つ以上の地形を同じにして重ねなければなりません。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

As the most litigious person in the most litigious city in the most litigious state in the country, he has to keep his dirty dealings under wraps.  The mayor needs distractions and has told the top eight attorneys in his beautiful city to take any case they can get so that he can get the heat off of him.<br/><br/>WE cards provide or block evidence to back up or refute an accusation. For example, a &ldquo;Security Video Footage&rdquo; may be used to add a Point to the accuser&rsquo;s case, but the defender may cancel that card out with a &ldquo;Blurry Video&rdquo; WE card. To win a case, the accuser must beat the defense by three points.<br/><br/>With hints from the Crime and Clue cards, players now have the option to Accuse each other of a crime listed in the Suemlots Gazette. Players then try to build a case and take it to court. In court, the prosecution (accuser) always goes first. Randomly turn over a Judge card. Apply Attorney and Judge bonuses or negatives to the case. Explain your case by laying down applicable WE cards and attempt to sway the judge and jury with your witnesses and evidence.<br/><br/>After the prosecution has laid their case before the judge, the defense now brings their evidence and witnesses to bear. All cards to be played by the defense now come into play and a preponderance of evidence/witnesses will win the day. To use the sample from above, a &ldquo;Security Video Footage&rdquo; may be used to add a point to the accuser&rsquo;s case, but the defender may cancel that card out with a &ldquo;Blurry Video&rdquo; WE card.<br/><br/>The Accuser wins the case when they have three or more uncontested pieces of evidence/witnesses that the defense is unable to deflect, block, or have thrown out of court.  The Defense wins in any condition where the prosecution team has less than three pieces of evidence that are uncontested. The game ends when an accuser wins their case in court.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each pair has its own point value based on how common the parrot species is.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play Parrot Pair-it:<br/><br/>Dexterity<br/><br/>For those who want a dexterity-based game, five random cards would be spread on the table, face up. Each player draws seven cards from the rest of the deck. The player whose turn it is looks for a pair. If there is on in their hand, easy points, lay them down in front of you. If they have a card in their hand that matches a card the table, they must let the parrot fly down to its mate. Hold the card at least a foot above the table, flip it up and try to get it to land, face up, touching its match. If it does, pick up it and add it to your collected pairs. If not, place it in the discard pile, draw a card, and hope you&rsquo;ll do better the next try.<br/><br/>Simply Picking Pairs<br/><br/>Another way to play Parrot Pair-it is the Old Maid method, where players hold a hand of seven cards and either ask if an opponent has a card needed to make a pair, or they may physically remove a card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Lay any pairs down to be counted later.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Cards have a number scale across the bottom that rises from left to right. Some parrots species will only have one pair, while others may have up to five. If a player, for example, has one pair of macaws, which is a five-pair set, it may be worth only five points. But if the player has four of the five macaw pairs, they would have 25 points, and if they have all five, fifty points. Winning the game is when one person reaches a predetermined score, or when all the parrots have been paired with the person with the highest score winning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You must gather your most fierce forces to make the journey because your enemies have the same destiny.<br/><br/>Divinities Boon: Primordium, pits fantasy races against each other in a battle to a magical relic. Champions command forces as they move forward on the player&rsquo;s game board. Attack your opponent&rsquo;s forces with melee, ranged or siege assaults to move your champion forward, or your enemy backward. Once your champion reaches the Boon, they must fight to retain control of it for three rounds. But victory is fleeting, for the other gods have the power to remove the boon and give their favored champion another chance for greatness.<br/><br/>Players take turns by playing one or two minions, whose MELEE, RANGED, and SIEGE stats combine. If they beat the opposing player&rsquo;s minions in any of the three attacks, that champion is moved forward a number based on the cards played (attack and ranged), or the opposing champion is moved backward (siege). Champions add powerful bonuses to the minion's attacks and defenses. Boon cards may also be played to give an added edge.<br/><br/>Once the champion reaches the final destination, they must maintain control of the relic for three, non-consecutive rounds.

In Animal Relay players manage an allocation of Animals to contest a relay race by choosing their optimal team.<br/><br/>Players are assigned six animals from a pack of 48 unique options from which they must choose and programme* their preferred team. Animal&rsquo;s combined speed will be central to a winning strategy, however, other characteristics such as height, width and natural predatory instincts, may influence progress in neighbouring lanes. Each player will have information regarding their own team, with other teams revealed as the game progresses. Players strategies should allow for possible opportunities and interruptions from neighbouring lanes.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for 1-6 players. More players can compete with the additions of more packs. When playing with less than six players, one or more players may contest with more than one team or the random allocation of cards permits unallocated (but sub-optimal) teams to challenge for the win. <br/>The game is a perfect ice-breaking social game because of its easy to explain rules, intuitive setting, fast pace and flexible player count. It is also a great filler game to pass 15-20 minutes while waiting for players to assemble for a longer game. Its quick and changeable gameplay however, often lead to contests of best of three, best of five&hellip;etc<br/><br/>The game contains: <br/> 48 No. Unique Animal Cards;<br/> 4 No. Progress Track Cards;<br/> 6 No. Individually Coloured Dice;<br/> 6 No. Individually Colour Player Markers.<br/><br/>The game is not intended as an educational game, however additional scientific information is presented for each animal.<br/><br/>Please don&rsquo;t take offence at these animals sticking there tongues out at you; each was requested to prove they had no illegal devices to aid in the carrying of a baton!<br/><br/><br/>     To programme is a modern gaming term for simply organising options in advance where all players choices are then played out without alteration in sequence.

Players will be able to choose to start the campaign from the Russian advance into Wallachia (modern day Romania) or at the start of the Crimean campaign. This is the first time the campaign outside the Crimea itself has been depicted in any simulation. Units will be regiment sized, with the ability for some limited tactical choices such as charging. Siege Artillery will play an important role being necessary to destroy fortresses before an assault. In addition to the operational battles,  A linked campaign will be included so players can carry their losses across multiple scenarios and compare their performance to their historical counterparts. The allies have multiple options when it comes to landing and conducting amphibious operations. Forces from the allied navies along with the black sea fleet are present as well.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trierarchs is a modern take on ancient Tactical Naval Warfare during the 5th century with a special focus on and surrounding the Peloponnese War. The naval conflicts of the ancient world were strategically and logistically vital to any nation&rsquo;s ambitions of expansions and colonization. Thucydides himself was exiled as a result of his failure to prevent a Spartan landing at Amphipolis and the subsequent death of Athenian general and politician Cleon at that battle.<br/><br/>The period is notable for the relative ferocity and unique nature of naval conflict. The primary tactic being to ram your opponents ship via it&rsquo;s broadside as quickly as your oarsman could row. Triremes were packed sparingly along with several hoplite marines and archers who could either attack or board enemy ships if close enough. Athens was primarily the dominant naval power until the end of the war and even had an original tactics where they could maneuver a ship parallel to an opponent going in the opposite direction, pull in their oars, and shear off the oars of their enemies leaving them dead in the water. The quality of a crew would frequently make up for inferior numbers in combat making for interesting and thrilling scenarios, of which Trierarchs is packed.<br/><br/>A basic and advanced version of the rules will be included where players may easily pick and choose what rules they wish to include. The advanced rule increase the playing time and relative complexity of the rules in order to more accurately reflect the nature of ancient naval warfare. Optional rules are included for simultaneous movement, double-blind refereed games, as well as limited combined-operations with land forces.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Violent Schoolmaster Tactical Series (VSTS) is (again) inspired by the late John Young and his PRESTAGS series for SPI. VSTS will cover all eras of warfare from the beginning of history until the 17th century. This series is possible because warfare changed relatively little between this period until the wars of the 17th century developed Pike &amp; Shot tactics and the era of combined arms started to develop.<br/><br/>The first full game in the VSTS set of games focuses on Lacedamemon, otherwise known to us in the modern era as Sparta. Lacedemonia was the dominant land power in the ancient Greek world, establishing its hegemony over the Peloponnese peninsula sometime after the collapse of the Bronze Age. After years of internal struggle and intrigue, Sparta emerged from it&rsquo;s borders putting down tyrants creating allies across the region forming what today is called the Peloponnese league<br/><br/>4 critical battles in Sparta&rsquo;s history are presented in a clean, accurate, and playable format which promises not to get bogged down in minutia.  A simple command system sees leaders able to allow units to their move and grant benefits to units in combat, or units suffering from adverse results in combat, though this can sometimes result in the worsening quality of the leader. Each hex in VSTS represents about 100  meters from hexside to hexside. Each single hex-sized unit represents a company/squadron of 100-150 mean and/or horses. Each turn represents 5 minutes of real time. Units from Thebes, Corinth, Athens, Macedonia, and several others localities are represented in game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

And many of those meetings took place at the town's local inn! In Meet at the Inn, you're the adventurer freshly setting out on your journey... but will you mostly encounter simple beasts and uneventful landscapes, or will you be trapped by a Null Zone, brave the Cavern of the Abyss, or command the power of the Genie?<br/><br/>Meet at the Inn is comprised of 30 unique cards, each with unique Trait combinations and some with unique abilities. The goal of the game is to empty your hand of cards, but that is much easier said than done.<br/><br/>Each turn you will only play 1 card from your hand if it matches a Trait with the top card of the Play Pile. If you cannot, you must draw a card from the Deck. Certain cards can remain in play with global effects, called &quot;Decrees&quot;. Some cards allow you to play out of turn to empty your hand faster, these are &quot;Chain&quot; abilities.<br/><br/>There is also a Discard Pile, which helps get cards out of play, because when the Deck is empty and a player must draw a card, the Play Pile is reshuffled!<br/><br/>Set up and teaching the game takes less than 5 minutes. Playing a game takes roughly 5 minutes per player. But Meet at the Inn really shines when you've played it a few times with the same friends because your strategy will adapt to the meta of your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Vincent has come to this mansion, to free his ghostly companions from their Portrait prisons in order to help him complete his ghastly rituals throughout the house. Vincent will be moving about the house in secret,  using a separate pad to keep track of his movements, trying to free the other ghosts from their paintings. The painting ghosts will be moving about the house too but unlike Vincent, their movement is on the board for all to see. All the ghosts also have a unique movement advantage over the hunters, they can move through walls. As the ghosts are released freed, they will assist Vincent in completing rituals. To win the game they must complete 3 out of 5 rituals in 9 rounds of play. The other players will share control of the 4 hunters on the board. Each of these hunters has one of 10 different special powers to choose from giving each game a different way to combat Vincent and his ghostly pals. But if you think Vincent is without his own powers and tricks think again. Vincent too has different once per game powers to choose from, getting 3 to use each game. For the hunters to win they will need to locate Vincent and zap him, or hold him and his spooky pals at bay until the time limit expires.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are 3 pieces to this cheeky character,<br/>This makes her one of the simplest games to learn. However, don't be fooled! To win, one must be cunning and calculating.<br/><br/>This step-toothed figurine is designed to be aligned, so that the artwork matches up. Players take turns assembling at their choosing and then take turns at moving the head or the body. As both pieces have different cog notches they can only align on special numerical combinations. The seemingly straight forward nature becomes abundant, without seeing the paths to alignment an infinite game is possible!<br/><br/>The countenance bares resemblance to the prehistoric so-called Venus figurines, or could also be compared to Inca gold. Combined with authentic visage and mechanic rotatability Tressa has landed in the forefront of 21st century design! The etched tittering statuette is ultimately a tactile object: sits twisting ergonomically in the hand, mischievously perches on the desk, laughing about something no-one will ever know. Interestingly the form fits in the golden ratio - the height measuring approximately 1.618 of the width. The parts equally ascend in escalating measurements furthering this mathematic harmony.<br/><br/>The game has 3 steps to the head and 5 to the body. At any moment a player can call &quot;Tressa&quot; and change the lower direction, and the other player calling &quot;Pympes&quot; and changing the upper rotation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CasTiles and Armies is meant to be a fast-paced tile-based Castle and Siege strategy game for 2 players. Players will build a castle wall, reinforce it as needed, and attempt to defeat the enemy Monarch with their troops.<br/><br/>CasTiles and Armies consists of 2 phases. The Construction Phase and the Combat Phase.<br/><br/>The Construction Phase:<br/>Starting with Player #1, the players will take turns placing castle tiles (dark grey) to construct their Castle Wall until it is 5-tiles wide. After placing a tile, the player may choose to discard one tile, placing it in a Rubble Heap, and then draw back up to 5 tiles in their hand. The Rubble Heap is a separate mass of tiles which can no longer be brought back into the game.<br/><br/>After the 5th tile is placed, 2 more tiles (a total of 6 additional tiles after the Gatehouse) may be placed in the Army Reserves Zone and/or the Offensive Line Zone. Be considerate of the numbers on the tiles during placement, the numbers all mean something! Once the castle is fully constructed, the final step in this phase is to calculate the strength of the wall. The Gatehouse icons count as wild cards and will conform to the number placed adjacent. We recommend placing dice at each of the 4 wall junctions with values that represent their strength. Dice make it easier to track damage on the castle wall. You will likely need a range of dice from D4s to D20s.<br/><br/>Tile placement is a key consideration! Your strategy during this phase of the game will determine your success as a defender or conquer. Tiles must be placed so they read left to right or top-facing-right (from the player&rsquo;s perspective). See the possible scenarios below to determine how to calculate the strength. The higher the number, the stronger the wall. Once a tile is down it is down.<br/><br/>The Combat Phase:<br/>With the castle wall now complete and total strength calculated and marked on the playing field, it is now time to start combat!<br/><br/>Each player should still have 5 tiles in their hand. At this time, ALL army tiles (gold-ish) in their hand can be placed in either the Army Reserves Zone or Offensive Line Zone, starting with Player #1. Hopefully, you didn&rsquo;t discard them all during the last phase. Then discard or draw tiles as needed to keep only 3 tiles in your hand. Like the wall junctions, place a die on the arrow side of the army tile to indicate the strength of the army.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Who would have said that the better fortune tellers were in cheap sci-fi movies?

That trash, that we threw away so carelessly, is now the most valuable currency in the space. More than gold, more than any other mineral, now plenty in any rock in the space. No one studies how to make a screw, that&rsquo;s why they cost so much.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s stop talking. Welcome aboard. You probably know something about us, the Those Little Assignments Co. We travel through the space, jumping into the hyperspace, avoiding threats looking for resources and, who knows, maybe a mighty artifact.<br/><br/>Please go to the sign board. Every day there is a new adventure to live. Well, we really have no &ldquo;days&rdquo; in the space, but we still count every 24 hours, just not to get crazy. I hope you enjoy your time here.&quot;<br/><br/>Little Space Errands is a game for 1 player, with games of around 20 minutes length.

In Bad or Worse? you will face the hardest decisions you would ever have to make, only surmountable by having to choose between the same choices in real life!<br/><br/>Players take turns choosing a Choice Card representng something they would never do. Other players then choose another Choose Card that would make the first player choose between either of them. However, there are action cards that modify how the game flows and make everything different. Player compete to reach a number of victory points equal to twice the number of players, or maybe you could make all the other player feel so offended that they leave...<br/><br/>ATTENTION. This game is NOT for people under 18, people who get offended easily, people with good moral values, people that can't make choices, and for good people in general. It contains sexual themes, mature content, offensive jokes, psychological torture, extremely disgusting scenarios, black humor, illegal hypothetical situations, and things only really horrible people would enjoy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The last team standing wins.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Each player at the start of the game will select a jersey ring with a nickname on it. That becomes their player piece. Each player will also grab a dodgeball. If a dodgeball thrown from the opposing team enters this jersey ring, it counts as a hit and the player with that ring is out. A hit occurs when the dodgeball completely enters the ring or is leaning inside the ring. If the dodgeball is balancing on top of the ring or leaning outside of it, that counts as a catch. That means the person who threw the ball is out and their jersey ring must be removed from the arena. The person who caught the ball can now have a previously out person come back in for their team. Teams go back and forth throwing until one team is left standing.<br/><br/>HOW TO MOVE<br/>Once you toss your dodgeball, you'll need to pick up another one to throw again. To do this, move your jersey piece to a different section of the arena. There are 4 sections for each side. Each section separated by lines and a pattern of blue and grey. You can move to a section that contains a dodgeball to pick one up again or you can move to a section without a dodgeball and won't pick one up. But you must move every turn You can move once per turn.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>The goal of dodgeball is to knock out all the players on the other team.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Table Dodgeball League.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They must be stopped, our only hope are the Space Warriors.<br/><br/>Earth has received eight reports from the planetary/moon leaders stating they are clear of aliens. One of these reports is wrong. The Space Warriors must blast off from Earth, their mission twofold: The Warriors must, by a process of elimination, find out which report is wrong and discover the hidden alien base; and each Warrior must collect a super weapon from the distant planet Pluto. When a Warrior has the super weapon and knows which report is wrong, they must return to earth to expose the aliens and win the game.<br/><br/>Using dice, Warriors select mission cards to decide their destination.

The reigns (conveniently 15 of them) are split into five in the Age of Barons, five in the age of the Crusades, and five in the age of the Cursed Kings. After applying that reigns events (perhaps a Crusade or Poor Harvests) the players each have their turn (based on a cube draw). In each turn they may do one thing based on the Three Orders of medieval life: Laboratores, Bellatores and Oratores (Peasants, Warriors and Priests). Each has advantages and disadvantages. Finally, each Baron may attempt a marriage that will bring fresh fiefs into his family.<br/><br/>The Baron seeks fiefs (his knights), peasants (for his new towns) and titles (many minor barons gained impressive titles in the East) as well as money. But kings seek armies in which you serve at your cost as these can eat your reserves or result in yet further success. Additionally they can invest in cards in suites of Military, Cathedrals, Scholars, Queens, Resources, and Culture. For example, respectively, Simon de Montfort, the Basilica of Cluny, St Bernard of Clairvaux, Blanche of Castile, the Fairs of Lagny, and the &ldquo;Summa Theologica&rdquo; of St Thomas Acquinas,<br/><br/>Event cards cause a number of historical events to affect play. Victory is decided based on money, fame, titles held, card suites collected and other items.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Background. Starting in the mid-1950s, Italy went through an unprecedented industrial and economic growth that lasted well into the mid-1960s. This period in Italian history is referred to as &quot;Miracolo Economico Italiano&quot; (Italian Economic Miracle) or &quot;Boom Economico Italiano&quot; (Italian Economic Boom).<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The economy runs at full speed, national income grows and people are employment rates reach new records. The reasons for this growth were the favorable international economic situation and the abundance of labor supply. Exports were also a major stimulus for the development of the country's industrial fabric.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>These years brought extraordinary transformations that affected the lifestyle and customs of Italians, accompanied by a marked increase in living standards. Numerous consumer goods, such as the first washing machines, the first refrigerators and the first television sets, began to enter the homes of Italian families, forever changing the lives of Italians.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In Dolcissima Vita 2-4 players are entrerpreneurs who produce televisions, washing machines and refrigerators and sell them in Italy.<br/>Most actions in the game are carried out by a very clever dice selection system. The sum of dice pips allows players to conduct basic and advanced actions, while dice colors let players advance on four different tracks (Workers, Scientific Research, Maintenance and Solidarity), which have various effects on the course of the game.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dolcissima Vita features 35 colorful Event Cards of Italian history from 1955 to 1968. These cards change the conditions of the game, either permanently or temporarily.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dolcissima Vita is the first volume in Spielworxx&acute; 'Italian Trilogy', dedicated to Italian history after World War II.<br/><br/>",

Among other things, you'll be making tough choices activating your warband, reacting to enemies during their turn, flanking enemies and deciding when to play it safe and when to take risks.<br/><br/>Xenotactics has no modifiers to calculate, tables to look up or tons of counters to clutter the battlefield. A mission lasts under an hour so you can finish a short campaign in an evening. Or play best out of three if you have a competitive craving. As warbands only number a few miniatures they're quick to paint and prepare for battle.<br/><br/>The game is not associated with any specific line of models, instead you use whatever models you like best or happen to own thanks to the character creation rules. This allows you to create balanced statlines with for miniatures from almost any sci-fi miniature range. A warband usually numbers about 10 miniatures.<br/><br/>You can read the rules online on the games webpage. A pdf ruleset is also available which expands the game with campaign rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Senate concurred in the declaration and the conflict began formally on June 18, 1812, when Madison signed the measure into law and proclaimed it the next day.  The war would wage until the Senate approved the Treaty of Ghent on February 17, 1815.<br/><br/>Dawn's Early Light tasks two players to recreate this pivotal war in American, British and Canadian history. As the United States, you will be be tempted to invade Canada while also maintaining the country's honor on the high seas.

He must play a red card followed by a colour of his choice followed by another red card etc and can continue playing until he gets a question wrong.  With each turn, the rules of snooker apply ie. after playing and answering correctly questions on 15 red cards and the following card of his choice the player must then answer one question each from yellow green brown blue pink and black packet in that order.<br/>Before playing a card of the colour chosen the player rolls the die which determines which question on the card he must attempt to answer.  The person on the players right checks the answer and places the card question up on the bottom of the pack.  The person on the players left keeps the players score.  When the player fails to answer a question correctly play passes to the left.

Turn the shell and see what friend it is. You have two options. Option 1: You take the exposed shell and put it for everyone Player visible in front of you. You replace the missing shell with a new one from the stock. This ends your turn and it&quot;s the next player's turn.<br/> Option 2: You leave the shell exposed and try the same to find another friend.  Again you roll and swim with Dorie to a shell of the color and turn it around. Is there a different friend than before? Luck! Now you can put both friends in front of you.  You replace the two shells by two new ones from the stack. If you want, you can do both leave the shells and continue to roll the dice. It&quot;s up to you,how many times you want to roll the dice. Attention: If you face the same friend twice, your turn ends immediately and you go with nothing this round. If you have a friend twice or more, you can change it with another player.

To escape from it, she must gather images of the reality by asking herself how the reality looks like. But the nightmare might be showing her false images to misdirect her.<br/><br/>In the game of BLAUMARE, players divided into two forces. One player is the nightmare who try to misdirect opponents. The others represent one girl named Mito who is trying to escape from her dream. Mito's side wins if they successfully make three pairs of cards of different symbols.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players are secretly assigned their roles. One player is the nightmare, and the others are Mito. Each player is dealt a certain number of image cards and one clue card. Such as 'number', 'color', etc. is written in clue cards. If you have 'number' clue card, you may only ask about numbers, such as &quot;is the reality related to six?&quot;<br/><br/>When you try to make a pair, you try to find another player who has the identical image of reality (namely, who has the identical card as one of yours). First, you ask everyone else what the reality is related, complying with your clue card. Other players say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Then you target a player who said &quot;Yes&quot;. Both you and that player place the card which they think is identical with each other face-down.<br/><br/>In a later turn, you may reveal the two cards. If these are identical, Mito's side takes the pair which can count toward victory. Otherwise the nightmare takes these two cards.<br/><br/>Mito's side wins when they successfully make three pairs of cards with different symbols. The nightmare wins when they have taken three pairs of cards with different symbols or six cards with the same symbol, or when the image deck runs out.<br/><br/>As the nightmare, you should try to misdirect Mito's side indicating that you have the right image, even if you don't have.

        "description": "Squadron Commander' is designed specifically to play with the 10mm Crew miniatures from Capitan Games, and the Gunboats &amp; Ships made by Laser Dream Works for Capitan Games.<br/><br/>The main elements of the game are the gunboats and ships, along with their crews.<br/><br/>Gunboat, our original Napoleonic small naval action rule set, has grown and, with this second edition, has become Squadron Commander in an updated form. The game has been re-scaled for a better playability and is supported by a whole range of miniature crews and ships that are available in 10mm scale.<br/><br/>With this re-scaling, players will be able to play on a smaller game table with smaller gunboats or on, a larger table, with cutters, brigs of war, sloops, corvettes, frigates, Xebecs, and much more.  Also in this 2nd edition we have introduced two new kits from the great &ldquo;Hearts of Oak&rdquo; Ships of the Line a 4th rate (50 &amp; 64 gun) and a 3rd rate (74 &amp; 80 gun).<br/><br/>We are investigating the introduction of 2nd and 1st rate vessels later, together with a merchant or &ldquo;Indiaman&rdquo; vessel. As a result of these moves, we have made a small adjustment to the rules.<br/><br/>With these changes, the rules have been expanded and cover all ship types and there is a full set of ship characteristics and crew charts ready to play straight from the book. By including the great &ldquo;Ships of the Line&rdquo; and  Frigates, players will be able to recreate the famous frigate actions of the Napoleonic wars, with Privateers or take the role of a captain of the Royal Navy, like Lord Cochrane on HMS Imperieuse, the French Privateer, Surcouf, with Le Confiance, Stephen Decatur who fought against the Barbary pirates or Spanish Captain Barcelo and his gunboats attacking Gibraltar&hellip; all this using a single rule set&hellip; action on the high seas, coastal landings, shore actions, cutting-out operations&hellip; plenty of enjoyment and history in one book&hellip;<br/><br/>As a tactical game, Gunboat &ndash; Squadron Commander is designed to be played with a few ships per side, but ships which provide a strong visual experience as well as quick exciting game play, Squadron Commander is a new concept in naval games, emphasising the individual action of ships and crews rather than those of fleets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Company Commander is set in the XVIII &amp; the first half of the XIX century.  During this period there were many great battles with large armies and thousands of men but there were also many smaller actions where the use of a musket, ability in fencing, riding skills, personal courage and charisma were decisive.<br/><br/>Company Commander rules are designed for games between small units of men such as reconnaissance patrols, convoy escorts, intelligence missions, border attacks, and other missions which were given to small groups of selected troops. The actions of small groups of soldiers and the direct commands of their officers are the most important aspects of play.  The system simulates the frantic rhythm of an encounter.  The &ldquo;human factors&rdquo; of individual initiative, speed and leadership are worth more than the grand tactics of larger battles.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to use with 15/18mm figures. Figures can be based individually or in groups. But other scales as 28mm could be used.<br/><br/>For command figures, standard bearers, musicians and officers, one figure equals one man. In all other cases one figure represents three soldiers. 8-12 figures represent a section and three sections represent a company.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents about 3 minutes of time.<br/><br/>Ground scale is 1:100.<br/><br/>During 6 years the game has been developed with the suggestions of many players, clubs and hours of gaming.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the latest set of wargaming rules from Hordes of Models and Buckets of Dice. The rules facilitate phalanx, warband, company to regimental level games from 3000BC to 1901AD with a focus on command and control. Larger games can be played depending of the scale and size of the table available. The design philosophy of the rule set provides a simple approach that can be used to play wargame battles, irrespective of the figure scale (6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 25mm and even 1/32 scale). These rules have been designed to provide the player with challenges based around the manoeuvre and the management of their army in an easy format while still maintaining a feel for the specific period being played. The rules use a number of bases, depending on the size of formations. These are then grouped into distinct command groups. A formation has between two, four or six bases to represent the different formation sizes. The bases are placed side by side to represent a line, skirmish line or a column/block deployment. A base can have any number of figures on it according to the players preference or current basing arrangement. To represent scouting or skirmish formations, the formation bases are spaced out in a line, with each base having a gap equal to one base width. I personally, use blank bases to show clear formation definition. Artillery formations are based slightly different. They are always on a single square base of two base widths wide to two base widths deep, always counting as a standard size formation. When playing with scales of 6mm &ndash; 28mm, a base size of 60mm x 60mm is used, although the equally popular 40mm wide bases could be used instead. For a scale greater than this, bases of 100mm x 100mm are used. This is the base size I use for my 54mm games. The rules use a measurement of one base width equal to one range/movement distance measurement. The rules have been designed to provide capability options for each base. These bases are then grouped into formations. Each formation cannot complete all of the traditional actions/phases (shooting, moving, charging and reforming etc.) during a turn, with a specific formation. Each formation has two action points per turn. The players then decide which combination of actions to complete. The players complete all actions on a specific formation alternatively. This makes the style of play more of a conversion, keeping players engaged through the whole game. The framework used in the game looks at the different formations capabilities compared to that of compatible enemy formations in period. Or put more simply: &ldquo;Was the specific formation any better or worse on the battlefield compared to their opponents, for the period?&rdquo;. This enables the player to apply their own knowledge of the historic period to represent the way they believe a specific type of formation would have performed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gunpowder Period: Quick play wargames rules for 1560AD - 1885AD<br/><br/>The design philosophy of the Gunpowder rules provides a simple approach that can be used to play wargame battles at brigade or higher command levels, irrespective of the figure scale (6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 25mm and even 1/32 scale) with your own current models and common basing formats currently in use. There are many very good rule sets aimed at a specific period in the hobby which provide a detailed simulation of warfare in that period. These rules have been designed to provide the player with challenges based around the manoeuvre and the management of their units in a quick play format while still maintaining a feel for the period. An army within the game is typically 20 units as side broken down into distinct command groups. A unit is a single base. The rules use 100mm equal to one range/movement unit and a unit has a footprint of 120mm wide by 30mm &ndash; 80mm depth depending the formation and unit type. The rules have been designed to provide capability options at the unit level, while still presenting the dilemma to the player that they cannot complete all the traditional phases (shooting, moving, charging and reforming) during a turn with that specific unit. These rules instead of using a traditional system of very distinct detailed weapon factors and micro-managed movement rates, they provide a game framework that looks at the different unit&rsquo;s capabilities compared to that of the unit&rsquo;s opponents for the period. This enables the player to apply their own knowledge of the historic period to represent the way a specific unit should perform with in the game. The rules also do not use the IGUGO turn approach, but instead each action, (reform, charge, move and shoot) can be done in any sequence and up to twice in a turn. This keeps both players engaged throughout a turn sequence. A unit has a limit of two actions in any turn. The players take it in turns to complete these actions by unit. Also, the rules do not focus on detailed weapon factors and actions within a specific game turn time frame, but use the approach: &ldquo;Was the specific unit any better or worse on the battlefield for the period?&rdquo; For example, all units could have used volley fire, but was this specific unit any better/worse at than anyone else? The rules manage this through a unit being given a selection of capabilities. The rules make a difference between the plug and socket bayonets. This is handled by the unit completing a distinct action to counting them fitted. This means when a plug bayonet is fitted, the unit cannot shoot. This formation is called &ldquo;Foot cavalry defence&rdquo;. This also covers the use the of foot squares as an anti-cavalry defence. The rules have to make a comprise and when a unit is claiming &ldquo;foot cavalry defence&rdquo; they also count as a deep formation even when a unit is in line with bayonets fitted. All units break at the same point, regardless of if the unit is veteran, regular or militia. What is managed within the rule set is how quickly or slowly a unit reaches that point of failure. Generals are used for command and control only. Units must be organised into command groups. An army for the game is organised into a number of these command groups with an overall army commander. Generals can only command units within their group and the army commander can command any units across all command groups. Typically, a command group is a brigade, division or corps depending on the scale you have adopted for the army. Games can be played over a two-hour time limit with a scoring system based around the number of units that one side has managed to kill. The rules reward aggressive play; thus, hopefully avoiding a static game. For a specific historical battle use the objectives of the actual battle to decide the winner. These rules cover the period from the end of the dominance of the Swiss Keil to the end of The Mahdist Wars in the Sudan.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

So if the middle is &quot;tomato&quot; you could play &quot;bread&quot; to make pizza, and then the next person could play &quot;curry&quot; to make nan and curry. You go on this way until someone runs out of cards. An important rule is that you can't just invent some kind of food on the spot, you have to use an existing well-known dish.<br/><br/>The other games use the same principle of making food out of ingredients. In &quot;Cooking Poker&quot; the hands are based on combinations of food, so for example a &quot;straight&quot; is where you use all your five cards to make a course meal and can explain the order the courses are served in. In &quot;Indian Food Cooking Poker&quot; you play with your hand visible only to the other players, and &quot;Tanuki Soba&quot; is like Old Maid.<br/><br/>What food will you come up with?<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

All instructions and the playing board are provided on the centerfold; a required six-sided die is not included.  Players form two opposing teams with at least two players per team recommended.  The two teams assume the function of the Biblical wise men, traveling from their home to Bethlehem and gathering gifts along the way.<br/><br/>Play alternates between the teams, with each rolling and moving the rolled number of squares.  Squares have game instructions for completion.  Many squares incorporate 6 separate actions, one of which is randomly selected by die roll.  Most game instructions direct some type of trivia exercise, based in Biblical or Christian knowledge of the birth of Jesus Christ and, especially, the visiting wise men.  Successful completion of the trivia activity yields a gift for the team.<br/><br/>The first team to acquire all the needed gifts and then complete the journey to Bethlehem wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is published in the New Era magazine, a publication of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, primarily directed at youth ages 12 to about 18.

Five cases are set at the same time, and a five-row, plot-type auction is held.&nbsp;Scores will be given to the 1st and 2nd place &quot;in the time allotted&quot; for each case. Do this for 3 hands.<br/><br/>Detectives work together to investigate the case, but often go to stand, play to seek credit, or settle with the culprit.&nbsp;As a result, you may get deeply involved in the incident and get seriously injured or you may be killed!　Moreover, even if you get a line of duty, the game is not over, and if you can get a line of duty at a good show, you can earn a high score.&nbsp;Produce your own line of duty scene well and decide &quot;What's this !!!!&quot;<br/><br/>The basis of the game is a &quot;5-row, plot-type auction&quot;.　A total of 24 common cards will be given to the player as a hand, and one card will be placed in each of the five cases, for a total of five cards.&nbsp;After placing, reveal the cards, and after seeing the result, arrange the remaining 5 sheets in the same way and judge by the total value.&nbsp;Therefore, it is important to avoid competition as much as possible and get more cases efficiently, because it is possible to guess to some extent who wants which case with the first placement.<br/><br/>Then, shouldn't it be better to hide the information by arranging as few numbers as possible for the first placement?&nbsp;Of course, that's one strategy.&nbsp;However, if the numbers are the same, there is a rule that the one with the larger number placed on the first sheet wins, so it is not always advantageous to arrange the smaller numbers.　In addition, each person has a ticket called hero time, and you can win regardless of the number unless the heroes spend time fighting with each other.&nbsp;Where to use this hero time is also important.<br/><br/>",

They love posting hot dog eating live feeds, video games, and boring videos. Today, they were having trouble shooting a video in the garage of Shaun's grandpa's house. (By the way, how long can you withstand a bunch of live crayfish in your body?) But that has nothing to do with this story. Instead, everyday life had collapsed due to a sudden zombie pandemic. The dead resurrected and ate the living. The army and police could not keep up, and the zombie population continued to expand day by day. The threat has arrived in the country town where Shaun and Edo live.<br/><br/>As the evacuation activities proceeded, the two thought, &quot;Now is our chance to become top U-Tubers? Let's film a zombie and upload it!&quot; A fool is a big deal in a small town. Thus, the two idiots headed to the city center full of zombies. Shaun packed Grandpa&rsquo;s keepsake revolver and ammunition in his backpack, as well as a smart phone and a lot of donuts. In this way, two stupid people began to stream an endless battle with the zombie pandemic to the world. &quot;Share zombie videos with the world and become famous!

        "description": "A Luminous Flame in The Darkness (LFID) is innovative Board Game for sharing and learning. The LFID is Homemade Integrated Design. It is also suitable for a solo game at home.  The player can share and learn about ethic, goodness, moral, and core cultures while they adventure and explore with many experiences on the map of a community. Some happenings tend to be worse. How do they live? How do they make a decision? or How do they take an action?<br/><br/>Each Player can create Core Culture and a story together, including modify rules. In the game, the player may see a picture emerge of inter-relationships with multiple factors that are connected, such as causes that lead to multiple degenerations or the existence of individual forces against outer contexts. Preservation and recovery of life is more difficult than destruction. Creativity, life, people and the maintenance are essential for the existence of a core culture. The environment is not for the individual to exploit, but for all lives to enjoy.  This game simulates incidents happening in a world of fantasy in which virtue and ethics are crucial to the survival of humanity.  Each player will be able to perceive an overall concept of the core culture which they created together in the game.<br/><br/>    Note : In case of using for eduacional game, an experienced adult or parent is required to teach and guide.<br/><br/><br/>BACKGROUND :<br/>I graduated in Ph.D. of Arts and Culture Research from the Faculty of Fine Arts of Srinakarinwirot University in Bangkok, Thailand. My research of Green Culture for Ethics Through Documentary Films, found out the issues of many problems and wide ranging effects, including the realisation that the relationship between natures and ethics are complementary in both the individual and public contexts. The complimentary nature of living in accordance with an ecological system leads to a balance between the physical and subjective, the concrete and the abstract, human behaviour and the mind which can be seen as the foundation of ethics for peaceful and sustainable mutual living.<br/><br/>A Game Story :<br/>After humanity has destroyed nature and the environment in many areas, some of the areas have  been restored and rejuvenated. Nevertheless, many people turn to violence to hurt and destroy each other for fame and wealth, focusing on dominating the land which causes many problems and adverse living conditions.  People have lost trust for each other : no faithfulness exists. They have lived in unsafe place and lead insecure lives. At the same time that pollution has dominated and deterioration also spreads widely into several areas.  In one remote district, a city that was once full of happiness, many things have began to change. However, the last thing that still keeps faith and hope and that will not be destroyed so easily, the GOODNESS OF PEOPLE<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>All players help most members in their community to stay away from evil power before most terrible things appear. They try to cultivate goodness and ethics in the land of loss before the darkness comes.  At the end of game, all players consider successful future and present outcomes together.<br/><br/>GENRE<br/>Fantasy game, <br/>Solo Game,<br/>Co-operative game, <br/>Strategic game, <br/>and Educational game<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>1. 16 Miniatures / 16 Character Markers<br/>2. 3 Draw Bags<br/>3. 12 Intelligence Dice<br/>4. 12 Conscience Dice<br/>5. 6 Open-Mind Dice<br/>6. 8 Sincerity Dice<br/>7. 12 Tolerance/Endurance Dice<br/>8. 12 Evil Dominance Dice<br/>9. 2 Protection Dice<br/>10. 20 Moral Cards (5 Principles)<br/>11. 47 Happening Cards<br/>12. 4 Ending Cards<br/>13. 6 Random Quality Cards<br/>14. 76 Encounter Cards<br/>15. 6 Item Cards<br/>16. 15 Special Person Cards<br/>17. 11 Monster Cards<br/>18. 1 Devil Card<br/>19. 5 Mechanical Move Cards<br/>20. 59 Person Tokens<br/>21. 89 Merit Tokens<br/>22. 224.

Victory points represent your ability to eliminate the aliens, and secure your territory. They can also represent your ability to study and understand them enabling you to live alongside them or even communicate with them!<br/><br/>The goal of winning the game is to earn 15 victory points. Simple. But, in order to do this you must survive the threats and perils of this new world, while maintaining the healthy morale of the crew.<br/><br/>Morale is one of the three tracks that affect gameplay. The game will be lost, if morale drops to zero.<br/><br/>The second track is the Threat track. As Threat goes up, more morale is lost every Season. Players can improve these two tracks.<br/><br/>The final track is the spawn track. The Spawn track increases every Season. It shows players how many aliens spawn from spawning points during the battle for each Mission Phase.<br/><br/>After each Mission Phase, crew members must return to the colony to complete the Colony Phase. A random event card is drawn that either adds more challenge, or provides a small benefit. Each player then places their crew tokens onto one of the 7 colony stations to perform its action.<br/><br/>All 7 stations can be accessed by any two crew members, or by one of the four specialists linked to that location, either a Commander, an Engineer, an Agritect or a Medic. The Perimeter lowers Threat level. The Training Grounds improves morale. The Med Bay creates medicine and regains lost health. Stasis Pods awake new crew members that can help in the colony next Season. The Bio-Dome is used to grow food. The Command Center earns valuable victory points. The Workshop is used to make new weapons and equipment. Every station can be improved to be more efficient.<br/><br/>Thrive has a fast-pace single die combat and skill system. It just takes one roll to determine if a hit is successful and how much damage is done. Damage and success are inversely represented on the dice, giving great balance to every roll.<br/><br/>Aliens are controlled by a clever and easy to use AI algorithm. The AI is predictable, but adapts automatically to the combined tactical choices of the players, creating a challenging puzzle of movement.<br/><br/>All player actions in are taken simultaneously, allowing for minimal downtime between turns.<br/><br/>Characters are all unique and balanced with 3 basic attributes, 3 pools of trait cubes used for actions, focusing and health. An expansive selection of skill tokens also improve each character after each of the first 3 missions.<br/><br/>The variable event deck, the randomly selected skill tokens, and the randomly drawn missions ensure that no two games will ever be the same.<br/><br/>The spawn track is a natural gameplay timer. It increases difficulty and provides thematic tension, making every game fun, fresh and exciting.<br/><br/>The most satisfying element you will find in Thrive is the interconnected puzzles between every Mission Phase and Colony Phase. They are challenging and rewarding. It is a great balance between tactics and strategy. Every choice is meaningful to the team&rsquo;s end results<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your gloves are on, seconds are out, the bell has rung, the crowd is screaming. Engage your rival, make your best moves, and hit first. Now you are on your own.0<br/><br/>Into the Box is a simulation of a boxing fight for 2 players, focused on the strategy involved. Your goal is to have more points than your rival after 9 or 12 rounds or, alternatively, knock him out before he does it to you.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards representing their boxer's skills, including punches, guards, and special moves. Players take turns to play their cards from a limited hand. In general, punching does damage, and guarding prevents that damage. Boxers may kiss the canvas as a result of a strong unguarded punch and may be knocked out after sustaining too much damage. You will have to manage your hand wisely, knowing when to attack and when to defend and try to take your adversary by surprise.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every round, each boxer is granted 10 points from ring judges and must subtract one point for each time they kiss the canvas. At the end of the round, the most damaged boxer must subtract one additional point from his/her score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They can also acquire new moves through the missions. They are free to take out cards and add cards to their decks for the next missions. Remember, a bigger deck size also means it is harder to draw some wanted cards. Players must consider and make effective decks instead of adding all the cards they get.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based. Every player performs different actions like these:<br/><br/>Move &ndash; move the player on the map based on its speed, sometimes they can have special moves with some special action cards.<br/><br/>Attack &ndash; Players can play cards from their hands to perform different attacks, they have different attribute requirements and the players often have to roll a set of dice to determine the attack strength.<br/><br/>When an action card is used once, it is discarded. When the player runs out of action cards, he needs to find a safe place to rest to replenish the deck! But they come back automatically once the current mission is over.<br/><br/>Search &ndash; Players can search the objects on the map and will trigger sudden events, often they have to choose between two options, but sometimes they don't have a choice, it is instead determined by some current conditions.<br/><br/>Specials &ndash; There are many special moves, like healing wounds, dealing with tear gas, take videos, etc.<br/><br/>Save Others &ndash; In some missions there are NPC protectors spawning on the map, the players can save them by moving to them and clear the enemies nearby.<br/><br/>As this is a coop game, the enemy&rsquo;s turn would be played according to the AI deck.<br/><br/>Remember, do not advance to the very front line always as this is a very hard game.<br/><br/>There are different objectives in different missions, like saving protesters, surviving for some turns, protect the Lennon walls, setting road blocks, collecting police violence evidence, expose to the mass through the six months.<br/><br/>Those are just what would happen in one mission, between the missions the players can use the experience earned to upgrade their attributes, get more action moves and construct their own action decks, etc. And remember the final goal is to survive through the missions till November, and increase the mass supports (an in-game value) by that time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer'<br/><br/>",

A player tries to put together the highest scoring word from the eight letter cards available to them (unlike Texas Holdem Poker which makes the best 5 card hand from 7 cards available). The word is made from the 3 letters that were privately dealt to each player (hole cards) and the 5 turned over on the spoker&trade; playing mat (the 3 'flop' cards, the 'turn' card and the 'river' card -community cards as in Texas Holdem Poker). Players can use the hexagonal note pads provided to write down and juggle the letters around to help make up words. Players bet in a series of rounds, exactly as in Texas Holdem Poker (with small and big blinds). The winner of the 'Pot' is the player who reveals the highest scoring word at the end of the 4 rounds of betting, or the last player left in the game, as all other players have folded their cards.<br/><br/>spoker&trade; therefore, places the intellectual and vocabulary expertise of word making, within the exciting arena of gambling and gives you the opportunity to make a profit from your combined skills. A word expert could beat a skilled gambler on many occasions, however a skilled gambler could very well beat a top word player too, due to their knowledge of gambling strategy and bluffs.  An expert in both these fields would find spoker&trade; an exciting and refreshing concept and an excellent opportunity to make a good profit through spoker&trade; gaming!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer, Jonathan Stone<br/><br/>",

This is done by gaining ten Fame points, venturing into the Desolation of the Claw to find the Sword of Yitar, and presenting oneself at the Citadel of Yitar for judgement (rolled on a table).<br/><br/>Each tyrant starts with randomly-determined attributes (Survival, Guile, Faith, and Generalship), gold, household garrison, warrior bands, and slayers (specially trained assassins). They move around the map to attack the other players, the Merciless Horde of Yin, and the Humanoids of the Claw. This can provide fame and, when attacking other players' households, gold.<br/><br/>Tyrants can also adventure into such places as the Vale of the Prophets and the Caves of the Necromancer, which may result in gaining magic items or other benefits, but may also have negative effects.<br/><br/>Each turn a tyrant must also roll for a random event; there is a 1/6 chance nothing will happen but otherwise a player may be ambushed, raided, given gold, etc.<br/><br/>One unusual rule is that a player is allowed to write a secret message to another player, but it may not be delivered properly; based on a die-roll the message may go astray and a different player may receive it.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

These frigates were designed to outmatch the frigates of any other nation while remaining nimble enough to slip away from larger ships-of-the-line.<br/><br/>These six frigates (Chesapeake, Constitution, President, United States, Congress, and Constellation. Chesapeake, Constitution, President and United States) were armed with 44 guns, normally a mix of long 24-pounders and 32-pound carronades. Across their service life, these ships would often end up over gunned, carrying upwards of 50 guns into battle.<br/><br/>Revolutionary construction techniques gave the six frigates much thicker hull planking than their British or French equivalents, allowing them to soak up a tremendous amount of punishment. It also allowed them to carry a much heavier armament relative to their size, as seen by the arrays of 24 and 32-pounders carried on the 44 gun vessels.<br/><br/>In the Game:<br/><br/>USS Constitution should be in the thickest fighting on the table, leading the charge into the enemy battle line, using her exceptional survivability to weather the storm of shot and shell while blasting away with her own guns.<br/><br/>While she might not be able to tangle with larger First Rates like Victory, she can hold her own in frigate actions, tying up the enemy fleet while the remainder of your ships go after other objectives or gain a more advantageous position.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

SDG Architect supports public education about the Sustainable Development Goals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>Players act as the leaders of neighboring countries responsible for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as quickly as possible. At every round, players get resource cards based on their progress, and use them to implement interventions aimed at achieving the SDGs. By way of those interventions, players advance from level 0 to 3 for each SDG or &ldquo;Goal&rdquo;, and receive more resources to invest and further their progress.<br/><br/>Basic Setup<br/>Distribute 17 tokens of the same color to each player; divide the resource cards by type and stack them on the outer part of the board; and place the Technology token on the globe in the center of the board.<br/><br/>To determine their starting level, players roll the die. The player with the highest roll rolls the die again and positions an initial token on the first intervention for the corresponding SDG number. The other players follow in a clock-wise direction, rolling the die in turns until all players have placed six tokens.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>At the end of the game, the player who has progressed the most towards the SDGs wins: each level achieved for each Goal is counted as a point, and the first player to fully achieve any Goal is awarded two extra points. The game can be limited in time, in rounds, or can end when the first player achieves a certain level for all SDGs agreed by players at the start of the game. Reaching Level 1 for all Goals typically requires about 1 hour of play time; Level 2 two hours; and Level 3 three hours.<br/><br/>",

By October 1797, the first three of six frigates launched; the USS United States, USS Constellation, and USS Constitution. Between 1798 and 99, several engagements took place between the US and France - though this was not a declared war. The First Barbary War of 1801-1805 saw actions against the Barbary pirates.<br/><br/>The fleet would then see substantial action in the War of 1812 - achieving victory in 11 single ship engagements against the Royal Navy. British forces were forced off Lake Erie and Lake Champlain, effectively preventing the invasion of New York State. The fleet was, however, unable to prevent British blockades of US ports, the British Navy being significantly larger.<br/><br/>Why sail the US Navy?<br/><br/>The largest ships of the US Navy may pail in size in comparison to other nations, especially when using the National Special Rules (being unable to field any large or extra-large vessels). However, their frigates were exceptionally reinforced with many guns. To represent this, US fleets gain discounts to both the Over Gunned and Sturdy upgrades. They are both able to better weather punishment whilst dealing out a substantial portion themselves.<br/><br/>Additionally, in a similar vein to British crews, US crews were routinely drilled and always receive the +1 bonus to hit rolls. This makes US frigates, the core of your fleet exceptionally dependable, though remember if you do purchase both upgrades on all your ships (even at a discount), you may find yourself outnumbered.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game was manufactured in Austria.<br/><br/>The players start by taking a hand of ten tiles, at random. Each plastic tile has one of three edge shapes on each side: a square, triangular, or semicircle &quot;cutout,&quot; or a straight edge with no cutout. The players take turns placing the square tiles on the table. Tiles are placed dominoes style, adjacent to another tile, with matching types of edges in contact.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to form rectangles out of the square tiles. The game ends as soon as one player runs out of tiles. Scoring is based on the number of rectangles a player formed, with points deducted for any pieces the player has remaining at the end of the game.<br/><br/>While a single set of the game supports play by up to three players, more can play by combining multiple sets of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The suggested board size is 19&times;19. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>A potential impasse is a 2&times;2 pattern of two diagonally adjacent stones of one color, one stone of the other color and an empty point. To fix a potential impasse is to place a stone of its majority color on its empty point.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point, then fix all resulting potential impasses. If this creates further potential impasses, fix those as well, and so on.<br/><br/>You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "集団陣形棋 (Shudan-Jinkeiki) (Troop-Chess) is an abstract game for two players, which can be played using components from other games (such as Go, Chess, Shogi). In Troop-Chess, players organize battle-formations with their pawns and use these formations in both offence and defense.<br/><br/>The game can be played in three versions, each using groyps of three, five or eight pawns. A player can take action only if they have organized a battle-formation using the specified number of pawns.<br/><br/>For this reason, a player who has reduced their pawns to fewer than the specific number, or has divided them too small, making it impossible to organize any formation, will lose the game. It is possible that both players get incapacitated at the same time, because they have reduced their pawns too much simultaneously. In this case, the game ends in draw.<br/><br/>Each type of battle-formation has its own nature, such as strong in attack or highly maneuverable. One formation has only mobility. As well as the predefined formations, you can create original battle-formations as you like. And modify the number of pawns that are used too.<br/><br/>Each pawn does not have any nature by itself, but the power or strength of the formation organized from pawns is affected by its relationship with the neighboring pieces.<br/><br/>What is required to determine this is only a method to judge which are allies or enemies.<br/><br/>Further, whilst in the original game, each pawn has no nature itself, the designer encourages players to customize the game further by introducing specialized pawns.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>複数駒で陣形を築き、攻守に役立てる2人用アブストラクトゲーム。<br/>3，5，8駒のバージョンがあり、それぞれの数で規定の陣形を作らねば行動不可能。<br/>ゆえに、自軍の駒が既定の駒数未満に減らされるか、陣形を作れないほど分断された方の負けとなる。場合により、同数駒で双方行動不能となる場合があるが、その場合は引き分け。<br/>陣形により攻撃力が強い、機動力が高いと性格が分かたれている。機動力のみの陣形も。<br/>こちらが用意・提示している以外の陣形を各人が好みで創造することも可能。駒数も自由。<br/>周囲との関係性で陣形の強さが変わるため、駒は無性格。敵味方判別の白黒があればいい。<br/>駒は無性格であるが、発展形として特殊駒を導入するとゲームの深みは格段に増す。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

Every turn a player places a card from his hand on the table and takes the card from that position in his hand. He ends his turn by turning a card in the middle over and making it visible. The players try to collect a group of 5 of the same cards that fit their role card. The first player to achieve that says &quot;Histo&quot; and wins the game. Other players with the same role will be awarded points as well. It's also possible to claim &quot;Histo&quot; when 5 of the same cards are visible in the middle, although fewer points will be awarded to the winners.<br/><br/>Every player receives an action card that can be played once. Players can choose from 4 different high impact actions to turn the tables in their favor. Although the mechanic is accessible and straightforward, there are a lot of different viable tactics possible to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not to be confused with other games with similar names. Neither the publisher nor the designer is indicated, but the game comes in an envelope saying &quot;Enclosed: Your Free Animal Triva Game&quot;, so one might imagine that it was a promotional item or was given away for free with some product or service.<br/>There are 30 cardboard rectangles with numbers from 1 to 30, and another 30 cardboard rectangles in 6 different groups (indicated by pictures and words): birds, insects, primates, fish, mammals, and reptiles (however, the reptile rectangles have a picture of a frog on them). One of each of these 6 groups has a stars, in addition to the pictures and the names of the groups.<br/>The two different types of squares (numbers and animals) are put into two different containers. Players (presumably without looking) take one rectangle from each container, and this determines which question (from the question sheet) they have to answer. For example, if a player drew 6 and primates, he would have to answer the question &quot;True or False: Lemurs and lorises have huge eyes so they can see well at night&quot;. (The correct answer here is &quot;true&quot;). Most correct answers give the player 5 points, but if a starred rectangle was drawn,  a correct answer gives 10 points.<br/>The game can last a chosen period of time (in which case whoever has amassed the highest total wins) or until a set target of points is reached (in which case whoever has reached that target wins).<br/><br/>",

Players draft tiles at the start of the game while seeing only their backs; tiles in the first group have a &quot;capsule opening&quot; on only one edge, while tiles in the second group have a straight or curved tube from one edge to another, and tiles in the fourth group generally have three or four open edges. You can look at the faces of your tiles are you draft them.<br/><br/>The start player in a round plays one tile of their choice, optionally placing one of their wooden cubes on it. Each other player in turn must place one of their tiles in the same group (if possible) face down in front of them, again optionally placing one of their wooden cubes on it. Players then reveal their tiles, then add them to the shared playing area, starting with whoever has the highest-numbered tile. If you placed a cube on your tile, you then place this cube somewhere on your tile in one of the capsules.<br/><br/>When a capsule is closed, akin to a road being closed in Carcassonne, whichever players have the most cubes in it score points equal to the number of energy symbols in that capsule. After all the tiles have been played, whoever has the highest score wins &mdash; except that if exactly one player has scored 0 points, then they win instead!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to not laugh when it is your turn to read a &quot;Statement&quot; card or read/answer a &quot;Response&quot; card all while trying to follow your own rules cards in your hand at all times.<br/><br/>In the deck are &quot;Response&quot; cards that the drawer must ask another player of their choosing, in which that player must respond, and there are &quot;Statement&quot; cards which the drawer must simply read out loud. What makes Deadpan unique are the hilarious rules cards that are also in the deck. When a player draws a rule card, they must abide by the rule at all times, even when it is not their turn.<br/><br/>The &quot;Response&quot; and &quot;Statement&quot; cards act as points. To score the &quot;Statement&quot; point, the drawer must successfully read the &quot;Statement&quot; card without laughing while following any rules in their hand. To score the &quot;Response&quot; card, the drawer must ask the question to another player of their choice while trying not to laugh and following their own rules. If the responding player is able to respond without laughing and follows their own rules, then they are awarded the point. If the responder fails, then the drawer who asked the question is awarded the point. If both fail, no one is awarded the point. If a player is caught not following their rules at any time, they lose one (if any) of their points.  First player to collect seven points is the winner.<br/><br/>There are &quot;Mannerism&quot; - rules that implement a type of action a player must do as directed by the card, &quot;Starters...&quot;- implements that a player must start each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, &quot;...Enders&quot; - implements that a player must end each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, and &quot;New Name&quot; - implements that the player must refer to the directed player on the card by the name on the card anytime they address that player. There are also DEADPAN rules in the deck - These are the same categories as normal rules, but the difference being they are more over the top and the drawer gets to assign the DEADPAN rules to other players.<br/><br/>In the deck are also &quot;Veto&quot; cards and &quot;Revenge&quot; cards. &quot;Veto&quot; enables a player to discard any regular rule from anyone's hand. &quot;Revenge&quot; cards give the player the opportunity for payback towards any player that has given them a DEADPAN rule.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warr Without An Enemie is a set of wargame rules for the English Civil War developed by the Wyre Forest Gamers. The English Civil War is notable because of the large number of small actions that happened during the war. These provide a variety of interesting historical battles to fight. The player commands one to three 'brigades'. Brigades are usually 3 to 6 units, with 4 to 6 bases of figures per unit. For non historical battles brigades are generated randomly to provide interesting challenges and opportunities for the players.<br/><br/>A base represents 60 to 100 infantry and half that for cavalry. The players decide how many figures to use per base and base size. Units lose bases of figures, not individual figures.<br/><br/>The emphasis on the rules is on command and managing unit disruption caused by battlefield action. Quality of the commanders and units is usually more important than numbers or weapons. Raw units will need constant vigilance to keep them in the action while hardened Veterans will sort themselves out, dust themselves off and carry on. Commanders have different command rating and also can have individual qualities to reflect their character. A commander can thus be 'Steadfast' and good in defensive situations or a 'Drunkard' and a loose cannon. Units can receive disorder from movement, manoeuvre, combat, friendly units suffering reverses, etc. Disorder adversely effects a units abilities and after the limit is reached will lead to loses of bases. High quality units and good commander have a better ability to remove disorder.<br/><br/>Infantry are rated in one of 7 categories, I1 to I7. The number indicates the number of muskets and pikes within the unit. I1 means the unit is an all musket unit, while an I7 unit is all pikes. Most units are of course in between these two extremes, two muskets to one pike is an I3 unit for example. All bases fire and melee so there is no need to exactly model the ratio of weapons. When firing you need to roll your I number or higher to hit, while if in melee you need you I number or lower to hit. In this way the mix of weapons within a unit is quickly reflected. For example: An I3 unit (2 muskets to 1 pike) needs to roll 3 or higher per base to hit when firing but an I5 unit (1 musket to 1 pike) must roll 5 or higher to hit. So when firing the I3 unit will have the advantage while in a melee the reverse is the case. In a close combat the I3 unit will need to roll 3 or less to hit, while the I5 unit will need 5 or less.<br/><br/>There are four kinds of mainstream cavalry along with lancers and dragoons. The four kinds of cavalry allow the representation of the tactics of the period that is not possible in many other rules and is, like much of the rest of the rules, based on modern research of this fascinating period. 'Pistoleers' rely on firepower. 'Gallopers' rely on the reckless speed of their charge and the sword. While the dominant tactics of the war are the Dutch and Swedish styles of fighting. Entering combat at a high speed is an advantage but runs the risk of getting more disorder. Shooting the attackers can stop the aggressors in their tracks and leave them open to counter attack. Yet if it doesn't work.........<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to provide a set of rules that combine modern views of the war with an innovative and entertaining game. In the future the rules will be expanded to cover other wars and work on the Thirty Years War is well on the way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

An entirely luck-based spin and move game, but different from many such games, since every space is an intersection with 4 possible directions to another space: forwards, backwards, left, and right. The spinner (to be constructed) has these directions (F, B, L, and R) as possible results, and players must go one space in the direction they spin. <br/>The goal is to reach the fair before other players. One is required to get an F on the spinner to begin. Some directions from spaces lead to dead ends; players who get spinner results telling them to go to a dead end must remain where they are that turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You have the problem of controlling areas for your cause, denying them to your enemy and yet always at the whim of the King or Parliament in providing the great central field armies with resources. The great National events of the great battles or the support of the Scots or the arrival of the great central field armies as they maraud through your county makes for a most unpredictable game.<br/><br/>The novel battlefield rules emphasise the limitations of command and allow the games to flow fast and furious such that they are often over in a couple of hours or the time they would have been fought in reality.<br/><br/>Scope: Included are a set of battlefield figure rules for fighting battles up to 6,000- 8,000 men with a full colour Campaign system to fight the war. Thus your battles will have a context of when and why they were fought. There is also a system for fighting one-off battles.<br/><br/>Contents: 56  page Gamebook, 2 x A4 Unit Counters, 1 x A4 Game Counters, A4 sheet of Fate cards Campaign Calendar, 2 x A4 Off-Table Charts, There is a two-page Playsheet (one for the Campaign System one for the Battlefield) and 2 A3 or 4 A4 map of  Worcestershire.<br/><br/>Scales<br/><br/><br/>     Ground Scale: 1&rdquo; = 10 yards/metres. All combat and movement are by handspan or 6&rdquo; rules. So a battle is approx. half a mile by a third of a mile<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Time Scale: 1 Turn = 10-15 minutes<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Table Size: 6 x 4 ft. up to 8 x 6 ft.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Figure/Base ratio: Figures per base according to pocket. We use Pendraken&rsquo;s 10 mm figures with 12 pike, 8 shot, 4 cavalry or 1 gun and 2-4 crew per base. 1 Base = 50 foot or 25 horse.

At the beginning of each round 5 ships are loaded with 2 fruit tiles, and set sail for 4 ports within the city. Normally, on a player's turn they'll dock one of the available ships at an open port, and unload a fruit tile into that section of the city, thereby establishing a market. The remaining fruit tile is added to the player's stockpile. Each player controls a gang of 6 ragamuffins, of which only 4 will be deployed within the city each game. These ragamuffins are tasked with stealing from specific markets. These targets are hidden from the other players. At the end of the game, the player who manages to increase the demand for their stockpile the most, via robbing the various markets in the city, is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Instead The French Empire was overthrown and a new Republic created to carry on the war.<br/><br/>With astounding speed new French armies were formed to continue the war using remnants of the old army, the garde mobiles and depot companies not overrun by the Germans. With these they attempted to harass and defeat the Germans besieging Paris. The Germans were themselves tied down in the siege of Metz and Paris and thus only had a small number of forces to hold back the French. It was to be a close run thing.....<br/><br/>Scope: Included are a set of corps and army level figure rules with a full colour Campaign system to fight the war. Thus your battles will have a context of when and why they were fought. There is also a system for fighting one-off battles.<br/><br/>Game Aids: 67 pages gamebook of the history, campaign and battlefield rules, 2 pages of game and unit counters, 2 pages of French and Germans orders of battle, page of Campaign Action Cards, Campaign Calendar, Off map display for sieges of Paris and Metz, 2 Page Playsheet, Battlefield options cards, 3 pages of battlefield Fate Cards, 2 page Line of March Cards and 4 x A4 or 2 x A3 Colour Campaign Maps.<br/><br/>Scales<br/><br/><br/>     Ground Scale: 1&rdquo; = 100 metres.

So in the spirit of good natured rivalry, you'll stock your bars with the best beer and attract the town's best customers. May the best bar win!<br/><br/>Draft Beer is a pick and pass drafting game for 2-6 players, taking approximately 20 minutes to play. There are three rounds where you draft 8 cards, and at the end of each round you will use those cards to attract customers from the town to your bar to score points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The cards are double-sided with the front having beers and food that you draft, while the back has the various customers in the town. Each round, players are dealt 8 cards to draft, and 5/6/7 customers will be dealt into the &quot;town&quot; (depending on round). Beer cards have 3 symbols, representing qualities: color, price and taste. These qualities each have 3 possibilities; light, dark, cheap, malty, etc... Customer cards have a point value, and one or two qualities they are looking for. So they may want cheap, light beers, or maybe dark expensive beers. After all the cards have been drafted, players will reveal their bar's selection, then go through the customers one by one to determine which bar they go to. The player whose bar has the most symbols they want is where they will go, and on a tie they will patronize both bars equally (awarding VP chits to all tied players).  Customers are kept until the end of the game for scoring.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are two other kinds of cards: salty snacks and bar food. These can attract customers, and are kept between rounds to score you points at the end of the game. The players with the most of each will get points.<br/><br/>Once all three rounds have completed, the player with the most points has the most successful bar and is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle of La Rochelle 1372<br/><br/>A scenario for Lord of the Sea in which a Castilian fleet surprises an English fleet at a severe disadvantage near La Rochelle.<br/><br/>The Battle of La Rochelle was a naval battle fought on 22 and 23 June 1372 between a Castilian fleet commanded by the Castilian Almirant Ambrosio Boccanegra and an English convoy commanded by John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. The Castilian fleet had been sent to attack the English at La Rochelle, which was being besieged by the French. Besides Boccanegra, other Castilian commanders were Cabeza de Vaca, Fernando de Pe&oacute;n and Ruy D&iacute;az de Rojas.<br/><br/>Pembroke had been dispatched to the town with a small retinue of 160 soldiers, &pound;12,000 and instructions to use the money to recruit an army of 3,000 soldiers around Aquitaine for at least four months. The strength of the fleet is estimated as between the 12 galleys given by the Castilian chronicler and naval captain L&oacute;pez de Ayala and the 40 sailing ships, of which three ships were warships and 13 barges mentioned by the French chronicler Jean Froissart. Probably it consisted of 22 ships, mainly galleys and some naos (carracks) three- or four-masted ocean sailing ships. The English convoy probably consisted of 32 vessels and 17 small barges of about 50 tons.<br/><br/>The Castilian victory was complete and the entire convoy was captured. On his return to the Iberian Peninsula, Boccanegra seized another four English ships. This defeat undermined English seaborne trade and supplies and threatened their Gascon possessions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher and wikipedia<br/><br/>",

The English captured the French flagship and most of the supply vessels, forcing the rest of the French fleet to return to Calais.<br/><br/>The French fleet was attempting to bring supplies to Prince Louis, later King Louis VIII of France, whose French forces held London at that time. The English vessels attacked from windward, seizing Eustace's ship, making Robert and the knights prisoner and killing the rest of the crew.

Between 14 and 26 Castilian ships were captured, and several were sunk. Only two English vessels were sunk but there was significant loss of life. The battle was part of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.<br/><br/>English trade, war finance and ability to bring force to bear against France was heavily reliant on seaborne transportation, especially to its territory in Gascony. With its own ability to raise and support a fleet much reduced by English activities, the French hired Castilian ships to blockade English ports. Frustrated by their effectiveness, Edward III himself led the fleet which intercepted them and inflicted heavy losses.

        "description": "Golden Serpent is a deck building card battle game with a dark fantasy occult theme, where players take turns playing characters, relics, and spells to kill their opponent's leaders. Players take control of 1 or more of 3 dueling factions: the Pagan, the Chosen, or the Fallen, by constructing a deck prior to the start of the game. Each faction offers unique abilities and strategies to the game play. The game comes with a full playable set of all cards to choose from.<br/><br/>Each player will have 2 draw piles that make up their deck, preventing players from being flooded with card types they don't need as they can choose which to draw from: a character draw pile made entirely of character cards, and an arcana draw pile made up of relic and spell cards. Additionally each player must start the game with 1-3 leader cards in play, which each offer unique abilities that are unlocked as they level up by killing opposing characters. Players may have a mix of factions within their deck as long as the have a leader for each faction. Lastly a shared draw pile of immortal cards are set aside at the start of the game, containing 1 of each immortal card. Players are able to summon these powerful cards only by taking enemy characters prisoner during combat, and then waiting until their next turn to sacrifice the prisoner to the immortals.<br/><br/>Rather than using resource cards or counters, cards are played using a delayed purchase mechanic referred to as the cool down system. Cards are put into play expended (rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 0-3 times, representing the number of turns that must be waited for the card to be usable, as cards only cool down (rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise) once per turn automatically. Likewise, abilities and attacks require cards to expend 0-3 times when used. Players must manage when their cards are ready for use to make sure they aren't left open to attack. Each faction offers unique key abilities that let you cool down cards faster in different ways: the Pagan by drawing cards, the Chosen by attacking, and the Fallen by casting spells. Strategically utilizing these abilities is key to gaining advantage over opponents.<br/><br/>Golden Serpent takes place centuries after the Chosen conquered and thought to have exterminated the Pagans, ancient people who ritually worshiped the god of balance and the god of chaos (the Golden Serpent). When a group of Chosen missionaries stumble upon a crumbling Pagan temple housing an evil book left on earth by the Golden Serpent, the spirit of chaos is unleashed into the world and the Fallen faction is created. Now the few Pagan people left come out of hiding to stop the Fallen from summoning the Golden Serpent to earth, and war erupts between the 3 factions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The board has 200 squares descending to the bottom of the sea. Players take a counter and move around the numbered squares on the throw of a dice. On certain squares dangerous fish appear and players must follow the instructions. Other squares have a flavored Life Saver sweet which can save a players partner from a dangerous fish or a player can move 9 spaces if there is no partner.<br/><br/>First pair or single player to reach the treasure ship at square 200 is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is recorded in the National Archives of Australia, first registered in July 1930 with the author being a Colin McAlister trading as the McAlister Publicity Company.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pirates! miniature battles on the high seas<br/><br/>the rules allow you to recreate quick and exciting (and sometimes hilarious) naval battles using 25mm scale ships and miniature figures.  Besides these rules, we also manufacturer a large range of 25mm resin cast ships, both historical and fantastic, to go with our game.  There is nothing to keep you from using ships by other manufacturers, or even scratch building your own!<br/><br/>Many of our ship designs are based on Elizabethan era ships, prominent during the time of Sir Francis Drake and the Treasure Ships of Spain.  This allows us to utilize both sailed and oared vessels.  Our ancient ship designs are the result of painstaking research.  These 25mm ships are (very) roughly 10:1 scale to their historical counterparts as far as crew sizes, firepower and tonnages are concerned.<br/><br/>For those of you who appreciate fantasy wargaming, an entire section of this book has been packed with rules for fantasy races, magic, scrolls, sea monsters, etc.  We also make a range of fantasy submersibles, airships and Jules Verne-esque ironclads.  And, as if that weren't enough, we included construct rules so that you could build your own!<br/><br/>What's new in this version of Pirates!?  Most of the changes involve streamlining game play.  We got rid of rules that were seldom (if ever) used.  The crit charts have been reworked, and the old ramming rules have been completely scraped in favor of a newer, easier to use system.  The same can be said for the boarding and morale rules.  Some minor changes have been made to the weapon and crew stats.<br/><br/>The biggest change, however, is our inclusion of the Pirates! Ancients rules!  That's right, now you can have battles between ancient galleys!  We are working hard on releasing a range of ancient galleys, and the first model, the liburnium, should be available very soon.  We are really excited about this part, and hope you will be too!<br/><br/>What's Included?<br/><br/>The Pirates! 3rd Edition rules include:<br/><br/><br/>     Fourteen historical ship designs.<br/>     Seven fantasy ship designs.<br/>     Seventeen types of ordnance.<br/>     Rules for designing/using fortifications.<br/>     Rules for creating your own creatures and constructs.<br/>     Eleven historical races.<br/>     Twelve fantasy races.<br/>     Dozens of spells and magic items.<br/>     The rules for PIRATES! ANCIENTS!<br/><br/><br/>Pirates! 3rd Edition has the historical accuracy to recreate epic historical events such as the Armada Campaign or the Battle of Lepanto, while having the flexibility to let you wargame in your favorite fantasy universe.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The basic game play of Pirates! hasn't changed since first edition.  Before each turn, every captain writes orders for his ship(s).  This is done on our handy-dandy orders sheet, and is very quick easy to do. Orders are written for speed and general direction of movement, for changing sail settings, raising or lowering anchor, and moving crew and ordnance.  If you are playing a fantasy game, then you write orders for which spell your navigator will cast, if any.  You do not write orders for ordnance or small arms fire, since that is all done as the opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>After all orders are written, the wind is checked for, to see if it changes direction or speed, or if something more... dramatic happens!  Movement takes place immediately afterwards, with the fastest ship going first, followed by the second fastest, etc.<br/><br/>Ordnance fire is the next phase, and every captain places a splash marker for each ordnance fired to indicate his desired target.  Ranges are guessed, shots adjusted and all results worked out simultaneously.  The same is then done for small arms.<br/><br/>Crew are then allowed to move about, and boarding actions and other melee takes place.  The turn ends with the repairs phase, where crew may attempt to repair damage to their ships, put out fires, etc.<br/><br/>One of the things that has made Pirates! such a huge success throughout its various editions is the fact that play is simultaneous, so all players are getting to do something all the time!  This makes it ideal for game clubs, conventions or friends who want to play a game as a group.  An interesting &quot;side effect&quot; if this is that you can easily play a game where it's every man for himself!  We have run games with up to 30 players at once, and everyone gets to have a good time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Second in the Matchbox Series by The Daniel Zayas Company, Gunpowder &amp; Gold is loosely based on an older Russian card game, Durak.<br/><br/>Players take the roles of aspiring pirates looking to make a name for themselves by attacking other pirates and collecting Legend Cards.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 6 Attack Cards, with the dealer being the first attacking pirate. Remaining Attack Cards are placed in a draw pile. The attacking pirate chooses a defending pirate and plays an Attack Card. The defender can play a higher matching suit Attack Card, play a no-suit defense card, or accept the attack. If the attack is defended, the attacking player or any other player can launch up to 6 attacks total against the defending player, or with as many cards as the defender has, whichever is fewer.<br/><br/>Upon a successful attack by any player, the battle ends. The lead attacking pirate may look at two Legend Cards and select one, while the other attacking pirates may only draw one Legend Card. Alternatively, attacking players may choose to draw up to two Attack Cards (as able) or destroy a revealed Legend Card instead. There are different kinds of Legend Cards, and a player may only ever hold one of each type of Legend Card. If ever a player draws a Legend Card matching what they own, that player secretly discards this card to the Legend deck.<br/><br/>After the battle, all Attack Cards played against the defender will enter the defender's hand regardless of the outcome.  The defender's cards will enter the bottom of the Attack Card deck face-down. The defending pirate will be the attacker in the next attack.<br/><br/>Between attacks, players may choose to reveal Legend Cards, which, in addition to furthering the win condition, will give them a significant upgrade to their actions and firepower. However, showing a Legend Card opens the possibility that another player will choose to destroy their Legend Card versus collecting one of their own. Knowing when to show a Legend Card and when to rely on your hand is paramount to winning a game of Gunpowder &amp; Gold.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, money in the bank can be lost if a bank run occurs. Money stored in your vault is secure the rest of the game, however, it can not earn you interest.<br/><br/>Each round, players who choose to put money in their vault (PANIC), increase the odds of a bank run occurring, putting players bank currency at risk. The more players that panic, the higher the odds of a bank run.<br/><br/>Winning Conditions<br/>You win the game by getting more money than other players stashed in your vault.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

With minimal tweaking, it could be used for other battles between Europeans and natives on the American continent from the abandonment of the pike to the arrival of the rifled musket.<br/><br/>The game has an order-based activation system which allows enemy interruptions, and elegant firing and melee mechanics that resolve the entire attack by picking multiples (doubles, triples &amp;c) out of each attack roll. The &quot;Disorder&quot; based morale system integrates personal and force level morale to produce believable results with no more book-keeping than a d6.<br/><br/>The rules as written are for models from 15mm to 28mm - halving or doubling ranges will give good games in smaller or larger scales. An average-sized game takes about two hours once you know the rules, and large games can still be finished in an evening. If you are playing a large game, you may want to invest in a few counters to mark the use of initiative orders.<br/><br/>Morningstar's Tactical Two Pager games are a series of simple but engaging games filled with fun and flavour.

The &quot;Panic&quot; based morale system integrates personal and force level morale to produce believable results with no book-keeping.<br/><br/>The rules as written are for models from 15mm to 28mm - halving or doubling ranges will give good games in smaller or larger scales. An average-sized game takes about an hour, and large games can still be finished in an evening. If you are playing a large game, you may want to get a few easily differentiated pairs of d6 to help move things along.<br/><br/>Morningstar's Tactical Two Pager games are a series of simple but engaging games filled with fun and flavour. Each one takes up only two sides of easy-to-print A4, eliminating the need for a quick reference sheet and providing our players with a cheap source of entertainment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players represent the allies fighting against Japanese. The countries are the U.S.A, Britain, Australia and the Dutch East Indies (which had been captured in 1942). The board has a central map of Japan and Tokyo marked. Japan is surrounded by the 4 allies at a distant of 500 miles (measured in 50 mile incremental sea lanes).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to reach Tokyo with your fighter aircraft. Each player has 4 cutout planes and uses a spinner to advance closer to Tokyo. The cardboard spinner has the numbers 50, 100, 150 or 200, representing miles a fighter will fly towards Tokyo along the sea lanes. The spinner also has a red plane that represents a Japanese fighter and black plane which is an Allied fighter. If a player spins the red plane it sends his fighter back one space and he can't proceed until he spins the black plane. If it is repeated the player loses his fighter but can regain it by spinning the black plane. The first to reach Tokyo with all 4 fighters is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The National Football Game is an early example of the uniquely Australian game of Australian rules football. Made by the National Game Company in 1900 the game is loosely based on an Australian rules football match.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for a player to score a goal by moving a marker (football) along a players path using the roll of a dice.<br/><br/>The game begins with the marker (the football) in the center of the board and players take turns to move the ball towards their goal on the roll of the dice. Each players progress is along a path and the goals are in each corner of the board. The next player rolls the dice and moves the ball back towards the center and can then begin along their path towards their goal. Players can have an extra throw of the dice on certain space (i.e. Free kick and behind) or by throwing a 6. To score a goal the player must throw the exact number by the dice to land on the goal.<br/><br/>Recorded in the National Archives of Australia dated 1900. Several versions are known to exist. The most common type is mounted on a square board. A much rarer smaller rectangular board version also exists. <br/>Updates were continually made. For example, on the rectangular board the South Melbourne Football club is represented with a red and white hooped guernsey which was worn from 1897 to 1904. The Geelong team also shows hooped sleeves that were worn between 1902 - 1904, suggestion this version was dated between 1902 to 1904.<br/>The Square board version shows the South Melbourne Football club with a red sash, Melbourne Football club with a Red central strip and Fitzroy Football club with a Maroon and light yellow Guernsey. These football Guernsey's were all worn in 1907. In 1912 numbers were added to the back of football guernseys which is not evident with these early versions of the game.<br/>A third version of the game shows superimposed photos of Footballers over the background. St.Kilda football team now replaces Essendon as the side playing South Melbourne. The St.Kilda geurnsey has long black sleeves which were worn between 1924 to 1932, suggesting this was probably the last version of this game. <br/>National games produced another Football game called 'Out Great Game' but this was probably near the end or after 'The National Football Game'. 'Our Great Game' is listed elsewhere on BGG.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The judge listens to all arguments, then completes the round by telling a story that explains who wins and how.

        "description": "Day of Battle - the Middle Ages Fun, Fast and Furious. Historical Rules for the Medieval Era<br/><br/>The game mechanisms in Day of Battle are designed to give a game that has the feeling of the period, not just the battle.  Like most published games of the past and present, Day of Battle: the Middle Ages can be played as standalone game where players setup a game, have a great time and then pack up and move on. <br/> To gamers just starting out in the hobby this is great, but it isn&rsquo;t too long before they yearn for a campaign.  In a campaign game you can truly prove who you are and how good you can be.  Ah, <br/>but campaigns can be a black hole.<br/><br/>The Player as a Character<br/><br/>Day of Battle attempts to satisfy the desire to play in a campaign but does it in an easy and enjoyable way.  As mentioned earlier, you are a general referred to as a Warlord.  Borrowing from our role-play cousins, your Warlord has a number of skills and attributes that make him who he is on the battlefield.  During the actual battle you acquire honor points whenever you perform actions appropriate to your Warlord.  At the end of the battle, win or lose, you total up your honor points and turn them into skill points.  As these accumulate, you spend them on your Warlords skills and attributes to make him better and more powerful.  Gain enough skill points and you have a chance to climb the social ladder and become a higher-ranking noble.<br/><br/>A Solo and Multiplayer Game<br/><br/>Each battle you play with Day of Battle is based on the social rank of your Warlord.  The higher the social rank, the bigger and better the army your Warlord summons.  In a campaign, the better your army, the better your chances of winning.  This campaign system is unique in that it doesn&rsquo;t require a map, an umpire, or even other players.  The fog of war in the game system is so good that you can play a game against yourself and not know which side will win, and if both survive then both will win.  You would truly have to cheat to trick the game.  Mind you, it is always more enjoyable playing with other gamers.  I run a campaign with six different Warlords that I have created and play them randomly against each other.  When first time gamer friends come over to play, I have them play one of my Warlords.  Such games are fast.  Games between new Warlords are over in an hour or so, which allows for multiple games in one sitting.<br/><br/>Army Creation &amp; Feudalism<br/><br/>The army creation mechanism is based on a loose interpretation of the history of times but designed to be fast, fun and unpredictable.  A Warlord and army can be created on paper with a deck of playing cards and a handful of six sided dice in 10 minutes.  There is little math involved and unlike most point system games, you have very little control over your army.  The size of your army is based on the social rank and household of your Warlord. The units that arrive at the &ldquo;summons&rdquo; are based loosely on the Domain (army) you are playing and of course a little bit of luck.  You draw playing cards to determine how many army points you have which then determine the number of units that arrive and then roll dice to determine what troop type they are.  You can promote the morale, armor and training of some of your units with the number of promotions available based on your social rank.  With this unknown in mind, retainer units must be chosen wisely &mdash; and then go hire some mercenaries!<br/><br/>In summary for a new look wargaming the medieval era try Day of Battle.  It will give you an experience you have never had before.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each basic hull has a number of available &quot;space&quot; points, which can be spent on weapons, sensors, armor, or extras like aircraft, catapults and smoke generators.<br/><br/>Combat:<br/><br/>Shipyard has a unique combat system, aimed at simplicity and a dose of realism. Fog of war and communication are represented: Ships start the game inactive, steaming forwards until they detect the enemy. Once they become active, they can send messages and orders to other ships, and begin to move and attack as they wish. Rules for Gunnery, Torpedoes, Air attacks and defense, submarines, depth charges, evasive action and much more are provided, allowing for a fun yet fairly accurate rendition of WW2 naval combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The clever elves agree to give Mr. Troll some of what they caught, but only if he can guess what it is. Can they keep him guessing long enough to sneak across the bridge or will Mr. Troll take everything?<br/><br/>In Trick Mr. Troll, 1-3 elves (usually children) work together to get across the bridge while Mr. Troll (usually a parent) tries to stop them. Every round, each elf hides a single fish, frog, or turtle token in their hand and Mr. Troll tries to guess what it is. If his guess is correct, Mr. Troll collects the token. If his guess is incorrect, the elf pawn moves across the bridge.

The game is packaged in a wrapped sleeve, made of Japanese paper. The chips are stored in the back side of the boards.<br/><br/>The three boards are arranged in a line. The players place two chips each from their supply in the centre, one player using the marked side.<br/><br/>Taking turns, a player either places a chip on the board, looking to attack as in Reversi, by flipping opponent's chips. Or a player may discard a chip and move one of the three boards around (a disturbance), thus causing an attack.<br/><br/>By taking an end board, for example, the player can place it at right angles, making an L-shape. This puts one of their pieces outside their opponent's, causing an attack.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player runs out of chips. The other player gets a final turn. Then the players get a point for each chip they have on the board, plus a point for each chip left in hand (not discards). The player with the most points wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Font HUNT is a Japanese game made in collaboaration with a Japanese font foundry, Fontworks Co. Ltd. In the same way that European language fonts come in different designs (Times New Roman, Gill Sans) and different styles and weights (Gothic, Bold), many fonts are also designed for the Japanese alphabet Hiragana. Fontworks produced a popular commercial font called 筑紫 (Chikushi), which is then produced in various styles and weights.<br/><br/>The game uses a set of tiles which only show a single character あ (A). The tiles are all varied though, because of the variations in the different Chikushi fonts used.<br/><br/>The game Font HUNT comes in three different foil packs. A pack holds 12 tiles with 6 different fonts.<br/><br/>Each pack can be used for the basic game, and each pack has its own game variant. The basic FONTHUNT (フォントハント) game requires players to identify specific tiles by describing certain aspects of the font. &quot;Huh? It sticks out here?&quot; &quot;A little thick here?&quot; &quot;A little bent?&quot; &quot;A little round!&quot;. Players can co-operate to try to discover which tile is being described, or have tiles in hand and try to have the other players work out which they hold. The game is intended to be more of an exasperating fun exploration of the nature of fonts, than a competitive challenge.<br/><br/>筑紫ゴシック 青 (Chikushi Gothic Blue) has a blue badge, and the game Font IMPRINT (フォントインプリント).<br/>筑紫明朝 黄 (Chikushi Mincho Yellow) has a yellow badge, and the game Font TONE (フォントトーン).<br/>筑紫書体MIX 緑 (Chikushi typeface MIX) has a green badge, and the game Font MIMIC (フォントミミック).<br/><br/>In Font IMPRINT, players conveys the impression of a font by using similies: &quot;This A looks like Asaoka!&quot; &quot;This A looks like Amoeba!&quot; <br/>In Font TONE, players have to imply the font by use of the tone of their voice.<br/>In Font MIMIC, players have to use hand and body gestures instead of words.<br/><br/>The packs are normally sold separately (quite cheaply), but the publisher has sold them at the Tokyo Game market in a bundle with a bonus set of new tiles.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Each tile has a number of paths, and each branch has a number from 1 to 9.<br/><br/>The players put a starting tile on the edge and a central tile in the middle of the next. Each player draws a tile and tries to place it such that paths join.<br/><br/>Players are trying to place tiles so that the connecting numbers add up to 10. If a player can do this, they say &quot;Thank you! 2+8=10&quot; (or whatever the sum is). But if a player cannot make a connection add to 10, they are not penalised.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to connect their starting tile on the outside of the board to the central tile.<br/><br/>The designers suggest an alternate for children who cannot add up, so that they need only have numbers match when played.<br/><br/>Alternately, they suggest you play the game in a terrible windstorm.<br/><br/>",

Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles.<br/><br/>Beyond the Monolith aims to separate the game core engine and the universes in which the game will be played. For that purpose, the &quot;Core Box&quot; is  not a full game playable by itself but a core game set that include only a basic ruleset and all common components (dices, tokens, ...).<br/><br/>You will need to combine it with an &quot;universe&quot; that will supply the theme, the specific rules, the campaigns, the miniatures and tiles, the maps.<br/>Monolith will provide two way to get universes :<br/><br/>     Universe Products : contains everything needed for an universe (ex : Conan, Batman : Gotham City Chronicles, Lord of the ring) <br/>     Second Life Products : provide extra components to play &quot;Beyond the Monolith&quot; with an existing miniature game universe [you will need to have or proxy this game miniatures to play] (ex : Zombicide, Cthulhu wars)<br/><br/><br/>",

The contents of each box can be seamlessly combined with other boxes to offer players  greater variety, and plans include multiple expansions to be produced later.<br/><br/>Instead of dice, the Champions Combat System&trade; uses a unique and intuitive card-based system to resolve combat. The use of cards rewards strategic thinking and careful resource management, while providing  each champion with a unique playstyle that captures their abilities and personality. The Champions Combat System&trade; provides strategic depth without sacrificing intuitiveness, and a new player can learn to play in only a few minutes.

        "description": "Eagle Troop at the Battle of Easting 73 is a scenario for Modern Armor<br/><br/>The Battle of 73 Easting erupted about halfway through the brief land phase of the Gulf War. American armored forces had entered Iraq and pivoted to unhinge the enemy&rsquo;s defenses inside Kuwait. Facing them was what appeared to be a well-trained and well prepared enemy - the elite Republican Guard.<br/><br/>The Republican Guard was dug in, defending the territory it trained in often. The Coalition forces were strung out, navigating by compass and GPS. Fog, sandstorms and &ldquo;oil rain&rdquo; confused the picture on the battlefield. All of this, on paper, should have given the Iraqis a  fighting chance. Instead, by the end of the 26th of February, 1991, the best they had to offer had been annihilated.<br/><br/>This scenario recreates the historical battle. Variants allow you to explore what would have happened if the Iraqis had been better prepared, luckier, or better trained.<br/><br/>This scenario contains:<br/><br/>     Historical information on units and deployment suitable for use with any micro-armor system.<br/>     Unit statistics and scenario rules for Modern Armor<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Breaking Ball is a Sports themed game based on one of the Irish National Sports - Gaelic Football. It is a card and dice game with an emphasis on tactical use of your team players throughout a game.<br/><br/>Each team has 15 'players' in various positions throughout the playing pitch from Goalkeeper to Full Forwards. It follows the proper rules of Gaelic Football.<br/><br/>Each team tries to win possession of the football and beat their opponent in that 'zone' of the playing field before passing the ball via various attacking cards, while their opponent tries to intercept the ball by counteracting their moves with their defending cards.<br/><br/>Once a player gets past their opponent and successfully  moves the ball through the playing field zones into their attacking half of the field they can attempt to shoot for a point from long range (using dice, the further out harder it is to score) or they can try and work their way in to shoot for a goal or an easy point, whilst their opponent tries to dispossess them of the ball (by means of card moves). A goal represents 3 points and a point is, well 1 point! (a point in Gaelic Football is kicking the ball over the crossbar and much easier to accomplish than scoring a goal).<br/><br/>Players can get yellow carded and red cards sent off - there are star players on each team with added skills and the tactical element of how you deploy your players can have a big impact on the outcome.<br/><br/>Its a 2 player game (2 teams) but players do join together to manage a team against other opponents.<br/><br/>Tactics is a big part of the game and how you deploy your team and counteract your opponents star players will have a bearing on the outcome.<br/><br/>So game play follows the rules to move up and down the field as each player tries to work their way into a possible scoring zone.<br/><br/>Play in a real game lasts 30 minutes per half but players can decide a time limit. The winner is the player with the highest combined score (goals and points) at the end of the allotted time.<br/><br/>",

Those cities will have space (hangars) for small plane tokens.  Above the connection line will be flight times, which are spaces for tokens to claim to be able to fly the route.  Below the connection line will be space for passenger tokens to be placed, showing demand for the route.<br/><br/>When you buy a plane you will receive a small plane board with a number of seats available for passenger tokens to fit into, as well as tracks next to the plane showing fuel status and amenities level this plane is at.  In addition, you will have tokens to indicate seats that are upgraded to first class seats, providing more income on your flight.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Easy to introduce to new players yet a satisfying and complete game for even the most battle tested World War II gamer.<br/><br/>This section requires a copy of Combat Command - the Basic Game to use.<br/><br/>As an added bonus this packet also includes Saint Lo to the Siegfried line a set of Army Lists covering July to November 1944.  These lists allow players to recreate historical Battlegroups in evenly matched battles.  In addition a section covers how to create well balanced battles based on actual historical match ups.  This section can be used with virtually any platoon based system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Our goal with Brigadier General was to provide a fun and simple game with the ability to cover battles both real and imagined from 1931 to 1958. This is not a complicated game to produce historical results, but rather a simple game with a World War II setting . Remember when reading as well playing our game, to look upon them from the viewpoint of a solo wargamer.<br/><br/>We do not define ground &amp; time scales in our games, instead we opt for what feels right on the table. Brigadier General uses blocks of troops which we call elements vice individual soldiers. Normally elements of troops in Brigadier General equate to a military company or depending on the game/scenario sometimes a battalion. However they can be scaled to suit any battle. Given the constraints in game, each player force would approximate a brigade, combat command or regimental team, hence our game&rsquo;s name.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players have to work with each other based on their own knowledge and input. As well as bringing the events and spirit of the Reformation closer to the body and bringing it to life, the game provides an excellent team building and community experience, and can therefore be an excellent tool for communication and networking.<br/><br/>The cards contain information on one side of the question and the question itself, and the answer on the other side, with details of the sources. The cards also indicate the degree of difficulty of the question, with three grades to distinguish between the more well-known, the more difficult, and the abstract. Logistore can be played in pairs or groups, with a trained referee moderator in the group.

General Mahler of Marshall Ney's VI Corps is ordered to the south bank of the Danube.  The general is faced by Austrians under the command of Baron D'Aspre who are positioned on the opposite bank of the Danube and are well supported.  Mahler splits his force into three groups and attempts to take the three bridges in the area.  His main force has no success in getting across the Danube in the center of his line, but they do capture the Baron and put his force into the dark with lesser leadership.

        "description": "This battle is the First Contact of the Ulm campaign.  It set the tone for the entire campaign and gave the French an immense boost of confidence.  Napoleon has ordered his Advance Guard, consisting of part of Murat's Reserve Cavalry and Lannes' Vth Corps, to begin the swing around to the south and east of Ulm, in order to cut off Mack from Vienna.  Mack, being a bit in the dark about the French maneuvers, sent a force under Baron Auffenberg, to determine where the French were.  The Baron's force marched into a very bad situation where his troops, mostly grenadiers, was seriously outnumbered.  A member of the French Impaerial Staff, General Kellerman, happened to be forward with the troops.  He saw a small group of Austrians in the town of Hohenreichen and ordered the Dragoons he was with the dismount and clear out the Austrians.

Rampant Sun uses a d6 dice pool vs. a target number to resolve most actions and mechanics.  Failure to activate moves play between players.  <br/>The game moves quickly and rapidly. If you are familiar with Rampant Stars, Lion Rampant, or Rampant Hordes you will have a core understanding of how these rules function.<br/><br/>Victory in Rampant Sun focuses on completing mission objectives.  These are randomly generated prior to the game and come complete with twists and turns to make every gaming experience unique.  In addition, the rules have campaign rules for linking game results together into a larger campaign.<br/><br/>Rampant Sun is ideal for experienced gamers and new players getting their feet wet.  Speed and ease of play were the priorities in the design process without sacrificing decision making.  In Rampant Sun models do not always perform exactly as intended so the &quot;Friction of War&quot; will force players to react accordingly.<br/><br/>Enjoy your Sci-Fi adventures with Rampant Sun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rounds are played with each Player acting simultaneously. Each round has three phases: Playing Action cards(and Target cards for 3+ players) face down; revealing cards and determining hits; and finally, rolling and gaining Pain.  Whenever a player is hit by an attack they gain 1d6 of Pain. When a Player's Pain value meets or exceeds their Pain Limit, that Player is knocked out. When all but one Player has been knocked out, that Player wins the game! <br/>1 V 1 Duel <br/>All games of ThrowDown eventually end up here, but some games start out here. <br/>When down to just two Players, they each start the game with only the Leg Sweep, Uppercut, and Bodyslam cards in hand. Players take their turns at the same time. For each round, the Players choose an Action Card and place it face down on the table. When both Players have placed their Action cards, they reveal them at the same time. The Actions are compared to determine which player hits. That Player rolls 1d6 and the other player gains that much pain. Then the cards go back to their players hands for the next round.<br/><br/>3 or more Player Throwdown<br/>Throwdown can be played with as many Players as you have cards for! With 3 or more Players, each plays with one of each Action Card in their hand, as well as a Target card for each player other than themselves. <br/>Rounds play out in the same 3 phases mentioned above and outlined here: <br/>Choose your action and which Player you&rsquo;re going to Target, then place the chosen Action Card and Target card face down in front of you. When all players have done this, move to phase 2.<br/>Everyone reveals their choices at the same time. Figure out who is targeting who, whether any moves are negated by its counter-move, and note any defensive Actions. <br/>If a Player has chosen the Dodge action and two or more attacks have targeted that Player, the dodging Player chooses one of the attacks targeting them to be negated.<br/>Any attack Actions (Leg Sweep, Bodyslam, Uppercut) that haven&rsquo;t been negated score a hit! Those Players each roll 1d6 and inflict that much Pain on their Target. The Targets track the Pain they&rsquo;ve gained on their Pain Limit trackers [or a d20 if ya nasty ;) ]<br/>If two Players target each other with the same attack Action, they both roll 1d6, whoever rolls higher inflicts Pain on the other equal to the difference of the dice values. If the dice are a tie, neither Player gains any Pain.<br/>    Then all Players return their Actions and Target cards to their hands, and those who still haven&rsquo;t reached their Pain Limit proceed to the next round. Rounds continue until one Player is left.<br/><br/>Action Cards<br/>Leg Sweep = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Uppercut Attacks targeting this Player<br/><br/>Bodyslam = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Leg Sweep Attacks targeting this Player<br/><br/>Uppercut = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Bodyslam Attacks targeting this Player<br/>(1 vs 1 style play only uses these three cards for each Player&rsquo;s hand.)<br/><br/>Guard = Cause no Pain and take half Pain from ALL  attacks targeting you this round.<br/><br/>Dodge= Cause no Pain, and also avoid Pain from ONE attack of your choice, targeting you this round.<br/>    <br/>Guard and Dodge actions do not use a Target card, but for the game to work you still need to play a Target card when playing either of these Action cards. If you don&rsquo;t play the Target card, the other Players will know that you are not using an attack Action.     <br/>Example 1: Player 1 plays a Bodyslam and Player 2 plays a Leg Sweep targeting Player 1; this resolves with Player 1 rolling to dole out 1d6 of Pain and Player 2&rsquo;s attack being negated. <br/>        <br/>Example 2: Player 1 and Player 2 each Target each other with Uppercut. Both Players roll 1d6. Player 1 rolls a five, Player 2 rolls a two. Player 1 will inflict three(five minus two) Pain on Player 2<br/><br/>Target Cards:    A set of cards in each Player's hand that they use to pick their targets in a 3+ Throwdown. Target cards will have a single number on one side. Players will have a Target card in their hand for each opponent. During the first phase of each round, a Player lays down a target Card with the same number as the Player they are wanting to attack. The Target card with their own Player number on it goes face up in front of that Player, for the duration of the game, as a visual reminder of which number is used to Target them. Normally Players don&rsquo;t hold on to the Target Card with their own Player Number on it. No real sense in targeting and inflicting pain on yourself.<br/><br/>Pain Trackers And Player Tokens: Players use the Pain trackers with Player Tokens to keep track of the Pain Value. Players Start the game with the tokens on 0 and as they accrue more pain they move their Player Token up the Pain Tracker.<br/><br/>1d6 per Player for Pain rolling<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (updated 1/26/23)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On April 24th, 1778 along The North Channel between Ireland and Scotland --Captain John Paul Jones of the USS Ranger set out to seize and capture a Royal Navy ship just outside the town of Carrickfergus. That ship was the HMS Drake, captained by George Burden. Jones immediately had the upper hand, in both firepower and maneuverability. The Ranger was built as a warship while the Drake was simply a merchant ship outfitted with 4-pound cannons. Not to mention, Jones had the upper hand in knowledge of the enemy ship, given to him by an area local Lieut.Dobbs. During the ensuing attack, the Ranger inflicted devastating damage to her opponent--killing its captain in the process. <br/>The ships fought in close range combat, but never close enough for boarding actions. In the end, Jones succeeded in capturing the Drake and as a result, gained international fame.<br/><br/>North Channel is a simple table-top &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; wargame of ship-to-ship combat for two players. <br/>One player will take on the role of the American ship the USS Ranger, while the other takes on the role of the HMS Drake. <br/>The American player will have the upper hand with higher firepower, a larger crew, and a sturdier hull (as it was historically). <br/>The British player will have to be smart (and lucky) in order to outmaneuver their enemy, and not succumb to the USS Ranger.<br/><br/>Will you be able to change history?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The reality is, the entire war wasn't a giant siege. Early in the war and later as well, the first world war was truly a war of manure and fluidity, many other fronts such as the eastern front and the middle east continued to be much more fluent then the western front. This scenario can be used to represent any meeting engagement at any period of the war.<br/><br/>This is a great scenario for playing pickup games or even tournament games.<br/><br/>",

No one knows who is guilty until the very end, and players have to make up excuses, relationships and alibis in order to not become the criminal.<br/><br/>The Detective asks the suspects questions so they can get to the bottom of who-done-it. Suspects have to think on their feet, while making sure they don't contradict their own narrative and attract the Detective's attention.<br/><br/>When Suspects draw the attention of the Detective by saying something strange or inconsistent, they can play cards from their hand as Alibis. These cards act as hard-evidence, solidifying their story and diminishing the Detective's suspicions.<br/><br/>Suspects can also use these cards offensively, accusing other Suspects of acting suspiciously, and turning the gaze of the Detective away from themselves.

        "description": "Based upon GT Publishing's Commit the Garde! rules for Napoleonic warfare, <br/>Sound the Charge! is intended to simulate battles of the American Civil War on the grandest of scales.  Based upon the Napoleonic rules Commit the Garde! entire epic battles are represented in Sound the Charge!  No longer must the players extrapolate the results of the entire battle of Gettysburg based upon their game&rsquo;s recreation of the fight for Devil&rsquo;s Den or Cemetery Ridge.  <br/>Players represent the highest level leaders in any given battle and as such make the decisions that will shape the entire battle.  Gone are the minutiae which their historical counterparts left to their subordinates, your focus is on your army&rsquo;s brigades, not on the battalions and squadrons.<br/><br/>Decisions made by lower level officers are abstracted into the mechanics of the game, players should understand that there is someone at the lower level who should be taking care of those details (spacing of battalions and squadrons, deployment of skirmishers, sighting of artillery sections, availability of spare ammunition, etc.).  Like it or not the real commanders had to trust subordinates to do their duty well.  Often these abstract subordinates will make mistakes (represented by bad dice rolls), whether or not your subordinate&rsquo;s failure is catastrophic to your plan will depend on the allowances you have made for that possibility. This of course is a good reason to have plenty of reserves available.<br/><br/>And speaking of reserves, the most unique aspect of Sound the Charge! is the use of off-table reserves.  No longer can your opponent see the deployment of your entire army.  The location of your reserves is not determined until you commit them to the battle, at which time you place them where you want them (with limitations based upon distance from your Army HQ and proximity of enemy forces).  The skill of your army commander and staff determine how effectively you can commit your reserves.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex-grid map; the reason for this is to remove the ambiguities of &ldquo;free movement&rdquo; common to most miniature rules.  With hexes there is no doubt about a unit&rsquo;s location, it&rsquo;s facing, and what the range is to any other unit on the battlefield.  The intent with this approach is to make this a game/simulation of decisions, not of inches.<br/><br/>Sound the Charge! includes two introductory scenarios, Manassas where the fledgling armies learned to fight, and Champion Hill where Grant completed the encirclement of Vicksburg.  Complete scenario briefings, orders of battle, maps and unit labels for these scenarios are included with the rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This scenario set includes the historical scenario where the fort was largely damaged but flooding before the attack, as well as a &ldquo;what if&rsquo; scenario where the Confederate defenders are not hampered by flooding, and may even have the support of their own gunboats.  This scenario file includes two record sheets for Fort Henry, one for Fort Heiman, and record sheets for another 7 Union and 3 Confederate vessels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "My previous ruleset Dreadnoughts At Dawn reproduced large capital ship engagements in or around the 1st world war. It did not deal with aircraft or submarines, and focused on the larger capital ships.<br/><br/>Carrier Strike at Dawn has a number of different &quot;Mission types&quot;, one of which is large surface ship combat in daylight, there are changes from WW1 but not that many.<br/><br/>The most important and innovative missions though involve aircraft carriers and long range carrier combat, there are a number of options here, pure carrier combat such as Midway etc, or combined operations where carriers and surface combatants are engaged in the same battle though the carriers are likely to be in a separate task force than the surface combatants.<br/><br/>Getting this part of the rules right has been very difficult but I believe I have got it as good as I can get it.<br/><br/>As per DaD I propose utilising 1:3000th or 1:2400 scale models for the ships and personally I use 1:600 scale aircraft for the air wings, whilst each model ship represents 1 ship, a model aircraft represents a flight of 4 aircraft. This still means the larger carriers will have around 20 model aircraft assigned to them and we have happily played a game to completion in a normal gaming night with 2 or even 3 carriers per side.<br/><br/>For such large air wings the aircraft are forced to attack in waves.<br/><br/>There are simple and fun mechanisms for the carriers spotting aircraft to spot and track enemy carrier fleets, rather than a clever dice mechanism each player writes down a number between 1 and 10, this is where their fleet is &quot;hiding&quot; and then try to guess their opponents number.  Whilst not materially different than rolling a dice it adds an atmosphere of suspense and fun as players try to guess where the other players carriers are hiding.<br/><br/>There is also a mission based on north sea convoys that involve wolf packs of submarines hunting merchantmen and their escorts, the wolf packs may be assisted by land based aircraft and or surface raiders whilst the convoy may have an escort carrier assigned for air defense<br/><br/>To avoid complexity the rules for each mission type are put together and duplicated where necessary, so for example if it is a night time cruiser action mission you don't need rules for air combat, if it is a carrier V carrier action you don't need rules for surface combat as the opposing fleets never come within 100 miles of each other, etc.<br/><br/>Whilst all ships from destroyers to super dreadnoughts are represented the emphasis is on capital ships, escorts are covered in a simplified way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All the movement orders and damage keeping is carried out by custom markers on the board.<br/><br/>I have found that naval games are either too complicated to be fun or so abstracted as to have no atmosphere of realism about them at all. I wanted to do my best attempt at getting the balancing act between realism and complexity right for me. These rules are not &ldquo;better&rdquo; than anyone else's they just reflect my take on the period.<br/><br/>When I play tested them at my local club &ldquo;Wargames Association of Reading&rdquo; in the UK, I was pleasantly surprised how well they worked and how well received they were. I have written many rules before but never gone to the extent of publishing them before.<br/>As my primary aim is to enjoy the hobby rather than become a publishing millionaire, I have tried to keep the cost of these rules as low as practical.<br/><br/>The initial rules cover British and German ships in the north sea, any additions to these rules or this list will be free of charge to registered purchasers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

None of the spreadsheets are protected, details can be changed if you wish and when creating your own army lists just copy one of the existing sheets closest to the army you want and modify a few values.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be played with 28mm models though 15mm can be used without changing any of the ranges. Smaller figures I suggest halving all distances.<br/><br/>I don't want you to waste your hard earned money on a set of rules you don't like so i have created a free sample of the rules which include about 10 pages of the rules and some of the army lists.

As the batter you pick your batting style card but hide it from the opponent.  You roll four colored dice to prepare for the pitch and then determine the amount of dice to adjust your swing and for power based on your batting style.  You can then roll dice to adjust the swing to match the pitch.  If you match you get a HIT and then determine how much power you put into the swing.  The power determines how far into the field the ball travels.  When there is a HIT, the opponent must place his player&rsquo;s &ldquo;up to 5 dice&rdquo; on the field in zones to see if they make the out. <br/>You can play a full game solo against an A.I. Bot or 2-player.  All the same rules apply to actual game of baseball with pitching, hitting and fielding but I removed balls and strikes to speed up play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Lead from the front and be rewarded.. or shot from your horse.<br/><br/>Combat uses a single-roll mechanic: Roll a pool of dice (typically 3-4) and check each die for results.<br/><br/>That single roll will tell you everything you need to know, without any additional rolls required: Is the enemy in Disarray? Being pushed back? Taking losses? One roll.<br/><br/>Finally the rules offer simple campaign rules, options to help you set up creative scenarios and a standard &quot;meeting engagement&quot; battle plan you can use to set up.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Second Kharkov Campaign is a pair of Pint Sized campaigns for the TooFatLardies rule set Chain of Command. These platoon level scenarios are perfectly usable for other rule sets and provided the necessary information to make adjustments.<br/><br/>The first campaign covers the initial Soviet attack on German lines in May 12th of 1942. It follows the advance of the Soviet 38th Tank Brigade and the 226th Rifle Division in their attack on the German 294th Infantry Division which was blocking the main roads leading to the city of Kharkov. The campaign has seven scenarios and involves British Lend-Lease tanks. The entire campaign spans a single day of this battle where the Soviets made significant gains and in many cases broke the German lines.<br/><br/>The second campaign covers the German counterattack on May 13th of 1942. Having released the armored divisions that were being held in reserves, the German 3rd Panzer Division pushed up from Kharkov and cut through a number of Soviet units. This campaign has six separate scenarios and covers the time from the 13th to the 16th of May 1942. This campaign has scenarios that may be played out with the What A Tanker rule set as well due to their armor heavy nature.<br/><br/>The third campaign in this book is a What A Tanker Campaign. This allows the player to create a map based campaign to move their forces in a kriegspiel type manner until their forces make contact, then play out the scenario using the What A Tanker rules.<br/><br/>Lastly, the book provides some sketches of other units and actions that can be used to create your own campaigns with. The maps are based on period maps from German and Soviet armies. Each scenario has a game map and a picture of the table that I used to game these out.<br/><br/>The PDF comes out to 105 pages and includes a short history of the campaigns to provide the player with a background on the action that they are fighting.<br/><br/>",

Whenever a unit tries to perform an action, its score is rolled against. Failure not only results in the attempted action failing but a fall in the &eacute;lan score, as the unit begins to succumb to the stresses of the battlefield. Under this system, even the most motivated troops will eventually be worn down and break.<br/><br/>In the game, much of the minutiae of combat has been ignored. As Divisional or Brigade commanders, the players only see the results of actions, not the process on the ground by which those results are determined. A commander will know only that a unit has not advanced, not which one of the multitude of reasons why it hasn't. This absence of precise control at the company level, is mirrored further up the command structure by using a non-sequential turn sequence to simulate communications failures (and initiative) within the command system.<br/><br/>&Eacute;lan contains army lists for 22 nations involved in the Great war and instructions on how to convert any MicroMark army list for play in the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A sugoroku game (a Japanese game which might be compared to backgammon) of graphically striking design encouraging players to make their way around the world along aviation routes of various types (e.g. the Zeppelin route.) Japan lies at the center, with countries identified by national flags. Around the border of the map are black and white images of people, animals, and historical buildings relating to the different stops along the way. The text boxes at the bottom give directions for playing the game, and important things for children to learn. It was a New Years newspaper supplement to Mainichi Shinbun, dated Showa 5 (1930).<br/><br/>Text in Japanese. The subtitle on the right reads: Educational Games for a New Age; the subtitle on the left reads:New Years Supplement to Osaka Mainichi Newspaper. Map title: World Flight Routes. Lower right: Directions for playing. &quot;The easiest way&quot; &quot;Here are instructions for the easiest way to play. Around the map are assembled the world's interesting and well-known places. Most likely, these are all places that everyone wishes they could visit sometime. Departing from Osaka [1] and moving to all the places in order of 2, 3, 4, you then return to Tokyo [52]. The player who reaches there first is the winner. &quot;Throw the dice and proceed as many places as the number you cast...&quot; Upper right text informs players of distances between locations, with basic geographic facts. The legend, toward the bottom of the map oval, shows 5 types of red lines &amp; 1 square: 1. Well-known large aircraft route (refers to zeppelin, seen center of map) 2.

The attack came in October of 1941. This city would be the site of three major battles for the city. The interesting aspect of the October 1941 battle is in the nature of the troops involved. The Soviets had superiority in armor. The Germans advanced with only a single STUG battalion in support of the 57th ID. The Soviets fielded the T34 as well as several improvised armored vehicles such as the KhTZ-16. While not a success on the battlefield, it demonstrated the Soviet inventiveness under the extreme pressure of the blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>There are twelve total scenarios in the campaign.  <br/>Full force lists are available for both German Divisions and the Soviet troops present.  <br/>Maps are based on aerial reconnaissance photographs taken by German troops in September 1941.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each faction brings unique abilities, and more actions become available to players as the city grows. You'll need to build a diverse set of locations to win and become the new mayor. Can you unite the people and create Diverse City?<br/><br/>Diverse City is a fantasy-themed, worker placement, city building game for 1-2 players. The players are rival leaders competing to build and visit locations. As the city grows, more actions become available, but players must race to claim the diminishing real estate. Specialists can be hired, granting powerful abilities to combo and enhance player actions. Points are awarded for locations, specialists, and the diversity of factions represented. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>You and your rival take in turns placing workers on the border locations of the city. Where your workers intersect you place additional workers - place them on empty spaces to build new locations there, or on existing locations to perform new and powerful actions. Instead of placing a worker, you can recall all of your workers to perform the action of those spaces, including harvesting resources, building locations for new actions, and hiring specialists to improve productivity.<br/><br/>All cards that you build and hire are worth points. You gain bonus points for sets of different factions, building adjacent to other factions, and increasing the city&rsquo;s population. As the name suggests, diversity is key to victory and becoming the new mayor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a game that flows very well from turn-to-turn and player to player. <br/>Games are intended to be short, with an emphasis on achieving objectives inside of a brief span of turns.<br/><br/>All Units Engage is a toolkit that invites you to play with the minis and models you already own. <br/>The focus is on sci-fi, near-future and post-apocalyptic gaming, but the mechanics are flexible enough to support a wider variety of settings such as Cold War and even WWII.<br/><br/>All Units Engages uses ten-sided dice. <br/>No templates are required and only a few basic markers are needed to track pins and reserve actions.<br/><br/>All Units Engage is casual, but complete.

If necessary you could also use card counters.<br/><br/>Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.<br/><br/>The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Albatros D.III. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.<br/><br/>The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.<br/><br/>To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. <br/>While air combat is probably what most players will want play, there are also rules for Ground Attack, Bombing, Photo Reconnaissance and Balloon Busting.<br/><br/>Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.<br/><br/>Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.<br/><br/>Data is provided for most aircraft that were in action during the First World War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Origins is a wondrous story of Arnorus's fight between vicious predators of Meru and with his confederates Mirgoth, Kondu, and Genu. Grendha: Origins gives a sneak-peek into both Arnorus and Meru's past. This addon is a standalone game and an entirely co-op/solo gameplay for 1-4 players.<br/>The game starts with the exploration of arnoru with his allies to dominate the planet Meru. Four heroes combine their strength to destroy the creatures on the planet. The territories have a strange connection with one another, to capture an area, the four heroes should explore and find the territories which are interconnected. The dangerous creatures have many odd powers that can only be defeated by great strategy. The primary power source of each dangerous monsters lies in different territories. The clue for destroying each creature lies within the hands of many wizards and witches. You have to draw each event card in the time of gameplay to see the clues hidden.<br/><br/>Attacking a territory and conquering it doesn't mean the dangerous monsters are fully annihilated. They can always come back, so spend your energy wisely before you exhaust. The provinces on the planet have many mysterious behaviours. By using the combination of technology, magic, weapons, and armies, you should dominate the planet.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/>The four warriors start from their home base. An event card is used to see the current situation of the planet. The event cards will tell how crucial it is to make a journey to any territories. For example, the event of the day states that now there is heavy rainfall, which causes you to exhaust your energy two times more than your usual travel. The event card will also indicate the connection of the territory with another territory. There will be certain symbols for showing the links of territories.<br/><br/>Green skull symbol: shows a connection with one territory.<br/>Orange Skull Symbol: Shows a connection with two territories.<br/>Red Skull symbol: shows a connection with three territories.<br/><br/>To destroy a monster in a territory A, the players should place their diplomacy card or resistance card(depends on the type of monster you are dealing with) in the linked territory to diffuse their mysterious power. For example, if Arnoru have to destroy a monster in the territory 'A,' which is of green skull symbol, the other warrior should place his diplomacy card or resistance Card in the other territory 'C.' If its done, Arnoru can give a perfect strike to the monster, and the beast will destroy.<br/>If there is only one player, The player should deploy his Resistance or diplomacy card in multiple territories and should target the regions he/she should attack later.<br/>Thus you should capture the celestial city and make the planet Meru a real heaven.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the 17th Century, three English civil wars produced a new and truly Great Britain. In the first and second wars (1648-49), supporters of King Charles I clashed with the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649-51) pitted supporters of King Charles II against supporters of the Rump Parliament. It all ended with the execution of King Charles I, the exile of his son, King Charles II, and the shifting of the seat of government power. The outcomes of these battles are well documented, but what would be different had the troops of King Charles II prevailed at the Battle of Worcester or if Sir John Hotham failed to keep Charles I from entering Hull? <br/>Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar may have some plausible answers.<br/><br/>In this fun and fast-paced game, players use D-10 dice for casualty and morale calculations and D-6 dice for additional movement (evades and pursuits). The D-10 system for casualty and morale eliminates the endless modifiers that tend to make each move a monotonous chore. <br/>Basing figures, a common practice in many other popular game systems, is not essential to Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar, since movement and engagements are based on numerical and figurative representations. For example, the system allows for infantry ranging from six to twelve figures and cavalry from four to ten figures; both are representations of much larger forces. <br/>Players are not, however, limited to small representations, as the game is designed to accommodate complete armies.<br/><br/>An added wrinkle in this system is the use of directional dice for command control and first artillery fire. We found that the use of directional dice for these functions keeps the game streamlined, fast-paced, realistic and fun.<br/><br/>The appendix contains tactical information, color illustrations to better explain tactics, and four pages of suggested army compositions. Because there are several different types of units, players are also provided with sample army lists and blank templates for composing custom lists.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(which is required for use).  <br/>Missile Age takes air combat beyond the age of gunfighters which fought in the skies over Korea, incorporating early missile armed air combat.<br/><br/>In addition to expanding the rules to cover missile combat between aircraft (including RADAR, rudimentary ECM, etc.), Missile Age also adds ground-to-air combat including mass FlaK battery barrages, individual anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) sites, Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs), and Man-Portable Air Defense missiles (ManPADs).<br/><br/>While we were at it, we decided to incorporate some optional rules for Above the Clouds, some based upon suggestions from veteran players.  These include an alternate maneuver order, limitations for tailing friendly aircraft, and non-simultaneous gun combat resolution.<br/><br/>Missile Age includes the first scenario package, Route Pack 6, which covers the air combat which occurred in South-East Asia from the mid 1960s and 1970s.<br/><br/>Route Pack 6 contains aircraft performance displays (APDs) for 28 aircraft, 4 models of Air-to-Air Missile (including 20 versions of those missiles), and one SAM system, the SA-2 (in 4 versions)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s Saturday morning, with the cartoons on the television and adventures running through your head. With grim determination, you pull back the elastic band and take aim. The tension builds and your fingers begin to tremble as the army man is centered in your sights.<br/><br/>The plastic soldier stood still, believing itself to be safely in cover behind the couch leg. It doesn&rsquo;t even hear the snap of the elastic as he sails into the air from the force of the blow.<br/><br/>Welcome to Elastic Warfare.<br/><br/>Elastic Warfare is a ruleset for tactical miniature wargaming to be played with a standard set of army men and a set of rubber bands designed to be played in your existing living room.<br/><br/>The ruleset is inspired by &quot;Little Wars&quot; by H.G. Wells in creating a ruleset for children and adults using toys they already own. The rules are extremely simple-to-learn utilizing only simple measurements and dexterity based shooting.<br/><br/>The advanced rules add strategy, without adding complexity in the form of a tactical deck. Move as many soldiers as you want, but the more you move the greater the risk of falling for an enemy ploy.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     This ruleset does not require anything past a measuring device, a set of army men and a handful of rubber bands<br/>     It requires no specialized terrain, as it's designed to use your existing tables, chairs, and furniture as the battlefield. Or play on your tabletop using the included Tabletop-Scale rules.<br/>     Accuracy in this game is based on player skill with a rubber band and terrain is physically placed. This means combat is quick, and simple to learn even for children.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FIRETEAM: Tactics (FTT for short) is a tactical tabletop war game designed for small-scale battles with plastic brick models and figures.<br/><br/>The action takes place in the near future where aliens are invading Planet Earth - or, as a matter of fact, anywhere you want it to, as long as there are battles involved. <br/>Gameplay is mission-based and allows advancement for any surviving characters, adding RPG-elements into the mix. <br/>There is no requirement for measuring tapes or rulers. Most dice rolls in FTT are made with twelve-sided dice.<br/><br/>Except for the hexagon-patterned surface of the battlefield itself, which you can have printed on vinyl, canvas, or any other suitable material at your local printer, everything on the table is represented through plastic bricks and compatible figures. Units as well as obstacles and terrain pieces will look amazing, given you are a skilled enough builder and have some Lego or other brick building toys at your disposal. As one might easily figure out, there's a significant advantage over using traditional glued and painted miniatures in a game like this: When something falls and breaks (you know it WILL), there's no reason to suffer a nervous breakdown over the amount of elaborate work that went into it. Instead, putting things back together will take just a couple of seconds.<br/><br/>Just like the building brick toys that inspired me, FTT is a modular system designed with expandability in mind. This means the core document will provide you with mostly basic rules, but other content, such as units, weapons, and missions, is kept separate, making it easier to customize the game and add more content. While you will quickly realize how accessible the creation of your own material is, I probably won&rsquo;t be able to resist providing you with extra content in the long run, as well. Expect more settings, scenarios, game modes, units, weapons, powers, and rule expansions from me in the future, as my building brick collection grows and evolves.<br/><br/>Download your core rules PDF for free. I don&rsquo;t intend to make any money off this project, and I will do my best to keep fine-tuning and updating the rules and other downloadable files according to any feedback I receive.<br/>In addition to the core rules, you will need the following to play the game:<br/><br/>     DIY printables: battle mat, stickers, unit cards, and weapon cards &ndash; included with your download<br/>     Unit spreadsheet: Required for creating custom units by yourself &ndash; included with your download<br/>     Dice: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, 20-sided, at least one of each<br/>     And last but not least, fitting plastic brick building toys to make the game pieces and matching figures. <br/><br/><br/>For the standard flavour the core rules where designed in mind with, I recommend using contemporary or futuristic-looking soldiers, aliens and robots &ndash; figures best found in various Lego sci-fi themes, such as &ldquo;Alpha Team&rdquo;, &ldquo;Exo Force&rdquo;, &ldquo;Space Police&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alien Conquest&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Galaxy Squad&rdquo;. Weapons and gear from third-party manufacturers such as Brickarms or Brickforge work like a charm on these.<br/><br/>For best results, customizing figures by mixing and matching their components is key. Obstacles and other terrain pieces are simply built from bricks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer / publisher<br/><br/>",

Large monsters like dragons, large demons and inter-dimensional monstrosities will use the monster rules.<br/>The first thing you will need to do is create a Crew Leader and 2-5 Crew Members. <br/>You will need to generate their background, their class, goals and motivations and buy any special talents or abilities and their starting gear and weapons. You will also need to choose your groups initial allegiance to one of the many Power Groups.<br/><br/>Your Crew will need to acquire food, water, clothing or armor, weapons, ammo and eventually transport and energy or fuel. Life in the Desolate Waste is a constant struggle for survival.<br/><br/>The Desolate Waste Campaign is a set of rules for playing skirmish games in an original post-apocalyptic setting using the Gruntz 15mm ruleset. <br/>It provides 25 linked scenarios and a sample crew and crew leader as wella s a complete description of the Town of Crossroads. The Scenarios tell the story of Earl Moore and his road crew and their overthrow of the wicked Viola Chance while defending from an invasion from Precinct 8.<br/><br/>The campaign setting also provides complete rules for surviving in the Waste, meeting contacts, performing jobs and complete descriptions and backgrounds of the 11 power groups in the Waste.

        "description": "The Rising Storm<br/><br/>The representatives of a local preservation society from a world within the sector, called Heaven's Gate, have been working with the governments of Earth for the last two decades. These representatives have helped scientists from around the globe in understanding the very advanced technologies of the Synod of Worlds.<br/><br/>As a result, the overall level of technology for the planet has jumped far ahead of what was predicted and the Earth is on the cusp of a new era of exploration and war. Planetary and orbital defenses have been manufactured non stop since the Prometheus Revelation. Planetary Defense Forts are littered around the globe on volcanic islands and barren mountain ranges in order to minimized collateral damage. Armies of powered armor, tanks and mecha fighting vehicles have been rolling off of the production lines and the men and women who will pilot them trained relentlessly in thier use. New tactics and weapons have been developed and the beginnings of a space navy are taking shape.<br/><br/>The preservation societies cannot provide warships to the Terrans but only old and frail cargo haulers of various sizes. Many of these have been put to use building a naval shipyard in the asteroid belt. The first of many warships are not due to for completion for many months and even more months for shakedown and training of its crews. The rest of the second hand frieghters are being hastily converted, with some advisor's assistance, into heavily armed Q-ships and commerce raiders. A half dozen bulk frieghters are being converted into military transport ships and one enormous bulk goods ship into a fleet carrier capable fo carrying squadrons of drone fighters. The first Operation of this new fleet would be to establish a base in the nearby system of Alpha Centauri.<br/><br/>The Alpha Centauri system lies on the main trade route and shipping lane through the sector. It is one of the many links in the jump chain between the Jump Gate worlds of Heavan's Gate and Lion's Gate. Jump sensors will be placed around the main jumps points and a ground base will be placed on the only habitable world in the system, Alpha Centauri 3a, nicknamed Plymouth Rock by the predominately American ground forces.<br/><br/>The Alpha Centauri Campaign uses a Logistics Point and Intelligence Point system to represent the Tail of the military force you are commanding on the table-top and to give you a real sense of growing or depleting resources with each victory or loss. Intelligence Points earned represent the ebb and flow of information on the battlefield. In order to play another scenario you must spend Logistics and/or Intelligence points as you attempt to find, fix and destroy your enemy.  It is fairly simple and uncomplicated.<br/><br/>The campaign is compatible with the Full Thrust, Stargrunt II and Dirtside II rules systems available for free from Ground Zero Games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He has advised us to seek out allies for we are not strong enough to take on the entire Synod of Worlds alone. While the Synod is a vast conglomeration and possesses incalculable resources, it is weak locally. The Sentai system is the lynchpin of commerce within the system.<br/><br/>The Sentai system is heavily defended and will not be easy to gain control of. It contains the shipyards and orbital manufacturing that Earth will need to build ships and weapons and currently lacks. The Synod knows this and is gathering a fleet in the system to protect it and to launch and offensive against Earth. In order to destroy this fleet and secure our safety we need to gather an armada of like minded allies.<br/><br/>Tosk has given us the coordinates of six potential allies within the sector: Sera, Adama, Akra'hom, Trii'hom, Principality and De'nada.

        "description": "Reaping the Whirlwind...<br/><br/>The naval portion of the Battle of Sentai is over and very costly. The carrier Enterprise went down with all hands fighting three Synod destroyers. Her fighters destroyed a Synod battlewagon and a heavy cruiser. The Ark Royal rotated the combined fighter groups of both carriers throughout the battle and kept them in the fight. Her own planes destroyed the three ships that had jumped the Enterprise and the combined groups claimed another heavy cruiser and a light cruiser before the day was out.<br/><br/>The light cruiser Charlotte died duelling with two wounded heavy cruisers. She had already claimed a battleship with her initial salvo of capital ship missiles. The two heavy cruisers were so badly mauled that they attempted to disengage but were run down by the destroyers Tang and Skate. After dispatching one of the heavy cruisers it was chasing the Tang turned and exchanged fire with a light cruiser. It took hits to the engine room and bridge and drifted out of control into Sentai's atmosphere, all hands are assumed lost.<br/><br/>Despite the losses we have secured the orbital space around the planet and the gator freighters have entered orbit. The Marines will assault the planet and neutralize the ground defenses in preparation for a larger landing by the Terran Legions. We plan to seize the spaceports and ground based planetary defenses before a counter-attack can be launched by the Synod through Hevan's Gate in the next system. This planet is the key to the sector. If we can hold this world, then the rest of the sector will be far more vulnerable and in no position to threaten Sol.<br/><br/><br/>     Twelve more scenarios recount the continuing fight for the Sentai System. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Former Synod worlds within the sector have joined with us and our allies. Members of the Preservation Society have flocked to our banner and provided a desperately needed resource of information and technical expertise. The shipyards of Titan and numerous mining operations within the asteroid belt and small moons of Jupiter and Saturn have built the largest fleet in Human history. Our close allies, the Aven and Fel'akin, have trained with us and a mutual respect and admiration have grown out of the desperate years of the first Synod War. The Sector, however, will never be safe as long as the Synod controls the galaxy. The Synod scourge must be eradicated.<br/>Task Force Alexander is composed of nearly three hundred warships and four hundred thrity five transports. The 1st, 2nd, 5th and 7th Marine Divisions along with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Terran Legions form the backbone of the invasion ground forces. Numerous other Terran regiments and brigades support the primary landing forces along with four Fel'akin wargoups and six Aven multimode fighter wings. Fleet Admiral Harlie Mason commands the combined forces.<br/>Their First Target is to break into the Hevan Sector through the Qetesh Gate system. Soon they will be knocking on Hevan's door.<br/><br/>'Gatecrasher is the 1st in a series of campaigns to liberate the Hevan Sector from the oppressive and genocidal rule of the Synod of Worlds. It provides 4 scenarios detailing the initial invasion of the Qetesh Gate system. It is compatible with Gruntz 15mm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Qetesh Gate system has fallen and given us a valuable foothold into this sector. The next planet in the local jump chain is called Pathu Bahli and is a major mining and transportation hub in this sector. Normally a gate system would be the linchpin of a sector but Pathu Bahli is home to a Division of Galax Interstellar and it's corporate headquarters for this sector of the galaxy. Other than the extensive mining and refining facilities and the planet has considerable infrastructure which can be valuable if we can eventually colonize this world with our own people.<br/>The system is full of resources and even possesses some ancient starship wreckage we might be able to reverse engineer and who knows what we might learn from that technology. The Admiral has declared this to be a critical system which must be taken before we move deeper into the sector. There are no native lifeforms other than plants and the atmosphere has a higher than normal CO2 level making it barely warm enough for life but requires anyone on the surface to wear a re-breather or sealed suit.<br/>Dense cloud cover and rough terrain make it difficult to recon the area from orbit. Small recon teams from the 15th MEU (SOC) will have to drop in and take a look. We have some captured shuttles from the Qetesh Gate operation which could be used to smuggle recon teams into place. Once we have a better picture of the situation on the ground and the extent of their defenses we can send in the Legions. <br/><br/>Dropping In is the 2nd in a series of campaigns to liberate the Hevan Sector from the oppressive and genocidal rule of the Synod of Worlds. <br/>It provides 4 scenarios detailing the initial invasion of the Pathu Bahli system. <br/>It is compatible with Gruntz 15mm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The drop went according to procedure and the combined Marine / Chang strike team hit the Consensus facility just before local nautical twilight. Chang units hit the perimeter while Marine elements of the now famous Echo company took out the comms tower and secured the headquarters facility.<br/>Once they were relieved by the Legions, Echo Company was sent out into the ruined wasteland to investigate a energy field detected from orbit. What they found was an alien device of unknown function. A battle erupted around the device as Echo company fought off repurposed labor bots sent to destroy them. Once the device was secured they set out on foot to the landing zone for pickup. Consensus labor bots seemed to appear out of the woodwork as Echo company fought their way to the LZ. Once the handoff was complete with the techs on the dropship Echo company recieved word from an embattled Chang Cadre near their position. They boarded three smaller VTOLs and made a mad dash to reinforce their new allies. One of the transports took fire and crashed far from the Chang position. Marines fought a hard battle to consolidate their wounded with the Chang and hold out for relief. The next day a battalion was dropped in to relieve them.

As this guide shows, they were really a bridge between civilisations, linking Rome with India, acting as a barrier to nomadic tribes moving westwards and even having some contact with China.<br/><br/>The second purpose is to offer up some army lists (designed to fit with Impetus rules but easy to follow and equally easily converted for other wargames rules) to help those wargamers who use Impetus and who want to field the armies described in the guide. The idea is that the lists will enable you to produce an army which is reasonably authentic and as much as possible has some of the strengths and weaknesses of the original.<br/><br/>The third purpose is to provide a simple campaign to help players use their armies within their historical context.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sail Ho! Napoleonic Ships Game<br/><br/>These Rules have been written to provide a Fast-Play set in which the fun aspect is highlighted. <br/>A game can be single ship to ship combat, or larger Fleet actions, and can run from a half to a couple of hours depending on the size of the Fleets and experience of the players. Several Fleets and multiple players can easily be incorporated.<br/><br/>The Movement system is Hex based, eradicating those minor tweaks and disputes bought about by rulers and angle markers. Ship types are generalised into three levels of Rated and several non-rated types, and include Frigates, fire ships, Bomb ketches, merchantmen and fortifications. Playing counters and sample Fleets are provided.<br/><br/>Combat includes exchanging cannon fire and grappling the enemy to board with Marines!<br/><br/>The effects of wind direction, day or night actions and accumulated damage is represented by various simple mechanisms that are easy to learn, yet hold subtle variations that an experienced gamer can exploit.<br/><br/>There is little record keeping, other than moving counters on a board, so the main focus can be kept on the models on the playing table. It is an I-Go-Y-U-Go turn system that prevents individual ship orders and snarl-ups, but does mean you have to keep your wits about you!<br/><br/>The Rules are originally intended for Napoleonic period ship combat, but can easily be used for other periods in which projectiles are the main offensive weapons, as opposed to the ramming tactics of earlier navies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.<br/><br/>Each player has a flight of four aircraft represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.<br/><br/>A performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.<br/><br/>TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.<br/><br/>The Ki-61 was the only Japanese fighter to feature an inline engine, a license-built version of the Daimler-Benz 601 V-12.  When the Ki-61 was first seen by Allied pilots, they mistook it for a German-built Bf-109 or an Italian C.202 fighter. Self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armour sacrificed maneuverability for durability, and the inline engine made a streamlined fighter with higher speed than other Japanese fighters.<br/><br/>This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the Ki-61 Tony and two scenarios that reference other aircraft.<br/><br/>     Misidentification:  Ki-61 and Ki-43 Oscars engage American P-38L Lightnings.<br/>     Ganryu-jima: P-47 Thunderbolts defend  B-25J Mitchell bombers against a flight of Ki-61 Tonys <br/><br/><br/>This set contains miniatures for the  Ki-61.

It promotes face-to-face communication for teams, families, schools and friends.<br/><br/>There are several methods of game play, the most common being one cards in the middle, with each player getting five cards.

        "description": "Car Lords<br/><br/>This game is played with small die-cast cars that represent your battle car on the tabletop. <br/> You move your car around the table and fire weapons to damage and destroy the other cars. <br/> Car Overlords is the most popular spectator sport in the future where drivers use modified battle cars to fight to the death for fame and huge cash prizes. <br/> These cars are heavily armored and armed with advanced military weapons because paying spectators expect to see massive explosions and inevitable driver fatalities.  Multiple cars enter a battle arena, they blast each other to pieces, and the last car standing wins.  It has become the most watched television show with hundreds of millions of viewers watching this ultimate blood sport every night.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seven Years is a war game designed to be simple and efficient.<br/><br/>At the core are: a two-table engine, the five status definition of units, a flexible command system that can span from cumbersome to almost Napoleonic and last not least a more fluid game sequence, than most common rule sets can provide.<br/><br/>While operating at brigade level, it is designed to keep a balance of overall action versus micro management of the troops.<br/><br/>For my taste, so called &ldquo;friction of battle&rdquo; is a good thing as long as it doesn&lsquo;t bring all action to halt or replaces the player entirely. The game system also gives a bit room to manoeuvre.<br/><br/>Let us trust in the discipline and drill these soldiers were exposed to on a daily basis.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Movement is determined by a die.<br/>Each space on the game board represents 1 minute. The burglars have a 10 minute headstart. If Perry Clifton overtakes a burglar, the burglar is caught and eliminated from the game. If a burglar reaches space 88 he has escaped. Perry Clifton may use up to 10 stop-chips to put on the track in front of the burglars instead of rolling the die to move himself forward. The burglars may only pass the chip if they land on the same space it occupies.<br/>The results of the game are documented on a piece of paper.

The game introduces four influential black Brazilian women on three types of cards: One shows an image, others show biographical information, and some have poems about the women. The poems were written by Brazilian author Jarrid Arraes, whose book Hero&iacute;nas negras brasileiras was an inspiration for the game.<br/><br/>Each group of students gets an image card and has to research the life of that respective personality (there is a QR code on the image cards which leads to a page with information). After the research phase, each group receives three random cards. The goal is to have a set of cards which all belong to their initial personality. But the poem and biography cards do not show the name of the personality, the students have to figure out which information or poem belongs to their character. The groups can exchange cards with a drawpile or with an open display of cards. Whichever group gets a full set first, wins. <br/>A competitive mode is also included. In this mode, the teacher teaches about one personality, then deals out the cards to the students who have to figure out which cards belong to the character they learned about.<br/>The game is available to teachers as a free print and play.<br/><br/>",

This applies to the target location as well. For each path up to six chips can be used. An already occupied tile can be skipped, but not a location or multiple occupied tiles. For each location up to 4 chips (own or foreign) are allowed, but only one per turn. After occupying a location the current player can (but does not have to) draw a location card and auction it.<br/><br/>A chip gets payed to the register and the card is auctioned. Up to 6 chips can be offered. If somebody offers six chips, the auction stop immediately. An auctioned location card can be used starting with the next round. Starting with the second turn, each player can choose: Either walk and auction or &quot;cap&quot;. This means that one location card is placed on the corresponding location, or another location. When capping, you can place as much chips on the location card as there are beneath it. A &quot;capped&quot; location is locked.<br/><br/>The &quot;i&quot; wild card can be used to either &quot;cap&quot; a chosen location, the &quot;IHK&quot; wild card to get the own chips back from the register immediately. If it is passed on, the receiving player has to take back all of its own chips from the register. If the &quot;i&quot; wild card is drawn, the &quot;i-Chemnitz-Service&quot; will be the start location. When starting from the start location is not possible any more, because all the tiles around it are occupied already, another location card gets drawn as the start location. The game ends when someone runs out of chips.<br/><br/>Scoring: Only &quot;capped&quot; tiles with at least one chip on it get scored. For correctly &quot;capped&quot; tiles all chips are counted for the corresponding person. For incorrectly &quot;capped&quot; tiles only chips of the &quot;capping&quot; person are counted, and only if the player has at least one chip beneath the location tile. All other chips are lost. Some special points can be gained by having matched places you wrote down before the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

KMH is designed for single ship or large fleet actions with ships that are of the rate (6th rate vessel or larger). <br/>Small ships of less than twenty guns tend to play the same from a one gun rowboat to a 18-gun Brig of War. These modifications provide some uniqueness for the smaller ships and allow them to be battled out on the tabletop.<br/>Like the original KMH rules, they are not scale dependent. <br/>However, the changes were designed with 1/300 or 6mm ships in mind. <br/>These can be obtained from sites such as Sea Dog Studios, Langton Miniatures and War Artisan. The later is an exceptional value as you are buying a paper kit that you print yourself and make as many as you would like.<br/><br/>Included in the book is a guide for creating your own ships or creating stats for historical vessels. <br/>Fifteen historical scenarios covering: the American Revolution, The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, The Tripolitan Wars and the Quasi-War with France.<br/><br/>A section is included for creating campaigns with these small vessels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will start the game with weaker cards, but those cards can be used to accumulate coins that can be spent to add more powerful cards to their deck. The trick is that all of the cards are initially played face down: players declare what card they are playing. If no one challenges the declaration, the player gets the effect of the card they declared. But if there is a challenge, the player who is incorrect is punished.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most influence when all of the elite mafia cards are purchased. Influence is given by the number of elite mafia cards in your deck as well as the amount of power that you retain (power can be lost if you are caught lying or attacked by other players).<br/><br/>The pool of cards in the shop varies game by game; 5 elite card roles are chosen (2 cards per role) and 4 mafia card roles are chosen (4 cards per role). Player decks start with two civilians and one thug, but they can use those cards to purchase more powerful mafiosi like soldato, capo, consigliere or criminals such as drug dealers, racketeers, or arson, or bribed officials such as police officers or politicians.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All serious patriots could not think of this great and, in some ways, dangerous undertaking by the beloved ruling couple and their happy ending without a deep movement. All kinds of details of the trip, such as the importance of the whole company at home and abroad, kept the heads busy.<br/>It is therefore not surprising that the publisher and &raquo;Royal Court Printing Company Adolph H. Engel, founded in 1848, took the opportunity to on the occasion of the imperial journey and the company's 50th anniversary, a board game under the name &raquo;Imperial Journey to Palestine. <br/>The publisher was thus in line with the times. The first travel board games were created around 1800 in England and the USA. As so-called running games with obstacles, the course of which was determined by dice, they were based on the classic board game, the type of didactic goose game that has been known for centuries and has existed in countless variations, which was thematically mostly historically or geographically oriented. Now, on a mostly foldable, but still stable game pad, views of cities, landscapes, monuments and other sights were graphically depicted more or less elaborately along an itinerary and designed into a course on which the players replay a corresponding trip with all its amenities and dangers and after could experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The battle was no one battle but a series of linked skirmishes that occurred across numerous orchards of peaches in Northern Virginia. It is an entertaining piece of history as the skirmishes had basically come to a stop once the troops had picked the peach trees clean of fruit.<br/><br/>The scenarios cover the following skirmishes:<br/><br/>     The Battle of Fairfax Courthouse - June 1, 1861<br/>     Ball's Crossroads - August 27, 1861<br/>     Bailey's Corners - August 28 - 30, 1861<br/>     Munson's Hill - August 31, 1861<br/>     Lewinsville Part 1 - September 10, 1861<br/>     Lewinsville Part 2 - September 10, 1861<br/>     Lewinsville - September 11, 1861<br/>     Lewinsville - September 25, 1861<br/>     Munson's Hill - September 28, 1861<br/>     Springfield Station - October 3, 1861<br/>     Little River Turnpike - October 15, 1861<br/>     Doolan's Farm - November 16, 1861<br/>     A Running Skirmish - November 18, 1861 (on the Fairfax Courthouse road)<br/>     Hunter's Mill - November 26, 1861<br/>     Dranesville - November 26, 1861<br/>     Falls Church - November 27, 1861<br/>     Annandale - December 2, 1861<br/><br/><br/>These scenarios are written for the TooFatLardies rules Terrible Sharp Sword.  <br/>However, they are perfectly compatible with other skirmish rule sets such as Brother Against Brother.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Soviet forces are attempting to drive through German defences in the Chera valley in order to break through into Germany itself, the Germans are trying to stop them.<br/><br/>The pack contains thirty-one individual scenarios set up in a five-step pyramid campaign i.e. scenario 1 leads to either scenario 2A or 2B; the result of this second game leads to one of scenarios 3A, 3B, 3C or 3D; and so on until scenarios 5A to 5P.<br/><br/>Although written as a fictional campaign booklet, no two scenarios are the same: each is unique and is also designed to be played as an individual game. Each of the three briefings for each scenario (Umpire, Soviet player, German player) contains enough background to give the game the same sort of context as with the background to an historical scenario.<br/><br/>Bashnya or Bust! is deliberately designed to give players who don't have enough time to write their own scenarios a huge number of games that they can play with little or no preparation at all. All you have to do is print out the three briefings, set up the table according to the map, make up the deck from the list of required cards, break out the figures and dice, and start the first turn. You don't even need to print the pack out in full: just the pages you need for the scenario you're going to play.<br/><br/>The campaign is structured so that you&rsquo;ll get maximum use of the standard forces presented in Vpered Na Berlin, with well-designed and balanced scenarios for IABSM, or indeed any company level rule set you happen to game with. Anyone who has a company-sized force of Germans and Soviets for late war, eastern front should already have enough figures to play any or all of the games.<br/><br/>Bashnya or Bust! follows on from the popular Vyazma or Bust! and Blenneville or Bust! campaign/scenario packs, also available from the TooFatLardies.<br/><br/>Bashnya or Bust! contains an introduction, details of the campaign structure and forces involved, sixteen different maps (some games are played across the same terrain, albeit in a different direction), thirty-one different scenarios, and a collection of templates allowing you to print off Blind markers as appropriate.<br/><br/>Please note, whilst this is a PDF product, you don&rsquo;t need to print this out like a book (although you can if you wish): Bashnya or Bust! is designed to allow you to just print the scenarios as you use them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The battle was the opening of a series of offensives by the German Army intended to force the Allies to sue for peace. The game is intended to simulate the interaction of ground and air elements during the offensive and the effect that aerial support exerted upon this battle.<br/><br/>The German player must capture as much ground as possible while taking as few losses as possible. Meanwhile the British must allocate reserves and airpower resources to slow down the German advance as much as possible by forcing the German player to pay heavier costs for their territorial gains.<br/><br/>The game uses a number of novel mechanisms to represent the attritional combat of the First World War and has been ran at several events including Connections UK Conference.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

And, while it is perfectly acceptable to use the cards with plain backs, there is also a page of reverse sides that can be printed or copied onto them.<br/><br/>A version of this game originally appeared in the multi-platform game publication d-Infinity Volume #2: Lost Treasure.<br/><br/>",

Beasts haunt the wilds and prowl the outskirts of palisaded settlement and isolated steading alike. Trolls and their ilk gather, marauders sweep brigands and more into their bands, and whispers abound of gaunt giant wolves and worse, glimpsed in the swirl of a snowstorm.

While most of play is building up an interesting story, there's also a strategic component to which aspect of the story you focus on, as that affects scoring at the end.<br/><br/>Each scenario has four keywords; for example, the first scenario is &quot;The Dragon's Cave&quot; and some keywords are &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Traps&quot;, and &quot;Treasure&quot;. Each keyword starts with two &quot;shadows&quot;, or black stones. Each turn a player pulls a jewel from a bag and uses the color of the jewel plus a keyword to tell part of the story. The keyword they choose to use determines where they place the jewel, and the color of the jewel determines the next player.<br/><br/>For example, if you pick a red jewel and then choose the &quot;Treasure&quot; keyword, you might say &quot;there's a legend that there's a giant ruby at the bottom of this cave&quot;. Over the course of the game you'll build on elements introduced by the other players.<br/><br/>You get points by getting rid of shadows, but also for each stone of your color on the board at the end of the game. You remove stones from the board by adding stones to keywords that already have three stones on them, so as the game progresses you'll have a choice between getting rid of shadows to get points directly or removing jewels belonging to other players to reduce their points. You'll have to balance both of these aspects to come out ahead.<br/><br/>Besides scenario-based competitive play, rules for non-competitive &quot;free play&quot; are also included.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bad War is the fourth set of wargame rules using the AB One system.<br/><br/>Previous titles include Father Tilly which covers the Thirty Years War and Bloody Kingdom, a set of English Civil War rules. <br/>Bad War is designed to cover warfare in the sixteenth century, a period which seems from this distance to offer the wargamer a terrifically interesting and colourful selection of gaming opportunities. Full of garishly dressed soldiers, colourful and exotic troop types and with the introduction of the firearm, the beginnings of modern warfare. <br/>Armies struggled to find a way of incorporating this new technology, much time was devoted to experimentation with battlefield tactics and still the tried and tested methods of medieval warfare produced dramatic victories. Few could stand against the awesome charge of the French Gendarmes nor face the ferocious onslaught of the Swiss pike-square. And yet warfare did evolve during this period. The arquebus and musket do replace the bow and crossbow, knights begin to put aside their lances and take up the pistol.<br/><br/>What I have attempted with Bad War is to bring out the qualities of some of these more exotic troops, the Doppels&ouml;ldner, the Aventuriers, the Black Bands, the Gendarmes, the Landsknechts, the Stradiots and the Condottieri. <br/>Rather than a simple factor rating their quality, these troops have different characteristics that shape and modify their actions. Gendarmes are likely to disobey orders and attack their nearest opponents, the Swiss will seek out any Landsknechts and visit bloody slaughter on their foe and any Stradiots can certainly be relied upon to loot the baggage train - either their opponents or their own!<br/><br/>Bad War can be played with either 25/28mm or 15mm figures and a wide variety of popular basing is allowed. <br/>The rules have many similar features to the other AB One games including the entertaining &quot;War-Tokens system&quot;.<br/><br/>Also provided is a Fornovo scenario which includes a map, order of battle and unit cards that can be printed out for use during the game and army lists for the Early Italian Wars. <br/>Although Bad War focuses initially on the Italian Wars, the rules can be used for any European warfare of the sixteenth century. Later supplements will cover the French Wars of Religion, the Spanish and Dutch war and the wars of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This game can be played with up to two or three players per side. <br/>     And finally, the last scenario covers the Battle of Lech. This is a large battle requiring around two hundred and fifty figures per side, three to four players per side plus a good five or six hours gaming.<br/><br/><br/>The Lech scenario is based around a river crossing under heavy enemy fire and contains special rules for boats, bridges and other details that allow such actions. Players will need to have a copy of the Swedish War gaming supplement for the details of Swedish generals, troops and tactics, in order to properly use these scenarios.<br/><br/>The Battle on the Lech was Tilly's final battle. Defending a river crossing to prevent the Swedish forces from crossing into Bavarian territory, the old Catholic general suffered a fatal wound while encouraging his beleaguered troops to stand fast in the face of punishing Swedish artillery fire. Will the Imperial army suffer the same fate as the historical outcome or can they deliver a major reverse to the great Swedish king?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barbarossa &ndash; Kicking in the Door&hellip; is a wargames campaign covering the German invasion of the Soviet Union between June and September 1941. <br/>It is designed for games in which a stand represents a platoon, such as Blitzkrieg Commander, Command Decision: TOB, A Fistful of Tows, Rapid Fire and others, including those which wargamers may have written themselves.<br/><br/>The system generates 150+ hours of gaming spread over 50+ individual battles which are fought over fifteen weekly campaign turns. Bookkeeping is kept to a minimum as players take command of four of the German panzer divisions spearheading the invasion or the Soviet tank and infantry forces opposing them. Straightforward German attacks will be interspersed with Soviet counterattacks, storming city outskirts, holding bridgeheads or trying to break through the fortifications of the Stalin Line. Each type of battle has its own terrain specifications, victory conditions, set up restrictions and likely opposition. Individual battles are reinforced regimental/brigade sized, with some battalions of each division selected to fight whilst others are rested.<br/><br/>In addition to managing the individual battles, however, the German player also needs to manage the campaign. Ever increasing Soviet resistance needs to be curtailed by encircling their forces. Such encirclements reduce the availability of &lsquo;mobilisation points&rsquo; which the Soviet players use as currency to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; greater or better equipped forces and fortifications with which the slow the German advance. A rapid, deep advance, however, will exact a heavy toll in attrition. Supply will also become a problem for the German players, limiting the numbers they can commit to battle and their artillery/air support.<br/><br/>The book also includes<br/><br/>     a brief history of the campaign<br/>     background information (such as time and groundscale) useful in adapting the system to different sets of rules and some suggestions for additional optional rules<br/>     a system for generating table layouts for individual battles<br/>     a comprehensive set of Appendices covering<br/>         the Tables of Organisation and Equipment to both platoon and company level for all divisions and regiments involved<br/>         42 colour terrain squares to assist in creating the terrain for individual battles<br/>         a worked example of the terrain generation system<br/>         a Campaign Quick Reference Sheet<br/>         an example Campaign Turn<br/>         a complete set of very quick play rules<br/>         a full colour A4 Campaign Map<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Barbarossa &ndash; Kicking in the Door&hellip; is an ideal campaign for a club (with eight of more players for twelve or more three hour sessions) or one to be organised remotely, by e-mail, with shorter options available for fewer players or those with less time available.<br/><br/>For those who have purchased the author&rsquo;s previous book of eastern front scenarios (Grey Steel, Red Storm &ndash; available on Wargame Vault) please note that around seven pages of history and background from that book are reproduced largely unchanged in Part One of this volume.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The intent of these rules is speed of play and while trying to return the grand tactical flavor of the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>ln the past we have played many rules for the Napoleonic period and have found them floundering just as the heat of the battle was getting interesting. Red tape, too many odd rules, all in the name of the realism. it is just too unbelievable for gaming.<br/><br/>So what we have done here, is sort through all the good, the bad and the ugly of all the rules we have played, and tried to come up with a set that will stay together when the real fighting starts.<br/><br/>Many rule sets have good qualities about them. What we have done here is try to take all those good thing and make a grand tactical miniature wargame out of them for 15mm to 20 mm figures. With little difficulty one can  adapt these rules to fit 6, 10, 25, 30 or 40 mm figures.<br/><br/>The rules are for grand tactical division and corps play although there is no reason you cannot use them for tactical regimental level games. <br/>Players do not need tons of dice just a few D-10 and D-6 dice will do. There is no writing of rules and most games can be played in three to four hours with resolution.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become a hard-boiled private eye,<br/>navigate through the dangerous &quot;noir&quot; world,<br/>and find your destiny - maybe even your femme fatale!<br/><br/>In Game Noir, players become private detectives and have to decide wisely what to do with their action points as they move along the NOIR path. Unpredictable events occur there, the detectives may encounter the femme fatale, end up in the bar for a while, or chase the suspect. They gather black and white tokens they can use to cancel effects of unfavorable events. The tokens also determine to which final path (peace, justice, revenge) a player goes. Then they roll dice and earn victory points for achieving various endings (beware, death is one of them). Being the first to achieve an ending, having an alliance with the femme fatale and/or catching the suspect gives the players bonus points.<br/><br/>Printed components are: board (A4 or A3 format) and 80 tokens (2x A4). Rules have 4 pages. Additional components needed are: different-colored pawns (2-5 for detectives, 1 for femme fatale, 1 for a suspect, 1 spare pawn if possible) and 1-2 six-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ziterion's Magic Tournament is a game that requires two or more players to start and theoretically speaking, there are no player limits.<br/><br/>Players lead a small elite unit of brave heroes through Ziterion's tournament arena, which he has created in dark underground caves. This means, whatever is located outside the playing field modules is impenetrable rock. Each player tries to pilfer an artifact from the central room of the arena, while fighting off your opponents, and move it to the starting room of the player on his or her left.<br/><br/>As a result, players build stairs to overcome individual levels of the arena, erect walls to block their opponent's path, find and use magical tools that may benefit them, and engage in battles with opponents, or even temporarily join forces with one of the other players in order to defeat a seemingly all-powerful opponent.<br/><br/>In the end, however, only one team can win Ziterion's Magical Tournament.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Golden Pyramid is a card driven game, where the players use colored cubes and tiles to collectively build a three-dimentional pyramid.<br/><br/>The unchilded emperor needs a worthy successor to his throne. He declares that the nobles shall together build a golden pyramid. The emperor demands a pyramid that consists of four levels, with the upper levels being build upon colorful artistic colonnades. The one whose contribution impresses the emperor the most will become the new emperor.<br/><br/>How to build a pyramid:<br/><br/>The cubes in this game represent the columns of the pyramid and are bought by playing a card. The number or cubes a player may draw from the bag is determined by the value shown on the card. Cubes can also be obtained from a common market or by trading with other players.<br/><br/>To actually build a part of the pyramid the players need four cubes (second level or higher) and a card that shows the symbol of an available tile as well as a value that equals at least the level that should be build.<br/><br/>Players mainly gain victory points by building tiles and placing cubes adjacent to already placed cubes of the same color.<br/><br/>The Golden Pyramid was one of two Gold Winners of the 2019 Contest X for the Green Box of Games. In order to play the game the Meeple Mini Expansion or replacements (20 white 10mm cubes, 20 black 10mm cubes, a drawbag and e.g. meeples in player colors) are needed.<br/><br/>",
