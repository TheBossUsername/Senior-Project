        "description": "On a small board 4 x 10 squares there are six little half-precious stones for each player in their starting position: three in the first of the four-square-rows, leaving the rightmost square unoccupied and three in the sixth row, leaving the leftmost field unoccupied. The direction of play is &quot;the long run&quot;, so the second row of each player is already &quot;behind&quot; the second row of the opponent. Stones can be drawn one step forwards or diagonally forward at each turn, never sideways or backwards. The stones cannot be beaten or jumped over and on each square there is only one stone allowed.<br/>The aim of the game is to build a 4-stones-in-a-row &quot;parade&quot;, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, which is not that easy as it first seems ...<br/><br/>This game was part of a small edition for the exhibition &quot;Gott w&uuml;rfelt nicht&quot; in G&ouml;ttingen 2005, initialized by Reinhold Wittig, Alth&ouml;fer and other game designers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played very much like regular backgammon... to a point. The first player to get all of his pieces off his home board is the winner.  Unlike normal backgammon, however, there are no safe spaces.  When your piece(es) land(s) in the same space as an opponent's piece(es), they do battle (rolling dice and comparing the result against a defense factor) until one side controls the space and the other (or both) has been sent back to the bar. In addition, one of the pieces has a special power (the Summoner) that really changes the flow of Backgammon.<br/><br/>The advanced game includes fortifications which further complicate things.<br/><br/>The version available in the Winter 2006 edition of the Crusader must be glued down and then cut out before play. The self published edition comes glued to crescent board and you must cut it out before play.<br/><br/>",

It is an action packed board game which combines skill, chance, and special maneuvers to determine a winner.  It incorporates an entirely new concept which is sophisticated and considerably more attractive than conventional board games. (i.e., chess or backgammon).  The game is played on a 15 1/2&quot; x 15 1/2&quot; Maneuvering board where each player has twenty-four ships to protect and defend.  To start the game, these ships are positioned in the first three rows of the board (as shown).  For each turn, the player rolls two dice.  He then moves 2 ships, one for each die the number of spaces indicated by both dice.  The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's ships or to win by trapping your opponent's ship(s).  The first player to complete one of the game objectives is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The name of the game is derived from the fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty (&quot;Dornr&ouml;schen&quot; in German) which is well known in many parts of Europe, including Germany and Russia. Although the game may appear superficially as a variant of Anglo-American Checkers, it has many unusual features that are not known in any other Checkers game:<br/><br/><br/>     Men capture adjacent enemy ladies (the equivalent of kings in Checkers) by the short leap backwards, but never forwards. However, adjacent enemy men are captured by them in the usual way by leaping forwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If a man reaches the opponent's back rank, he is promoted to a sleeping beauty (and turned upside down), if the player has already a lady. A player can never have two or more ladies at the same time. Sleeping beauties are inactive until they are woken up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A lady captures by the short leap like the king in English Draughts / American Straight Checker. A lady can also capture in the Chess way by replacement like a Ferz in Shatranj, not just by jumping.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     It is not permitted to combine both ways of capturing in one move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Capturing by replacement is not compulsory, whereas capturing by jumping is and the greatest number possible must be captured. Consequently, jumping always takes precedence over replacement, unless a lady can capture the opponent's lady. Then the lady that captures has the choice between both ways of capturing, which is called Royal Privilege<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A sleeping beauty may not move or capture, nor may she be captured. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     After a sleeping beauty is woken up, she is permitted to make a &quot;jump of joy&quot;, a rule that was was inspired by the Kurierspiel. However, a jump of joy is only permitted if the square crossed over is (1) vacant and (2) not &quot;threatened&quot; (or &quot;guarded&quot; in Chess terminology).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The object of the game is to leave the opponent without a valid move, either by capturing all his pieces, or by blocking them completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A game can never end in a draw, thus &quot;vanquishing the curse of the Checkers draw&quot; as Kerry Handscomb, the editor of the Abstract Games magazine put it. There are, however, rare positions very similar to jishogi, or impasse in Japanese Chess that need a special rule: In a continous sequence of moves in which only ladies are moved, a particular lady is not permitted to move onto the same square twice after the full board position has been repeated once (even if the lady occupied this square before the position was repeated).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A point scoring system is used to determine the margin of win. The winner gets as many points as there are still pieces on the board (of any kind and color). The loser gets zero points, even if he has still pieces left (in the case of a blockade).<br/><br/><br/>The game has been extensively covered in the Abstract Games magazine whose Canadian editors described it as &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;rather strange&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Their objective, a bridge along the main axis of advance. But first the men of No. 11 Commando will have to silence a menacing battery of Vichy howitzers.<br/><br/>BC3: 42ND STREET CRETE, May 27, 1941: German mountain troops stream over the rocky hillsides pursuing what they think is a beaten enemy. But as they approach a major Allied supply dump, they bump into a fighting patrol from the Australian 2/7th Battalion.

The Australians send a company of infantry to evict the unwanted vehicle but the R35 has friends and won&rsquo;t go quietly.<br/> BC5: STORMING THE AMPHITHEATRE, BOUGAINVILLE, February 6, 1945: The whistle of shells and the dull thud of smoke rounds alert the Japanese defenders on their fortified ridge line. Before long the Australians emerge from the shroud and into a wall of withering fire.<br/><br/>BC6: WALKABOUT, BOUGAINVILLE, March 30, 1945: A rumble of tank tracks and the sight of the lurching armoured monsters sends panic through the Japanese ranks sitting in their muddy foxholes, but their leaders steady their charges and order them to fire at the supporting infantry now coming into view.<br/> BC7: BRIGADE HILL, NEW GUINEA, September 8, 1942: The Australians defending along the Kokoda Track face an unprecedented disaster. Somehow the Japanese have enveloped an entire brigade and cut the line of communication to headquarters. It&rsquo;s time for the Aussies to break-out or perish.<br/><br/>",

In consequence, the map has 'special runs' - so on alternate runs, one end of the run is a special destination such as any or specific ports, or to edge towns for connection to England.<br/><br/>The hilly terrain means that this is not a good map for beginners.

Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>In the Trenches: The Lost Generation includes nine operations. &quot;Probe into the Bois des Caures&quot; and &quot;Coup de Grace&quot; take place during the Battle of Verdun, while &quot;Bangers and Mash&quot;, &quot;Storming La Boiselle&quot;, &quot;French Canadians at Regina&quot;, &quot;Second Shot at Regina&quot;, and &quot;From Delville to Flers with the Heavy Section&quot; cover various episodes of the Battle of the Somme. Finally, &quot;Polish Hill&quot; and &quot;Counterattack at Polish Hill&quot; is set during the Brusilov Offensive on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Included in In the Trenches: The Lost Generation are four 12&quot; x 18&quot; maps, 384 counters, one rulebook, guides for all nine operations, one referenced card, and two D6s.<br/><br/>(source: Grenier Games website)<br/><br/>",

Amid the noise, stunning secrets were revealed: Anastasius Focht was once Frederick Steiner; ComStar Primus Sharilar Mori was a Kurita spy.<br/><br/>Yet along with the secrets revealed and the spreading fires of the Jihad, the Blakists unveiled terrible new weapons and an army the size of which the intelligence agencies of the Inner Sphere had scarcely dreamed, spawning a darker, new wave of mysteries, and whispers of shadowy cabals. Hidden worlds, cults of assassins, ancient societies and even the mysteries of hyperspace - all emerged as possible sources for the Word of Blake's newfound power. Once more spanning all of human space from ancient Terra to the far-flung Clan homeworlds, the conspiracies behind the Jihad could be the key to unraveling the greatest war since the days of Amaris.<br/><br/>Jihad Conspiracies: Interstellar Players 2 describes several of the most powerful and influential people, organizations, and entities at work behind the scenes of the Word of Blake Jihad. Some of these conspiracies are firmly grounded in Classic BattleTech lore, but shown here in ways never before seen; others have only recently emerged from their own shadows. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these power brokers are real and which are paranoid fantasies spawned by the chaos and fear of the Blakist Holy War!<br/><br/>",

Consequently the battle, for its scale, had more violence and finality than the typical WWII action, and more clearing of hexes than we are likely to see in a single turn of Europa. The battle thus serves to demonstrate the need for some special rules to address such a situation, and provides a small test case for &quot;designer's choice&quot; rules suggestions...&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;It has been two years since the cybernetic Toracs invaded. In two days they destroyed human civilization- breaking the strongest fronts of resistance and herding entire populations into their conversion centers to make us into more of them. All that remains of the human race now are the survivors who escaped through the cracks of mankind&rsquo;s ruined civilization<br/><br/>But there may yet be hope. Hidden away in the ruins of mankind are the keys to possible salvation. Experimental technologies, hidden superweapons, unexpectedly useful devices are all scattered across the globe. The only chance for the human survivors to evict the Toracs from their world is to find these devices and use them&hellip; before the last scraps of humanity are wiped from the face of the Earth!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a one-to-four player hex and counter game set in the near future (2050 or so) where earth has been invaded by the &quot;Toracs&quot;. Initially the humans are weak- they cannot out run the Toracs and they certainly can't hope to fight them. Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders. They might find weapons, faster transportation, or even leftover superweapons from the 20th century in the form of nuclear devices. The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.<br/><br/>However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated. For the survival of the human race, the Torac must be defeated!<br/><br/>This is an entry for the Sneaky Sci-Fi game contest.Until the files are approved, you can get the game on my deviantart account: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://norsehound.deviantart.com/#/d2sulo7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://norsehound.deviantart.com/#/d2sulo7</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ecalper is a 2-player abstract game about negotiation for territory conquest. It was invented in 2010, while the designer were reflecting about the pie rule.<br/><br/>The game begins with an empty 7x7x7 hex-hex board. The game is scalable, so a beginner can start with 5x5x5 and. Expert players should play on 8x8x8 board or bigger.<br/><br/>One of the players uses black stones and the other player uses white stones. Players move alternately, starting with black player.<br/><br/>In the first turn, the black player places just 3 stones.  For each turn afterwards, players replace 1 of their opponent's stones placed in the last turn (not the replaced one) by their own, and continues placing 3 more of his stones.  In the last turn, black replaces just one of the last white stones and the game is over.<br/><br/>The pie rule can be used.<br/><br/>When at the end of the white turn the board has just 1 empty cell, the last turn starts. The game ends with an unoccupied cell. When the game is finished, the player with the largest group of stones wins. If both players have the same score, the winner is the player with less number of groups. Of course a player may resign at time if the situation looks hopeless, this causes his immediate defeat.<br/><br/>For making the gameplay easier, without memorizing the last three opposite placements each turn, it's possible to mark those stones in some way.

        "description": "In Prepotent, players breed, bet on, and race horses. Designed by Tom Russell, Prepotent blends the short term tactical thinking found in its streamlined racing mechanisms with the long term strategy of horse breeding. Additional intrigue is found in the betting mechanisms: Do you want your horse to strive for only second place so the opponents lose their bets?<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has two horses: one stallion and one mare. When players breed horses, they breed their mare to other players' stallions, and each player can set a stud fee for how much this costs. Players must decide if they want to breed a new stallion or new mare; with a new mare, desirable traits will last longer, but with a superior stallion, races are more likely to be won in the immediate future.<br/><br/>Players can bet on each horse to win, place, or show. Money is made both by successful bets and by the player's own horse placing well in races. In addition, the older a player's horse is, the slower it becomes, but the more money it makes if it places well in races.<br/><br/>Each horse has a set of traits, and when a new horse is bred, the most desirable traits are what players strive for.  Parent horses that are genetically compatible can offer gene traits superior to unmatched mates.  Each of these traits represents an action the horse is required to take during the course of the race.  Each race is four rounds long, and each horse has four traits, so each horse will use every one of its traits, helpful or hindering.<br/><br/>Players acquire money by setting stud fees that other players must pay to breed with their stallions, winning bets on races, and having their own horse place well in races.  The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Here's more details.<br/>It's 1754 and there's news of the impending war between France and Great Britain. But that's in Europe and between Kings and there aren&rsquo;t any Kings in North America. Life for both the French and British colonists is tough enough with trying to stabilize their respective frontiers and dealing with the local Indian tribes is a delicate balancing act. No, let the Kings fight amongst themselves across the pond. It's not my fight.<br/>Or at least it wasn't until today. Word has spread along the frontier of open conflict. The tribes are choosing sides and the militias mobilizing. Settlements are suffering brutal raids causing harsh retaliation in kind. The frontier's aflame with war! The Kings may not be here but their war is and while many sides can lose only one side will win. <br/>WHICH SIDE WILL YOU CHOOSE?<br/>In Muskets and Mohawks you can choose from two sides with a total of four factions. You can be:<br/>&bull;    British Regulars <br/>&bull;    French Regulars <br/>&bull;    British Allied Indians <br/>&bull;    French Allied Indians <br/>Whichever you choose you must lead one or more units of men through the war, the French and Indian War, fighting when needed because it's all about victory and glory, and in some cases, just survival!<br/>The war drums are beating, the militias mustering, and now it's become your fight.

Your role is to gain fame and fortune while leading a small band of men through encounters and adventures. You will gain fortune by hunting and trapping wild animals and fame based on your exploits and success. During your adventures you will meet friends and confront enemies. You start out independent not taking sides in the conflict but staying that way may be a challenge. <br/>Long Rifle is compatible with Muskets and Mohawks, the unit based game of the French and Indian War. When combined think of them as the movie, Last of the Mohicans. For the large battle in the field where the Indians ambush the British you would use Muskets and Mohawks. For the smaller actions such as the ending of the movie Long Rifle is perfect. Both sets may be used for the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and any other period that used black powder.<br/><br/>An immersion game is one where the players take the role of individual characters trying to gain experience and rewards that will allow them to grow in abilities. Although immersion games share some common elements with Role-Playing Games (RPGs) there is a dramatic difference. The difference between immersion games and Role-Playing Games is that in an immersion game you have a combat system that can be used alone to recreate small skirmishes in a realistic manner. Think the Last of the Mohicans movie or the Sharpe's Rifles television series covering the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>",

The Attack on the West, 1940.  The difference in this 1940 game is the advent of massed armor groups and airpower, and the dramatically different pace of events demonstrates the difference in outcome of the German offensives in the respective world wars.  The teaching/learning value of playing the two games and being able to directly contrast the two campaigns - the simpler, introductory France 1914 first, of course - is considerable.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WBC-The Board Game is a game for 3-5 players, who will share the fun of the week-long World Boardgaming Championships, contesting convention events in a quest for Laurels and competing for the ultimate prize: The title of Caesar. Players must manage their time wisely.  They must remember to carve out a moment between games to sleep and eat while dodging convention pitfalls &ndash; including other competitors, unfortunate circumstances, and the occasional dreaded phone call from home.  After six days of gaming -- when the games are all packed up and the competitors are headed for home &ndash; WBC players compare accumulated Laurels.  Highest score is Caesar, a proven boardgaming champion worthy of praise!<br/><br/>The six turns of WBC-The Board Game, each one representing a day at the convention.  Each day/turn proceeds in the following sequence first the Day&rsquo;s Events are determined, Players then Schedule their day (ie pick which Events to attend), next the Players in turn order select specific Events or spaces to resolve (ie allow Event attendees to compete in that Event or spend time at a recovery space such as Pool Side hoping to recover some much needed Energy or satiate their Hunger).  Finally, at the close of the day/turn all Players participate in one final Event, the Late Night Event, where success often comes at a price.<br/><br/>Additionally Players will be assigned an Alter Ego card that represents their &ldquo;Player Type&rdquo; at the convention.  Player types range from the Eurogamer, to the Emerging Talent, the Superior Players, or the Late Night King.  Each Player type provides two abilities to the Player, one a typical benefit common to the Alter Ego Type being played and one a unique benefit for that Alter Ego.<br/><br/>Finally, convention attendees compete at WBC for a variety of reasons.  WBC-The Board Game represents this with Convention Focus markers.  The Convention Focus is a secret objective the Player is attempting to complete by game&rsquo;s end and depending upon their level of success rewards the Player with a number of additional Laurels.<br/><br/>Each copy of WBC-The Board Game includes the following:<br/><br/>- One 22-by-34&rdquo; game board.<br/>- W &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Your Game&rdquo; deck, featuring many of the<br/>games you&rsquo;ll play at WBC.<br/>- B &ldquo;Build Your Skill&rdquo; deck, featuring mostly<br/>useful items which will aid your quest<br/>to be Caesar.<br/>- C &ldquo;Competitors&rdquo; deck, featuring many of the<br/>competitors who will provide a helpful<br/>boost -- or stand in your way --<br/>throughout the week.<br/>- 55 player cubes, 11 each in five colors.<br/>- 15 dice, three each in five colors.<br/>- 60 convention focus markers.<br/>- 95 laurel tokens.<br/>- Six two-sided alter-ego player aids<br/>- One turn marker.<br/>- One 12-page rulebook.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Karaokards is a new, fun, social card game, inspired by karaoke and based on the songs in your head. It offers two completely different ways to play, both based around playing cards that describe elements of a song.<br/><br/>One ruleset enables a traditional card game, gathering friends around a table (and can involve drunken singing, but doesn't have to). Players are dealt five cards. Each card contains two &quot;clues&quot; to a song -- for example &quot;Artist begins with B&quot; or &quot;Genre: Rock&quot;. In each turn players play a card and build on a central tower of these clues, defining a song (of the player's choice, which may be switched turn by turn). As the tower gets bigger so it becomes harder and harder to find a song that matches all the clues. If a player cannot play a card they pass; the winner of the round is the last player able to play a card, and they score the number of cards in the tower as points.<br/><br/>The other game is something completely new: a game for teams or individuals to play during karaoke. Players are dealt five cards. Again, each card contains two &quot;clues&quot; to a song, but this time the players must combine as many cards as they can within their own hand to come up with a song to sing. Once they've chosen a song they add it to the playlist. When it's their turn to sing they announce the clues they chose and score points for each card they managed to use. During the song, other players may &quot;duet&quot; and score points for their own cards that match their song. When the song is finished players who have sung refresh their hands from the draw pile.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has scored the most cards when the draw pile has been exhausted and the playlist completed.<br/><br/>",

As your ship orbits the Earth, use celestial mechanics, and your ship's thrust, sensors, and weapons to close in, target, and attack your opponent - before they do the same to you!<br/><br/>Players control one or more ships orbiting the Earth in one of several discrete orbits.  Turns are meant to simulate simultaneous action.  On each turn, (a) the players (optionally) move using thrust, or let the ships continue in their present orbit, (b) attempt to locate and detect an enemy using sensors, (c) once a detection is successful, attack the opposing ship using weapons, and (d) defend against attacks and tally up inflicted damage.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player's ships are destroyed, or one player is able to retreat by de-orbiting and successfully re-entering the atmosphere to land on Earth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In September of '43 Italy became the pivot around which revolved the fate of World War II. After the fall of Mussolini and the declaration of war to Germany, Italy overthrew the course of the war. Playing Resistance you can choose to control the partisans, aiming to spread over the country to get consensus and support. Or you can step into the role of the Axis, trying to stifle resistance or discredit it.<br/><br/>Resistance is a strategic light wargame with historical and political elements for 2 players, which assume the role of the forces of the Axis or the Partisans. The game map outlines the North of Italy, enclosed to the south by the Gothic Line.<br/><br/>When playing Resistance you should give up concepts such as the &quot;front line&quot; and &quot;grouping military forces&quot;. On the opposite, Axis and partisan must aim to spread themselves all over the country: the Axis should try to surround and round up the enemies, while the partisan should try to exercise political control over the population.<br/><br/>The Axis player controls a number of variable military units (about 20): the exact number depends by the political situation. The partesan player controls from 1 to 50 partesan units: the exact number dependes by the consensus coming from civilian population. The partesan player goal is to control the territory, in order to recruit more people than those dying each turn (which is inevitable). On average the partesan player should be able to recruit about 30-40 units of partesan fighters during a play, and lose about 10-20. This implies that the partesan ends the game with about 20 units. Since the Axis players has about the same number of units, the player having the number supremacy at the end of the play wins the game.<br/><br/>Resistance is based on very light wargame concepts. The actual game engine is the struggle for getting control over territory and raising population support.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>たねまき (Tanemaki) is a card game from Hoy Games that bears similarity to Bohnanza in theme and scoring, but the basic gameplay is significantly different.<br/><br/>The similarities are:<br/>Players are farmers growing different crops in up to two fields.<br/><br/>When these crops are harvested, they turn over into coins (Hoyer) according to the distribution on the crop. The design of the cards looks similar to Bohnanza in this respect.<br/><br/>The difference is the way cards are distributed. The active player draws a hand of cards from the draw deck, drawing the number of players plus one. They choose an opponent and pass them a seed card face-down in secret. That player has three options: to either plant it face-up in their own field, or place it face-up in the Storehouse in front of the active player, or pass it face-down to another player who is still in the round (who then has the same options but cannot pass it back). Once a player plants a seed card in a field, they are out for the round. Eventually, all the other players will have planted a seed card, or added the seed card to a field with that crop. The active player is left to choose their seed card from what is left in their hand or what is in the Storehouse (which can store 2 cards). The remaining card is discarded. The turn passes left to the new active player.<br/><br/>If a player has their two fields occupied, and has to plant a seed which does not match the two crops, they must harvest one crop. As well as the seed cards, there are manure cards which act as Jokers. Planted cards are staggered to show how many are in a field, so any Manure cards go at the back of the stagger.<br/><br/>Play ends when the active player cannot draw enough cards to distribute. The player with the most money winds, ties are broken by owning the most of the rarest plants.<br/><br/>So whilst Tanemaki has obvious connections to Bohnanza, the game play is calculated and based on hand management from the card draft, and no bartering is involved.<br/><br/>The 2nd edition includes English rules. The differences between the 1st and 2nd editions are:<br/>- Redesigned the box<br/>- Reduced card size<br/>- Improved card quality<br/>- Redesigned the back of the cards<br/><br/>Publisher summary:<br/>プレイヤーは農家となり、野菜の種を集めます。<br/>種が必要な量までまかれたらお金を得ることができます。<br/>一番お金を多く獲得できた人が勝者となります。<br/><br/>You are a farmer, who's trying to grow vegetables.<br/>Collect the seeds, plant as many as possible and then harvest them for coins.<br/>The player with the most coins wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The data within became the core of the ground-breaking design, Tobruk: Tank Battles in North Africa 1942.<br/><br/>Years later, an MIT-grad and devotee saw the potential of reverse-engineering the 'programmed instruction' rules; the result is something that brings back the approach to tank vs. tank warfare, and keeps the approach true, creating a truly unique system of recreating the war in North Africa and beyond.<br/><br/>BRL 1192: Tobruk Deprogrammed is an enhanced edition of the original Tobruk; the heart of the game remains the same, but now it can be enjoyed with a deprogrammed 24-page rulebook, revised play aids, a comprehensive selection of counters representing the men, weapons and machinery of WWII North Africa, plus a collection of geomorphic maps and new terrain overlays.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carteso is a finite territory game for two players: Vertical and Horizontal. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The suggested board sizes are between 9x9 and 13x13 points. Both players must have access to a sufficient supply of stones in two colors and vertical and horizontal markers.<br/><br/>Carteso was inspired by a conversation with Corey L. Clark. The game's name was suggested by David Stoner.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto adjacent stones of its color.<br/><br/>A group, regardless of color, is owned by Vertical if it spans more rows than columns, and by Horizontal if it spans more columns than rows. Groups that span exactly as many rows as columns are owned by the opponent of the player who most recently placed a stone on the board.<br/><br/>To claim a group is to place a marker of yours on top of one of its stones.<br/><br/>A group is finished if its vertical and horizontal dimensions cannot grow larger by means of any series of placements on empty points.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayVertical plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, pass or place a stone of any color on an empty point. After a placement, let every unclaimed finished group be claimed by its current owner.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score wins. Your score is the total number of stones on the board in groups you have claimed, plus komi in the case of Horizontal. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points that is added to Horizontal's score as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.<br/><br/>The button is a special token that is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a regular move. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game based on the Paranoia RPG.<br/><br/>You live underground in a giant complex controlled by a paranoid computer. This complex is called Alpha Complex. The Computer is your friend. Traitors are executed. Good Citizens help root out Traitors. Mutants are traitors. Secret Society members are traitors. You are a Mutant and a Secret Society Member. You know very little because of your (Red) low security clearance. You have been assigned to a team of Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters shoot trouble. Stay Alert! Trust No One! Keep your Laser Handy!<br/><br/>Each player has a family of 6 clones. Every time your clone is killed, one of your remaining clones takes his place. When all six have been killed you lose and are out of the game. Players try to survive while killing off their opponent&rsquo;s clones.<br/><br/>There are 2 decks: The Mission Deck and The Paranoia Deck.  Cards are of 4 types: Combat, Comprehension, Communication and Treason.<br/><br/>Each turn has 4 Phases:<br/><br/>1.  Requisition Phase<br/>-   Each player fills their hand to 5 cards from the Paranoia Deck.<br/><br/>2.  Mission Phase<br/>-   Flip over the top card of the Mission Deck. This describes an encounter all players must face. The encounter will be one of three types: Combat, Comprehension, or Communication. Each player must play (discard) one Paranoia card of a matching type to survive. If a player cannot play a matching card his Clone is killed.<br/><br/>3.  Action Phase<br/>-   The current player may initiate one or more actions. Actions require the expenditure of Paranoia cards. He may continue doing this until he has no cards left in his hand.  The Actions include: <br/>&bull;   Situational Awareness: Discard 2 Comprehension cards to draw 3 Paranoia cards and put them in your hand. <br/>&bull;   Accusations: Play one or more Treason cards onto an opponent. The opponent may play Communication cards to discard Treason cards on a one to one basis.  If a player has 3 or more Treason cards and no way to discard them, that clone is immediately terminated by the computer. <br/>&bull;   Shoot the Traitor: The player picks a target opposing player who has at least <br/>one Treason card. Both play combat cards from their hands. The player who plays more combat cards kills the opposing player. If both play an equal number of cards then roll 1D6: The higher roll wins. If still tied, both are killed. <br/>&bull;   Special Actions: Some cards allow for special actions when played. These special actions (SA) are described on the individual cards. <br/>-    All played cards from Action Phase are discarded.<br/><br/>4.  Debriefing Phase<br/>-   Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard any excess cards.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to kill off all your opponents&rsquo; clones and be the last one alive.<br/><br/>",

The only way to get back to life is to appease the God of Life. The God of Life seeks sacrifice, but not of the physical kind. You must speak witty sentences and entertain for your passage home.<br/><br/>Letters appear before you, made from the bones of those who disappointed. Each word in your sentence must start with these letters. The God of Life loves certain keywords. If you can secretly put a keyword from a Key Card into your sentence then you gain a Body Part. Collect all 5 to win.<br/><br/>However, the God of Death is also listening. If other players can guess your keyword then they take your Body Parts. Can you outwit the God of Death and entertain the God of Life with some Good Interesting Fun Times?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gryphon couriers have always been the backbone of trade in Dsyx. Fast, discreet, and formadible in the face of pirates and bandits. But Gnomish airships, Dwarven &quot;Grease Tunnels&quot; and the ever improving field of teleportation magic has left gryphon-run delivery services hustling for work. Coordinate your last few couriers on the most profitable run possible, contending with unpredictable winds, mischevious fairies, and coniving goblins, and maybe you won't have to close your doors.<br/><br/>Gryphon Delivery Service is a solitaire roll-and-write game where players attempt to move three characters -- gryphon couriers -- along a track from start to finish, while picking up and dropping off various items to turn a profit. Each space either yields an item, allows an item to be sold, or represents an encounter with one of the Dsyx world's various races that can offer players a windfall... or catastrophe. Instead of being sold outright, items can also be used instead to influence various markets, raising prices for (hopeful) future sales. Players must manage each of their characters, their special abilities, and their inventories well, because as soon as the first character reaches the end of the track, the game is over, and any items that were left undelivered represent lost opportunities to make precious gold.<br/><br/>The easy part is getting to the end of the game. The hard part is having anything to show for it. Succeed, and the courier service will live to see another day; fail, and hard-working gryphons will blame YOU for their unemployment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Released in the July 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

And now we've answered with this 24-scenario supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series, complete with 130 playing pieces. Certainly each side had difficulty bringing sufficient force to bear, and both German and Italian leaders thought they could continue the war in the western desert after Alamein. Significant events would have to place in other theaters of war to allow the Italian Navy to maintain supply lines across the Mediterranean and prevent the United States from bringing its massive resources to bear.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If you were picked on your entire life, would you consider finding a way to fight back?  In Kobolds Vs. Goblins that's what happens! When the leader of a small tribe of Kobolds has finally had enough of being picked on and ridiculed, he comes up with a plan.  Not just &quot;a&quot; plan, &quot;the&quot; plan!  If the ones picking on him are doing it because they are stronger and bigger than him, he'll find someone bigger and stronger than THEM!<br/><br/>It's a foolproof plan.  He decides to swear allegiance to the Mightiest of them all, the great red dragon.  But, he knows he can't just go alone.  The great red dragon wouldn't even bat an eye at a single Kobold seeking to join his ranks.  The plan calls for a much larger number of Kobolds to show up and wear their allegiance.  He isn't sure, but he thinks 30 sounds like a pretty large number.<br/><br/>So, the plan, to reiterate, is to recruit 30 Kobolds to join the cause and follow the great red dragon, then, make fun of all the ones that have made fun of us because we'll have the protection of the great red dragon!<br/><br/>This is the perfect plan, well it was!  Unfortunately, the Goblins (Another of the puny races that always gets picked on and our bitter rivals) heard about &quot;the plan&quot;.  The Goblins have decided to copy the plan and only change one little detail... they are going to swear allegiance to the Great Orcish Chieftain!  How dare they steal the plan that took me the whole time I was on the poop pot!<br/><br/>The plan has changed, well, no, not really.  But now we have to do it faster than them!  Then, we'll have the great red dragon smoosh those little green meanies!<br/><br/>Oh, I've gone on a tangent haven't I?<br/><br/>Ahem...<br/><br/>You'll love the fast paced nature of Kobolds Vs. Goblins with the rapid dice rolls, the press-your-luck mechanics blended perfectly with Roll &amp; Write tracking system for a sweet 5-15 minute game that you'll want to play again and again.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It features wild pop culture-rich artwork on large OVERSIZED glossy linen cards making it unlike anything else that has come before.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need all your wits and gaming skills to employ BOUNTY HUNTERS, BANDITS, BURGLARS, HEROES, MONSTERS, and a WITCH to capture high-value BAD GUY targets. Battle your opponent to steal their captures while defending your own.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to score points by capturing the most Bad Guy Cards before the deck runs out. You'll need to get the right card combos to make a capture and score points. The higher the value target, the harder the combo is to acquire. You make captures and score points while the SPECIAL CARDS (HEROES, BURGLAR, BANDIT, WITCH, MONSTER) all cause massive havoc between you and your opponent(s). The game gets intense as each turn passes because once the deck runs out, the game is over. When this happens, uncaptured BAD GUYS count as negative points. So you'll want to start discarding them when the deck runs low! However, your opponent(s) may be able to pick them up and use it against you...

Strange lights burning within. One final effort and then no more. One final no more.<br/><br/>Tower of Silence is a dark and brutal game of abandoned hope and apocalyptic prophecy. Players take on the roles of shipwrecked souls washing ashore at the base of a mountainous tower slowly crumbling away into the icy seas. Drawn like moths to the flame that burns high above, they begin a long and harrowing climb which will either see them lost in the shadows of death or transformed in the fires of prophecy.<br/><br/>Each turn players take control of a new soul (up to a maximum of three souls per player) and roll their starting hope and location. As souls crawl about and make various efforts, their hope dwindles, and once it is all gone, they become shadows of death further draining the hope of those who follow after them. If a soul manages to reach the top of the tower, the player controlling it burns the corresponding standee in a black candle and draws a prophetic uttering. Once all souls have either abandoned hope or been consigned to the flames, the utterings are lined up to produce a unique prophecy for that game only.<br/><br/>Tower of Silence is the first installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope which continues with Iron Mountain and Pesta. It comes with a dedicated soundtrack (Stilhedens T&aring;rn) recorded and released by dungeon synth artist Offermose. Players are encouraged to listen to the album as they play.

        "description": "The board game is based on the film WolfWalkers.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE FILM<br/><br/>In a time of superstition and magic, a young apprentice hunter, Robyn Goodfellowe, journeys to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last wolf pack. While exploring the forbidden lands outside the city walls, Robyn befriends a free-spirited girl, Mebh, a member of a mysterious tribe rumored to have the ability to transform into wolves by night. As they search for Mebh&rsquo;s missing mother, Robyn uncovers a secret that draws her further into the enchanted world of the WOLFWALKERS and risks turning into the very thing her father is tasked to destroy.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE BOARD GAME<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to find three parts of the wolf soul in one colour and bring it back to the Lair before soldiers, who start in the town area on one side of the board, reach the Lair on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>The central board has a grid (called road) with fields marked with four different symbols. Some of the fields are connected with a path to the area with stacks of tiles. There are rune symbols at each intersection which represent the runes players collect during the game to buy the tiles. The grid is divided into three town areas with two fields marked for soldiers at the top of the board and nine forest areas at the bottom with the Lair area where players start the game &ndash; each with their own Wolfwalker figure.<br/><br/>Each area has a stack with a certain number of tiles which depends on the mode players choose. In general, there are four types of tiles: a) tiles that move soldiers toward the Lair; b) wolf souls that the players try to find (three parts in three colours); c) tiles that help players find the wolf souls or change the soldier movements and d) neutral tiles. Each game mode adds some tiles or changes their meaning.<br/><br/>On their turn, the player rolls a die and moves along any road. They have to stop on the first field with a symbol matching the symbol on the die. Then they count the rune symbols they passed on their way and take the rune tokens which are used to buy the tiles. It is possible to get more than one rune in one turn (if you pass two rune symbols, you get two runes, etc.). If the field they ended their movement on is connected with a path to a stack of tiles, they reveal the top tile(s). If they reveal a soldier tile, they have to move one of the soldiers in the direction shown on the tile. If the tile has a price (wolf souls, tiles that help players) the player can buy it with runes they collected. If the bought tile is a wolf soul, they place it in front of them. If it is any other tile, they have to use it immediately (e.g., you have another turn; move one of the soldiers in any direction).<br/><br/>Additionally, there are two special symbols on the die that allow players to either reveal any top tile on the board or buy any revealed tile on the board.<br/><br/>The game has three cooperative game modes with each adding additional rules and new tiles (e.g., look at the top tile of any stack, then place it on top of any pile face down) or more soldier tiles to make the game more difficult. The fourth mode is the competitive mode with the player who collects the completed wolf soul and brings it back to the Lair first winning.<br/><br/>At the end of the rules you can also find achievements (e.g., win three games in a row, play solo with two Wolfwalker figures) and challenges that change the rules a bit in a unique way (e.g., win with soldiers being at the two rune symbols at the top of the board at the end of the game; each player looks at two chosen stacks of tiles in secret before the game starts. For the rest of the game you cannot communicate.)<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Under Ten Flags starts early in 1939 when the German merchant raider Atlantis made its way into the South Atlantic to sink and capture Allied cargo vessels. Its crew used their skill in disguising the appearance of the vessel to aid its encounters or avoid enemy warships. The journey of the raider Atlantis lasted for over 600 days and traveled over 100,000 miles.<br/><br/>Follows the 100,000 mile journey of the German &quot;auxiliary cruiser&quot; Atlantis, a &quot;merchant raider&quot; capable of changing its shaped and configuration as well as its flags.  Atlantis is probably the most successful merchant raider of all times when combining total tonnage sunk and how long it forced the Royal Navy to chase it; plus, it captured documents of strategic importance that actually impacted the war.  The &quot;adventure&quot; sounds like something from a movie, and in fact, did inspire one from which our title comes.  Each player is challenged to &quot;do better&quot; than their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Endbringers summon monsters from myth and nightmare, breeding hybrids that can destroy an enemy's forces, eventually building up enough power to destroy the world. After a world is destroyed, the Endbringers travel through dimensional portals to other, parallel worlds where the contest begins again.<br/><br/>Hecatomb's unusual stacking mechanic gives the game a three-dimensional feel. Five-sided Hecatomb cards depict a variety of horrid creatures, from terrible beasts and demons to crazed shamans.

        "description": "Released on February 24, 2006, this expansion added 72 cards to the base Hecatomb collectible card game, with a theme of extraterrestrial invasion.<br/><br/>The base game description via the Wizards of the Coast website:<br/><br/>In Hecatomb, each player is an Endbringer, an evil genius bent on the destruction of the modern-day world. Endbringers summon monsters from myth and nightmare, breeding hybrids that can destroy an enemy's forces, eventually building up enough power to destroy the world. After a world is destroyed, the Endbringers travel through dimensional portals to other, parallel worlds where the contest begins again.<br/><br/>Hecatomb's unusual stacking mechanic gives the game a three-dimensional feel. Five-sided Hecatomb cards depict a variety of horrid creatures, from terrible beasts and demons to crazed shamans. Cards feature four clear edges, with scores for power and abilities on the fifth edge. Players can create frightening creature hybrids called Abominations by stacking cards on top of each other. Each Abomination combines the powers and special abilities of all the creatures used to assemble it.

        "description": "Freedom Rings is a game based on the idea that an economy is a community that can be free and fair to all. The richest don&rsquo;t always win and victory is what you choose it to be. The game board is inspired by a thriving city; with the greatest land values in its heart, medium land values in the suburbs, and the lowest land values in the rural areas. Freedom Rings&rsquo; blends economics, ease of play, and short time to finish.<br/><br/>Each player receives the 7 goal cards and chooses a single goal card to secretly play.  The game is played with the 3 playing pieces, one for each of the three property rings. Before each turn, the player must choose which ring to play. The first time a player plays a ring, if it&rsquo;s with a die roll, the playing piece starts at the Pay Interest Street.  The playing pieces move clockwise around the board. Every turn, except for the first turn and power plays, requires a die roll. The die roll isn&rsquo;t to determine what property you claim, but to keep players moving around the board and to see if rent is due to another player.<br/><br/>When the game begins, all players have no money, no property, and no debt. Acquiring property is the way for a player to achieve their goal. The community is the bank, so players will volunteer to watch the flows of cash and debt as needed. Turn by turn, players accumulate properties. Tactics to win can include the following: acquiring properties after a die roll, purchasing other property, consolidating properties, trading acquired property for vacant property trading with other players.  Other tactics become available as the game&rsquo;s economy grows and include earning the ability to change production point values, interest rates, and even your chosen goal. Only the wiliest will make the most of what is freely given in this game.<br/><br/>A player wins by achieving a goal chosen from seven goal cards available. Victory can be had with much wealth, or little wealth,  depending upon the chosen card. Players claim property squares on the board with every turn until they&rsquo;ve acquired what&rsquo;s needed as stated on their chosen goal card. Final scoring is calculated with the value for each property square, less the player&rsquo;s debt.<br/><br/>",

The multimedia conglomerate Time Travel Entertainment Inc. uses propietary technology to deploy its patented actor-bots anywhere in time and space.<br/><br/>With a complex goal and minimal programming, the hapless bots are turned loose for the audience's delight.<br/><br/>Each installment of their unscripted adventures is broadcast to trillions of eager viewers hungry for scenes of heoric triumph and hilarious failure.<br/><br/>In Time Travel Entertainment, Inc. players take on the roles of actor-bots. Choose the action from one of your CPUs for your next devious plan and share it with your fellow actors. If they do not approve you will need to rethink and try again, but once you have impressed them, use the die to find out if you plan succeeded. Beware - failing may damage your CPUs, removing them from the game. Achieve your goals or outlast the other actor-bots to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Before play begins, all players must agree together on what the premise of their robots' adventure in this game will be. To do this they must answer three simple questions:<br/><br/>     Where did they travel to?<br/>     What year did they travel to?<br/>     What are they trying to do?<br/><br/><br/>Each player will select a robot type and take all three CPU cards. Select a player to set the scene with a short narration and then play begins with the player to their left.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will take exactly one action from your available CPU cards actions. Once you've chosen your action, explain to the group how you are going to use that action and the outcome you hope it will achieve. The player to your right will then decide if your proposed action is reasonable.<br/><br/>If your action is denied, you must choose a different action or a different resolution. If your action is approved, rotate the card so that a new action is available and roll the die to see if it succeeds. Your odds of success are based upon which CPU your action is coming from.<br/><br/>If your die roll was successful, you plan works. The player to your right narrates your success. If your action fails, they narrate exactly how you ended up failing. Then they narrate some consequences.<br/><br/>If you fail, roll a six-sided die to see if your failure results in any damage, by losing a CPU of your choice.<br/><br/>If a player loses their last CPU, they are dead and out of the game. Play continues until either you all accomplish your goal or everyone dies by losing all their CPUs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "そして深海魚は０になる (Soshite Shinkaigyo ha 0 ninaru) is a card game from Japan, and means something like 'And The Deep Sea Fish Becomes Zero'. Players are trying to get their tableau of cards down to the lowest total. If a top and bottom row card match, those two equal zero. At the end of the game, the lowest total score wins.<br/><br/>The deck is numbered 1 to 8, with one 1, two 2s, three 3s and so on. Each number is a different sea creature.<br/><br/>Players have a tableau of six cards face-down in two rows of three. Two are turned up and the highest total starts. On their turn, a player draws either from the deck or from the discard pile. The player then uses the drawn card to replace an existing card in their tableau. The new card goes face-up, the old card goes face-up to the discard. If the player drew from the draw pile, they can discard it instead.<br/><br/>In this way, cards gradually get turned up. The game ends when either the draw deck is exhausted, or a player has all six cards face-up. The totals are calculated, and the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>However, the game has certain twists. For example, the 4 card is actually -4. The 5 card forces another player to turn up a card, possibly ending the sooner.

The investigation, the negotiations with the rest of the cast and the exchange of information are fundamental pieces to solve the crime, but we must not forget that the murderer is one of you. You cannot believe everything they tell you, but neither can you win without trusting someone ... Enjoy this unique experience that, although used only once, will leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>England, late 16th century. A man is found dead in a town in the English countryside, apparently after his executioner plunged his head into the river that runs next to the inn where he was staying. The guests, the white witch so beloved in the municipality and the employees of the establishment themselves look at each other suspiciously trying to identify the culprit.<br/><br/>",

If you want to serve orders, give the customers their food and get those sweet coins, and be quick, as the customers are hungry and will punish you if you are too slow.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Who will be the Califfo, the one who manages to seduce the most and most beautiful women?<br/><br/>Everyone takes his best car, prepares to pay for dinners and bouquets of flowers, makes the most of his qualities of beauty, poetry, sympathy, and even imagines a few lies. And, given that it is a challenge, even putting a spanner in the works of others is legitimate&hellip;<br/><br/>Il Califfo is a game in which the protagonists compete for all the free girls who are around for each evening of their holiday, making the most of the qualities of their characters and the resources represented by the cards in their hands. Approaching the most beautiful can be a temptation, but be careful: a girl is not always as charming as she seems at first sight, and sometimes she can hide real surprises, positive or negative!<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER<br/><br/>Il Califfo is a diseducative and politically incorrect game, but any criticism in this sense is rejected as idle by the authors. Most games aim to variously kill and/or massacre your opponent, when it's not about crushing the world under the heel of your own armies. Acting as a Don Juan and collecting women like trophies is not very edifying, but trying to make love with consenting girls is still considered by the authors to be less unseemly than breaking people's heads.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook (translated)<br/><br/>",

This process is repeated with the 3 questions on the question card. The round is won by whoever scored the most points. If there's a tie, the Bachelor decides who deserves the win based on their overall answers. The winner then reveals their Monster Card. The Monster Cards from the winning Romantic Interest and the Bachelor are placed together and each player scores an extra point.<br/><br/>The Bachelor role is passed to the next player and a new round begins. Play as many rounds as it takes for everyone to have been the Bachelor at least once. Whoever won the most points overall wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shinobu no Gakkō, roughly, Shinobu School, is a climbing game where each player has two hands of cards and is adding and removing cards from a central tableau.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of cards, and then divide, as they'd like between a closed hand they hold traditionally, and a face up hand on the table.<br/><br/>Two cards are dealt face up to the table that form the initial cards the players will add or subtract from. Players can play higher or lower cards than are currently on the table, and play them to that end of the column. Players must play at least the same number of cards as what is present at that end, but could play more. If one end of the column has more cards than the other, that end is &quot;locked&quot; and cards cannot be removed or added. As an alternate to playing, players can remove the last cards from either end of the column.<br/><br/>Each turn players get to take one of these actions (or pass) with both of their hands.<br/><br/>The first player to play all of their cards wins the round and is granted points; the other players lose points depending upon the sets left in their hands.<br/><br/>The person with the most points after a number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Martin, A Clash of Arms<br/><br/>Spoils of War is the first Chapter Pack in the &quot;Conquest and Defiance&quot; cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game. In Spoils of War, each of the six Great Houses of Westeros enjoy the plunder and glories of their victories...even as those trophies place them at risk to lose their positions of power. Among the Chapter Pack's sixty cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards), you'll find captives, spies, vengeful schemes, righteous fury, and deadly, crippling treachery.<br/><br/>Many of the new cards from Spoils of War feature the &quot;prized&quot; keyword, which balances tremendous risks and rewards in deck-building and play. These cards lend material, in-game value to the riches you plunder, the captives you seize, and the castles you successfully siege. But can you hold them once you win them? Prized cards give your opponents power when they enter your discard or dead piles, so it&rsquo;s up to you to leverage your spoils toward victory!<br/><br/>",

After a nuclear meltdown at a power plant, the lake next to it was quickly saturated with radioactivity.  An alligator in the lake transforms into a road smashing, car crushing monster.  Be the first to build your roadway and drive your car from ground zero to your home base to win the game.  Beware of the monster and of your opponents.  No one is safe on Monster Highway!<br/><br/>To start players are all dealt at random 5 road tiles and 1 monster buster card for their hand.<br/><br/>On your turn roll the two specialty dice that have images of a car, monster or road. If road comes up, play a road tile from your hand. If a car comes up, roll the six sided die to see how many spaces your car can move. If monster comes up, draw a monster card and see what space the &quot;monster&quot; lands on.<br/><br/>The goal is to create a roadway out of road tiles that leads from the center of the board &quot;ground zero&quot; to the players home base. The players car moves along the road built and once the car makes it to home base, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The active player knows (most of time) the exact height and asks others for the good card to add to his own ladder. Alas, he can only speak with 2 words : &ldquo;More&rdquo; or &ldquo;Less&rdquo;. More, the princess as well as the current page of the story book tell the players how to save her.<br/><br/>When each player ended the round, ladders are added and the total is compared to the dungeon height. If equal, princess is saved, otherwise, dragon takes the princess away and players turn another page of the story book. At the end of the book, if all princesses are not saved, the game is over and lost.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s some variant rules in the booklet to increase game length and/or difficulty.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Units can represent anything from battalions to brigades and are made up of a number of stands.  As losses are taken stands of figures are removed and the unit is forced to take morale tests, multiple failures remove the entire unit.<br/><br/>The rules are broken down into basic and optional rules - at the most basic level the game is fast and simple, the optional rules add more detail and realism but also add more time to the game play.<br/><br/>",

The final production version of the Bf.109 was the K series, or &ldquo;Kurf&uuml;rst.&rdquo; Externally similar to the G series, it had a large number of internal and aerodynamic changes that improved its effectiveness and remedied existing flaws, which kept it competitive against rival fighters.<br/><br/>Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&ndash;4 (9./JG3)<br/>Belonging to the proud Jagdgeschwader 9, which fought throughout the war, this Bf.109 defended German borders from the Allied advance.<br/><br/>Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&ndash;4 (1./JG77)<br/>Jagdgeschwader 77 used the last version of Bf.109 to fight in the Reichsverteidigung (defense of the Reich) during the last days of WW2, to slow the inevitable German defeat.<br/><br/>Messerschmitt Bf.109 K&ndash;4 (Hartmann)<br/>Major Erich Hartmann, the greatest Ace of all time with 352 aerial victories, piloted many different airplanes, including the latest versions of Bf.109.<br/><br/>Each WW2 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scream, Aim, Fire Pacific! is a solo tactical game of squad-level combat set in the pacific theatre of WWII. The player takes the part of American infantry and armor pushing inland to take objectives, using a dice-roll action system that gives you a guaranteed number of actions each round, but not always of the exact type you need. A card-driven action system manages the Japanese defenders, including veteran units, machine-gun nests, pill boxes and even tanks. Victory is based on objectives and American Morale score, and game complications include lack of supplies and surprise Japanese reinforcements, so even on the edge of victory, it pays to be cautious. But with a time limit on every scenario, not too cautious. With five scenarios of increasing difficulty and complexity, Scream, Aim, Fire Pacific! is a challenge you will have to rise to and a challenger that is always ready for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to shed out all your tiles.<br/><br/>The unique twist to this game is that you can climb up or down the ranks depending on the combination lead to the play. Each player gets a double blank tile, which is a wild tile, to offer flexibility.<br/><br/>When you shed out, for each opponent with 5 or more tiles in their hands, you score bonus points. Therefore, you must skillfully shed out all your tiles while also denying others from getting bonus points.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by Sean Ross&rsquo;s domino games (Clackerjack, Daiquiri, and Fiddich). Pins &amp; Needles is a gentler introduction to those games by being easier to setup, quicker to parse through the hand, and without the complexities of partnership play.<br/><br/>",

Combat units represent anything from a wing (two or more companies) to a battalion. Each combat strength point represents 40 to 150 men, depending on the quality of training and weaponry.

        "description": "Disaster on Kangchenjunga (or &quot;K13&quot; for short) is the third game in Tom Decker's 'Disaster on' series.<br/><br/>A plane has crashed high up on the slopes of Kangchenjunga, the world&rsquo;s third highest mountain. One of the passengers was carrying plans that contain secrets that if exposed or delivered into the wrong hands, could threaten world security. Your nation has sent you to join an expedition intent on reaching the summit of Kangchenjunga (Kangch), but you have different orders. You must reach the plane wreck, find the secret plans, and continue the expedition as if you are just one of the team. However, there is a spy among you who will try to sabotage your efforts and steal the plans away from you. There may also be another nation&rsquo;s team on the mountain with similar interests. It&rsquo;s a race to the plane crash!<br/><br/>The game begins at midnight at High Camp on Kangch. You will control the movements for your entire team, most of whom are trying to reach the summit. Each turn, you will move climbers towards the summit (and plane crash) and then back down again. However, at some point in the game, the spy will be revealed, changing the rules drastically and forcing you to make decisions about who will summit, who will find and protect the secret plans, and who will try to just survive!<br/><br/>Your decisions will not only determine the lives of your climbers, but may also stop the Cold War from heating up. Think you have what it takes? Play Disaster on Kangchenjunga to find out!<br/><br/>",

They must do this by crossing bridges to leave the others behind.<br/><br/>There are 6 pieces on the board. You control a master piece and a servant piece.

Shedding their worldly possessions and symbolically greasing their hair with pig fat, these contrite Dwarfs seek only a pure death in combat against the most terrifying foes imaginable. Traditionally, they had sought their fate on the battlefield, but all of that changed when Grim Ironjaw joined the Black Mountain Blades.<br/><br/>Following a successful first season, Ironjaw spent several years moving from team to team, always striving to move up in the league rankings. After all, as he saw it, the most glorious death to be found on the pitch must surely be at the Blood Bowl itself, facing off against one of the NAF&rsquo;s most accomplished teams. In the years since he has yet to compete in the fabled tournament, but with each passing season, his chances are greater and his legend grows ever more impressive. Who knows &ndash; maybe this is his year!<br/><br/>Field Grim Ironjaw as a Star Player in your Dwarf Blood Bowl team with this resin kit. He&rsquo;s a particularly stocky example of Dwarf strength, with bulging muscles beneath a frankly glorious beard featuring plaited-in details (skulls! He has skulls in his beard!) His mohawk is tall, and his fist clutches a terrifying-looking blade &ndash; truly, he&rsquo;s an all-crushing Slayer and a half.<br/><br/>This resin miniature comes as 5 components, and is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl base.<br/><br/>",

Of course, you still want to have a lot of both, but now it is even more important to get exactly the ones you are missing.<br/><br/>You can specialize or work towards set bonuses. Colors also give bonus points, but more importantly, certain color combinations let you use powerful extra abilities. And if you weren't allowed to make any crosses, or you got exactly one die, you get to pick a special bonus, or save up for an even more powerful bonus.<br/><br/>So the question of which dice you get becomes even more important, and sometimes you may even want to intentionally not take any dice at all. So it's even more important that you keep an eye on the others and their cards!<br/><br/>All in all, depending on the card selection, there are a number of different strategies you can use to get the maximum points out of your slips.<br/><br/>There are also refill sets that include scoring blocks for both the base game and the expansion.<br/><br/>Translated from the crowdfunding page<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get ready for a blast from the past as Dominaria's heroes must launch an expedition into ancient history in order to stop the New Phyrexian planar invasion in the present day! This Magic: The Gathering expansion uses time travel as a framing device in order to revisit the epic conflict first glimpsed in 1994's Antiquities in the form of excavated artifacts. Nearly 30 years of real-time later, the continent-destroying war between the two brothers, Urza and Mishra, is finally getting its time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>The Brothers' War is packed with soldiers, armies, giant robots, and all the horror and destruction of mechanized warfare. It boasts two new mechanics: Prototype, which allows players to cast a less powerful version of an artifact at a lower mana cost; and Powerstones, artifact tokens that can tap for mana that can't be used to cast nonartifact spells. Joining them are the returning mechanics of Unearth (first seen in Shards of Alara) and Meld (first seen in Eldritch Moon).<br/><br/>Similar to the Timeshifted cards in Time Spiral or the Mystical Archive in Strixhaven: School of Mages, there is a bonus artifact sheet in The Brothers' War: every booster pack of The Brothers' War contains a reprint of a classic artifact, from Magic's past, in the retro frame.<br/><br/>Two preconstructed Commander decks featuring Urza and Mishra were released alongside the main set. Additionally, to play into the &quot;giant robots&quot; theme, this set also includes a crossover special in the form of 15 cards depicting characters from another Hasbro intellectual property about giant robots fighting: Transformers. These cards are not in draft boosters, but can be found in set boosters, collector boosters, and bundles.<br/><br/>",

They form Japan&lsquo;s more or less honourable group of food stall operators and hucksters. Once they&lsquo;ve paved the way for the notorious Yakuza, but no need to retire: the Tekiya are still around and active today. And, of course, they are all one &bdquo;big family&ldquo;. Except when talking money. Then they suddenly all turn into greedy bastards. And now this: Ichien san of the kakigori stall claims to make the best shaved ice, while all the other guys merely hawk inferior crap. Man, that means trouble! Anyone who publicly puts himself above the others is breaking law and order. No Tekiya will ignore that. But should you make a snitch out of yourself at the Oyabun and in the worst case lose your finger, Yubitsume style? No way! Breaking taboos is something you only do among yourselves &ndash; in an ominous corner of the park. And then, then, then it&lsquo;s dan ... dan ... dan! Which in our simple translation means &bdquo;Bang, bang, bang!&ldquo;. Here&rsquo;s the good thing: Whoever survives the shootout of the gun toting brawlers will have a few more food stalls in the near future.<br/><br/>IN PLAIN LANGUAGE: WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/>Quickly and in turn, you turn over cards from your own stack and place them face up in the centre of the table. There, a full arsenal of handguns accumulates. Every time a loaded gun is pointed at two of you with its grip and barrel, a shootout takes place. If you are shot &ndash; or make a mistake beforehand &ndash; you are punished and must take all the cards from the centre of the table. You grease the police with the top card, the rest go face down under your stack. Then you continue the game by turning over a new card. And on it goes...<br/><br/>The first player who has no cards left, wins the game.<br/><br/>In addition, various abstruse special cards fuel future game rounds and keep the game challenging.<br/>What more could you wish for?<br/><br/>",

Mammoth is a tile laying game that appeals to ages 8 and up. Players place tiles to grow their specific color of flowers and to increase the size of their path as their mammoth moves through the plains. The game has both competitive and co-operative versions of play.<br/><br/>To begin the game, players place their mammoth to begin a field of colorful flowers. At some point during the game they can also place their other prehistoric mammals to claim a path. Then as they take their turns players place an octagon tile or square tile to increase their color grouping or path.  They can score maximum points placing a tile directly next to their mammoth and growing more color groupings instead of just their own.  The last round starts when the last octagon tile is played. The winner is the player who gained the most points by successfully transforming the barren tundra.<br/><br/>In the co-op version of the game the players work together to accomplish a random color and path goal.  The players play as scientists planning how they are going to guide their mammoths through the park.  Players discuss what actions they want to take and then reveal the available actions for the turn.  Players then choose their actions without discussion and then complete them in turn order.

Plays in 30? minutes.<br/><br/>3 German Army Group, 4 Panzer Group, 2 Army, and 1 Panzer Korps pieces, plus a Romanians Army Group piece.<br/><br/>4 Russian operational Tank Groups - Rokossovsky, Lelyushenko, Katukov, Vatutin - 8 Fronts, and 1 Siberians pieces.<br/><br/>Simple, basic mechanics, but with lots of basic combat options.<br/><br/>Unlike Barbarossa Brief from which it was adapted, Postcard Barbarossa! uses a simple factor differential/comparison combat system which can be (and usually is) made nightmarishly unpredictable by a Special Factor Pressed Attack or Desperate Defense rule.

Then, you&rsquo;ll race against others to make a high-scoring crossword grid. Over three rounds, you&rsquo;ll try to maximize the scoring power of your personal letter set to win. Word games like Word Hustle &ndash; that let you move your letters around to find words &ndash; are incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>In this word game, you won't be sitting idly waiting for your turn. There's simultaneous word-building and player interaction in each phase &ndash; you can steal or share letters and make strategic moves to win.<br/><br/>Word Hustle&rsquo;s unique challenge of having to make new and better words with the same letters each round means the game gets MORE and MORE exciting. It turns out, the human brain loves this challenge. Word Hustle will lead you to consider moves like:<br/><br/>&bull; Should I steal that valuable tile or go for more tiles for myself?<br/>&bull; Should I make words quickly and put pressure on my opponents or take my time and make high-scoring words?<br/>&bull; Can I outscore my previous round using the same letters but new words?<br/><br/>The player with the most points after three rounds is the winner, unless they are challenged to an Ultimate Hustle! In the optional Ultimate Hustle, the winner hands over their letter set to see if their final round score can be outdone&hellip; But, it won't be easy &ndash; the challenger only has two minutes and can&rsquo;t use any of the words the winner used in the game.<br/><br/>",

One player plays with the japanese army and the other plays the Kuomintang Armed Forces. The game is played in only two turns, one for february and one for march. Each turn both players alternate in taking actions by expending logistic points until they exhaust their points or both players passes consecutively.<br/>The map depicts the countryside north of Shanghai, in a zonal map. The goal of the Japanese is to score enought victory points by occupying some key areas by the end of each turn or else eliminate all KMT troops from around Shanghai. The KMT wins elseway. The counters represent regiments or brigades, with few support counters.<br/><br/>In &quot;Shanghai / Nanjing Operation&quot;, is a more classical wargame, that simulates the 1938 thrust to Nanjing. The map represents the region between Shanghai and Nanjing, and it's an hexagon's map. The units are at divisional level for the japanese and at army level for the Kuomingtang.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you move one of your pieces one step orthogonally or diagonally forward. Then, look for a bonus move: Choose an axis through that piece, and sum the values of all pieces along that axis (including the one you moved, any of yours, and any of your opponent's!). Now you get to move your piece whose number matches that sum, and so on until you've run out of bonus moves. Finally, it's your opponent's turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone cannot make their opening move for the turn. Each player sums the values of their pieces that made it all the way to the other side; higher sum wins!<br/><br/>The rules also offer two variants, which means there are 4 ways to play the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Key events require dice rolling, and team training is available to stack the odds in player's favor.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches 30 or more points on their turn or if there are no cards left for a player to restore their hand to six cards. When one of these events happen, each player gets one last turn. The game can be lengthened or shortened by adjusting the number of points needed to win.<br/><br/>After each player completes their last turn, they total up the number of points scored.

Jukebox is a fast-playing 2-player game that is easy to learn and plays in around 20 minutes.<br/><br/>In Vinyl: Jukebox, your goal is to create the best playlist by organizing your 45s in not-so-easy ways. All the while, racing to earn public scoring conditions and completing private goals for maximum points.<br/><br/>Jukeboxes play records called 45s and they come in five genres, three decades, and have great songs on side A and B. To collect these 45s, players must draw a variety of coins from their bag until certain record-earning conditions are met- but no fast, bebopper! Draw too few coins and you might not earn any record. Draw too many coins and you might end up helping your opponent!<br/><br/>As 45s are acquired, they need to be arranged in a 3x3 grid inside your jukebox. When a row or column is completed, their arrangement will affect which public scoring bonuses you can earn and determine if you have completed your private goals. As you fill your jukebox with records, you&rsquo;ll be pulled back and forth between the competing needs of the various scoring objectives. Which ones do you go for? Did your strategy work? Will you end up on top? We&rsquo;ll find out when a player acquires their ninth 45s and the end game is triggered. Count up your points the person with the most wins!<br/><br/>",

Howard, Wings in the Night<br/><br/>In Solomon Kane&rsquo;s time, Africa was a deeply mysterious and dangerous land. Little explored by Europeans, it was a place of near-legend. Kane is one of the few who dares to brave the trek to its shores, and fewer still who venture into its interior. For this reason, he is a stranger in this endless land of magic and cannibals, and has to rely more than ever on his inner strength and the blessings of his immortal companions. Unsurprisingly, it is not long before Solomon Kane is in the middle of a deadly situation once more.<br/><br/>This expansion adds 2 new adventures in the dark continent! These are the Wings in the Night and The Footfalls Within. Between them, these Adventures have a total of 5 Acts (50 chapters).<br/><br/>Wings in the Night: As soon as Solomon escapes from some dangerous cannibals, he falls straight into the fire from the frying pan, walking into a ruined village that has been terrorised by the inhuman akaana. These strange flying creatures seem to be a horrible amalgam of bat or bird and human, and they strain Kane&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s creatures&rdquo; to breaking point. Solomon undertakes to protect the innocent villagers, and when this plan goes tragically wrong he swears vengeance as atonement for his error. Are they part of the strange natural world in this alien land, the work of the devil, or some dark summoning from the mind of a sick wizard? Any of these seem possible. And any of them are, depending on the path you take and decisions you make. Remember: You and your friends make the decisions in your games, and perhaps your skill or your luck outstrips his previous efforts! Fighting a numerous foe, who can fly as well as fight, makes this a unique challenge for the Puritan hero.<br/><br/>Footfalls Within: Solomon Kane does not approve of slavery. In fact, it utterly disgusts him, and his first thought, on finding a train of Arab slavery is: &ldquo;Sons of iniquity, the wrath of God is upon ye.&rdquo;  <br/> &ldquo;The fury Solomon Kane felt would have been enough at any time and in any place to shake a man to his foundation; now it assumed monstrous proportions, so that Kane shivered as if with a chill, iron claws scratched at his brain and he saw the slaves and the slavers through a crimson mist.&rdquo; So, despite the fact that he is alone, he cannot help himself. He must confront the slavers&hellip;<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    8 double-sided tiles<br/>    14 Fight cards<br/>    8 Fight Effect cards<br/>    191 Discovery cards<br/>     29 Miniatures<br/>    2 Storybooks (5 Acts/ 50 Chapters)<br/><br/><br/>This is an expansion, and cannot be played without the base game.<br/><br/>",

As a consequence a player can play their team of keyples more quickly and profitably than would otherwise be possible, but are then also likely to have fewer different types of laydown actions to choose from.  The leader is a very strong country tile, but is tricky to play optimally and its inclusion should be agreed by all players before starting a game of Keyper or Keyper at Sea.<br/><br/>The Leader was not included in the base games as a regular tile as it seriously disrupts the normal flow of a game.

It's also now printed in the USA on certified paper and card stock from responsibly managed, sustainable forests. A free print-and-play version is available on the company's website.<br/><br/>At the start of the two-player card game Marital Bliss, each player draws seven missions that they must complete in secret for their partner over the next seven days. Mission cards range from housework chores (such as taking out the trash) to more complex activities such as organizing a weekend away. Each mission card also has a brownie point option that can be completed for extra points.<br/><br/>Players can choose to discard any number of mission cards at the start of the game if they feel they cannot complete them. Different missions are worth a different number of points, and any uncompleted missions at the end of the week are worth negative points. If the other player guesses a mission you are attempting (or recently completed), then you gain no points for the mission.<br/><br/>Strategy cards are mixed with the mission cards and allow players to change the rules of the game by making the other player discard missions, allowing some free guesses, or simply gaining points for a guessed mission.<br/><br/>Players also draw five reward cards and choose the one they would most like to win. A players cards are keep secret from their opponent.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the week earns a reward card to be used at their discretion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At last, peace breaks out!  But, obviously, your previous allies will use the breathing space to re-arm, ally themselves with the enemy and invade us!  As the President, it is your sacred duty to beat the other countries to the punch.  The time for decisive action is now!<br/><br/>Each player has his own little country map, divided into conceptual areas: political, military, communications, production and population.  Each player also has a production card, 60 people tokens, 6 Action cards, 3 ships, 2 carriers and 1 airplane.  The players share 30 missile markers (power 5, 15 or 30) and 15 Goal cards.<br/><br/>The Goal cards represent your secret victory conditions (see below).  People will eventually spread not only over your own areas but the other players' --giving you a say in each player's destiny as will be seen below.<br/><br/>Play is in rounds, with each round beginning with a Player Order and Political phase, and then a varying number of player turns.<br/><br/>Player Order phase: The order of play is determined by each player's Communications area.  Each player counts his people in that area, and each other player with people in that area either adds, subtracts or stays neutral (his choice).  Largest score goes first during the round and so on.<br/><br/>Political phase: Place up to four of your six Action cards (keeping at least one), face down, in front of the other players, in any ratio.  This phase is resolved in sequence by all players.  Next come the individual player turns.<br/><br/>Production phase: Each player's production card is progressively filled up with people markers; the level reached indicates what can be produced.  Producing anything, even something way below the current &quot;fill line&quot;, empties the card (the people go back to the player's Production area).<br/><br/>Embarkation phase: People of your colour (up to 10) may be embarked on one of your ships.  Missiles (up to 30 total power) of a controlled colour may be embarked on a carrier or airplane of a controlled colour which happens to be off the missile's shores.<br/><br/>Action phase: The player must play one of his Action cards (the ones he kept earlier plus those played on him).  Political clout (people in your Political area) can be used to instead lay a card aside for a later round.<br/><br/>These player turns continue until all players pass.  The players then recover their Action cards from the discard pile.  Cards laid aside during the round are put back in the player's hand --so you may end up with a smaller or larger hand than usual.  A player without any people in his Population area, or with less than 5 total people markers on his country (diasporas don't count!) is eliminated.<br/><br/>Goal cards indicate either a player to eliminate (you win even if another player is responsible for your target's elimination) or two players to dominate politically or demographically.<br/><br/>The Action cards are:<br/><br/>Transfer - Transfer up to 5 people of your colour from one area to another, within your country.<br/><br/>Disembark - Up to 5 embarked people on one of your ships off another country's shores disembarks into any area.<br/><br/>Growth - For each 5 people of one colour in your Population area, add two more.  Enemies also grow if present.<br/><br/>Production - Move up to 5 people from your Production area into the production display.  They may be of another colour if their owner agrees.<br/><br/>Move - You can move one ship of your colour, or one carrier or airplane of a colour you control by one country.  Ships and carriers move clockwise or counter-clockwise, airplanes move anywhere.<br/><br/>Shoot - Fire a missile on board a carrier or airplane of a colour you control onto an area of the country where it currently is.  The missile kills as many people as its power.  The more powerful missiles can spill their effect over into other areas of the target country.  Casualties must be fairly spread between the colours present in the area (if it matters).<br/><br/>",

On a modular map with an hex grid (terrain features have been included for decoration and further modules on ground combat that never appeared) little flying armies fight each other in fierce air battles.<br/>The armies are bought with a point system: flying beasts can be manned by different quantities of soldiers equipped with several kind of weapons. Creatures are of good, neutral and evil alignment: three of the counter sheets include good and neutral creatures, the other three evil and neutral ones (good and evil ones can not be taken together). Each of the 6 sheets includes 140 counters depicting classic and less classic fantasy fliers such as dragons, wyverns, pegasi, flying carpets, elephawks, winged snakes, giant eagles, chimeras and so on.<br/>The rules have two different difficulty levels. The basic system has an initiative check for a variable movement order. Several optional rules are provided for them, while the advanced set of rules has a simultaneous planning of the movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Mesomorph Games website:<br/><br/>&quot;Tapestry contains three attractive new strategy games for two or four players played with a unique set of stained wooden tiles and colored pawns.<br/><br/>In the first of the games, called Tapestry, players build the board as the game progresses, adding light and dark tiles, placing pawns to access regions, and sliding tiles to strategically alter the landscape and block opponents. When the board is complete, the player whose pawns access the most territory triumphs.<br/><br/>In Towers the board starts off full size but shrinks as players race to construct towers before bearing them off the board to earn points. It is tempting to try for the high-scoring tall or single-color towers but if you take too long or allow your towers to become isolated, your opponent may end the game before you are ready to score.<br/><br/>Conveyor is a strategic race game in which the object is to move pawns across the board, starting from your seating position. Each turn players also have an opportunity to alter the pattern of light and dark tiles by shifting a row or column. Players strive to be first to move all their pawns across the shifting landscape of the board.<br/><br/>Each of the three games presents different challenges and satisfactions lasting 30 to 60 minutes, and the unique tile distributions each time insure that no two games are ever the same. The Tapestry set includes 26 light-stained tiles, 26 dark-stained tiles, 8 red pawns, 8 yellow pawns, 4 white pawns, 4 black pawns, a cloth bag, and a rule booklet. The games are best played on a smooth surface such as a glass or wood table.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The Imperial Japanese Navy has been tasked to deliver reinforcements to Guadalcanal and support the offensive to retake the airstrip, Henderson Field, from the US Marines.  A task group of 14 Imperial warships is proceeding south down &lsquo;The Slot&rsquo; between the Solomon Islands to bombard Henderson Field and destroy the aircraft there in order to allow the slow, heavy army transports to reach Guadalcanal safely.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thirteen US warships are steaming north through Ironbottom Sound to intercept the Japanese.  The two forces nearly collide with one another in the pitch black night.  Star shells, flares and searchlights probe the darkness as ships intermingle and attempt to sort out friend from foe.

        "description": "This is a new member of the Dominoes family. The game consists of 73 dice and 18 Variomino tiles. These are square plastic tiles which have two different sides. On one side, four dice can be placed on top of the tile, on the other side, one or two dice can be placed - this side of the tile also has a number on each edge (1-4).<br/><br/>Various games can be played with these materials; from classic muggins variants where points are scored when the ends of the line can be divided by five (counting the sum of the dice plus the numbers on the edge) to solitaire games resembling Sudoku. There are many ways to count the points: Adding dice numbers on top to numbers on the edges, counting the numbers on the side of the dice, etc. The tiles can even be stacked.<br/><br/>The game was published as a test edition by Edition Perlhuhn in 2009. The rule sheets expressly invite players to invent new games with the materials, much as was done with &quot;Spiel&quot; for which dozens of game ideas were eventually published.<br/><br/>",

Servers are rated for Aces &amp; double faults and these results can also be obtained from the returner's card as well.<br/><br/>A point is played out with just 2 rolls of the dice. The first roll determines whose matrix will be used (server or returner) and the second roll is used on that matrix to determine the outcome of the point. It is critical that the server stay ahead in the game otherwise a point won can become a point lost.<br/><br/>There is also a Random Events chart which can result in injuries, equipment failure, bad weather, or player distractions all of which can have an effect on the outcome of the match.<br/><br/>All seasons available for IVT come with the top 60 players being rated for that season.<br/><br/>Get Inside the world of tennis with Inside Volley Tennis!<br/><br/>",

Sho shogi has no drop mechanism. All pieces used in modern shogi are used in sho shogi and have the same movements and initial positions, but sho shogi also has one additional piece with respect to the modern game-- the drunken elephant which promotes to a crown prince and begins the game directly in front of the &quot;king&quot; (osho or gyokusho). The drunken elephant moves one space in any direction except directly backwards, and the crown prince moves exactly like a king because it is a second king. Namely both the crown prince and the king must be bared, checkmated and/or stalemated simultaneously to win. Baring counting as a draw only if one's own king can be bared the next move.<br/><br/>According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 (Drunk Elephant still present) and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1861 - Hoke&rsquo;s Run (American Civil War in 3D)<br/><br/>This absolutely FREE complementary battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D sees the Union army under General M.G Robert Patterson attempting to defeat the Confederate army of General Joseph E. Johnston at Hoke&rsquo;s Run in the Shenandoah Valley.<br/><br/>This fictional encounter is a prelude to First Manassas.  The battle at Hoke&rsquo;s Run could have very easily taken place, because General Patterson drove the Confederates away South from Falling Waters the previous day.  The Confederates regrouped around Hoke&rsquo;s Run and camped ready for battle the following day, but Patterson failed to press the Confederates and moved to Martinsburg instead.  The Confederates waited four days for a battle that never came.<br/><br/>The game can be played in about 1 hour; it is very tactical and can be played again and again.  It has a time limit of 16 bounds in which the Confederates must inflict a devastating defeat on the Union army.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game that gives a flavour of the American Civil War period.  A simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two quadrants, the Hoke&rsquo;s Run five page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you start this great series of battles with a victory?

The objective is simple, crash all the others cars out of the race. The last car running is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex board divided into 10 zones. The player manages a hand of 7 cards to drive more aggressively or defensively. On a player's turn, the player first plays driving cards and moves through zones to build momentum. Then, if they end their turn adjacent to an opponent's car they make a hit. The player decides how much momentum to put towards the hit and can then add hit bonus cards. The opponent can then respond with defensive cards and hit bonus cards as well. Damage is then recorded on a player car card. Each player's car damage is hidden by a player screen but visual clues (damage) are placed on the physical car, other player can only see which sections have taken damage but not the amount. The derby cars are wooden game pieces where the 4 corner pieces(driver front, driver rear, passenger front and passenger rear) can be removed and replaced with corresponding damaged piece.<br/><br/>",

To prove your might, you must command your tribe to hunt, gather, or steal as many stones as possible.  When the stones are all gone, the Boss with the most stones will be universally feared and respected. Stones give much power.<br/><br/>SIMPLETONS is a quick playing multiplayer card game that takes less than 5 minutes to learn, so you can jump right in and steal your neighbors stones!<br/><br/>In a game of SIMPLETONS, each player has a similar hand of cards, each displaying a single action. Every round, each player selects one card from their hand and plays it face down on the table. Once all players have selected their action, they flip their cards up and resolve them. Players continue to play rounds until all of the stones in the supply are gone.<br/><br/>Card selections include HUNT and GATHER - which allow you to take varying amounts of stones from the supply. Each deck also includes a RAID card for each opponent - which allows you to take half of their stones. Beware though, because every player has a DEFEND card, that will block opponents' HUNT cards - effectively causing them to skip their turn.<br/><br/>SIMPLETONS plays quickly, regardless if you play it with 3 or 8 players - and features fun caveman cartoons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Banzuke Shoushin (番付昇進 'Rise through the ranks of sumo') is - as the name already indicates - a sumo wrestling career simulation game. Hence, it does not focus on individual bouts (even though hundreds of fights are simulated during the game), but on the whole of a rikishi's (sumo wrestler) career.<br/><br/>There are 12 rikishi in the game, but only a small number of those are player-controled; the others are 'automated', i.e. controled by the game. The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.<br/><br/>During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.<br/><br/>After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice. Rikishi can try to influence the match tactic such that it matches their strongest skills (or the opponent's weaknesses).<br/><br/>After the basho the banzuke (ranking) is adjusted, rikishi age one year, and some retire (forcibly or voluntarily).<br/><br/>Playing one game year takes about 45 to 60 minutes, most of which is taken up by the tournament. Consequently, simulating a 10-year sumo career will take up to 10 hours. It is, however, easy to store away the game in between years, and thus to play the game in many different sessions spread out over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>",

The card deck consists of cards numbered 1&ndash;15 and a special power. Each player gets 7 cards. The first player may play 1 or more cards (several cards of the same number or a straight), and the players who follow must play as many or more cards as the previous player and the total value must also be higher. Each time one or several card(s) are played, the effect of one of the played card is executed. Players who cannot play must pass. Once everyone around the table has passed, the played cards are discarded and the current players begins anew with playing one or several cards.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of his hand wins the round. The game is played for several rounds, with the winner of the previous round getting an advantage for the next round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the world of Diggin Deep Baseball.  With this game, you should be able to re-create the game of baseball complete with all the strategy and decisions that the big league manager make on a daily basis.  You set the rosters.  You pick your rotation.  You make the lineups.  All of the game strategies are here.  Do I steal a base?  Do I pinch hit?  Do I leave my pitcher in for one more batter?  Diggin Deep Baseball also re-creates dilemmas that not every tabletop baseball game can re-create.  Does my slugger dig deep now in hopes for a big inning, or save that for later in the game?  My pitcher is hurt, but says he&rsquo;s fine.  Do I yank him now, or keep him in and take the chance that the injury might be more severe?  My all-star catcher has a death in the family and has been put on the bereavement list.  How do I replace his offense?  His defense?  Along with the above, there are several aspects of Diggin Deep Baseball that you&rsquo;ll find makes this a complete tabletop baseball game.<br/>     <br/>Games are played using cards and three ten sided dice.  There are cards provided for every batter with 50ab's and pitchers with at least 25ip.  In a normal at bat sequence, the three ten sided dice create a number from 1 to 1000.  Results of 1 to 500 come from the hitter's card, and 501 to 1000 come from the pitcher's card to resolve the plate appearance.  <br/>     <br/>What sets Diggin Deep Baseball apart from other games is the Diggin Deep Mechanism.  In certain game situations, players can 'Dig Deep' for that little bit extra to tilt the scales in their favor.  In a normal situation, there is a 50/50 chance the  result comes off the hitter's card or the pitcher's card.  When a player 'Digs Deep', that 50/50 chance now becomes 100/0.  This doesn't guarantee a positive result, but it does give you a better chance of success.<br/>     <br/>Diggin Deep Baseball is played just like a real baseball game.  This includes relief pitchers, pinch hitters, pinch runners, injuries, and ejections.  Once you have gameplay down, you should be able to play a full nine inning game in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Like the other Ratz Fatz games, this is a collection of games for kids from 3-12 years that can be played with the same material.<br/><br/>Components: 20 picture tiles (for use on the floor), 20 bracelets, 1 booklet with rules, stories, poems and tasks for different ages<br/><br/>The picture tiles show vehicles (bike, car, bus, train), furniture (chair, table, bed, closet), animals (dog, cat, horse, cow), toys (doll, ball, building blocks, picture books) and food (apple, bred, salad, pasta).<br/><br/>Games that can be played include:<br/><br/>1. Naming and grouping: The children say what's on the tiles, which pictures might go together, or they try to find something that fits a certain description (something made from wood, something that has four legs etc.)<br/><br/>2. Listen, run and win: The tiles are distributed on the floor. When the game master mentions one of the pictures while reading a story from the game booklet, they have to run to that tile as fast as possible. The player who is the first to stand on the correct tile earns a bracelet, and the player with the most bracelets wins the game. A variant includes jumping from tile to tile instead of running.<br/><br/>3. Running memory: Similar to 2., but the tiles are played face down and the children have to remember which tile is where.<br/><br/>4. Throw the tile: The players have to find something to match a description, but they only earn a bracelet if they manage to throw a fitting tile into the bottom of the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scenarium is an improvisational storytelling game for 4-20 people who can play as individuals or as teams of two. It is a party game where players act, draw, and tell stories based on interesting prompts and creative commons photos.<br/><br/>Scenarium was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2014.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is similar to Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. The game begins with one of the players/teams in the role of The Director. The Director chooses a card and a prompt (Tell, Draw, or Act) and all the other players/teams of two have a few seconds to prepare before telling, drawing, or acting out their response. The best performance, in the eyes of The Director wins the card, and then the player or team to the Director's left becomes the next Director. The first player or team to five cards wins.<br/><br/>It's an easy game to learn - the directions fit on one side of a playing card, and it's a flexible game that encourages house rules (all acting, family and kids versions, drinking game versions, etc.). Each game takes about 30-45 minutes to play.<br/><br/>There are 249 game cards in the limited edition version of Scenarium, and each card has three prompts. The average game only takes 12-18 rounds so you'll never see the same game twice.<br/><br/>The company gives a portion of their proceeds to CrashCourse and Kiva.org.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>Lucius is tricky. His crew generally consists of lower cost models such as the Guild Guards. Even his &quot;heavy hitters&quot; do not pump out a lot of damage on their own, but rely on a combined arms approach. He, of everyone in the Guild, supports his crew the most and loses well over half of his capability when not running his own crew. His limited crew of Guardsmen and Elite Division can pull off some cool &quot;alpha strike&quot; tactics, but it's pretty tricky to make them work. Focusing on any single part of his crew can take it apart quickly and make it tougher to play.<br/><br/>Overall, Lucius crew is all about the whole being greater than the sum of it's parts. For the most part your crew will be made of very &quot;average&quot; models (average movement, average attack, average resilience), but can be made to work very well by using a combined arms approach.<br/><br/>The Elite Division box comes with 1 Guild Guard (4 SS), Ryle (8 SS), the Guild Guard Captain (7 SS) and a Lawyer (7 SS), for a total of 26 Soulstones (plus Lucius' cost of 10 SS if not leading the crew). The starter box thus gives you a very top-heavy crew, with a trio of high-cost minions. Lucius tends to work best when he has a good number of minions around him however, so your first purchases should definitely be cheaper models with which to replace one of the 7-8SS minions in small games.<br/><br/>Your first purchase after the starter box should definitely be a pack of Guild Guard, who are cheap, resiliant and decent in both melee and ranged combat. Adding at least one Austringer is recommended to begin with. Good early buys are a blister of Guild Guard, a second Austringer and one of the Totems. Which one you choose depends on your play style, but if in doubt the Drill Sergeant has several different uses.<br/><br/>Lucius is trickier than a normal Guild Master due to his reduced list options, but can do well if you use the right pieces at the right time.<br/><br/>",

There are four suits: hearts, bells, acorns, and leaves, each with eight cards: ace, king, over-knave, under-knave, 10, 9, 8, and 7.<br/><br/>The most common setup is with three players, with one player playing alone against a partnership of the other two for each hand. The lone player seeks to win more card points than the other two players together.

        "description": "Operation Lam Son 719 was the first major offensive waged by the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam (ARVN) outside of its borders. Supported by US airpower, the offensive sought to destroy the Communist supply dumps along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Cambodia and Laos, as well as disrupt any offensive by the forces of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and its People&rsquo;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), better known in the USA as the Vietcong. The offensive was also the first large scale test of President Nixon&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;Vietnamization&rdquo; in which the bulk of the war effort was to be borne by the ARVN as the US forces were withdrawn home.<br/><br/>The Communist high command was well aware an offensive was in the works, and planned a counter-offensive. What ensued was one of the largest battles of the war that resulted in a very costly and controversial outcome. Both sides claimed victory but in the end the overall course of the war was little changed and America&rsquo;s resolve to exit the conflict only deepened.<br/><br/>Operation Lam Son is published by High Flying Dice Games. It is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh, with graphics by Bruce Yearian. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate units and resolve most combats.<br/><br/>",

You'll need to pick carefully and roll well, though, to balance aggression and defense, and to do the most damage to your enemies.  Each game Year has four Seasons for a total of 12 turns, and takes approximately 20-30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Thematic introduction:<br/>King Alwan is dead and the Kingdom of Draig has been torn asunder. Year after year, the dragon-riding knights of King Alwan&rsquo;s former court clash in bloody battle in the skies over Draig. The mystical forces that give dragons flight and imbue magical weapons with astonishing power play a key role in these battles, and woe be to Lords who go into battle without their own cabal of Druids wielding the elements for their army.<br/><br/>But four times each year, when the seasons are in flux, the world&rsquo;s magic surges, crackling in the air with deadly potential. On these days, the Druids don the mantle of war, calling down torrents of wind and rain, conjuring firestorms that scorch the<br/>land, and shaking the earth itself.<br/><br/>Stones crack. Mages fall. Kingdoms are lost. And won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The second title in the Blood Before Richmond series recreates the Battle of Glendale, and its artillery-only side-show, White Oak Swamp.<br/><br/>The Union host is heading for Malvern Hill, a superior defensive position that will allow them to escape destruction and encirclement. If Lee wants to achieve those aims, he needs to cut off that retreat at a place called Glendale, which requires the careful coordination of his generals. But, par for the course, only A.P. Hill and Longstreet seem capable of doing what they&rsquo;re told: Ben Huger and his men are too busy moonlighting as lumberjacks, while Stonewall Jackson fights a pointless artillery duel at White Oak Swamp - when he&rsquo;s not napping, anyway. Difficult terrain and fresh, high-quality Union brigades mean that the weary Confederates have their work cut out for them. The optional Galena Rule gives the Union command-control problems of their own to contend with.<br/><br/>Like other titles in the series, a  modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn't pull there weight are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It's a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties that Lee had during the Seven Days.<br/><br/>Blood Before Richmond builds on the same &quot;stacks of steps&quot; combat system introduced in Tom Russell's Blood on the Alma (2012). Flipping a counter over when you take a hit just doesn't capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire. This system uses step counters stacked beneath an identifying counter to account for brutal attrition and devastating wipe-outs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In Ancient Sands, players will play as treasure hunters digging for valuable artifacts in a hostile desert. The game is played on a 4x4 grid of treasure card stacks. At the top of the stacks are easy to recover simple treasures. Each one of these will give you a small number of points and an additional bonus or way to manipulate the desert. As you take these, more valuable treasures are revealed deeper in the sands. Should you manage to reach the bottom and gather the workers needed to dig one, you'll find ancient artifacts of tremendous power. Recover one and you'll not only get a huge boost to your score, you'll be able to turn its power on your rivals!<br/><br/>Each turn, you will choose a worker to recruit and play for both progress towards recovering treasures and for a variety of effects depending on who you chose. Alternatively, many workers can be instead discarded for stronger powers, but no progress towards digging. Once you have gathered enough workers in play you can send them out to dig up a treasure from the desert grid. Each treasure is worth a number of victory points along with a wide variety of special effects from recovering them. You might find functioning tools that make your work easier or uncover old tomes that point to where more valuable treasures lie. Be warned though, the Dead Reaches are not a safe place to be. Each round an event card will be drawn that could radically change the situation and have everyone scrambling to recover. Worse still are detrimental weather cards that could bring your progress to a screeching halt. It will be up to you to carefully use your workers to mitigate the risks that lie in the Ancient Sands.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls an army of Giants, Ogres, Trolls, Dwarves, Hobgoblins and Goblins, battling for land in the prized turnip-growing valley of Ogre's Knee.<br/><br/>At the start the four armies are positioned at the corners of the board. The initial aim of the armies, of which each constituent has a different numerical value, is to capture opposing pieces. Capture is custodial, captors having to have a higher combined value than those being captured. Players can combine in capture. Capture is rewarded by gold, which, when sufficient has accumulated, allows an army to build a monument. Further gold allows players to build walls around the territory they dominate, enclosing both men and monument.<br/><br/>The primary aim of the Battle is to capture territory on the board; and the winner is the player who captures and encloses the largest territory.<br/><br/>",

The rules are suitable for games with miniature figures in all scales from 2mm to 30mm. Although primarily designed with the Macedonian and Punic wars in mind, the mechanisms can be used for the earlier Greek and Persian conflicts as well as the rise of Imperial Rome.<br/> Although these rules are designed around the same principles as Comitatus, they also have unique features which capture the flavour of the period. Particular attention has been given to developing practical ways to reflect the relative strengths and weaknesses of the phalanx, the legion and their supporting arms.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

You will need to collect as many different colors as possible and as many of one color as possible to score most points.<br/>The tiles eligible are limited every round so you need to choose what gives you most points, both in scoring and set collection for the end game score. Some buildings also have loot, gems or gold, powerful magic artifacts that you can use and if you silence the bell tower, you can make another swift attack.<br/><br/>In each game the city will be built differently, so good variaton to the set up.<br/>Simple game play with good tactical depth makes it quick, easy and fun to play.<br/><br/>The game also includes a mode for solo play where you can play to beat &quot;Drako&quot; (the cute dragon from @bgwniramas) or your own personal high score.<br/><br/>",

Also, I will slightly change the color of the purple vases to make it easier to pull them out.  The other cards will be easy to remove as needed.

This character will now play earlier in the upcoming turn order sequence.<br/><br/>As soon as a character's health hits 0, it is removed from the game, reducing the distance between the characters.<br/>When a player has more characters still in play than his/her opponent, he/she plays with 4 dice instead of 5.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Honshu War, 1950-53 (HW) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic simulation of the war that could have resulted had Japan ended up divided between Communist and US occupation forces at the end of World War II. The Soviet player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win the game by seizing key objectives within the territory of the Western-allied Republic of Japan. At the same time, though, the situation allows for and at times demands the launching of sharp counteroffensives by the United Nations player.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 25 miles (40 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are divisions. Each full turn represents from one to two months, depending on the season. By seasonally telescoping time in that way, the turn-by-turn movement and combat capacities of the units can be held as a constant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game starts with eighteen cards dealt face-down on the tableau to form three face-down &quot;pyramids&quot; of six cards each, and a row of ten cards beneath. This is built by dealing out ten cards face-up in a row; then nine cards face-down above them, offset by half a card to the right; then six cards above those, offset by the same amount (and leaving a one-card gap after the second and fourth cards); then three cards to cap the three pyramids.<br/><br/>The twenty-four remaining cards make up the stock. The first card from the stock is put in the waste pile (sometimes known as the foundation/discard). For a card in the tableau to be moved to the waste pile, it must be a rank higher or lower regardless of suit. This card becomes the new top card and the process is repeated several times (e.g. 7-8-9-10-9-10-J-10-9-8, etc.) until the sequence stops. Along the way, any face-down cards that are no longer overlapping are turned up.<br/><br/>In case the sequence is stopped, i.e. no card on the tableau can be put over the top card of the waste pile, a card is placed on the waste pile from the stock to see if it can start a new sequence. Cards are transferred from the stock to the waste pile one at a time as long as it does not begin a new sequence with the cards on the tableau.<br/><br/>If there is no scoring being tracked, the game is won if all three peaks are cleared before or after the last card from the stock is discarded to the waste pile. However, the game is lost if there are still cards that cannot be placed on the waste pile after the stock has run out.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima, revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality called &quot;sakura&quot;.<br/><br/>The players in Sakura aim to play cards without taking any hands. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules, which by default require higher number on the Jin side and lower on the Jang side in the same color. (Alternatively, a player can place the same number in any color.) Also, the players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (money). The game ends when everyone has only two cards left in their hand. The player who earns the fewest points wins the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs until next spring.<br/><br/><br/>This edition contains previous Kickstarter extras (not exclusive).<br/><br/>",

Players start with two Keepsakes, and may gain or lose more as they complete challenges and recite the line of memories, represented by various face-up and face-down cards. Players take turns by drawing a new memory card, adding it to the line of memories, defining the memory, and reciting the line of memories in order, starting with the first one played. Players may then call out if the person seems to have done something incorrectly, with Keepsakes trading hands accordingly. Each memory card is different; they may require players to say something only they know, something they can see, something that they prefer, etc. Sometimes tasks appear, requiring players to complicate their turns, or players can opt for available challenges to increase their Keepsake collection. Some memory cards may reorder the memory line or be turned face-down, forcing players to reorient themselves or risk losing Keepsakes. Play ends when any player has zero Keepsakes remaining or the memory deck runs out, and whoever has the most Keepsakes wins (ties permitted. With that in mind players can opt to play cooperatively instead to attempt to gather the most Keepsakes collectively.<br/><br/>",

The main scoring happens on a physical seesaw board where &quot;prevention&quot; tokens are placed on one side and &quot;pollution&quot; tokens on the other. Filling the prevention side lets all players win (with optional placements based on who contributed the most). However, if the board tips towards the pollution side, all players lose.<br/><br/>Each player has their own country board with their own special ability, where they track their economy and their population's need fulfillment. Increasing the fulfillment levels of certain needs will unlock more and more powerful rewards, but at the same time threatens to create additional pollution.<br/><br/>One of the major goals of the game is to use your country's board setup to create &quot;influence&quot; tokens which can then be used to prevent climate events from (such as species extinction) from occuring in a negotiation about who is willing to invest how much per event. Stopping these events creates prevention points, while failing creates pollution.<br/><br/>The primary way of increasing need fulfillment is playing cards onto a grid shared between all players. Some cards have special effects depending on which other cards they are played adjacent to. Playing cards of the same category next to each other comes with its own set of bonuses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Cultists of Cathulhu have gathered: their Great Eldritch Ritual nears its end. There is just one thing left: choose one of them to Ascend and finish the ritual. It&rsquo;s a simple choice, really. They are all the same &mdash; any of them will do! There is just one problem: some Investigators have infiltrated the ritual, pretending to be Cultists. And choosing any of them would ruin it all!<br/><br/>Cult of Cathulhu is a fast-paced hidden role game for 4-11 players. Engage as a Cultist, trying to find trustworthy brethren with your unique skills and solve the lie-filled riddle -- or as an Investigator, trying to sneak you or your comrades in to halt the Cultists&rsquo; world-ending plans.<br/>Each player has two hidden cards: their alignment (Cultist or Investigator), and a separate skill card. Investigators are in the minority but know each other, while Cultists have to use their otherworldly skills in a search for just one Cultist they all can trust.<br/><br/>The game consists of three phases: Mission briefing, Council, and Voting.<br/>Mission briefing lets the Investigators know each other, as well as other Investigators' skills. <br/>In Council, players can freely discuss and use their skills. Most skills either give information, e.g., by seeing others' cards, or help other players use their more powerful skills. <br/>Investigators can use their skills just like Cultists to fool them, with an extra advantage: they can use skills from any card, not just their own. Skill cards are always discarded after use, face-down. The Council is timed; after the time runs out, Voting begins.<br/><br/>In Voting, all players simultaneously vote for another player. All players with the most votes are chosen to Ascend, and the game ends. If all chosen were Cultists, the ritual succeeds and all Cultists win; if any of them was an Investigator, the Investigators win, instead.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The principle is as simple as it is ingenious. Whoever thinks that Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten can't work well as a card game will soon be proven wrong.<br/><br/>The game is explained in no time and the fun can begin. There are no open questions and the game rounds are entertaining and exciting. Due to the 200 different categories there is always enough variety.<br/><br/>The official card game of STADT LAND VOLLPFOSTEN with 120 playing cards for an unforgettable gaming experience among friends.<br/><br/>How to play: Each player is randomly dealt 8 letter cards. Now each player must place a word matching one of his letter cards as quickly as possible. Important: The first letter of the word counts and you do NOT have to form a term from the letter cards, as is sometimes the case in other games, e.g. Scrabble.<br/><br/>So it gets exciting: The 60 category cards contain a total of 200 different and funny categories:<br/><br/>Who can put down a &quot;profession&quot; first? Or a &quot;reason for separation&quot;? What about a &quot;city abroad&quot;? Can you quickly think of a &quot;Famous Dead Person&quot; or a &quot;Famous Actor&quot; for your letter cards?<br/><br/>Important now: The FASTEST player wins each round and at the end the player who first got rid of all letter cards wins the game. The 10 additional action cards make the game especially exciting.<br/><br/>Of course, there are also FULL FIX cards in the game that either act as jokers or are used as tricky counters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Hochwertige Klappdeckel-Schachtel in coolem Design made by DENKRIESEN.<br/><br/>Das Prinzip ist so einfach wie genial. Wer glaubt, dass Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten als Kartenspiel doch nicht gut funktionieren kann wird schnell eines besseren belehrt werden.<br/><br/>Das Spiel ist im nu erkl&auml;rt und der Spielspa&szlig; kann beginnen. Es bleiben keine offenen Fragen und die Spielrunden sind kurzweilig und spannend. Durch die 200 verschiedenen Kategorien ist immer f&uuml;r genug Abwechslung gesorgt.<br/><br/>Das offizielle Kartenspiel von STADT LAND VOLLPFOSTEN mit 120 Spielkarten f&uuml;r ein unvergessliches Spielerlebnis unter Freunden.<br/><br/>200 kreative und lustige Kategorien bringen jeden Hobbydenker ins Schwitzen. Spa&szlig; Garantiert!<br/><br/>Durch die 5 verschiedenen Editionen, ist eine riesige Vielfalt geboten. Neben der familienfreundlichen Classic Edition bringen die kinderfreundliche Junior und die unanst&auml;ndige Rotlicht Edition die gewisse Abwechslung in den Spieleabend!<br/><br/>Spielablauf:<br/>So wird gespielt: Jeder Spieler bekommt per Zufallsprinzip 8 Buchstaben-Karten ausgeh&auml;ndigt. Nun muss jeder Spieler m&ouml;glichst schnell einen Begriff passend zu einer seiner Buchstaben-Karten ablegen. Wichtig: Es z&auml;hlt jeweils der Anfangsbuchstabe des Wortes und man muss NICHT aus den Buchstaben-Karten einen Begriff bilden, wie es in anderen Spielen z.B: Scrabble manchmal der Fall ist.<br/>Es wird also spannend: Die 60 Kategorie-Karten enthalten insgesamt 200 verschiedene und lustige Kategorien:<br/>Wer kann zuerst einen &ldquo;Beruf&rdquo; ablegen? Oder einen &ldquo;Trennungsgrund&rdquo;? Was ist mit einer &ldquo;Stadt im Ausland&rdquo;? F&auml;llt dir zu deinen Buchstaben-Karten schnell ein &ldquo;Ber&uuml;hmter Toter&rdquo; ein bzw. kommt Dir sofort ein &ldquo;bekannter Schauspieler&rdquo; in den Sinn?<br/>Wichtig nun: Der SCHNELLSTE Spieler gewinnt jeweils die Runde und am Ende gewinnt der Spieler das Spiel, der zuerst alle Buchstaben-Karten losgeworden ist. Durch die 10 zus&auml;tzlichen Aktionskarten wird das Spiel besonders spannend.<br/>Nat&uuml;rlich gibt es auch VOLLPFOSTEN-Karten im Spiel die entweder als Joker wirken oder als kniffliger Konter genutzt werden.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, in an eternal cycle of revenge, the victory of Horus, god of the sky, heralds the coming of each new day, continuing a cycle which has endured since the beginning of time.<br/><br/>In the game, Horus and Seth face each other in three locations: the world of the living (the Deshret), the underworld (the Duat) and the Sun Boat, or Mandjet, which symbolises the sun&rsquo;s journey across the sky.<br/><br/>Sunrise Sunset is a competitive game for two opponents where in each round players take turns in playing cards (up to a total of 6 each) in order to gain control of the three locations. In each location the opponent with more power takes control.<br/><br/>The first player to deal three damage is the victor of the game.<br/><br/>Beginning with the starting player, the players take turns to play cards one after another until they have played all of their cards  and assign it to one of the three lanes of your choice.

You are the overlord of one of them.<br/><br/>Your aim: increase as best as possible the prosperity of your realm and extend your powers of domination. To achieve your target, you must cleverly manage your kingdom, timely tax your villagers, negociate alliances with other lords and enter trade to enrich your vast estates.<br/><br/>You can also try to conquer new areas to enlarge your territory, while protecting your villages and your lands by raising armies. Castles, windmilla, camps, fortifications, drakkars, merchant guilds, trade goods, ports; you might wish to build so your reign is better appreciated.<br/><br/>Honoring the gods and obtaining magic powers is also important in those mythical time: build temples and sanctuaries in your marvelous land...<br/><br/>You may be a Viking Lord, an Elfic Prince, Grand Priest of Chaos or Princess Sandra... then you might become the legitimate successor of Helric, anew mythical king, beloved of the Gods and worthy of legends to come...<br/><br/>",

He&rsquo;s tall, superfit and strong, with a grace and co-ordination that can leave most other players standing. Instantly recognisable across a murky Blood Bowl field by the splattering of gore across his kit, Oberwald cuts a very dashing figure and it&rsquo;s no surprise the girls go wild when he has the ball in his capable hands.<br/><br/>The very peak of square-jawed, sculpted manliness, the world-famous Griff Oberwald and his excellent quiff can be added to any Human Blood Bowl team. He&rsquo;s clad in just enough armour to protect his vitals, while leaving him free to run as quickly as possible, and his sneering face (covered with a helmet or not; your choice) and knuckledusters show he definitely means business on the pitch. Rules for fielding Griff Oberwald are found as a Star Player card in the Blood Bowl boxed games, as well as in Blood Bowl Death Zone Season One.<br/><br/>This resin kit comprises 6 components, and includes 2 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Epic Geek edition was intended to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Wits &amp; Wagers, but it needed another year to get &quot;that extra kick over the cliff&quot; (yes, this version goes to 11).  There are 3 things which make the Epic Geek edition different (and better) than every other edition of Wits &amp; Wagers:<br/><br/>1) It has all new questions about the epic stories we love such as Star Wars, The Avengers, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Matrix, Monty Python, Batman, etc. If there is a brand you love, chances are you'll find a question or two about it in this game.<br/><br/>2) It has stunning artwork on the back of each HUGE 5&quot; x 8&quot; player board.  These illustrations were commissioned by some of the best artists in the industry such as  Boris Vallejo &amp; Julie Bell,  Jimmy Palmiotti &amp; Amanda Connor , and  Jon Kovalic.<br/><br/>3) Every player board comes with an unique in-game power that adds a layer of fun interaction to the game.  Anytime the zombie player goes all-in and loses, he comes back to life with 5 free chips. The Wizard of Odds can switch any two payout odds before the answers are revealed. The Superhero helps the downtrodden by moving another player's bet to the correct answer (for which he receives a small token of gratitude from the mayor).  You get the idea!  It&rsquo;s the interaction of these thematic in-game powers that make this edition epically fun to play.<br/><br/>",

Whoever develop better their domains and collect the best combination of immigrants wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is heavily based on Brazilian history, the % of immigrants is, as much as possible, near to what really happened and all in game events really happened. They were adjusted only to make sense as a game.<br/><br/>",

Cannons and rifles had become more accurate at longer ranges, rapid-fire pistols gave cavalry a new weapon, and the telegraph and railroad completely altered both strategic and tactical thinking. Across a Deadly Field, the new regimental-level war game from Osprey Publishing, allows players to recreate this tumultuous period of warfare on the tabletop. Its versatile rules make it possible to refight any battle, from the early skirmishes of Ball's Bluff and Big Bethel to the grand, set-piece battles such as Gettysburg that decided the war. Written by John Hill, designer of the Johnny Reb series, Across a Deadly Field offers both new and experienced war gamers a fast-paced and dynamic game where even a single regiment can make the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>",

Despite of German counterattacks and setbacks such as Debrecen, by Christmas Eve the Red Army was besieging Budapest, had joined hands with the Yugoslav Partisans, and had occupied Bulgaria and Romania.<br/><br/>Balkans 1944 is a wargame simulation of the Soviet offensive across the Balkans of the late summer and fall of 1944.

But they come at a cost. The grounds require a never-ending offering of blood spilled in battle.<br/><br/>The first beings born off the Bloodfields had to keep them satiated through gory festivals of violence. Many have died and many have become powerful beyond comprehension, thus becoming Gods.<br/><br/>The Gods have then created other realms. Filled them with magic and creatures of all kinds. But with one selfish purpose in mind. To ensure a never-ending stream of the most valuable resource - blood.<br/><br/>Every war, every disagreement, and even the smallest quarrel between Gods is therefore settled on the Bloodfields. And Gods always bring the greatest warriors from their realms to remain invincible!<br/><br/>This world is driven by conflict.<br/><br/>Bloodfields feature dynamic and simple yet engaging gameplay. To keep things action-packed each skirmish takes up to 60 minutes and features a team of chosen ones on each side.<br/><br/>To make every Bloodfields experience truly unique, there is a wide range of scenarios that enhance the gameplay. Each scenario has its individual rules, dedicated terrain, and surprising events. It&rsquo;s up to you to prepare the winning strategy for each occasion, whether it is an endless siege or escorting a deranged mage.<br/><br/>",

The Battle of Lodi was not a decisive engagement, since the Austrian army had successfully escaped. But it became a central element in the Napoleonic myth and, according to Napoleon himself, contributed to convincing him that he was superior to other generals, and that his destiny would lead him to achieve great things.<br/><br/>The game uses the 'La Bataille series' rules from Clash of Arms. The Rulebook is intended to be a rough guide to tactical warfare in the last Eighteenth Century and in the beginning of the &ldquo;age of Napoleon&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Note: The series rules are not included in the game. Rules from any La Bataille game can be used or they must be downloaded. Both the full rules and the simple Marie Louise rules can be used.<br/><br/>",

Greatly outclassed by the neighboring Union in terms of manpower and raw economics, yet spurred by a desire to project power into the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, a fleet built around a moderate contingent of capital ships (of British design) capable of facing down South American rivals, and backed up by numerous small craft, submarines and airplanes intended to offset any Union fleet numerical advantage, is projected for the new Confederacy.<br/><br/>Confederate States Navy includes 35 long and 70 short laser-cut cardboard playing pieces, depicting CSN ships, aircraft, fleets and submarine flotillas as well as tropical cyclone markers.  The supplement is not a complete game; the use of maps and pieces from Plan Gold, Jutland, Black Waters, Sea of Troubles and Pacific Crossroads are needed to play the majority of the twelve battle and eighteen operational scenarios, while those from Cone of Fire, Mediterranean and Zeppelins! are needed to play them all.<br/><br/>",

In this exciting strategy game, however, one must call for divine help as conquering the ocean is nothing compared to holding it&hellip;&quot;<br/><br/>Each almirante has the goal of dominating the ocean, that is, conquering and holding the field in the center of both ocean and board. For that, he or she builds and sails a fleet of both fishing boats and war galleons, by cleverly using the resources received in the beginning of each play: winds and coins. In addition, each almirante has three opportunities to use a god card.<br/><br/>Each play starts by receiving 6 winds and a variable amount of coins. Winds allow you to move your vessels: you need 1 wind to sail a fishing boat to another field, and 2 winds to do the same with a heavier galleon. Coins allow you to build new vessels: fishing boats cost you 2 coins, while galleons cost you 8 coins. You can trade these two resources, if you are willing to pay a conversion fee.<br/><br/>You then move your vessels. Sail your fishing boats to the shoal fields to fish and earn coins on your next turns (2 coins per each of the 6 shoals players compete for). Sail your galleons to meet opponent vessels in order to fight battles, or go for the center to conquer it. Battles are always won by the almirante with the most galleons on that field. Some defeated vessels are sunk and some of them may flee.<br/><br/>If the time is right, call upon the gods! Each almirante chose 3 god cards from equal pools of 8 before the game started, kept them secret and can now play each of them once - but only once. Play Aeolus and he will grant you extra winds, or maybe play Ares and he will sink an opponent's vessel...<br/><br/>Your play is now over. Are your galleons dominating the center of the ocean? Good, then slide one point along the scoreboard. Do this 4 times (in a game with 3-5 players) to win. But look out, the other almirantes are now sourrunding you and will want to join efforts to stop your countdown toward victory. Will they get you?<br/><br/><br/>Portuguese Description:<br/><br/>Enquanto almirantes, no comando tanto de uma marinha mercante como de uma de guerra, 2 a 6 jogadores constroem e dirigem as suas frotas para dominar o centro geoestrat&eacute;gico do oceano.

Designate one player to be &quot;The Knower.&quot; The Knower knows the different logic rules for each Ring and will facilitate the game. All other players start with a hand of five object cards.<br/><br/>Depending on the Ring, the logic rules will be related to different characteristics, like spelling, grammar, physical properties, cultural relevance, or industry.<br/><br/>On your turn, place an object card from your hand into the Venn diagram. If it fits that ring's rules, place another card. If it doesn't fit the rules, &quot;The Knower&quot; moves the card to the right area. The player then draws another card.<br/><br/>The point of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. Can you figure out the Rings' logic before your opponents?

        "description": "The Marshals III covers the campaigns of winter 1814 that took place in France north of Lyon and in Italy on the Mincio. These theatres of operation are considered to be minor since they occurred far from the Emperor&rsquo;s view who was engaged in the north of France. Nevertheless, important and little-known battles took place there where the young Marie-Louise, the conscripts of the French army, displayed extraordinary courage. The first campaign, that of Marshal Augereau in France, recounts in three scenarios the march on the flanks of the Austrian army engaged against Napoleon.<br/><br/>In the first, the &ldquo;Lion of Castiglione&rdquo; must seize Geneva to cover his march on the enemy lines of communication. The second relates the Austrians&rsquo; offensive return from Dijon and the fall of Lyon after the battle of Limonest. The third covers the whole campaign from the beginnings of Augereau&rsquo;s timid offensive to the loss of the &ldquo;capital of the Gauls&rdquo;. The second campaign, led by Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, describes the fierce combats for the supremacy of northern Italy. Threatened at his rear by the betrayal of Murat who is moving up from the south of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; with his Neapolitans, Eug&egrave;ne withdrew from Verona to Mantua. The first scenario, very brief, simulates the about-turn of the French on the Mincio to counter the Austrian advance. The second covers the whole campaign from the evacuation of Verona to the victories of Eug&egrave;ne against various enemy threats.<br/><br/>With this new volume, The Marshals series evolves. The more imposing strengths of these campaigns required some adaptations that allowed for simulating the march of an entire army corps. These new rules are compatible with the previous modules with some minor adaptations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "soft landing is an abstract strategy game about the global haves and have-nots, with two possible endings: Players either work towards technology that brings about a new era of peace and prosperity, for which only one player gets the credit (and victory points), or it is every nation for themselves, trying to have the most hoarded away when the final collapse comes.<br/><br/>Basically, people are competing for score and each player is a &quot;nation&quot; (geopolitical entity like &quot;North America&quot;). It is designed for 3-6 players, but there is a 2-player variant, and the rules are such that someone who has played it can explain it quickly to new players.<br/><br/>soft landing is a trade and resource management game, but the trick is, different players are going to be trying to end the game different ways, and everyone has a different starting score. The European Union has good production numbers, but only starts with 3VP. Africa, not so good on production, starts with 12VP, and there are regions that start with up to 17VP. Obviously, Africa wants the game to end sooner, while it is still ahead, and may try to force Catastrophes. The EU wants the game to last longer so it can develop New Era tech, and will be trying to abate Catastrophes.<br/><br/>You need to provide for the needs of your people, and if you do not, you generate &quot;stress&quot;, which accumulates in a central location. The type of stress depends on your nation.<br/><br/>For instance, on a production roll of &quot;5&quot;, Africa generates one Tech, one Industry and one Resources. If it does not acquire some Reserves or Lifestyle by the end of the turn, it will generate (from left to right, Political stress, Health stress and Population stress (fyi, the panda is Environmental stress). Each of these stresses has a little holding area on the score track where all the tokens accumulate until bad things happen...<br/><br/>Each nation also can use its production to buy special abilities, which are generally what you use to mess with other players. For instance, Africa has good production numbers for &quot;Resources&quot; and might have a surplus, but need &quot;Industry&quot;. Another player might have Market Manipulation, and use it to drive the &quot;sell&quot; price for Resources down to zero, screwing over Africa. Or, a nation with a Military could take existing stress tokens and rearrange them. When enough stress builds up, bad things happen (minor or major Catastrophes), and whoever has the most of their tokens in that zone takes the blame (and loses VP). Your Military is not actually attacking another player, you're just taking existing global stress and shifting it around to get yourself out of a jam, blame someone else, or both. Your turn consists of production, using abilities, trade, stress and investment, each of which is a very simple action, so turns move pretty quick.<br/><br/>soft landing has some superficial strategies and some more subtle ones. If you play looking only out for yourself, odds are that someone else will pass you by limited cooperation with another player.<br/><br/>",

There can be only one objective: a crossing over the Rhine at Arnhem. I needn't tell you that this would spell disaster for Germany! All along the Belgian-Dutch border, German troops dig-in their heels and put an end to the Allied pursuit across France and Belgium. There, the canals and flooded fields of Holland will slow the Allied advance and give them time to organize a strong defense of Germany. With the outbreak of Operation Market Garden, the German reaction is instant. The II. SS-Panzerkorps happens to be ideally placed to resist the British paratroopers in Arnhem, while a wide assortment of ad-hoc battle groups are organized to oppose the American paratroopers and the 30 Corps along 'Hell's Highway'. These battle groups range in quality and motivation, including Fallschirmj&auml;ger, heavy tanks, training battalions, machine-gun companies, and fragments of SS formations. Strange formations, such as whole battalions of anti-aircraft guns and fortress machine-gun battalions have been called up to block the Allied assault. Despite the motley appearance and equipment of these troops, they all have one goal in mind: to keep the Allies out of and away from their beloved Germany. The F&uuml;hrer himself has issued orders to hold until the last man and bullet are spent in defense of the Fatherland - nothing will make these men fight harder! The defense of the Reich starts here and you will lead your kampfgruppe to glory!<br/><br/>",

You have a minute to get through as many cards as possible, earning a point for each one your team guesses correctly. But use one of the censored words and you not only lose a point, you also get the DREADED COWBELL.<br/><br/>Can you get your team to guess the word Pervert, without using the words Dirty, Gross, Filthy, or Sexual? Or maybe Fake ID without saying Underage, Liquor, Alcohol, or Bouncer. How would you describe a Walk of Shame without mentioning Next Morning, Last Night, Hookup, or Embarrassing?<br/><br/>It might sound easy, but only if you can handle the pressure of being timed and the looming threat of a censoring cowbell.<br/><br/>Odious Censor comes with: 500 cards, 1 one-minute sand timer, 1 cowbell, 1 score pad, 1 pen.<br/><br/>",

Now they find themselves in a dusty old box, no one has use for their archaic technology but they will also never throw them away. <br/> We can all take a lesson from Mikro and Chip who instead of letting their fate get them down have invented games to play together with their own memory stacks. Instead of worrying about the future they while away their hours playing games and entertaining each other, they&rsquo;d love to play their favourite game with you, Memory Mischief.<br/><br/>Objective  Fill your stack with letters in alphabetical order. They do not have to be consecutive. Letters out of order will reduce your overall score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the forces of Imperial Japan; the other plays those of the British Commonwealth.<br/><br/>The game reflects the advantages enjoyed by the Japanese during the invasion in terms of command and control, equipment and training, and air superiority. Perhaps the primary reason for the so-called &ldquo;worst disaster&rdquo; in British military history, however, was the contrast between the effective and efficient strategic and tactical decisions taken by the Japanese high command and the ill-advised choices made by their British counterparts.  The latter were simply unprepared for &ldquo;modern&rdquo; warfare.<br/><br/>In the game such decisions are the preserve of players who are likely to be better matched and, of course, under far less duress than the historical commanders. It is for this reason that the Victory Conditions are set so that the Japanese can win the game even if they do not replicate their historical achievement of capturing Singapore in 70 days.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>One 17&rdquo; x 21&rdquo; Hexagonal Game Map<br/>15 British and Japanese Force Counters<br/>Two Force Detail Sheets<br/>127 Force Detail Markers<br/>Nine Activation Markers<br/>Two Tactical Detail Sheets<br/>12 Tactical Detail Markers<br/>One Game Turn Marker<br/>Four Fortified Hex Markers<br/>Eight Solitaire Variant Excluded Force Counters<br/>Extended Example of Play<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/>16 Game Turns<br/>Force Movement and Combat<br/>8-Page Rules Book<br/>Optional Rules<br/>176 Counters and Markers<br/>Movement by Sea<br/>Passable and Unpassable Terrain<br/>British Fortified Hexes<br/>Air Support<br/>British and Japanese Reinforcements<br/>Army Supply<br/>Solitaire Optional Variant<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Legend says that an evil warlord once lived in the tower, and terrorized the entire realm. There are now whispers that this warlord, known as Bram, has returned. Your town has chosen YOU to go to the tower and stop this threat. It is said that within the garden outside Bram&rsquo;s Tower lies the key to stopping him - the ORB of ICE. If you can navigate the garden and find this orb, survive the deadly crypt, navigate the fortress, and defeat Bram, you may be able to save your town. But those who enter the Fortress of Terror never return...<br/><br/>Fortress of Terror is a solitaire roll-and-write adventure game in which you, a simple peasant, become the humble hero sent by your village to enter the terrifying fortress of the evil warlord Bram in order to stop him from terrorizing the realm.  You do this by making your way through four chapters, or sections, of the game.  Each chapter places you in a maze that you must explore and escape from, collecting powerful Relics and other goals that you must achieve to win.  You move around each maze using a pool of dice that are rolled each round. However, you can never retrace your steps, as Bram has cursed the earth and floors of the fortress to crumble beneath your every step. If you manage to fulfill the chapter objective and escape the maze, you will advance to the next chapter, until you reach the final battle with Bram himself.<br/><br/>Fortress of Terror is the first adventure module in the Roll-With-It system, a modular, solitaire roll-and-write adventure game system with endless possibilities for adventure. The simple yet solid core mechanisms in the basic game system allow it to be very flexible, supporting just about any theme.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The second battle in 1941, resulted in the city being captured by the Japanese, and then being recaptured by the Chinese 9th Army Group commanded by Gen. Xue Yue. The third battle was originally intended by the Japanese to gain control of the city and prevent Chinese forces from reinforcing the British forces engaged in the defense of Hong Kong. When Hong Kong fell on 25 December, the Japanese decided to continue the offensive to gain control of Changsha thereby dealing a major blow to the Chines war effort. Ground units represent battalions and regiments with artillery and Japanese air power being represented with the use of fire support markers.

In an ominous and undoubtedly mocking tone, their message, 'The Sorras are approaching. Your planet we are poaching.' immediately caused people to wonder if the rhyme was intentional, or just a lucky coincidence. Seconds later it plunged the world into chaos.<br/> When will they arrive? What do they want? Will they ever leave? No one knows. One thing's for certain though, they're not just coming for a cup of space tea.<br/><br/>Alien Frenzy is a wildly chaotic and suspenseful card game that plunges players head first into an Alien Invasion. The game unfolds in two thrilling phases with game play designed for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>The game begins in the Preparation phase, before the Aliens have invaded. Here, players take turns playing and drawing cards to improve their hand and mess with opponents. However, the tension builds as players desperately try to avoid drawing a dreaded UFO card, as this triggers the Invasion, and places that unlucky player at the forefront of the action.<br/><br/>During the Invasion phase, players take turns playing cards, and revealing Invasion cards. Here players come face to face with the Aliens and must fend off their attacks with Character cards. Once a player has no Character cards left, they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Who will be the last player standing amidst the frenzy of the Alien Invasion?

The game is driven by cards, which are used to acquire troops and to fight battles. Players each have a piece which moves around a track by die roll; the space landed on determines how many cards the player draws and how many troops are auctioned off (bidding is conducted with cards). Sets of cards can be turned in for troops in addition to those auctioned off. The track is also the game clock: there is a neutral piece which moves around it and determines when scoring occurs and when the game ends.<br/><br/>The game was produced in an edition of 100 copies.<br/><br/>",

Players get tiles via die roll and place them on individual boards in an effort to cover as many spaces as possible and to get the high-scoring tiles on bonus multiplier spaces.  There are action cards to add some variety (place a tile on an opponent's board, etc.).<br/><br/>No publishing date is printed on the box.<br/><br/>",

Finally, the storm clouds broke and armies from East and West marched into Poland.<br/><br/>The Poles fought hard for their country. For six long years they fought. They fought in Poland, they fought in France, they fought in Norway, they fought in Britain, they fought in North Africa, they fought in Italy, they fought in Russia, and finally, they fought in Germany, all the way into Berlin and the Brandenburg Gate. They fought in the air, they fought on the seas, they fought on the land, and they fought behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>They had hoped that their unwavering opposition to the Axis would earn them the right to freedom after the war. Their motto was, &quot;We don't ask for freedom. We fight for freedom!&quot; However, only one of their foes was conquered. The other was now master of Eastern Europe. It would be four more decades until the Polish people would taste that sweet elixir again.<br/><br/>",

But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.<br/><br/>Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.<br/><br/>Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.<br/><br/>The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Piekło Okop&oacute;w (Trenches of Hell) is a game where you take the role of infantry battalion commanders on the Western Front in the First World War. You have three nations to choose from &ndash; the conservative British, the offense-inclined French, and the extremely effective Germans. Each nation has a different battalion structure, and thus a different set of tokens representing units and nation cards that you play in the game. Your task will be to get as many victory points as possible, which you receive from carrying out orders. This, in turn, determines which fields in the enemy&rsquo;s system of trenches must be occupied only temporarily, or kept completely. The battle takes place on a board representing both players&rsquo; network of fortifications, separated by a narrow strip of No Man&rsquo;s Land.<br/><br/>Piekło Okop&oacute;w lets you feel the excitement of giving commands in order to get a few meters of land that are bought with the blood of thousands of soldiers. The game&rsquo;s mechanics allow you to use successful tactics employed by the commanders of the Great War. You will use artillery preparation, gas attack, try flexible defense, or the use of fire to take enemy trenches.<br/><br/>A separate publication included with the game reveals the secrets of trench warfare in the First World War.<br/><br/>",

Some say that he was descended from royalty, others say that he was an adventurer or a smuggler, and there are even those who claim he was a wizard.  Whatever they believe, the towns people are wasting no time rushing to his estate sale after his death seeking answers to the mystery around him... and to get their hands on as many of his possessions as they can.  Some of Mr. Maksimov's possessions could be worth a fortune but others might end up being worth nothing.<br/><br/>Mr. Maksimov's Manor is played in four rounds.  In each of these rounds players will bid on Maksimov's possessions during his estate sale. Item cards that players can gather will either build on each other for more points or cause the player to lose points. When bidding, players need to balance how much value can be gained from the available items with what cards could hurt them. Also, if Mr. Maksimov's will turns up, it could change everything!<br/><br/>Mr. Maksimov's Manor is a casual game that both non-gamers and strategy gamers can appreciate.  Casual gamers will enjoy the game's easy to learn rules and the feelings of excitement and anticipation that the game play yields. What will keep strategy gamers coming back is the ability to manipulate the game's odds, constant risk and reward decisions, and subtle elements of social deduction.<br/><br/>",

Successful players must manage the tension and uncertainty surrounding 4 Specialists, including the powerful Raven.<br/><br/>The game is played with 56 suited cards &mdash; Shields, Swords, Axes, and Waters numbered 1 (low) to 14 (high) and 4 special cards (specialists).  Each hand features a different trump suit.  Players must sacrifice cards from their hands to bid the number of tricks they will take.  Each suit conveys a bid value:  0, 1, 2, or 3.  The suit (not the rank) of the cards chosen determines how many tricks the player must take. Score 1 point per trick taken, plus a bonus for an exact bid.<br/><br/>The specialists are:  <br/><br/>        Raven &mdash;  the highest trump<br/>        Wolf &mdash; the highest non-trump<br/>        Shaman &mdash; a half-step higher than the card it immediately follows<br/>        Dwarf &mdash; the lowest card<br/><br/><br/>Each player tries to take (win) the exact number of tricks bid.  Deception and collusion are allowed and include saying:  how many tricks you bid; what cards you hold; that you want a particular trick; that you won&rsquo;t take a trick; and lying about any or all of these things.  You can say what you like, but you cannot show your cards before you play them.<br/><br/>Card play mechanics are typical for the trick-taking family of games: The player left of the dealer leads.  Play proceeds clockwise.  A player who can follow suit must either (1) follow suit or (2) play a specialist. A player who cannot follow suit may play any card.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after 8 hands wins. In case of a tie, the player (of those tied) who earned the most bonuses is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The treasure that hides under the sand changed the peaceful lives of the bedouin tribes that inhabited the planet. Used to the hard life of the desert, these tribes soon became the most valuable allies in the gas-extraction business. You are the new leader of your tribe and must guide your people to find the gas wells and to build  extraction ducts that will reshape the landscape forever. Use your people wisely to control the most strategic places on the map and keep an eye on the movements of rival tribes. Don't forget that the powerful and greedy corporations of Earth pull the strings in the shadows and are capable of helping you...or making your tribe disappear between the dunes.<br/><br/>Bedouin is a strategic game whose main mechanisms are area control and hand management. There is a high interaction between players as they collect the tokens of the gas fields that their tribe controls; these tokens are worth different amounts of victory points, and their value can be modified by different actions during the game. The modular construction of the desert guarantees that you will not find two games the same. Every action counts under the burning sun of the bedouin's planet!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TRITT RELOADED is a reimplementation of TRITT, that was solved in 2009.<br/><br/>This new set of rules fixes the problem and also changes the game experience completely, as now lines of 3 or more dots can only be created as a result of a tritton movement. It also includes more pieces than its predecessor.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>A hexagonal board with 91 connected dots.<br/>20 trittons (10 of each type).<br/>Carrying case.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>The game begins with an empty board.<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated colour (Orange or Blue) and takes all the trittons that have their colour in the middle.<br/><br/>The Orange player starts the game by entering one of his trittons somewhere on the board. The three dots of the tritton must be placed over 3 free aligned dots on the board.<br/><br/>From now on, and starting with the Blue player, players in turn must do these 2 things in order:<br/><br/>     Legally enter one of his trittons on the board.<br/>     (Optional) Move an opponent&rsquo;s tritton (if any) any number of steps along the line it is laying on.<br/>     It is forbidden to enter a tritton on the board so that a line of 3 or more dots of the same colour is created. Lines of 3 or more dots can only be created as a result of a tritton movement.<br/><br/><br/>As a rule of the thumb, you place trittons that have your colour in the middle, and move those that have your colour on the sides.<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/><br/>The game ends in one of the following cases:<br/><br/>One player wins by making a line of three (or more) dots of his colour but not making a line of at least three dots of the opponent&rsquo;s colour at the same time.<br/><br/>One player loses by making a line of three dots of the opponent&rsquo;s colour.<br/><br/>One of the players loses by not being able to make a legal action.<br/><br/>The game ends in a tie at any moment if both players agree.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game end is triggered when someone pegs 180 (or more) points. The hand is completed and the player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>The game is quite simple to teach as it uses standard must-follow trick-taking. To increase balance, one player will pick a trump suit and the other player will pick the rank order (which cards are high or low). What elevates the game is its distribution of card points among the ranks; in particular, trying to avoid giving up the high Phat points for capturing the middle-ranking 9s makes for some interesting and sometimes quite tense decisions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Singapore Edition of Codenames, using Singlish words in addition to standard English words. It contains 200 double-sided cards. About 60 of them contain words that non-Singaporeans will probably not understand, like Kelong, Angmoh and Samsui. It also contains about 40 words that are standard English words, but that have a special or different meaning, connotation or significance in Singapore, like Orchard, Causeway or Hawker. All the local cards have non-local reverse sides, so if you select cards randomly and a local card comes up that somebody is not familiar with it, you can easily solve the problem by turning the card. There are no overlaps with regular Codenames cards, so it can be used as a standalone expansion.<br/><br/>Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates only know the agent&rsquo;s Codenames. The team that contacts all their field agents first, wins.<br/><br/>",

The game can be enjoyed competitively, cooperatively, or solo.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of detectives, and depending on the game mode, will be working either together&hellip;. OR separately&hellip;. to crack the murder case. Time matters, and the first 48 hours after any crime are the most critical. Players race around Echo Ridge City collecting evidence, such as the murder weapon, forensics, or the getaway vehicle. This secret evidence is sifted through using the novel Tiny Epic Decoder System, which keeps all of the murderer&rsquo;s other evidence hidden. This knowledge eliminates suspects and helps identify the true killer.<br/><br/>But crime doesn&rsquo;t stop for one investigation. Players must answer the call of duty, juggling their time as other criminal activities arise across the city. Resolving these events allow players to gain useful alibis and powerful Force Cards, but knowing full well that their actions will take them hours closer to a reckoning.<br/><br/>In their final hour, players will stake their careers on a final guess: who they think the murderer really is&hellip; hoping that their wits and detective skills are enough to bring the correct suspect to justice. Can you hold this city of crime together long enough to crack the case, or will it go cold and your time on the force run out?<br/><br/>Crooked Capos has 2 separate modules that can individually be added to the game: &quot;Crooked&quot; and &quot;Capos.&quot; In the Crooked module, players are dealt Loyalty Cards which state whether they are &ldquo;CLEAN&rdquo; or &ldquo;CROOKED.&rdquo; Players can investigate whether another cop is crooked, getting either big rewards (if they are right) or big penalties (if wrong). In the Capos module, the Capos represent an extra challenge and reward for the officers! Capos are treated like mobsters while in the city, but are not like regular mobsters. Instead, each can only be arrested by following the requirements listed on their card.<br/><br/>",

OMEGA!<br/><br/>Beyond the galactic void, beyond the ISC, lies the Omega Sector, where mighty empires wage war, conquer vast territories, and are in their own turn destroyed. Unlike the relatively stable Alpha Sector known to SFB players, in the Omega Sector, there is no such thing as a fixed border, and the survival of races depends on the skill of a gunner, the ingenuity of an engineer, and the valor of a starship captain. It is a place of danger, death, and opportunity.<br/><br/>Module Omega One is the first in a new series of adventures for Star Fleet Battles players. It includes 46 new ships, 11 new races, 24 new weapons, and many new systems. The mighty M&aelig;sron Alliance seeks to dominate the area, but is opposed on all sides by the antimatter weapons of the Koligahr, the implosion bolts of the Trobrin Empire, the particle beams of the Vari Combine, the fireballs of the Loriyill, the bioelectric bolts of the Alunda, the energy howitzers of the Chlorophon, the kinetic waves of the Sigvirions, and the hypercannons of the robotic Drex Unity.<br/><br/>Five scenarios only hint at the savage wars, titanic battles, and devastating conquests that mark the dangerously unstable Omega Sector.

        "description": "In the distant past, a starship from a faraway world appeared in the sky. Damaged in battle, the craft broke apart and traced lines of fire across the horizon. These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!<br/><br/>Lost Legacy: Orb of Prophecy can be played independently or mixed together with other Lost Legacy sets to create a unique custom set.  This version was released at AEG Big Game Night at GenCON 2015 and won't be sold for retail.<br/><br/>As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Oer Alles&quot; (translates as &quot;Over All&quot;)<br/>aka &quot;Frysk damjen&quot; (Frisian) or &quot;Fries dammen&quot; (Dutch) or &quot;Frisian draughts&quot; (English)<br/><br/>Frisian draughts is closely related to the now standard game of (Polish) draughts and can be traced back to at least the late 1600s, when the games of the Draughts Family were sweeping through Europe from the French base. It has retained its unique rules ever since, and presently has its own league, founded in 1932, and is still widely played in its natural home of Friesland. Friesland is now a province with its own language and culture in the North of the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The &quot;normal&quot; version of draughts only slowly made its way into Friesland, and is known there as &quot;Oer Hoek&quot; (over corners) or &quot;Holl&acirc;nsk damjen/Hollands dammen&quot;. These days you are more likely to hear people talk about &quot;Frysk Damjen&quot; than &quot;Oer Hoek&quot;.<br/><br/>The set-up and basic movement is identical to the commonly known game, but it won't be long before the main difference will become very apparent: capturing isn't restricted to just diagonal jumps, but can be executed horizontally and vertically as well. Yes, a piece can capture in all 8 directions! If you think that makes it easier to solve, try it. It has a lot more action but it doesn't become easier.<br/><br/>There are other subtle variations:<br/>A promoted King can be moved only three times in succession when a player still has normal pieces. After that it must be &quot;released&quot; by a capture (which can be made with the same king) or by moving another piece. When a player has nothing but Kings then this rule is ignored. When you can capture, you must, but if a King and a standard piece can both capture a stone, or stones, of equal value, then it is the King that has to make the capture. When there are multiple capturing opportunities of equal value than the one that includes most Kings must be taken. The moment a player obtains a second King (and his opponent has only one), than that player has seven moves to finish the match or it automatically becomes a draw. Kings can make long jumps.<br/><br/>A few more names:<br/>The Frisians are still proud sailors and it should come as no surprise that there are more pockets along the North Sea and Baltic Sea that play the game, where it is known under many names that all refer to the erstwhile important Frisian harbour village of Molkwar/Molkwerum, famous in the Netherlands for its ad-hoc infrastructure. Early Dutch literature (mockingly) refers to Frisian draughts with its free-form any-direction capturing as &quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; as an homage to the labyrinthine village.<br/>&quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; (Dutch). A similar game is &quot;Makv&aelig;r&quot; (Danish) or &quot;Marquern&quot; (Swedish), however, it is played on an 8x8 board and, in Makv&aelig;r, a King doesn't only move diagonally, but also orthogonally, that is in 8 directions.<br/><br/>And more still:<br/>&quot;Jeu du Dame Bablionique&quot; (French), &quot;Babylonian Draughts&quot; (English)<br/><br/>There is even a game played in Siberia that follows very similar rules to Frisian Draughts, except that it is played on a 64 field chess board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Blood in the Fog is a two-player game recreating the 1854 Battle of Inkerman, one of the most fascinating battles of the Crimean War. An Allied force made up of French, British, and Turks had laid siege to the major naval port of Sevastopol.  Desperate to lift the siege, their Russian enemies probed the allied line for a weak spot. They found it on Mount Inkerman, held by less than 7,000 British. On October 27, the Russians initiated a brief skirmish to test the British defenses (later called &quot;Little Inkerman&quot;). On November 5, they were ready to crush them with over 35,000 Russians.<br/><br/>It did not go quite as planned. The disorganized Russians had their forces divided in two parts, under the command of three generals, each of whom had a different, contradictory, battle plan. A cold and dense fog allowed the Russians to get the drop on their enemies, but visibility was so poor that there was little command structure in place for either side. Regiments and companies had no choice but to fight (or flee) on their own initiative, giving Inkerman the nickname &quot;the Soldier's Battle&quot;.<br/><br/>While the fog reduced the range of the Allied Mini&eacute; rifle, it was far more accurate and deadly than the Russian muskets, especially at point-blank range. The Russians relied on ferocious but bloody bayonet charges to make up the difference. But as Russian morale started to flag, the fog began to lift, and nearly 9,000 Allied reinforcements arrived-- particularly the fearsome French Zouaves-- the battle turned in the Allied favor. In the end, there were 4,676 Allied killed and wounded, and over 10,000 Russian.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique variant on chit-pull activation mechanisms, with each player alternating pulling from their own pool. The number of activations per turn is tied to the current Fog level. At the start of the game, it's somewhat difficult for the Fog to rise, but once it starts to do so, it happens rapidly. Russian morale is simulated via its own chit-pull pool, and like the Fog, it begins the game in solid shape but once it starts to flag, it quickly collapses. In this way, the odds start to shift to favor the Allied Player. Generally speaking, the Russian Player is strong in the early game and his opponent in the late game.<br/><br/>Step-losses and the gradual erosion of fighting strength is modeled using the &quot;stack of steps&quot; mechanic featured in some earlier Tom Russell designs, such as 2012's Blood on the Alma. The game is Regimental in scale, with each hex representing roughly one-tenth of a kilometer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Okinawa!&quot; is a two-player wargame recreating the land, sea, and air struggle for the possession of the Japanese island of Okinawa, from April to June 1945. Seen as the last steppingstone for the final jump toward Japan, the battle was important for both sides. The US had to prove it could overcome enemy resistance, securing airfields, and, after the bloodbath on Iwo Jima, keeping their casualties low. The Japanese had the chance to test their new air tactics relying on simultaneous strikes from multiple groups of Kamikaze and conventional strike aircraft escorted by fighters. They also had a full Army on the island backed, with one of the highest concentrations of Japanese artillery even seen during the Pacific War. They had to hold part of the island or inflict a level of casualties on US forces to cast enough doubts on their ability to later sustain a larger operation on Kyushu and then Honshu.  Stakes were high on both sides.<br/><br/>The game covers the land battle for possession of Okinawa (focusing on the more military relevant southern part), and the concomitant air and naval struggle around it. On land you have Marine and Army regiments, tanks and amphibious tanks, Japanese forces that run the gamut between highly experienced machine gun battalions to raw conscripts.  At sea Carriers, battleships, Navy and Marine air groups, Japanese Kamikazes, and even Yamato&rsquo;s last sorties. Even the Commonwealth makes an appearance with Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet.<br/><br/>In addition to the campaign, shorter scenarios are included as introductions to the game system, as well as highlighting critical moments of the epic struggle. We've also included designer's notes an a nice example of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hungry Life is an environmental education and awareness card game played between 2-5 players and for the whole family, schools and holidays.<br/><br/>It comes in two versions: A Europe continent (English, French, German) and a North America continent (English) featuring species unique to that continent.<br/><br/>Each player starts with their own deck of 20 cards plus five in their hand (player count dependant). You start by placing a primary producer/Base Card to create a new habitat. Each animal card will list what it can eat leading up to an apex predator. Each new habitat is connected as the game goes on, but with human projects such as roads and housing estates these habitats can become disconnected. Animals that could once be moved are now trapped. You must strategically place your animals, human projects and natural events to thwart your opponents. The game mechanics have been designed to practically demonstrate how humans are causing issues but also how we can help in a simple and family friendly game lasting 25 - 45min.<br/><br/>Each animal card will also feature data about that animal so you can learn things like their weight, population size/trend as well as where they fall on the endangered species list.<br/>In the rules you'll also find a list of organisations that are working hard to protect our natural world.<br/><br/>The first player to place all their cards wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Make bids to capture the correct amount of dragon clans and outwit your opponents in Magic Dragons. In this trick-taking adjacent game, you will be working on as many as 5 or more &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; at a time, using your hand of 7 cards with the goal of winning 0 to 4 tricks each round. Each trick consists of a stack containing one clan (color) of dragon. Control of each clan stack (trick) is determined by who played the highest dragon card on that clan stack. But your opponents may have spell cards in their hand that they can use to freeze, destroy, or suddenly change the color of any dragon clan stack.<br/><br/>Play continues in multiple rounds until at least one player attains a cumulative total of at least 40. Points are gained for controlled clan stack cards and matching your bid prediction for the number of controlled stacks. Points are lost for cards remaining in hand at the end of the round. Each round is a full refresh: the whole deck is reshuffled, hands dealt, and new bids made.<br/><br/>In each round, players place cards one at a time, in turn order. Unlike traditional trick-taking card games where all players play for one trick at the same time, in Magic Dragons each player in turn may play on any active stack (trick) or may be able to create a new stack. Control of all stacks is determined at the end of the round when all players have placed all the cards that they can from their hand for this round. Points are then scored at the end of the round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionXodd is an elegant connection and territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (from now on points) of a square board, which is initially empty. The suggested size is between 9x9 and 14x14. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones. The goal of the game is to end up with the fewest groups on the board. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a set of orthogonally connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRulesStarting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty points. On his first turn, Black can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board (i.e. the sum of the number of Black and White groups must be an odd number).<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the previous rule (this means Black can't pass on his first turn).<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with the fewest groups on the board wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes on gameplayDouble placement serves as both a first-move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has many interesting tactical implications. For example, groups separated by two empty points can't be merged on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the group count to an odd number. Also, the diagonal connection is safe if the opponent has exactly one or three groups touching the two empty points adjacent to both stones, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the group count anymore!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's webpage:<br/><br/>In 1864 General Sherman's march to Atlanta faced the heart of Dixie with the prospect of bloody fighting such as had already devastated large swathes of the Confederacy. And yet, despite a superiority in men and material, his task was a daunting one. Tied to the single-line of the Western and Atlantic Railroad for supply, and marching through a wilderness, Sherman could not afford to run up a huge butcher's bill. A too bloody summer's victory in Northern Georgia could easily result in a November defeat for President Lincoln in the forthcoming general election. On the other side General Johnston, commanding the defending Army of Tennessee, was no less vexed. He had attempted to whip his flagging forces into shape, despite sagging morale and a lack of reinforcements, but he knew this was a battle he could not afford to lose. Only reluctantly appointed to command by President Davis, Johnston would also be hamstrung by a divided and uncooperative staff.<br/><br/>Trampling out the Vintage is a simulation of the 1864 campaign for Atlanta. Both players maneuver and fight their units in an interactive sequence of play that places a premium on planning and decision making. Can you as General Sherman present the city of Atlanta to President Lincoln in a time and manner that will hasten the end of the war and ensure a second term for the Republican administration? Or, as General Johnston, can you stave off the Northern host and save the heartland of the Confederacy from capture and ruin?<br/><br/>",

The Wizard was a founding member of a Wizard&rsquo;s Guild that managed the impossible. To travel without moving. Although, the moving wasn&rsquo;t through space. The Guild discovered that when you manage to travel without using the dimensions of space, you travel through time. Hence, the new name of the Guild was based on the event of that movement through time, the Total Inertia Moving Event Guild, or simply T I M E Guild. Centuries passed, the coming of the Nano Age totally reformed the Guild into a T I M E Agency and gave a new agenda to its members: The molecular processing. The Agency could combine almost anything in order to create new properties it could utilize. But, some items needed to be centuries old in order to evolve or to become suitable for the processing. Therefore, the Agency decided to cooperate with its members from times past in order to bring items to the future in their desirable state. So, there were many ways for one to do that. You could simply travel back in time instruct someone in the past, to hide an item for you in a place that you knew, and travel back in your time and take the item, which now would be centuries old. Or, you could take an item from your time and hide it somewhere in the past by yourself and take it back when you return in the future. But, the T I M E Agency has many members, so that it can function properly in all Eras. If you travel back in time, too far away from your Era, it could be hard to adjust in the ways people had in the past, so, the help of another person from that Era makes the procedure easier. Usually, a Mission that includes the keeping of an item through the centuries, is concluded by 3 members: A Wizard, an Archaeologist, and a T I M E Agent specialized in traveling through the ages.<br/><br/>Components.<br/>1 board.<br/>4 player sheets.<br/>12 pawns (3 for each player).<br/>108 cards.<br/>1 rulebook.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY. <br/>All players begin the game with a mission that requires at least 4 items of different properties. Each player during his/er round uses his/er 3 pawns, which are the Wizard, the Archaeologist and the T I M E traveler. The board of the game is divided in three regions that represent three aspects of time: Past Present and Future. Each pawn starts from one of these regions and moves in order. First the Wizard can move in regions of the Past to collect information about powerful items and artifacts and then gather the items and/or artifacts for which he possesses the proper information. Then, the Archaeologist, moves in the Present regions in which he can also gather items that are somewhat different from the Past items and he can gather some more info about artifacts of the Past that might help the Wizard find them. Last, the Time Traveler moves and starts from the future areas, in which she can also gather info and items. The difference in the future region is that, items gathered here are built for time travel, which means that they evolve as the centuries pass. It is best for the Time traveler to travel back in time and leave these items in the Past or the Present to age and become stronger. Each item in Continuum Run has tiers, 3 sometimes 4. When an item is new, it begins from tier 3. Some areas on the board allow the players to store items and take them back from another time period. For example in the Present regions there is the Continuum Vault. If the Archaeologist stores an item of tier 3 in the Present it stays there until someone takes it. The Continuum Vault has its future version, in which the time traveler can go and take the item the Archaeologist has stored. But, centuries have passed, so the item must be replaced with a lower tier. Tier 2 in this case. Different tiers have different values. So, if a player requires for his/er mission an item with a value of Ruination 3, and s/he possesses a future item that has Ruination 2, s/he may store that item in one region and take it back from the next.<br/>GOAL.<br/>Any player that has at least 4 items that his/er mission requires may cause an endgame, during which, a last round is played and then players score Victory Points for each item and/or artifact they have managed to send to the Future Area called Molecular Processor.<br/><br/>",

The winds of change are blasting across the worlds of the Inner Sphere, and the battle for Coventry is the center of the storm!<br/><br/>In early 3058, following the disastrous Trial of Refusal with Clan Wolf, Clan Jade Falcon launches a brutal campaign against the Lyran Alliance to regain its status among the invading Clans. As the Lyran Alliance tries desperately to marshal the necessary troops to stop this invasion at Coventry, military forces from all the major powers in the Inner Sphere converge on the war-torn planet. With massive troops poised on both sides of the conflict, the battle for Coventry threatens to explode into an all-out war with the Clans once again! Will the Truce of Tukayyid hold?<br/><br/>The Battle of Coventry is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the savage conflict between Clan Jade Falcon and defending forces of the Inner Sphere on the planet Coventry. A detailed description of the hard-fought battle, along with seventeen scenarios and special campaign rules, allows players to recreate the events that unfolded in the BattleTech novel Malicious Intent - and perhaps even change the course of history.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This is another Clan vs the Inner Sphere scenario pack from FASA, containing 17 assorted scenarios and the details on one new Clan OmniMech, the Cougar, which was reprinted a couple of years later in BattleTech Technical Readout: 3060. This scenario pack is similar to the earlier Luthien scenario pack, in that it brings along a multi-national force to represent the Inner Sphere; with units such as the Com Guard, Wolf's Dragoons, the Eridani Light Horse, the Davion Heavy Guards and others to choose from, it's a good opportunity to play your favourite unit from the novel on which the scenarios are drawn. Thanks to the inclusion of the Com Guard Invader Galaxy, it's also possibly the only scenario pack where the Inner Sphere player will go into a battle or two equipped to the same technological level as the opposing Clan.<br/><br/>",

From small-scale uprisings in ancient Scotland to epic struggles between mighty star empires over countless worlds, the Northwind Highlanders of every generation have added to their forebears' battlefield glory. Fiercely proud warriors, the Highlanders have left their legendary mark on the universe -- and will do so as long as war rages in the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>The Northwind Highlanders is a BattleTech scenario pack that follows the career of this phenomenal unit, from its inception on Earth in the 18th century to the latest battles of the 31st century. Fourteen scenarios drawn from different periods in the Highlanders' distinguished history let players recreate the unit's greatest battles -- beginning with the First Kearny Highlanders' near-fatal first engagement in 2366, all the way up to the year 3059. Also included are a detailed unit history and a complete military roster. Players can use optional rules that reflect the specialties of each Highlander regiment in conjunction with the BattleTech: Field Manuals series to create their own Northwind Highlander scenarios.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Part sourcebook, part scenario pack, this expansion gives more detail on the Northwind Highlanders than any previous sourcebook, alhough the fluff section makes up a smaller part of the book than the scenarios drawn from the Highlander's history including a small campaign against the Clans, details on the various Highlander regiments and a couple of items of new equipment.  While the new equipment has been reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3060 this particular expansion is out of print, and not currently available from the present licence holder.<br/><br/>",

Each brings a unique ability that can alter the fate of your competition.<br/><br/>Who will be the first to cross Mount Olympus?<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Each player is provided 12 Gods of Olympus cards, light and dark.<br/><br/>The gods and goddesses have individualized health points, movements, attacks and special abilities that match their characteristics, to deeply tie theme in with mechanics.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 9x9 diagonal board. The first space on both sides are the &quot;gates&quot; spaces. It will be your goal to either eliminate all the other player's characters, or move any of your characters onto your opponent's gate space.<br/><br/>On your first turn, select a character to &quot;summon&quot; onto your gates space. On subsequent turns, you will choose to move, attack, or bring additional characters into play.<br/><br/>All of the cards are balanced so that they are equal in power. Zeus has twice as much health as Hermes, Hermes has far more mobility and provides a &quot;Winged Sandals&quot; ability that increases the movement of other pieces. Athena has even less health, but a powerful &quot;Aegis Shield&quot; ability protects other pieces. All characters will be equally important to achieving your victory.<br/><br/>Expansions will add deck building and asymmetric gameplay options.<br/><br/>Try playing chess with each of the 12 Greek Gods as your pieces.<br/><br/>",

Rolling swiftly into battle, droidekas unleash their arm-mounted twin blasters, pouring out withering torrents of fire.<br/><br/>The Droidekas Unit Expansion lets you support your droid forces with some of the most powerful combat droids in the galaxy. Four finely detailed, unpainted Droideka miniatures identical to those found in the Star Wars: Legion Clone Wars Core Set represent your Droidekas as they speed across the battlefield in wheel mode and unleash suppressive fire in their attack configuration. Meanwhile, a unit card fully outlines the Droidekas abilities while three upgrade cards give you the freedom to modify them with comms systems.<br/><br/>",

One of the key aspects of this conflict was control of the two rivers that served as critical trade routes for both nations, the Allegheny and Monongahela.<br/><br/>Designed by Bill Molyneaux, Savage Wilderness provides gamers with a fast-playing, introductory-level wargame covering twelve engagements of this war, including alternate variants for you to explore. Using easy to understand rules, each scenario is designed to be played in about an hour. Special scenario rules expand the experience further, bringing unique flavor and mechanics specific to each engagement while staying historically correct.<br/><br/>Battles included in this game are Grand Pre, Petitcodiac, Fort Bull, Mercer&rsquo;s Massacre, Fort Oswego, Kittanning, German Flatts, Battle of Fort Ligonier, La Belle Famille, Beauport, Bloody Morning Scout, Bloody Run, Devil&rsquo;s Hole, and the 30 turn campaign: The Battle of Fort Fredrick.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Luckily, you were on your way to have an expedition in the mountains and your supplies were not ruined in the crash. Unfortunately, you have no idea where you are, or how far it is to civilization. Your expedition has started earlier than expected!<br/><br/>At the start of the game you draw between two to four goal cards to try to complete as you journey through the mountains.  You also start with two items, either the rope or telescope, or the compass or map.  Place a mountain token at the 10 spot of the fatigue tracker.<br/><br/>Now you are ready to explore the mountains!<br/><br/>At the start, draw a Mountain card from the bottom of the Mountain deck.  This is the starting mountain, where you crashed.  You do not have an Encounter on this card, so ignore the dice shown at the bottom of it.  Then draw a Mountain card from the top of the Mountain deck and place it to the left or right of the starting card.<br/><br/>Each time you move to mountain, roll two dice.  You are trying to either get your dice to match, or equal the dice on the bottom of the card.  Then flip the card over and read the Encounter linked to the number of successes you rolled.<br/><br/>The game continues until you win by reaching all your goals, or you lose as your fatigue reaches 0.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was invented at the Technical University Twente in The Netherlands.<br/><br/>Atlantis is very original in its mechanisms. The board is built up from segments, each consisting of 7 hexes: one in the middle and six around it. The board can be made quite large, but is usually something like 4x4 segments; the game takes longer as the board gets larger. Each player has pieces of a single color. Pieces can be stacked, but when the stack gets as least as high as the number of neighbouring hexes, it explodes, spreading one piece to each surrounding hex and eventually destroying the original field. Once all seven hexes of a segment have been destroyed, the entire area disappears and segment is removed. Thus, during the course of a game the board (Atlantis) sinks into the waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to conquer as many free hexes as possible. An area is conquered if it can be only touched by hexes without enemy-pieces. But beware: Exploding hexes have the nasty tendency to turn into an unstoppable front of explosion and destruction.<br/><br/>As far as I know this game has not been released commercially, but nevertheless it has a large playing community, since the University Game Club (Fanaat) has now more than one generation of offspring players. The game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players, for symmetry reasons. 4 players is possible, but since the board is not mirror-symmetric the players will not have equivalent starting positions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A precursor of Pergame, Singidunum has been conceived as a game to bridge the gap between traditional wargames and abstract games. It mainly relies on the use of only four types of units and simple movement and attack rules. The main principle is that a ready unit can make only one move or/and attack during a turn of the game. This will allow and even entice players to cleverly coordinate their moves and anticipate their opponent&rsquo;s actions. <br/>The game still retains some of the wargame appeal by using dice to simulate fortunes of war and giving the players a chance to immerse themselves into the brutal fighting between Huns and Romans on the Balkan Peninsula.<br/><br/>The game is designed to appeal to wargamers looking for a fast game as well as abstract gamers. It is also quite welcoming to the younger players (and their parents) as it offers a fun and easy gateway to wargaming.<br/>The small box dimensions (171x151x36mm) make it perfect for gaming on the go.<br/><br/>",

The old bear found no joy in the beautiful scene though, he had survived enough winters to know the work that lay ahead. His mind reluctantly turned to thoughts of hunting and hoarding; stashing as much food as possible while the woodland was awake and bountiful.<br/><br/>The bear&rsquo;s brooding was interrupted by an annoyingly cheerful voice:<br/>&ldquo;Look Huni, another big juicy berry! This will be our biggest stash yet!&rdquo;<br/>It was those two ridiculously radiant rabbits, Huni &amp; Bunz. As he watched the little bunnies bounce from bush to bush a cunning plan started to form. Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have to make such an effort this year? After all, there were plenty of other critters already hard at work! Ol&rsquo; Grizz pondered this new revelation. If he could apply a little pressure, maybe twist a tail or two, he might just be able to convince his new best friends to share...<br/><br/>In Survival of the Fattest, you take the role of a woodland critter and use your unique tricks and abilities to forage for food. Spend your gathered food to complete delicious recipe&rsquo;s from the Market for in-game bonuses and end-game victory points. After 3 seasons, if you&rsquo;ve fed your critter and accumulated the most victory points, you shall be declared the winner!<br/><br/>Survival of the Fattest is a visually stunning family-weight game using action selection, hand management and unique critter abilities!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Decide the size of the board (8x8 or 10x10).<br/><br/>Red places one disc onto an empty cell of the board. Then, starting with Black, players alternate turns placing 2 discs of their colour onto empty spaces until either one of the players resigns or all cells are occupied.<br/><br/>If, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn (after placing both stones) a squ bigger than any previous squ of any colour has been created, the player places one pyramid of her colour on each of the 4 corners of that squ (covering each of the 4 discs). This is, the pyramids are used to keep track of the largest squ of each colour. Notice that the discs covered by pyramids still count for future squs.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/><br/>When the game ends, the player with the largest squ wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The &quot;Thread&quot; has been added to balance things out. Although mainly for kids, this is a great game to be played by adults alike.<br/><br/>The idea is to make kids become familiar with geometric shapes and colours as well as doing basic maths at the same time. <br/>- The Scissor wins against both the Thread and the Paper.<br/>- The String wins against both the Rock and the Paper.<br/>- The Paper wins against the Rock<br/>- The Rock wins against the Scissor<br/><br/>So, according to the power of each object, these are worth either 1 or 2 Points. Each shape appears several times, so players will be able to make calculated guesses on what would be the best piece to play at a given time. The stakes increase if both players play the same piece simultaneously, since these will accumulate to the Victory Points.<br/><br/>A game to be played in little time with net to no set-up time!

Players may draw random chits from a Control Pool, which gives them a chance to assume secret control of a unit (Civilian, Paramilitary or Military), or deliberately choose from a selection of Action Chits which allow them to investigate, infiltrate, neutralize or block what other players are doing.<br/><br/>The second, Coup phase, begins once one player declares a coup d'etat. Each turn represents one to several hours, as gameplay changes from secret plotting to open, active warfare. Players choose sides and maneuver and fight for control of vital points on an area-movement map of Santiago, capital of a Chile in chaos.<br/><br/>The true winner of the game is not obvious until its very end, when players reveal their hidden agendas and score according to the plans they had all along!<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>105 counters including 44 units, chits to Control them, and Action Chits to play<br/>A 18&Prime; x 12&Prime; area movement map of downtown Santiago as it appeared in 1973<br/>Rulebook and storage bag<br/><br/>Players: Two to four or more (maximum limited only by number of players available)<br/>Duration: 45 to 90 Minutes<br/>Complexity: Medium-Low<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DUEL BOY is a trading card game with unique seven-card packs. The game was first distributed at the 2022 Fall Tokyo Game Market. The packs include seven cards for playing the game, one divider card, and a sticker the owner can wear to help find opponents to play the game.<br/><br/>The game was designed to be played while standing (for instance, while in line to buy a game) and does not require a table. After a match, the players swap two cards, with each player leaving with five cards they entered the game with and two of their opponent's cards.<br/><br/>After an initial shuffle of cards, a player has one chance to reshuffle, but otherwise must play their hand as it has been drawn. A game is made up of several rounds, and the first player to win three hands or cause their opponent to not be able to play a card on their first turn of a hand wins the game.<br/><br/>Players can play cards only from the rightmost end of their hand and must pay the cost of cards with the cards from the left end of their hand. Once per hand, a player can put the cards from their discard pile on the bottom of the deck &mdash; in the exact order they were discarded.<br/><br/>",

As the Great Houses of Westeros clash over the Iron Throne, players must continually evaluate whether the reward of bringing powerful new cards into play is worth the risk of losing those cards to the enemy. Whichever House you lead, you'll find iconic characters, like Viserys Targaryen and Wex Pyke, leading you closer to The Champion's Purse.<br/><br/>The Champion's Purse includes three copies each of twenty new cards and introduces the &quot;prized&quot; keyword, which balances tremendous risks and rewards in deck-building and play.<br/><br/>",

Avid baseball fans will appreciate the fact that each batter mimics the talents of some of baseball's greatest legends.<br/><br/>Once a batter is placed in the batter's box, the real fun begins! The pitcher and batter take up their respective tokens and begin to take the next few seconds to formulate a game plan. The pitcher can choose to throw a &quot;Ball&quot; or &quot;Strike&quot; and the batter can choose to &quot;Swing&quot; or &quot;Take a Pitch.&quot; When the batter &quot;Swings&quot; at a &quot;Strike,&quot; the batter rolls the dice out of the &quot;Ump Cup&quot; to determine the result of the play. Make your selections wisely, as you don&rsquo;t want to be too risky, too safe, or too predictable!<br/><br/>This game is easy to learn, fun to play, and hard to put down. It travels easily from the kitchen table to the local pub and everywhere in between.<br/><br/>Now go ahead, see if you can out smart your opponent in this poker-meets-baseball challenge fittingly dubbed &ldquo;Baseball&rsquo;s Fastest Board Game.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Batter up!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Metallic Dreams is a five-color deck built around artifacts.<br/><br/>Planechase is a card game and a variant of Magic: The Gathering  with an emphasis on multi-player games. The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.<br/><br/>To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a &quot;shared planar deck,&quot; which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one &quot;Chaos&quot; ability.<br/><br/>Players also need a six-sided die, called the &quot;planar die.&quot; Each Planechase pre-constructed deck comes with a &quot;planar die&quot; that has four blank faces, one &quot;Planeswalk&quot; face with the &quot;Planeswalker&quot; symbol, and one &quot;Chaos&quot; face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If &quot;Chaos&quot; is rolled, the &quot;Chaos&quot; ability of the current plane card triggers. If the &quot;Planeswalk&quot; symbol is rolled, the player &quot;planeswalks away&quot; from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been &quot;planeswalked to.&quot; A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.<br/><br/>Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.<br/><br/>",

Enlist in the help of magical seahorses that give you extra victory points and encounter scuba divers that allow you to alter the board.<br/><br/>Fight the incoming tide every three turns while you alternate moves in this highly strategic duel game. Sometimes the tide carries in diamonds, requiring you to decide when and where to focus the most attention. Earn the most seashells and win the favor of the inhabitants of the Gem Islands!<br/><br/>Your turn is simple. You will place one of your gems on an open space of one of the islands available. The island you are sent to depends on where the previous gem was placed. Picture each island as a representation of the whole 3x3 board. Whichever of the nine spaces are chosen is the island that the next gem must be placed. For instance, the blue gem is placed on the middle right space of the island. This means that the next gem will be played on the middle right island. This will continue until all 27 gems have been placed.<br/><br/>Battle it out with your rival islander to complete patterns, control each of the islands and recruit seahorses.<br/><br/>Every game is different! With 14 islands to choose from, no two games will ever be the same. Seahorse cards score in two different ways from the orientation of the player, meaning any one card has different value for both players!<br/><br/>Tide cards dictate the flow of the game, either flooding an island or revealing diamonds that can lead to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>        Cardboard Edison Runner-Up 2022<br/>        LUCI Award Finalist 2022<br/>        Board Game Design Lab Challenge Runner-Up 2019<br/>        Note: This game is completely changed from its 2019 iteration.  While using some mechanics from the old version, Island of Gems in its current state has been adapted for 2 players with fundamental scoring changes and differences in components, component count and presentation.  For the purpose of BGG, this is still considered related to its old version but the similarities are very minimal.  The videos on the BGG page reflect its old iteration and not the new one.  This is a complete rehaul.  The game was an attempted KS that I cancelled and no copies of this game have been sold as this game is still looking for a publisher.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Roll your dice and use them wisely to explore, camp, and settle your way to victory. Explore areas to benefit yourself while disturbing other explorers. Make yourself a camp for better reach, and build your settlement in a well-charted area for victory!<br/><br/>Start the game after the direction of the compass is determined, flip all the 7 face-down tiles and every player places their starting camp on whichever tiles they like.  Roll the dice to determine what actions you can take. Each player takes turns to use the dice with the corresponding direction of the hexagon compass to explore (place a tile) or place a camp. You can sacrifice dice to reroll for the rest of the unused dice regardless of your turn.<br/><br/>Placing a camp expands your starting point for exploration and potentially develops into a settlement for victory points. To develop a settlement you need dice with the corresponding number of pips according to the settlement score which is determined by the terrain adjacency of the mentioned settlement, place the dice used as settlement below the pre-existing camp. every player can only develop a settlement once per round. after the players use all of their dice, the round ends and take all the dice not used as a settlement, and start a new round by rolling the dice.<br/><br/>The end game triggers after 2 stack of exploration tiles exhausted or a player have created 4 settlements, finish the present round as usual and starting the last round. The player with the most amount of pip from the dice used as a settlement win.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Their largest shareholder is the Director, and they alone make decisions for the company.

To achieve their goal, players may also invest in companies shares, speculating on future returns and market values.<br/> 18BE introduces a 3D map board with overlays and unique features to ensure each session delivers their very own challenges. Companies may purchase different types of trains, invest in different trade opportunities (the so-called &quot;Links&quot;) and/or Upgrades. Thus each company will most probably be played in a totally different way from one session to the next. Experienced gamers should be able to play the game in less than 6 hours.

The game is designed for 25mm miniatures, but is adaptable to 15mm. Each miniature represents one warrior with his own physical attributes, weapons, and combat skills.<br/><br/>BattleLust is designed for any number of players. Each player typically commands a company of about twenty warriors, but an experienced player can operate two or more companies. BattleLust is compatible with our role-playing H&acirc;rnMaster rules. The game can be used as a quick combat system for H&acirc;rnMaster , or you can use H&acirc;rnMaster as a source of optional advanced rules for BattleLust.<br/><br/>BattleLust provides a strong contrast to the usual fantasy miniatures game. There are no dragons and monsters here. While there are strong men and weak men, no single hero dominates the battlefield. There is no gunpowder, no war wagons, and no suits of plate armor. Instead, this is a game solidly based on the realities of medieval warfare.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Gertrud: The German Invasion of Turkey is a speculative two-player wargame about a German invasion of Turkey during the Second World War. The historical course of events during World War II precluded any likelihood that the Germans would invade their erstwhile ally, it is conceivable that a different turn of events could have precipitated a German Blitzkrieg into Turkey. The Turks were concerned about this possibility and they endeavored to remain neutral during the war. Unlike the First World War, the Turks could not hope to hold Istanbul in the event of a war, and any incursion by one side (Axis or Allied) would certainly invite an incursion by the other. The Turks were most concerned about Soviets, but if Hitler had conceived a notion of invading Turkey, the Germans' most daunting challenge would be the Allied response, not necessarily the Turkish Army. The Turks had been underestimated during the previous world war, and so it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess how well they could have faced up to the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>Components: 22x34 inch map, 176 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>World at War #49, April 2016<br/><br/>",

He sought out the object of his lust and seduced her while she worshipped at the temple of Athena, and then he retreated into the sea. The goddess Athena discovered the blasphemous act which had occurred within her temple, and she punished Medusa with a terrible curse. Medusa&rsquo;s mind was shattered, her hair turned to snakes, and all those who gazed upon her would be turned to stone.<br/><br/>The wrathful gods have now come to punish the Atlanteans, sinking their island forever. Knowing that the Atlanteans are clever, Athena unleashed the gorgon, Medusa, to turn the entire populace to stone and thwart any efforts to save Atlantis. As the waters rise, you and your fellow Atlanteans must work quickly to defeat the gorgon and save your people!<br/><br/>Medusa Unleashed is a new module for Atlantis Rising and can be used with any player count. The new expansion introduces Monsters, persistent misfortunes that continue to hinder your progress once activated. Each round, Medusa is drawn to a random tile on the island. Any Atlantean workers on this tile are immediately turned to stone! If there are no workers present, she instead targets the populace.Petrified volunteers fill the island tile and limit the number of available action spaces.<br/><br/>The Artisan comes to your aid as a new playable councilor. The Artisan can create mystical items to equip your workers, granting them exciting new powers. In a twist on the ancient myth, you can even construct and use a fabled mirror shield to break Medusa&rsquo;s curse! With her curse broken, Medusa turns her rage towards the gods and joins your cause, unlocked as a councilor for future games!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Takes 2 min to learn, about 15 min to play and 3 min to regret your decisions.&quot; - from Kickstarter description.<br/><br/>Kawaii Chaos is a card game in which each player starts with a hand of 3 cards.  On each turn, players draw one card and play one card.  Cards may be points, which are played into a player's tableau, or action cards that protect your own point cards, destroy, nullify or steal other players' point cards, change the rules of the game, or bring the game to a premature halt.  The game ends when a player reaches 500 points.<br/><br/>",

In devices, you gather resources and build machines that process and change those resources in order to fulfill different customer orders. Every customer order is worth varying amounts of points.<br/><br/>Customer orders are placed in the middle of the table to draft along with the &quot;parts shop&quot;, where you get the parts for your devices. Players start off with basic machine parts and 1 cube of each color. The game is played over several rounds. Players can choose between several basic actions each round: collect cubes, buy cards (using cubes), accept customer orders, build parts from your hand on to your device, dismantle your machine, or load cubes into your machine and run it. Cubes that go into your device come out in various colors and amounts--depending on the machine you've built! You can then store those cubes or use them to fulfill a customer order and get points. The first player to reach 30 points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lassadar's defenses are not as they once were, the Wardens are greatly reduced in number and magic is seemingly drained from the land.<br/><br/>From the South now arises a new threat. Twelve dread barons have formed a pact and pledged to take Lassadar for their own. They have gathered their armies and new allies - the Trulls, hulking brutes that hurl stones like mobile catapults - and have come north to Dalnish, a border city and first line of defense against invasion, to lay siege.<br/><br/>The Tower of Dalnish stands ready to repel the invasion but supplies and soldiers are limited. As the Captain of the Guard, it is your responsibility to hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Rally your men, ready your weapons. They are upon you.....<br/><br/>A solo tower siege game lasting about 20 minutes and is the first game in the 2nd Lassadar game trilogy.<br/><br/>You, and the forces you command, must hold out long enough until Reinforcements arrive (drawn from the Event deck). If you can succeed in this you will drive the Barons and their armies back across the Southern border. If all of your Tower&rsquo;s battlements are destroyed by Enemy Units or all of your Tower Units are slain or destroyed you lose the game and Lassadar is invaded.<br/><br/>42 cards, divided into Defensive Units, Enemy Units and Events are payed on a 2 section game board. Each Unit has a set of attack and defensive values. Using Action Points units played by the player can be deployed, engaged and repaired.<br/><br/>Unique to this game are Damage Pattern footprints that players must use effectively to combat Enemy Units.<br/><br/>A series of Event cards act as an AI in the game changing game play as the rounds progress. These cards are drawn when sufficient damage is done to the Enemy Units<br/><br/>Dice counters have been provided along with the card files/player board.

The player assumes the role of Major-General Charles &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; Gordon, Governor and self-appointed defender of Khartoum, besieged by the Mahdi's Dervish rebel forces. As the Player, you will have to use your few military units and meager resources skillfully to hold out long enough for British relief forces to come to the rescue&hellip;or gloriously die like Gordon himself did.<br/><br/>The game is not intended to be a totally accurate simulation of the siege of Khartoum but is meant to create an interactive narrative and gaming experience in which the Player is required to make crucial decisions to have any chance of protecting the city and its inhabitants from the wrath of the Dervishes. The Player must improve the city&rsquo;s fortifications, build makeshift Gunboats, mount daring raids and sorties, and tactically respond with military units and leaders to prevent the Mahdi's army from capturing key city defensive locations and, ultimately, the Governor&rsquo;s Palace. All the while, you must manage to keep up the city&rsquo;s morale in the face of adverse events and the continuing effects of the siege.<br/><br/>Are you up to the challenge, Gordon Pasha?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The campaign saw the Italians seize the coastal towns, but the Ottomans, supported by local Arab and Bedouin tribes, fell back into the interior. The war came to an end via Italian naval attacks in the Aegean and elsewhere, with the Ottomans finally ceding Libya to Rome. This laid the foundation for the establishment of an Italian colony and had an obvious effect on the campaign in North Africa during World War II. <br/>Scale: Each hex represents 45 kilometers, with each game turn one to two months.

To pick up, choose all of the passenger cards of one color from the row waiting at the bus stop, then place them in your bus &mdash; that is, the area in front of you, which can hold at most ten cards. Senior citizens aren't going far, so you score them immediately instead of placing them on the bus.<br/><br/>To drop off, choose a group of passengers on your bus that match one of the available destination cards &mdash; for example, all men, all girls, or one passenger of each color &mdash; then remove these passengers from your bus and place them under the card. You score points for each card depending on how many people you delivered at once, so aim for large groups. Whenever a player drops off, everyone else can make one of their matching passengers skedaddle, removing them from the bus and placing them in a personal scoring pile with their senior citizens.<br/><br/>When the bus stop can't be refilled with passengers or only a certain number of destination cards remain, the game ends. Tally your score, earning 1 point for each single card and the listed points for each destination card. If your bus is empty, congratulations! You earn a depot bonus for not stranding passengers on your bus. They will thank you for not doing that...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NBC Game of the Week Baseball is a card-driven game using a simple chart, spinners, and a gridded gameboard / playing field to determine the result of each play. Each team selects a batting line-up from the two identical teams of individually-rated players (&quot;.210 medium left,&quot; &quot;.300 heavy right,&quot; etc). The team in the field positions its players on the grid. The &quot;pitcher&quot; throws one of the ten blue &quot;pitch&quot; cards he holds at the same time the &quot;batter&quot; throws one of the seven red &quot;hit&quot; cards he holds. The two cards are indexed against the chart featured on the board. If the chart indicates the ball has been hit, the &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;direction&quot; spinners are used to indicate exactly where the ball has been hit. If that indication is the white dot of the grid on which a fielder is stationed, or an immediately adjacent dot, the out is made. Otherwise, it's a base hit, and extra bases depending on how far it is away from a fielder. There are additional rules for base runner advance, double plays, force outs, sacrifices, hit-&amp;-run, pick-offs, and errors.<br/><br/>",

We become those villagers driving wagons through the countryside, visiting homes to collect Firewood &amp; Weapons. We take these to the Village Center and make Ploughshares. Watch for the Tsar's patrolling soldiers who will confiscate our wagons and send us to prison. Learn love and courage so, with the guidance of our Wise Elders, we will remain determined in our Cause. We might even inspire some Soldiers to drop their weapons and join with us. It will be an Adventure filled with danger and great rewards.

        "description": "&quot;Elemental Wars&quot; is a non-collectible fantasy card game. It is played with a deck of 40 cards, 10 for each of the Element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth) with a Strength ranking from 10 to 1. The strongest cards (Strength from 10 to 6) have a Fame score of 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points.<br/><br/>The classical version is played in four, with the persons sitting in front of each other forming a team (but in the booklet there are variants for different numbers of players).<br/><br/>Before the game begins, one of the four players shuffles the deck and places it in front of the player to his left who must &quot;cut&quot; it. The dealer then distributes three cards to each of the four players (either singly or all three at once), in a counterclockwise rotation, beginning with the player on his immediate right.<br/><br/>He then uncovers the thirteenth card and places it prominently in the center of the table. This card, regardless of its rank, identifies the Elemental plane on which the Tournament takes place: the Dominating one. The remaining cards are usually placed, face down, as a stack on top of the Dominating card, but not obscuring it.<br/><br/>The game begins with the player to the dealer's immediate right, and goes around the table until the dealer has played last. Each round of four cards played constitutes a round of tournament. The winner of each rounf gathers all four cards and places them, face down, on his side of the table<br/><br/>The winner of each hand is determined by the Strength and the Element of the cards. The winner is the player that dropped the strongest card of the Element that has been played first on that round; but if somebody played a card of the Dominating element, the winner is the strongest of that element.<br/><br/>The winner of each round then draws one card from the deck. Then the others also draw one card, in sequence. Play continues until all the cards have been played.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the total number of Fame points is added up for each team. As there are 30 points for each Element, the maximum number of points is 120. The winner of the game is the team which scores 61 or more points. The score over 60 is kept to see which team wins the partita (the set) scoring a fixed amount of points.<br/><br/>The cards have to be cut from a booklet that belongs to &quot;I giochi del duemila&quot; (&quot;The games of 2000&quot;) collection: a series of role-playing games, game books, wargames, card games and so on that included 23 titles. The name of the collection refers both to the end of the millennium and to the price: 2000 liras, that means 1.03 Euros, making them the cheapest games in Italy.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     Briscola (1800)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules have been designed to simulate a modern naval action involving surface ships, submarines and aircraft of todays (1980s) navies, using the recently introduced range of 1:3000 scale warships.<br/><br/>The rules were originally designed for a large scale naval campaign in which large numbers of ship8 would be engaged in combat. To achieve this it was necessary to generalize certain areas for the sake of playability this, whilst not giving absolute realism (which can never be achieved in a game), resulted in a very fast and enjoyable game. The rules are not designed for a single ship v. single ship combat, as it was considered &ldquo;highly unlikely&rdquo; that in any future Warpac/NATO conflict a solitary NATO ship would come across and fight a solitary WarPac warship. The more likely course of events 1s for the WarPac (Soviet) navies to sail (by devious routes) to prearranged rendezvous points several days before hostilities are due to commence. From there the &ldquo;Task Forces&rdquo; prime function would be to disrupt the American reinforcement of Europe; to intercept and destroy the Vital oil cargoes in the Arabian Gulf, off the African coast and in the Indian Ocean; to prevent the transfer of allied warships into and out of the Mediterranean, and to harass the US Pacific Fleet (with the idea of drawing forces from the Atlantic to keep the Pacific Fleet &ldquo;in being&rdquo; to counter any threat in the Pacific) A further option open to the Soviets would be to use the obsolete Kynda class cruisers to bombard US coastal cities with their long range missiles, compelling the US to keep back warships to protect their own coasts.<br/><br/>In any of the above scenarios the Soviets would use their ships &lsquo;en masse&rsquo; to achieve their objectives. It was with those actions in mind that these rules were written, to enable the Wargamer to fight through the Atlantic convoys, to endeavor to keep the oil flowing or to fight for the glory of the revolution and crush the wicked capitalists (even if it costs you your life comrade). It is hoped that the users of these rules do know something of modern warships and win use this set as the basis of a campaign involving a number of wargamers as it is only when there are large numbers of ships involved that the maximum enjoyment can be obtained.<br/><br/>Scale<br/>1 move = 2.5 minutes<br/>1 inch = 1km<br/>2mm/turn = 1knot<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Hardy Boys Treasure Game, private detective Fenton Hardy has agreed to let his boys (Frank and Joe - The Hardy Boys) help search for Mr. Applegate's missing doubloons, stolen 10 years ago.<br/><br/>In this roll-and-move children's game, players move along a winding path picking up Gold Doubloons which will allow them to acquire extra Bags of Gold at the Water Tower before racing to the Finish Line. The goal is to be the first to reach the Finish Line with at least 1 Bag of Gold.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>On your turn, roll the die, then move your pawn that number of spaces. After the first turn, you can choose to move either forward or backward, but you can never land on an occupied space. If you can't move the full number on the die in either direction without ending on an occupied space, you forfeit your turn. If you land on a space marked Message Card, take a message card and follow its instructions.<br/><br/>Along the track to the Water Tower and Finish Line, you can make detours to pick up gold doubloons. You do not have to roll exactly to reach a gold doubloon space, you can end your movement on the gold space and attempt to acquire it by rolling the number next to it. If you are successful, pick up the gold. If not, you'll have to return to the main track on your next turn, then try again if you want.<br/><br/>When you reach the ladder to the Water Tower, you move up the ladder toward the top space marked Take Gold. You must reach the Take Gold space by exact roll. Once there you can take one Bag of Gold, plus one additional Bag for each doubloon you've collected.<br/><br/>Then it's back down the ladder and a race to the Finish. Once you enter the area between the Water Tower and the Finish, you can not move back out of it. Watch out for the Black Spaces. If you land on a Black Space without a Bag of Gold on it, you'll have to place one of your bags of gold on it. If, however, there is already a Bag of Gold there, you can claim that Bag of Gold.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the Finish, by exact count, with a Bag of Gold, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

With 2 or 4 players you play with 4 sets of pieces and the pieces opposite to each other are partners or teams. The object is to checkmate the other team Kings... so you need 2 checkmates to win ... or a checkmate and a stalemate to win! The Beauty of this game is when your team first gets checkmated you don't lose all that players pieces! Depending on what configuration everyone agreed on at the start of the game determines what pieces are removed when a checkmate occurs. So everybody stays in the game.... right to the end! Piece movement is the same as traditional 2 player chess... with just a few variations that are easy to learn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the game's website:<br/><br/>Gambler was invented by Charlie Towlson and friends in 1987 and has attracted a huge cult following amongst those who play it. This has lead to annual tournaments, most notably the UK Championships which grows in attendance every year.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to gamble your way around the world on a set course of Reno -&gt; London -&gt; Monte Carlo -&gt; Tokyo -&gt; Sun City -&gt; Las Vegas. The game is won when a player completes the course and finally wins a bet in Las Vegas. This means that the climax to every game is always a winning bet; failure to win that bet means the game continues.<br/><br/>Gambler made its serious debut at the London International Toy Fair in 1998 and was voted in the Top Ten New Games.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mage Warfare is a new CCG created by a NH teenager.  After years of playtesting, it was brought to market in October 2005.<br/><br/>The story concept is that you are a Mage in the Exocosm, the plane of existence that surrounds and connects all realities.  You can pull warriors and weapons from any reality to do battle for you.  Thus you can fight with samurai, vampires, MechaClowns, angels, demons, Nexans, dragons, etc., etc.<br/><br/>The focus of the game is strategy.  You play with three decks: Barracks, Armory and Spellbook and on each turn you choose which one to draw from.  Combat has three ranges: Long, Medium and Close, moving through the ranges as you fight, with many ways to affect the battle.  Long Range weapons give ground troops the chance to shoot down flyers and some weapons can be thrown at opponents.  When you defeat an enemy, you can loot the weapons they leave behind.<br/><br/>The resource for creating your warriors, etc., is a product of your Mage's HP, as well as the damage you inflict on your opponent.<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is to complete the most sets.

In RFL, players take on the role of a franchise manager and coach.  The players will draft rookies, sign free agents, manage franchise finances and try to make a run at the league championship, all at the same time!  Rogue Football League runs over the course of three seasons, so owners will have plenty of time to see their league grow and succeed.<br/><br/>What makes RFL fun to play is that while players are trying to beat each other on the field, they must work together for the success of the league off the field, or no one wins.<br/><br/>It is not necessary to have eight players to play RFL.  While the game has mechanics for non-player franchises, and can even be played solitaire, interaction is a BIG part of the game.<br/><br/>League models, or templates, are available for leagues of between six and twelve teams. Each individual game on the schedule can be resolved in 3-5 minutes with the two owners rolling against each other, or a quick play function is available if owners wish to concentrate on the managerial/financial aspects of the league.<br/><br/>Rogue Football League comes with a 14-page rulebook, 24 franchise cards, 52 veteran cards, 44 rookie cards, 60 event cards, originals of all necessary game forms, and three double-sided player aid cards.<br/><br/>     Two expansions have been released: Foreign Fields, which adds in more league templates, more cards and rules for Canadian/European franchises; and Ghosts of the Past, which adds in more cards, a random event table and scenarios for recreating the USFL, WFL, and WLAF<br/> Available from Brothers-in-Arms Games at biagamesonline.tripod.com - check out the site and check out the game.<br/><br/>",

A Record Sheet is made out with values for each Leader and Warband involved in a game.<br/><br/>Initiative is determine by use of cards from a conventional card deck.  Each player is assigned a card number or suit, adding a card for each Warband under a player's control.  Additional cards can be added to reflect additional events or participants in a given scenario, for example, the random appearance of a traveling Lord or Bishop and retinue.<br/><br/>Dynamics of play involve Morale, Courage, Agility, Terrain, Non-Warband Movement, Shieldwalls and Wedges, the use of ships, and Mounted forces.  Information is provided for Saxons and Normans as well as Vikings, and the system is also adaptable to other peoples with whom the Vikings interacted, including Picts, Arabs or Skraelings (Native Americans) with a little historical research on the gamer's part.<br/><br/>The game is well suited to multiplayer games, each player handling one or more Warbands of anywhere from six to twenty or more figures on the table.  Game length is dependent upon the scenario design, from swift ship-to-ship fights to extended coastal raids or open-field battles.<br/><br/>The game is enhanced by the inclusion of a random events card deck which adds variety and surprises to play.<br/><br/>Unlike many sets of miniatures rules, Strandhogg can be enjoyed by players owning only a few dozen figures; an average Warband might number ten to twelve figures, and three Warbands compose a raiding force under a Noble.  The rulebook is sprinkled with sidebars featuring excerpts from the Norse Sagas for flavor, and also includes optional rules for special attributes or traits to individualize Leaders or leading warriors (for example, a warrior surnamed &quot;the Stout&quot; gains +1 on Defense; &quot;Leg Biter&quot; enjoys a +1 on Offense).<br/><br/>Players will often find themselves identifying strongly with the fortunes of their warband and even individuals within it; although Strandhogg is not a role-playing game, it deliberately strives to impart a strong flavor of its Viking focus.<br/><br/>Web address: STRANDHOGG@rochester.rr.com<br/><br/>",

The rules do have a few points of distinction.  For example, units have a stacking limit of two, and cannot attack on the same turn that a stack is created, so building up a concentrated assault takes time.  The advanced rules add different movement rules for different unit types and introduce battles which can continue over more than one turn.<br/><br/>The game is most notable for its map, which is full-color and mounted - highly unusual for a small wargame company at the time.  The map is 21.5&quot;x22.5&quot;.  Besides the map, two rules booklets, and a die, the game contains 110 counters, of which 41 are blanks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Universal Soldier Miniature Rules (1977, RAFM) is a stand-alone comprehensive set of rules for wargaming with military miniatures (25mm or 15mm). The emphasis of the rules is to provide a method for fighting battles with both historical and fictional armies. The rules include simple, easy to remember, combat and missile fire systems that use six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Chapters cover how to form units, orders, movement, missile fire, melee combat, morale, control, fatigue, and special weapons and tactics. There is some simultaneous movement allowed, which will sometimes require pro-rating moves to determine where units contact. Units are rated for attack and defense, using a letter system (&quot;A&quot; being the best, &quot;E&quot; being the worst). There are three ranges for missile-armed troops, as well as ammunition rules. About 6-24 six-sided dice are needed, depending on the size of the game. This is a casualty-removal system. There is a point system for designing games with balanced sides.<br/><br/>Most of the examples and scenarios are from the late medieval / early renaissance period, but the rules can be applied to earlier periods.<br/><br/>Although an old set of rules, it was a good miniatures rules set for new players that wanted to try tabletop miniatures wargaming, and less complex than other contemporary miniatures rules of the time that covered the ancient through medieval periods.<br/><br/>RAFM actively promoted these miniatures rules through the 1980's at major conventions, such as ORIGINS, as well as historical miniature shows (such as HISTORICON) by hosting historical-based battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game's theme is of a horse race held in Siena, Italy twice each summer. The city is comprised of 17 fiercely competitive neighborhoods (contrada) that each have their own flag and coat of arms (stemma). Ten of the 17 neighborhoods compete with one horse each in the race. The jockeys' garb are each inspired by their neighborhood's flag &amp; stemma. A piece of fabric is embroidered with the contrada's stemma and this item is attached to the horse's head (I presume via braiding into the mane but I do not know) A horse is disqualified if its head piece is not present at the finish. The jockeys ride bareback and carry a large riding crop called a nerbata. Although striking other horses and jockeys with the nerbata is not permitted, it does happen fairly often.  The winner of the Palio is literally the horse that crosses the finish line first, the rider is not required to be mounted. The people of the winning neighborhood brag about the victory constantly until the next race.<br/><br/>This game is a very rare simulation of the Sienese Palio published in a sort of game collection series, the Italian &quot;Era della Guerra&quot; journal.  The journal has several pages about the game's theme which will help you understand and appreciate the game.  Example; The first question you will ask is: &quot;Why doesn't this game have a start like other games that I have played.  Its simple, in horse racing the gate opens and the horses can only run in one direction.&quot;  I'll give away the answer, in the text of the journal you will learn that there is no starting gate, just a rope pulled tight across the track.<br/><br/>Unlike the real Palio, where only 10 &quot;contradas&quot; among 17 are allowed to participate in the horse race around Piazza del Campo, &quot;il Gioco del Palio di Siena&quot; is open to 8-17 jockeys (a player may control more than one horse). Each &quot;contrada&quot; has 2 pawns: the &quot;montata&quot; and the &quot;scossa&quot;. The first one shows the horse with its jockey, whereas the &quot;scossa&quot; shows the runaway horse without its jockey. The preliminary actions include: drawing lots for contrada and for horses &quot;tratta&quot;, holding a sealed first price auction for jockeys, establishing a secondary purse that amounts to side bets among extra hostile &quot;contradas&quot;, determining the post line up via a humorous and combative iterative process. Finally, the race starts.<br/><br/>A rather sophisticated dice rolling system determines horse movement. There are two very sharp turns on the race-track where players must see if their horse falls or throws its rider.  Throwing a rider does not put the horse out of the race, the player replaces the &quot;montata&quot; pawn with the &quot;scossa&quot; pawn.  Players may give a nearby Horse-Jockey a wack with their club-like nerbata.  However, wacking another horse-jockey with your nerbata can back fire on you. It is a good idea for the Player to hold back enough money from the earlier game phases to bribe other Jockeys during the race.  The race-track is divided into 293 boxes, each with a number.  The numbers on the spaces determine the turn order within each round, which is important in most all racing games. The numbers are distributed in a manner so that there is a logical best path.  A horse that can get on this best path will gain ground on the leaders and the leader can pull away from the pack, unless another player has bribed the jockey!!  Il gioco del Palio di Siena lasts for 3 complete laps.<br/><br/>Nell&rsquo;ora di Sunto (the bell in the Mangia tower), al tempo della Gloria!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kar-a-a-ate Men is a unique, hard to find game from the mid 70's.  Each player has a movable platform with a Karate champion action figure, roughly a foot tall, attached to the end.  The platform has three control levers which allow you to left jab, right chop or right kick.  Each figure has two pressure or impact points (one on the head and one on the chest).  The object is to strike a blow to your opponent which triggers the pressure point and causes them to fall backwards.<br/><br/>The Karate champions both have a brown belt to begin with.  If you win the match (first player to four points) you get to trade in your brown belt for a black belt.<br/><br/>The neat thing about the game is that it doesn't use batteries.  It also has tightening screws on the bottom of the  platform to ensure the spring like mechanisms work correctly.<br/><br/>The rules are quite simple, however, they also include penalties for cheating (ex. lifting the platform during the fight).<br/><br/>",

Grant on the orders given to General Phillip Sheridan, August 7th, 1864.<br/> &ldquo;&hellip;as [the 23rd Ohio] rose from the bank, away went my boys as though ten thousand devils were after them.&rdquo;  --Confederate General John B. Gordon, following the battle of Opequon Creek.<br/> Devil Takes All! is a simulation of the battle fought on September 19th, 1864, at Opequon Creek (also called the Third Battle of Winchester) between the Confederate Army of the Valley under General Jubal Early and the Union Army of the Shenandoah under General Phillip Sheridan.  The battle was one of the last fought in the Shenandoah Valley.  Former Vice-President of the United States, John C. Breckinridge, was in titular command of the Confederate forces, while two future presidents, Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley, figured prominently in the battle&rsquo;s outcome.<br/> Devil Takes All! uses an interactive sequence of play that activates formations, and their subordinate units, by the types of orders (Attack, Advance, Stand, Reserve) they have been issued. Combat is of two types, fire and melee, and both individual unit and larger formation morale figure prominently in the game&rsquo;s outcome. Rules include ones for leaders, variable reinforcements, and possible Confederate withdrawal. Scenarios cover the morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;opening round&rdquo; in which both sides were surprised to discover a fight would occur here, the afternoon&rsquo;s bloody, climatic slugfest in which the remnants of the Stonewall Brigade made their final appearance, as well as the comprehensive day-long battle.<br/> Terrain scale is about 500 meters per hex<br/>Infantry units and cavalry units are brigades, artillery units are battalions. <br/>Each strength point represents 250 men.<br/>Each turn is about 45 minutes. <br/> Playing time is about 2.5 to 3 hours for the AM and PM scenarios, about 6+ hours for the day-long battle scenario. Although designed for two players, Devil Takes All! can easily be played solitaire.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the designer:)<br/><br/>On June 12, 1898. Filipino revolutionary forces under Emilio Aguinaldo declared proclaimed independence of the Philippine islands from the colonial rule of Spain. The declaration of independence however was not recognized by the United States of America and Spain since the Spanish government ceded the Philipines to the USA in the aftermath of the 1898 Treaty of Paris which formally ended the Spanish American war (April 25 to August 12, 1898). Tensions already existed between both sides due to conflicting movements of independence and colonization further aggravated by misunderstandings on both sides and feelings of betrayal on the Filipino side. The tensions escalated between the former allies on February 4, 1899 when a Filipino soldier was shot by an American soldier (William W. Grayson) in Manila. Fighting soon erupted in Manila and culminated in an official Filipino declaration of war by the Malolos congress on June 2, 1899. The war would last 3 bloody years and would see a short conventional war followed by a long guerilla war which would be a prelude of things to come in Vietnam 60 years later.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&quot;Bolos &amp; Krags&quot; is a simulation of the Philippine American War 1899-1902 which saw 4 years of brutal guerilla war resulting in 4,000 American soldiers and a million and a half Filipino dead. The war influenced Mao Tse Tung to refine his people's war guerilla doctrine which would haunt the U.S. in Vietnam and Iraq many decades later.<br/><br/>Area impulse action movement system.  280 counters, 12 pages of rules, area map covers all of Luzon. units are leaders of regiment sized battlegroups which you equip with companies in a system similiar to Death In the Trenches/CSA. Victory centers on Political will (like Byzantium Reborn/Battle For China). Combat is the NO CRT wescom system from Death in the Trenches/CSA. Has Strategic chits(from Storm Over Taierzhuang) to give both sides a wealth of strategic options. Lots of random events.<br/><br/>The game shows the political and military dimensions of the war. 16 bimonthly turns. In a historical, easy to play and learn, balanced and interactive format. Playable within one evening. Interesting situation as the U.S. with military supremacy tries to fight a guerilla war with determined but poorly equipped Philippine Republic insurgencts in one of the most roughest terrain in the world.<br/><br/>This game includes:<br/>Mark Twain, Bandit hunts, guerilla warfare, atrocities, Sun Yat Sen, Boxer Rebellion, Philippine Constabulary, President Mckinley, 1900 U.S. presidential elections, epidemics, Mao Tse Tung (Ok, a cameo in the random events), General Joe Wheeler, typhoon, hearts and minds and more...<br/><br/>This game is probably the first wargame on the Philippine American war 1899-1902 and this game will shed much needed light on a obscure part of American history.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rules to recreate battles of the American revolution period based on the warmaster rules.<br/><br/>The rules were published in Wargames Journal magazine Number 6. There are several scenarios and a campaign system in numbers 7 and 8 of the same magazine.<br/><br/>Several scenarios are available: Guildford courthouse, Brandywine (4 players) and 3 small actions from the same battle, Camden, Monmouth, Germantown.<br/><br/>Requirements:<br/><br/>Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), suppression markers, tape measures, a 4x4&rsquo; or 4x6&rsquo; playing area with appropriate terrain, and suitable miniatures. Typically is used 6mm miniatures on 40x20mm bases (unit faces long side) but the only real requirement is a standardized basing scheme. You may wish to use inches instead of centimeters with 15mm or larger figures.<br/><br/>Game Overview:<br/><br/>The game follows a ugo-igo pattern of alternating player turns. Games end when one side achieves its objectives or breaks due to mounting casualties.<br/>Each side operates several units. A unit represents either a company (60 men) or a battalion (600 men) and normally comprises three stands (or bases) of troops that always remain in contact. <br/>Officers and generals are represented by individual bases. Their role is to give their units or groups of units (called brigades) orders. Each officer and general has a command value assigned&mdash;a higher command value indicates a more capable officer and general.<br/>The crux of the game is the activation system. The player with the initiative (i.e., whose turn it is) identifies an officer or general and the unit(s) the officer or general wishes to order. <br/>Shooting is resolved with a single die roll (but many dice!) while melee requires a single competing die roll. Units can be suppressed or routed and stands can be killed. Over time, mounting casualties reduce the combat effectiveness of a unit.<br/><br/>",

This game requires lightning reflexes and mental agility, and people with experience in dancing video games tend to play better.<br/><br/>Players place cards on some stacks chaining arrows of the same direction. Each time you play a card, the next required card on that stack changes, so you have to rethink constantly what can you play in each place. Some arrows have special rules for an additional twist.<br/><br/>It is recommended (but not mandatory) to play with a referee. Original rules are for 2 players only, but a simple variation allows up to 6 players (divided in 2 teams).<br/><br/>",

For each combination of the 2 spinners, there is a tile with a drawn scene of those two items and thus there are 36 tiles total.<br/>On a turn both spinners are spun and when they halt, players need to find the corresponding scene depicting both items. The fastest player may add the tile to a player board which holds 8 tiles. The first player to fill his/her board wins the game.<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow for stealing scene tiles from other players. This is where a memory element comes into play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fast play air-to-air combat miniatures game for jets equipped with guns and missiles. The game uses a rectangular grid with playing card suits marking 4 rows and cards K to A marking 14 columns, similar to Gary Graber's G&ouml;ring's War.<br/><br/>Jets have individual flight characteristics for vertical and lateral movement, as well as armament and structural points.<br/><br/>Each turn a card is drawn for each jet to place it onto the grid on the appropriate space. Jets may be able to move to a different space by drawing a new card that must be lower than its movement rating. Thereafter shooting cannon fire and missiles is preformed in a similar fashion. At the end of each turn, the jets are removed from the grid, so may reappear on an entirely new angle of attack the following turn.<br/><br/>Rules provide many optional rules and complete aircraft statistics for any period from the Korean War to present.<br/><br/>A short introduction to the rules, focusing on the Vietnam era, is available in Wargames Illustrated No. 254 (December 2008), under the name &quot;Very Instant Thunder&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website.<br/><br/>Queen Victoria died in January, marking a literal and symbolic end to the 'Victorian' era. Two new powers - the United States and Japan - were entering the world stage, even as many in the old guard began to creak under the weight of their own might. Communism, in the person of Vladimir Ilych Lenin, had begun to rear its head in Czarist Russia. Technology and the industrial revolution were changing everything, including the weapons of war. And while the &quot;Boxer Rebellion&quot; in China was easily quashed, the incident demonstrated growing resentment of European dominance.<br/><br/>Starmada: Iron Stars reveals a world in crisis. Recovery from the Martian Invasion is slow, and its effects will be felt for decades to come. Hopes that the extraterrestrial threat would result in a new spirit of cooperation and coexistence have been quickly dashed, with the Great Powers scrambling to take advantage of technological tidbits left behind by the invaders. While recent conflicts have been thankfully limited in scope, it seems only a matter of time before Humanity is engulfed in a new conflagration, this one of its own making.<br/><br/>This supplement is a unique &quot;crossover&quot; project, combining two of our most popular gaming systems. The intent is to introduce fans of the Iron Stars universe to the Universal Game of Starship Combat, while at the same time exposing those Starmada players who may have been reluctant to jump into a different environment a glimpse at an alternate Earth in which the Martian Invasion really happened.<br/><br/>Outside of the thrills of Edwardian space combat, there is plenty in these pages to expand any Starmada setting, including new options like:<br/><br/>* Faceted shielding<br/>    * Crew-killer weapons<br/>    * Etheric movement<br/>    * Critical damage<br/><br/>And more!<br/><br/>Starmada: Iron Stars is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada: The Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.<br/><br/>",

They wanted &ldquo;old school&rdquo; combat where arguments were settled at the tip of a sword.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s what Chain Reaction 3.0 &ndash; Swordplay is all about. Hand to hand combat with sharp cutting and sticking weapons.<br/><br/>So we&rsquo;re giving away this companion rules set for you to use. That&rsquo;s right, giving away as in it&rsquo;s free. All the latest mechanics that can be used for ancient, medieval, and fantasy hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>Free.<br/><br/>Because we want you to try the Origins Award winning Reaction System which Two Hour Wargames is built around. What is the Reaction System?<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not for everyone. If you like total control of your forces then just keep walking because you&rsquo;ll hate it. But if you want realism where you control yourself and your forces succeed or fail based on your leadership skills then you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.<br/><br/>Just try it and if you like it then there&rsquo;s a whole world of games covering a variety of genres and periods waiting for you. And you STILL can use any figures you already have!<br/><br/>And if you don&rsquo;t like CR 3.0 &ndash; Swordplay it&rsquo;s all good.

It was to influence both literature and British army reform for years to come. &quot;1875: The Battle of Dorking&quot; allows two players to find out what might have happened at the key battle of this fictional campaign. Along with the rules and all the cut-outs needed, full background notes are given regarding Chesney's original book, the context of the campaign and the weaponry, organisation and tactics of both armies.

        "description": "Master of the Elements is an element-themed part strategy, part luck card-centered game where players aspire to be the first to master the elements by one of three methods: maximum power in each element, summoning 5 spirits, or playing a 9 card mastery set.<br/><br/>Players take turns going through the phases each round (referred to as the &quot;season&quot;).  Cards corresponding to the season have a bonus.  Each season, there is a lead player who chooses a special universal modifier.  It could be a draw bonus, it could be to prohibit using/summoning spirits or to prohibit special cards from being played.<br/><br/>The cards, spirits, element power levels, and seasons all interact in a synergistic way throughout the game.  Cards can allow you to draw more cards, put a spirit into play, or boost your element power level.  Spirits can help you draw more cards, boost your power level, and more!  Higher power levels means you may be able to draw more cards.<br/><br/>Do you go for element power? Can you summon enough spirits?  Do you change your strategy along the way...<br/><br/>",

As it that can do more can do less, the rules can be used for a melting pot of the above or any of them specifically, so the Golgo Island rules can be used for anything from the ever popular zombie games to treasure hunting among many other things.<br/><br/>Golgo Island offers fast and intuitive play, alternate unit activation,<br/>game balance guided by a point system, and completely adaptable scenarios and game conditions that require neither an umpire, a game master, or even charts to look up all you need is a copy of these rules, a handful of miniatures, some six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), a tape measure and a roughly 3&rsquo; x 3&rsquo; playing area. Thanks to simple yet dynamic game mechanics, heroes and henchmen face player and non-player opponents as  well as (more or less) random events in non-stop action and pass-me-the-pop-corn atmosphere. The amount of details and non-player intervention can be tailored out depending on your scenario&rsquo;s requirements and the number of players involved, so while the game is best played with up to 4 players you can easily enjoy it with many more of them on board!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     The compiled WarEngine and Golgo Island' rules.<br/>     Background on Golgo Island and its denizens.<br/>     Profiles for over 60 ready-to-play characters and henchmen.<br/>     A profile builder section, complete with special powers, traits, and a point value system, to help you create your own balanced yet characterful profiles.<br/>     7 scenarios, and scenario special rules and guidelines to help you adapt them to your needs and imagination.<br/>     and more!<br/><br/><br/>",

It's a tough life, and to survive, to have to know how to deal with ruffians, swindlers and thieves.<br/><br/>For excitement, and to pay the rent, you make your living as a bounty-hunter.  The risks are great but the payoff can be tremendous.<br/><br/>Your quarry this time is a dangerous pirate, armed and ruthless.  Initially, his ventures were an irritation to the locals.  But as his greed and daring grew, he garnered the watchful eye of the meagerly-equipped local authorities.<br/><br/>Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to capture &quot;The Duke&quot; and bring him to justice.  But you must hurry.  The provisional government is weak, and with each of &quot;The Duke&quot;'s raids, society falls further into chaos.<br/><br/>You must find &quot;The Duke&quot; and neutralize him before it is too late.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This easy-to-play adventure is designed for solitaire or group play, and is suitable for one to four players, ages 12 and up. This complete game includes the adventure booklet, rules, pieces and game board.<br/><br/>The player creates one or more characters from the rules, equips them with items they purchase and sends them adventuring by using a paragraph reference system, much like the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; type of game. The player resolves encounters with die rolls and updates his character's status to reflect damage, victories, records key words, and attempts to complete the mission.<br/><br/>Counters and a map provided with the module, aid in visualizing the relation between character(s) and encounters with animals, bandits, stray robots, drunken gods and what have you.<br/><br/>This series is strongly inspired by Metagaming's Microquest series: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24145\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24145</a><br/><br/>",

The goal is to climb your way back out, but you will never make it without a long streak of lucky rolls. Anywhere you step, there is some kind of hazard that takes a health point away, or kills you instantly. It might be flying arrows, falling rocks, spikes, or a slide that sends you to a volcanic fire. You start with three health points but you can raise it if you find it too difficult. It doesn't matter anyways because so many spaces are instant death. It's not a linear game, you can't just go straight to the exit. First you have to get a talisman but before you get the talisman you need to get a key.<br/><br/>{Source: Deadly Danger Dungeon Video Review by James Rofle/Board James}<br/><br/>",

Many cards of the game show that change, from traditional to modern astrology. One of the main reasons, was the discovery of new planets. Until recently, Astrologists weren&rsquo;t aware of the existence of the planets in the far reaches of our solar system. Due to the discovery of Neptune, Uranus,  Pluto and the consolidation of the Sun centered planetary system, astrology had to change. New ruling planets were established for the Zodiac Signs, Houses were shifted and the characteristics of each sign changed in order to be aligned with the new form of our solar system.<br/><br/>Most of the cards of Astrologica feature these changes, as each player makes the changes available through modern and traditional sign characteristics.<br/><br/>In few words...<br/><br/>Cards help you gain extra points, while creating row of cards <br/>with the Proper Signs and Elements might grant you victory at the endgame.<br/><br/>As for the players, well, they try to put the Zodiacs in order along with the Elements.<br/><br/>The stars were always there. Our way of observing them through astrology changed, as we discover more and more of the  universe we live in. An easy, competitive game destined for 2-5 players. Enjoy Astrologica by playing and learning of, the universe&rsquo;s beauty combined with our imagination.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Taikyoku Shōgi (大局将棋) is a large board variant of Shogi (Japanese chess). The game was created around the mid 16th century (presumably by priests) and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the rediscovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant (if not board game) ever. It has not been shown that Taikyoku Shogi was ever widely played. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves.&quot; - Wikipedia<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, play on a board ruled into a grid of 36 ranks (rows) by 36 files (columns) with a total of 1,296 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 402 wedge-shaped pieces of 209 different types. All pieces are the same color. The orientation of the piece tells which side it is on. The pieces are wedge-shaped with the name of the piece written in kanji on it's face in black. If the piece can promote, then the name of the piece's promoted form is written on the back face, usually in red. Pieces are turned over when promoted.<br/><br/>An opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Unlike standard Shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.<br/><br/>Like other large board Shogi variants, this game uses the promotion-by-capture rule. When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes if it can (this is compulsory, not optional). few important pieces do not promote. Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves.<br/><br/>The players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially displacing (capturing) an opposing piece, promoting that piece if it is able to promote.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s King and Crown Princes, of which players start with one of each. Both pieces must be captured to win. Also present is a piece called the Drunken Elephant, which if promoted becomes another Crown Prince which would also need to be captured to win.<br/><br/>A player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)<br/><br/>",

There goal was to take territory in an effort to put pressure on the British government.<br/><br/>In 1866, a large, well armed and organized Fenians launched an attack on Canada West (Ontario) to put pressure on the British government. In June of that year, 1,000 Fenians, many of them Civil War veterans, marched into Ontario and were confronted by an equal number of Canadian militia. The Battle of Ridgeway ensued, and ended with the Canadians leaving the field to the Fenians. British regulars were on the way, so the Fenians had to make their escape back into New York. Four years later, the Fenians tried again, this time in Quebec, but things had changed. Canada was now and independent country and the militia system had changed as well. The Battle of Eccles Hill showed how militia could stand up to an invader - the Fenians were repulsed. The Last Invasion is a grand tactical game, with each strength point representing 10 men and each hex representing 80 yards at Ridgeway and 30 yards at Eccles Hill.<br/><br/>",

Using cut &quot;stone&quot; blocks in different shapes and sizes, players alternate placing them on the board, with the first to join both sides of the &quot;Quarry&quot; winning the match. Out maneuver and cut-off the path of your opponent by stacking your stones around each other or over each other, cutting off their path. Force your opponent to use up their more valuable stones to counter your moves. Make key strategic defensive moves while staying prepared to switch over to the attack when the time is right. <br/> To win, you must have an unbroken line of &quot;Stones&quot; of your color extend from one Quarry Zone to the other, when viewed from above the game board. The board is 10 spaces wide and 9 spaces across, with a Quarry area of 2 spaces on each end.<br/>Each player has the same number of pieces for play, and they must remain clearly visible at all time to your opponent to assist in calculating the next move or counter-move. Each player has 25 Stones:<br/>3 BLOCKS, 4 BRICKS, 4 BEAMS, 1 SPAN, 3 POSTS, 2 PILLARS, <br/>1 CORNER, 1 STEP, 3 ARCHES, and 3 BRIDGES. <br/>The Steps, Arches and Bridges are multi-directional, as they can be placed face-up or down.<br/>The Stones cannot be stacked higher than 5 Blocks, so during some games there may be areas where no more pieces can be played.<br/>SteinPlatz also has a competition scoring system for tournament matches that count points for unused Stones at end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this tactical spatial two player game, played on a 3 x 3 field, each player has eight playing pieces: 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 2x6 movement points (printed on the top of the pieces). The goal is to be on top of two equally tall stacks of four or five pieces in height. <br/>Players start on their side of the field, bringing in their pieces, which move the number of movement points printed on them. A movement point can be spend horizontally or vertically, as when a piece climbs up on top of another piece (or a stack of them) or down. Only the pieces on top of a stack may move, everything below them is blocked. <br/>The first player to top two stacks of four or two of five pieces in height is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is named after two similar looking mountains in Namibia.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

There are multiple ways to win including holding locations and killing specific targets. The unique aspect to this game is the added element of weather, which can be used to blast players off the game board, thus drastically changing the layout of your opponent's defences in a single turn.<br/><br/><br/>The Game Components and Basic Gameplay<br/><br/>Included: 1 Game Board, 40 Tokens (16 Dark Forest Yetis, 16 Order of the Fire Plains, 4 Spawn Location Markers, 4 Objecive Markers), 1 Weather Table, 2 Dice. Suggested use of your own Chess Board.<br/><br/>Characers show a base strength rating of 1-5, that score is augmented by a single die roll which then determines outcomes when attacking and defending your position. Additionally, you each have a Leader and a Weather Master, both hold key powers towards the outcome of each battle. The Weather Table is placed next to the game board, the results from a die roll determine which row is affected and which direction the characers in that row are pushed by the weather. Choose a side, choose a scenario and be the first to accomplish one of your objectives.<br/><br/>",

Knights and Orcs fight against Dragons and Dwarves to decide the outcome of the 2nd War of the West. Fury takes the bones of Manoeuvre and builds a game that has more of everything you like in the original. More and varied types of movement such as flight and teleportation, more combats in a turn each with their own deadly styles, and devastating spells that can turn the tides of war in your favor. Your ability to control the Fury of the battlefield will determine your fate.<br/><br/>Fury includes armies for each of the nations of the west including; the Elves of the Woodland Realm, The Dwarves of the Kingdom of Zikkim, The Theocracy of Tayanna, The Nik&rsquo;tmarg a loose conglomeration of humanoids and savage men, Badari the desert empire, The Republic of Toren, Medis the feudal lands of the wizards and Tireisis feared by all as the domain of the Necromancer. In addition Fury adds in many small nations and mercenary bands that can swing a battle in your favor.<br/><br/>The map boards now include mountains and desert in addition to the basic land types introduced in Manoeuvre. Other additions are territorial objectives, spells, various methods of Attack and Defense. The game includes more and varied types of Movement, expanded leader capabilities and involvement. The card mix also allows more combat from every unit through the use of generic nationality cards that can be utilized by any unit on your side. Fury turns the orderly Napoleonic battlefield on its head and populates it with Goblins, Zealots and Zombies ready to fight for their cause.<br/><br/>For many more details on each nation as well as the mercenary units, visit Jeff Horger's design blog at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/857/fury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/857/fury</a><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>36 Terrain Tiles<br/>8 Nations consisting of 9 Units and 49 Cards each<br/>23 Mercenary Units with 3 Cards each<br/>2 Sheets of 1&rdquo; Counters<br/>Rules<br/>8 Nation-Specific Player Aids<br/>2 Mercenary/Terrain Player Aids<br/>Dice (4d6, 4d8, 4d10)<br/>Playing Time is 30-60 minutes<br/>Complexity= 3<br/>Solo Rating= 1<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the simple but tricky set-collecting card game 9Tours, players plan a sightseeing trip through Thailand, but the trip conductor imposes certain restrictions on what players can do during the nine-day trip. In game terms, players all have a hand of differently colored cards numbered 1&ndash;4. Taking turns, they form lines of these cards, but they can neither place the same color twice in a row nor have the cards in a row sum to more than nine. Each time a player plays a card, he takes one of the face-up cards as replacement to his hand.<br/><br/>Making a row sum to nine gains you that row, and you skip your turn for the remainder of the round. Play continues until everyone has a row. The game lasts two rounds, then a final, secret round with the cards left in hand, after which players calculate their score; having the most of one color gains you a bonus, and some special cards factor into your score, too.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game of Penultima is a chess variant that can accommodate 3-8 players.  The recommended number of players for ideal play (as specified by the game designers themselves) is 5.<br/><br/>Only 2 of the players are actually referred to as &quot;Players&quot;, with the rest being called &quot;Spectators&quot; - a misleading name considering that the &quot;spectators&quot; control the movement of the pieces as much as do the &quot;players&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is played on the normal 8x8 checkered board with all of the normal piece figurines.  The goal of the game is also the same: to check-mate the opponent's piece normally called the King.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the 6 figure/piece types are allocated by some means between the spectators.  The spectators take physical possession of all pieces of their type or types while they decide what rules shall govern their allowable movements, methods of capture, and any other consequences.  These rules are kept secret from both players as well as all other spectators.  The only constraint on the spectators' rules is that they must attempt to make the game playable.  Once the spectators have made their decisions, they place the pieces on the board in the normal starting configuration (with some variation possible if the rules for a piece are incompatible with its normal starting position).  Spectators then announce new names for their pieces.  Names may be designed to try to help players guess the piece's rules.<br/><br/>In Penultima, black goes first.  On a Player's turn, he or she can pick any of his or her pieces and move it anywhere on the board.  Then the Spectator allocated to that piece will do one of three things: <br/>  1) They will allow the piece to remain where it is, declaring the move to be legal, but without consequence.  <br/>  2) They may allow the piece to remain where it is, declaring the move legal, but will alter the positions of other pieces and/or remove pieces from play (and possibly say &quot;check&quot;) to enact the consequence of the move. (As the game progresses, Players may learn the rules regarding capturing or moving other pieces and may act out these consequences themselves.  If they act out a consequence incorrectly, the Spectator will correct the error.) <br/>  3) They will return the moved piece to its starting position, declaring the move illegal.<br/><br/>",

It's played on the intersections (points) of a square board, which is initially empty. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo like-colored stones are strongly connected if they are orthogonally adjacent to each other, and weakly connected if they are diagonally adjacent to each other without sharing any strongly connected neighbor. Note that two stones of different colors are never considered to be connected.<br/><br/>A chain is a set of connected stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayStarting with Black, the players take turns placing stones of their own color on empty points of the board, one stone per turn.<br/><br/>It's illegal to make a weak connection to a certain stone unless it's impossible to make a placement which is both strongly connected to that stone and not weakly connected to another.<br/><br/>It's also illegal to form a crosscut, i.e. a 2x2 pattern of stones consisting of two diagonally adjacent Black stones and two diagonally adjacent White stones.<br/><br/>If a player can't make a move on his turn, he must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

The final scenario provides for as many as 500 aircraft in a one day maximum effort that occurred on August 1st, 1945 when the Air Transport Command India-China Division made over 1,000 sorties and delivered more than 5,000 tons of cargo to China in a single 24-hour period.  Scenarios provide historical average daily tonnage for comparison of player performance in running airlift operations.<br/><br/>There are four counter sheets on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages with each 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch counter representing a single aircraft with its flight characteristics printed on the counter.  There are eight map pages on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages that can be trimmed to form a map approximately 16 inches by 40 inches with representations of geographic locations, terrain, and altitude bands for flying aircraft counters from India to China and returning for another load.  Various simulation tracks, such as the tonnage delivered, time clock, morale and efficiency, loss rate, and search and rescue level are included on the map sections.  The map also includes loading and turn around boxes at the air fields for tracking aircraft as they land, load or turn around, complete loading or turn-around, are cleared for takeoff, and take off on their next flight.<br/><br/>The simulation is available as a free download and is fully contained in an Adobe Acrobat file that prints out on 58 pages of 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper.  The simulation includes some probability driven aspects of airlift operations, and three or more 10-sided dice can be used for these purposes.  No dice are provided, and players will need to provide dice or other means of generating random numbers.<br/><br/>The simulation is designed for solitaire play.  More than one player can participate by dividing aircraft types among players or dividing operating bases among players.<br/><br/>",

Centered around battles near the town of Grainville-sur-Odon.<br/><br/>This is a remake of Scotland the Brave II. It contains 12 scenarios, and 2 campaign games, mostly the same as in the original, but with additions (most notably scenarios #21 and #22) and some minor alterations. The game features new map and counter art.<br/><br/>This game allows you to recreate firefights between British and German troops in Normandy 1944, on a tactical scale: individual vehicles, artillery pieces, support weapons, squads and leaders. Combining this game with Orders For The Major, you can play on a large area (campaign games), like in the original combination of Scotland the Brave I + II.<br/><br/>The terrain lends itself for a mixture of close quarter battles around villages and bridges, coupled with long range tank duels, due to the relatively flat, open area with little or no hedges (bocage).<br/><br/>Because of the designer's research and availability of detailed sources on the depicted actions, the scenarios have a highly historically informative value, backed by information and pictures of some of the landmarks in the designer's notes booklet.<br/><br/>",

In this game, players portray one of the film&rsquo;s titular detectives and must search futuristic Los Angeles for five genetically-engineered humanoid Replicants, who have illegally escaped to Earth from the off-world colonies and are virtually indistinguishable from the human population. It is the Blade Runner's job to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant. However, it is possible that any one of the Blade Runners may become a fugitive Sympathizer and attempt to escape the city with one or more Replicants.<br/><br/>In the game, players move about the city by rolling a die and moving any amount of spaces up to the number rolled, in any direction. Players investigate locations from the film by drawing cards, and test Suspects using the Voight-Kampff empathy test from the film. If a Suspect is revealed to be a Replicant the Blade Runner must engage it in combat, and later on, the players' characters will likely end up fighting against each other.<br/><br/>There are three ways to win the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Retire more Replicants than any other Blade Runner.<br/>     Escape from the city as a Sympathizer.<br/>     Be the last player whose character is still alive.<br/><br/><br/>The rules, cards, counters, board, and assembly instructions can all be found in the 'Web Links' section, below. Also, there is a VASSAL module now available, for online play!<br/><br/>(Note: this game is completely unlicensed and unauthorized, and is not intended to be bought or sold.

It can be the heavy hitter many crews lack, and even though expensive, you are getting a massive piece for only 9 (or 10) SS.<br/><br/>The Rail Golem works well with models that can put Burning Tokens on it, but it is self sufficient enough to work with any crew.<br/><br/>The Rail Golem has very significant offensive abilities. Its melee weapon has a good reach, is Paired, and causes grievous damage, and it can use Burning Tokens to get positive twists to attack or damage, or an extra melee attack.<br/><br/>The main &quot;trick&quot; with the Rail Golem is to balance out how it accumulates and uses Burning Tokens. Often, you will need to balance between increasing attacks in a short-term way (by increasing attacks and damage flips, or getting an extra attack), healing up (by burning all tokens for 1 Wd of healing each), or saving them up to Reactivate (which costs 5 tokens, but can be very powerful.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game of tactics &amp; luck, you try to outsmart your opponent(s) by conquering their pawns, jumping yourself to your Home Zone and taking the best spots on the board.<br/> In this abstract game, the players try to get their pawns from their starting position in the oppenents Home zone, to their own Home Zone on the other end of the board.<br/>This is done by throwing two dice, which have the primary colours, a black, a white &amp; a joker side on them. By strategically using these colors you can jump forward, take over enemy pawns and get into waiting rooms or your home zone. <br/>The first player to get all their pawns in their Home Zone, wins the game.<br/><br/>Authors note.<br/>Primary moves is actually not as abstract as it first appears once you have played it. The board appearance is random for a reason, that was how I could build player 3 and 4 into the game.<br/><br/>The original games relies a lot on luck and quick decision making due to the fact that the drive mech is dice.<br/>The end of 2015 saw a &quot;couldnt see the wood through the trees&quot; breakthough and allowed a new mech to be added in the form of cards that turn the table on the luck factor, making it a more pleasurable game for the planners and thinkers among us, all be it still very light to play.<br/><br/>what still never ceases to amaze me is how many variations and styles this 1 simple game can have all based on a few super simple rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Toads are the Type * AFV of the UNA in AT-43 and come in four different flavours. Toads are quick with 25 movement, They are deadly, with a wide assortment of weapon loadouts for every situation, and they are cheap. While not having the armour of the Red Blok, Toads are very resilient when in a Mind company. This list gives all AFV&rsquo;s a repair for free so a unit of 3 toads can repair 3 damage a turn. This is before you even start to throw Steel Trooper Engineers into the mix. The toads are fairly quick and are great for flanking the enemy.<br/><br/>Fire Toad<br/>armed with 2 laser guns the Fire Toad is the jack of all trades. It can take out everything from afv&rsquo;s to infantry. This is the most common variant of toad used in many lists because of this fact.<br/><br/>Light Prince<br/>A hybrid between the Iron Rain and the Fire Toad, the light prince packs a MG and a laser gun. It is able to throw 3 mg shots and 1 lasergun shot at its target. It still retains the ability to engage AFVs while being able to put out enough fire to have a hope of killing infantry that are in cover.<br/><br/>Iron Rain<br/>This guy is a battlesuit killing machine. A full unit of Iron Rain&rsquo;s put out 18 MG shots a turn. When shooting at a type *** infantry unit in full cover you&rsquo;re bound to score a few wounds due to the sheer number of dice. The Lancelot is better suited to killing more lightly armoured units and grounding those suits that don&rsquo;t have stability (Red Blok and Therians). if you&rsquo;re taking these guys, its to neutralize your opponents ungroundable battlesuits. Otherwise you&rsquo;re better off with Lancelots.<br/><br/>Lancelot<br/>The Lancelot is an infantry killing monster. with 2 grenade launchers it puts out a lot of indirect fire. Note that the card is a misprint and each grenade launcher only gets 1 shot instead of the printed 3. Even still, a unit of 2 of these guys can get the all important double damage template. This weapon grounds units and ignores cover so it is a better choice if you are facing Red Blok or Therians as their type *** infantry can still be grounded.<br/><br/>Contains: <br/>-1 figurine: Fire Toad Mk IV, 2 light grenade launchers, 2 light laser cannons, 2 light MG<br/>-8 cards - Fire Toad, Fire Toad Sgt., Fire Toad Light Prince, Fire Toad Light Prince Sgt., Fire Toad Iron Rain, Fire Toad Iron Rain Sgt., Fire Toad Lancelot, Fire Toad Lancelot Sgt.<br/><br/>",

It was the location of a fierce struggle during Operation Crusader, a deployment of armor the British hoped would rid them of Rommel's aggression in the Western Desert and end the seige of Tobruk. It would not come to pass, partly due to unanticipated Italian resistance. British historian Richard Humble stated the following about Italy's performance during Operation Crusader, &quot;&hellip;Crusader should be remembered as the battle in which the Italian army can claim to have recovered its self respect&quot;. Bir el Gubi served as an unexpected redemption in North Africa for the maligned Italian Army.<br/><br/>BIR EL GUBI FOR PLATOON LEADER 3.0 includes: North Africa Italian MMC/SMC counters and color overlays.

Use cards to build your stories and triumph in this quickfire game.<br/><br/>Next England Captain is a two to four player card game that faithfully models the career of a modern footballer; a challenge for everyone who's ever failed to earn millions by kicking things really well.<br/><br/>Welcome to a world where your celebrity wife matters more than the club you play for, but only if you have the right promo deals. It's a world where your status in the squad matters - but not very much - and where retirement is just another opportunity. Here, becoming England Captain has less to do with your footballing ability and more to do with whether you&rsquo;re married with kids.<br/><br/>Starting with nothing, you gain points as you move to bigger clubs, increasing your on-field stature, sponsorship, and your off-field respect. Careers may go down as well as up - so you won't have it all your own way - but capping it all off with a wise retirement can make all the difference. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

It is a turn-based action, dexterity and tactical game. It is similar to the game Blood Bowl, but mixes in elements from curling and real soccer. With the special abilities and constantly expanding races, weapons and spells, you can fight over the control of the ball and then actually shoot at a miniature goal to score.<br/><br/>Actually, our greatest unique feature is that we take all of the action to the FLOOR! Rather than small miniatures on a table in a virtual environment, we have huge miniatures you actually kick and slide around in any environment; whether that is your living room, your yard, at the beach, on the street. You can play almost anywhere.<br/><br/>Our game puts you in control, using your own tactics, dexterity, and shooting action, rather than letting the dice decide the outcome. Another great feature of KiCKeT!-ARENA is that you can play with our basic rules for a simpler and faster game, or with our advanced rules that turn the game into a strategic battle.<br/><br/>Build your team with different talents, weapons and magic to play KiCKeT! in your very own arena set up in your living room, garden, backyard or even at the beach!<br/><br/>KiCKeT! Arena mixes up fantasy games and soccer to create a kicking, passing, and fighting action game.<br/><br/>Our curved solid wooden bases make the figures slide over many different surfaces including grass, carpet, and sand. With the addition of a base sock or an asphalt glider, you can even play on tile, laminate, hardwood, stone, or asphalt. Play almost anywhere!<br/><br/>In the future, we plan to offer even more figures, weapons, spells, abilities and obstacles to expand gameplay.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, responsibilities prevent him to pursue his ambitions for military expansion. He therefore summons the richest people in the region (the players) to erect the city as well as produce the greatest possible weapons. As a reward, he promises to offer the keys to the city to the best candidate.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Players will have to send their workers to explore the surrounding regions to discover beds of resources and materials. They will fight for control of these resources, exploit them to construct various buildings, which in turn will enable them to build tools, pistols, rifles and machine guns, aiding them in production or combat. When the General is satisfied with a player, he gives him victory points.<br/><br/>Goal: Earn the most victory points during the game, the points represent that the General is satisfied with a player. Points are given to those who control the resources, that construct buildings, that produce weapons and that use certain special buildings.<br/><br/>",

They allow you to field one platoon per player for some really large games, and as they are so simple we&rsquo;ve given them a simple name: Big Chain of Command. They are a no-frills set notes which, in truth, leave the main game rules are pretty much unchanged. We just have a few tweaks to the Force Morale in order to reflect the various platoons reacting to what is going on with friendly forces on the same table.<br/><br/>For the most part Big Chain of Command is really just notes to be read before the game. They show you how to rate your armoured platoons &ndash; tanks have always been support options in the past, you can now field whole platoons of them &ndash; and how to run through the patrol phase and game set up for the bigger version of the rules. The great news is that as the turn sequence in Chain of Command is not reliant on drawing chits, cards or dice, the system doesn&rsquo;t slow down with multiple players and the core rules remain exactly the same throughout, so no great learning curve to embark on with Big Chain of Command!<br/><br/>To make things easy, we have added a number of pages to show how the various nations organised their armoured platoons so that you can follow historical precedent or just form an ad hoc &ldquo;kampfgruppe&rdquo; from the vehicles in your collection. However you enjoy your games, you&rsquo;ll find that Big Chain of Command allows you to play these great rules in a more sociable big game atmosphere.

Each player receives four markers, which are one color (red, yellow, blue or white) on top. All markers are green on the bottom. Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn. Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack. If a player's marker lands on the white spaces (in the water), that marker is turned into an island (green side up) and is stuck there, able to be used as a stepping stone for other players, for the duration of the game. The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there. Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack. The winner is decided by the player whose marker(s) score the highest total points in the final stack.<br/><br/>NUMERI:<br/>Each player receives six figures of the same color, numbered from 1 to six. The number on the dice signifies the figures to be played. A player must move figures totaling to the amount shown. If he rolls a six he can move as an example pawn number 2 and pawn number 4. They always move to the next free space that is available on the board.<br/>If the player succeeds in making a chain - that means 3 or more pawns in a row he rolls the dice again.<br/>The game is finished when the last three, specially marked squares are occupied. Each player receives the number of points achieved by multiplying the number of the square by the number of the occupying pawn.<br/><br/>",
