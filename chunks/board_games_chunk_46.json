It includes everything required to integrate the new miniatures and terrain with the starter set, including dice, equipment tokens, event cards and a mission booklet.<br/><br/>The new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders attempt to secure one of these gates for themselves before passing through it to reach yet more undiscovered treasures in the more distant asteroid bases. New equipment and mining opportunities await amongst the incredible new terrain pieces included in this set. The gates are housed in enormous caverns large enough for all manner of creatures to come through, and the shifting colours in the energy pylons make for an eye-catching centrepiece to your gaming table. New event cards shuffled into the deck will represent the reality-shifting nature of the nearby gate.<br/><br/>There are three Cerberosa included in the set. These vicious beasts are deadly in close-assault and take advantage of the rules for poisoned attacks, further weakening their wounded victims. Cerberosa do not roll the Knowledge Die when they attack, instead coming with their own bespoke die. Its additional effects include crippling strikes that reduce your Skill pegs, frenzied attacks that target multiple opponents, and pure brute strength, adding further poisoned hits to their attacks.<br/><br/>The Gates of Ry&rsquo;sa includes two Talos. Like the Cerberosa the Talos rolls its own bespoke dice when attacking representing the physical effects of its powerful energy blasts. These include knocking opponents from their feet, instilling panic, and even setting their victims on fire! Talos are also very tough to kill. Getting through their rock-like armour a first time will only make them stumble &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have to hit them again before they recover to permanently power them down.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game Monopoly: Warszawa dwudziestolecie międzywojenne (&quot;Monopoly Warsaw interwar period&quot;) is a fascinating journey to the city, which, carried with enthusiasm after regaining freedom, changed and became beautiful. Outstanding works of Polish architects - modern and functional - as well as the style and color of the then life of the capital contributed to calling pre-war Warsaw &quot;the Paris of the North&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is an attempt to revive the beauty of that Warsaw, a story about a city full of contrasts, with remarkable vitality, using the short time of 20 years between the wars. There are nearly 30 objects on the board representing selected Warsaw office buildings, public buildings, universities and scientific institutions, as well as transport modernized in the 1930s. The center of the board is filled with a map of Warsaw from 1933.<br/><br/>Don't wait, roll the dice, make a move, make transactions and make a fortune in the world's first retro edition of Monopoly!<br/><br/>",

In the spirit of Slither, the designer is proud to present yet another connection game in which movement is utilized to solve a specific design problem while providing unique and puzzling tactics as well. The name Aquifer refers to how each player's initial group is the wellspring from which all their other groups originate. Draws are impossible in Aquifer.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Materials: Any Hex board size 10x10 or larger and an unlimited supply of stones in two colors.<br/><br/>Objective: Connect your two designated sides, Top and Bottom for Black and Left and Right for White with an unbroken chain of pieces.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Starting with Black, on their turn players alternate either placing a stone of their own color that, if possible, must be adjacent to a like-colored stone already on the board. Or alternatively moving one or more of their stones according to the following conventions:<br/><br/>The player selects a group (connected set of like-colored stones) to move stone/s out of. Other friendly stones within the group are sacrificed, by flipping them to the opponent's color, to give the stone/s sliding movement, each sacrifice adds a particular direction of movement to one of the stones being moved. Any number of stones can be sacrificed from the group (which aren't the moving stones of course) except for 1; the group must still exist at the end of the turn. The stones may move in any combination of their purchased directions. At least one of the stones must land adjacent to no other stones. When moving, stones can move over friendly stones but not over enemy stones.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The direction and number of squares <br/>permitted for each move depends on whether the animal starts from a land or a water square. Hit animals are imprisoned and removed from the board.

        "description": "Stigmergy is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>Two stones, or a stone and an empty cell, see each other if they lie on the same straight line of adjacent cells and there are no other stones between them along that line. You control a cell if the number of stones of your color it sees is more than half the number of cells (empty or occupied) adjacent to it. To flip a stone is to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions: a) Pass, provided that there are no empty cells or every empty cell is controlled by some player. b) Place a stone of your color on an empty cell not controlled by your opponent. c) Flip an enemy stone on a cell you control. The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of empty cells you control, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>Komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games. The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. It is only used when komi is an odd number. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button.<br/><br/>Stigmergy is based on Michał Zapała's Tumbleweed.<br/><br/>",

They are barbarians in the classic style of fantasy, but driven by a dark power. Originally, these guys were slated for just one pose, but we were very inspired when we started working on them and decided that we just had to have a second pose for variety and to add some extra detail to the enemy group.  All of the fur detail, armor, and the battered, battle-damaged shields really cement the theme of these ruthless raiders!<br/><br/>Includes 6 Hellborn Marauder Miniatures, Cards and Rules.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Calling all Knights is a 2-5 player trick-taking card game for the whole family.<br/><br/>Players act as potential rulers of the kingdom trying to rid the land of pesky monsters. They do this by hiring Knights to fight on their behalf and claim bounties. There are 54 different unique looking knight characters making up the knight deck. For each monster on the field, players send one of their knights out to battle. The best knight slays the beast and gets points for the player.<br/><br/>Monsters are slain by the knight with the highest number. If the knight matches the color of the monster, they trump the other knights of a different color. Monster point values are based on how impressed the villagers are. For example, dragons are worth the most at 4 points each. However, if you slay the bunny, that's negative 4. They just don't realize that the bunny is the most dangerous of them all.<br/><br/>The game is played in 5 rounds. The game starts with each player having 2 knights per hand, but that amount increases by 2 each round with the final round having 10 cards in each players' hands. Each round players bid on how many monsters they will take. If they guess correctly, they get extra points. Bonus points increase each round as it gets more difficult to predict. At the end of the last round, whoever scored the highest wins.<br/><br/>",

Once part of a galaxy-spanning empire, the Drukhari now indulge in every macabre passion their supreme intelligence can conceive. They consider themselves superior to the galaxy&rsquo;s other races, and suffer a gnawing sickness of the soul which only the suffering of others can fill. The ranks of the Drukhari are filled with fleet and agile warriors, each armed with weaponry designed to inflict maximum pain, and through their innate poise they raise their torturous form of war into a gruesome artform.<br/><br/>Get ready to launch raids with superior anti-grav vehicles, hideous vat-grown cyborgs, and coteries of venom-shooting killers. Whether you prefer the gang-like cartels of Kabalite Warriors, the gladiatorial Wyches from the arenas or the surgical horror of the Haemonculi (or even a mix of all three!) this book is for you. Along with inspirational photographs of stunningly painted models, it features the background and lore of the Drukhari, and the rules that you need to field them in your games of Warhammer 40,000.<br/><br/>Inside this 120-page codex, you will find:<br/><br/>     The history and dark origins of the Drukhari, their hideous obsessions and the competing factions that vie for power<br/>     A showcase of stunningly painted Citadel Miniatures that displays the martial liveries, hedonistic colours and gruesome appearances seen among the varied power blocs of Commorragh<br/>     A vast range of datasheets providing tabletop rules for units from the Drukhari army<br/>     Army-wide rules and an evocative Crusade section that allow you to transform your collection of Drukhari miniatures into a terrifying force, poised to strike at the galaxy's vulnerable underbelly and reap the spoils<br/>     And more!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is written for people with no prior wargame experience, but has enough depth to entertain the experienced wargamers as well. The army structure that is presented, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies. Similarly, the distances are given in inches for use with 28mm scale soldiers. Feel free to adapt to centimeters should you do not have the space or use a smaller scale of miniatures.<br/><br/>In an ideal battlefield situation the enemy was pinned in place by the threat of cavalry or disorganised by the missiles of infantry. Once this was accomplished, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork between units, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim in this game, is not to annihilate the enemy&rsquo;s units to the last man, but to inflict enough damage, indicated by chips, that morale is reduced and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the tabletop. By a clever combination of movement, shooting and dashing cavalry charges, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a group, but also between groups and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>Your role will be that of a commander in an ancient or medieval army. Should more than two players per side be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.<br/>So onwards, to glory!<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/><br/>     making a plan<br/>     roll for initiative<br/>     Command (movement, including initiative moves)<br/>     shooting<br/>     hand-to-hand<br/><br/><br/>An IGo UGo system<br/><br/>Cards or special dice (The dice have 0, 1, 2, 3 and B on them<br/>0-3 dictates how many moves can be made by units in a Command.) are available separately.<br/>Markers and chips can be downloaded in the download section<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ronin Warrior is inspired by the 47 Ronin and Japan's Sengoku period. In this 2-in-1 board game there are two separate modes of play; Ronin Warrior: Vengeance is a solo, cooperative campaign game, while Ronin Warrior: Rising is a strategic wargame that features various buildings and units that players can construct and train across the map. Both modes of play share the same timeline, game pieces, and characters.<br/><br/>Ronin Warrior: Vengeance is where the story begins, when Kirashi, a greedy warlord, is instigated by the sorcerer Majo to harm Lord Asan to usurp the ancient spirit's power. One thing Kirashi didn't expect, after Asan's death, the spirit temple also collapsed and 5 pieces of the spirit disappeared. According to legend, summoning a spirit requires 5 pieces of a spirit and an eight-headed dragon's claw. From here the battle to collect 5 spirit and dragon claws begins. The Samurai under Asan had become Ronin, lost their master, their honor was damaged, the Ronin once again gathered, they were determined to recover 5 pieces of spirit to end the dark age and avenge, get honor back.<br/><br/>In Ronin Warrior: Vengeance each player takes on a different role, such as Ronin, Samurai, Ninja, Darksoul, Sohei, and Ming. You can play solo or you and up to 5 other players will overcome dangerous traps, assassinate enemies, recover ancient spirit, and obtain rare treasures in this co-op campaign. You'll explore an ever-changing world, with endless possibilities in Ronin Warrior: Vengeance.<br/><br/>Ronin Warrior: Rising continues where Vengeance leaves off. When one clan attempts to usurp the power of the spirit, a great clan war erupts across Japan. You will play as daimyo on your journey to build and consolidate power throughout the nation.<br/><br/>You, along with other Samurai, are gathered for a special occasion. The clans decide to work together in search of the ancient spirit to gain their legendary power. However, in this cooperative mode, players will tentatively work together while their secondary objectives will be hidden from each other. With your sword forward and a knife pointing at your back, up to 6 players explore Japan, fight legendary Yokai, and obtain legendary items such as Muramasa, Kusanagi no Tsurugi, Yata no Kagami. As you explore the map, you will come across villages where you can recruit various units and heroes to bolster your forces or destroy them for personal gain. You can also receive blessings at temples from Yamata no Orochi, the Eight-Headed Dragon. Each Samurai has a unique story, a unique goal, and a clan-specific skillset. You'll discover an ever-changing world, with endless possibilities in Ronin Warrior: Vengeance.<br/><br/>In Ronin Warrior: Rising you are a powerful daimyo, whose goal is to unify Japan. Players can accomplish this either by conquering all the other clans, or by summoning the spirit. To conquer the nation, you will use your townspeople to exploit resources and trade with other players to build your empire alongside legendary figures such as the Samurai Shinsuke and Tameto, shaman queen Himiko, and Seimei the Onmyoji. As you expand your territory across the board, you will encounter neutral villages, and temples dedicated to Yamata no Orochi.<br/><br/>To summon the spirit, you will need to defeat Yokai, collect all 5 spirit shards, and possess the dragon claw. The entire history of Japan's Sengoku period will be written by your hands. Conquer them or befriend them. Worship the eight headed dragon or destroy his temples. Recruit soldiers or raze villages. The choice is yours. Do you fight for victory, justice, revenge, or honor?<br/><br/>",

When komi is used, Black wins by making a black group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the star cells on the board minus komi, and White wins by making a white group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the star cells on the board plus komi. Komi works best when the number of star cells is fairly large.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games. When komi and the pie rule are used together, Black on their first turn chooses komi and places a black stone on the board, and then White has the option to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesRaces (but not draws) are possible when the sum of the number of star cells and twice the value of komi is an even number.<br/><br/>Different board shapes and star cell configurations result in different games:<br/><br/><br/>     Sunder: The perimeter of the board is a regular hexagon.

Or destroying all fortifications and soldiers in the opponent's trench.<br/><br/>A Round includes three phases, performed in the following sequence, Initiative, Action, and Reinforce. The initiative phase determines which play goes first during the Action phase.  During the action phase, each player performs 8 steps: deploying weapons, moving soldiers, attacking, building fortifications, and drawing event cards. Once one player completes the action phase, then it is the next player's turn.  The final step is to reinforce for the next round.<br/><br/>The game focuses on getting the right dice roll combination to implement your strategy to achieve victory. However, it won't be easy because your opponent is doing the same and taking steps to counteract your plan.  Do you have the skill and luck to defeat your opponent? Or will they outwit you and claim victory?<br/><br/>",

Intrigue cards are acquired by players during the intrigue phase of the game, with each player gaining at least one card, each turn.<br/><br/>For more details on the original game Swords &amp; Sails, rules, and components, please see the Rules section below.<br/><br/>",

They were little known to anybody when the year began, and their leaders were still under indictment for state treason when they came to power. You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people...' <br/>             Leon Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolutions<br/><br/>The Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is a social-political conflict game for 2 to 5 players. In the game, players take on the role of one of five factions (Monarchists, Octobrists, Cadets (Constitutional Democrats), Left Reformists, or the Revolutionary Left) active in the events of the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Some factions begin the game as Governing factions with state power; others as the opposition. Whatever your factions, you will need to build your political influence, maintain your military power, manage alliances with other factions, and protect Russia from foreign invaders. The winner of the game is the faction that gains state power, and uses that effectively to change Russian society as its ideology dictates.<br/><br/>The game is played on two boards, one depicting the European part of Russia, the other representing St. Petersburg/ Petrograd (Russia's capital city and the 'cradle of the revolution'). Political influence is represented by coloured blocks; a vast range of historical leaders as well as military units (with historical designations) are represented by colourful double-sided chits.<br/><br/>The game uses an innovative system in which player either spend 'action points' to take actions or to buy cards, and thereby gain influence among various significant institutions, organisations, and social groups which can be used in later turns. Historical events are affect play as they are drawn from time-tiered event decks. New cards are added to these decks as certain conditions are met in game play.<br/><br/>Unlike most political games, the Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is  very suitable for solitaire play. There is little hidden information and, while alliances between factions is an important part of play, these alliances are formed and broken automatically as the ideological position of you faction changes through the game. That means there is no need for long breaks in play where players 'negotiate' and scheme - all your scheming will happen on the board.         <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Puppet Masters is a game where players choose from 27 Masters, powerful characters with differing amounts of health or magical prowess, each with special abilities encouraging a certain style of play. Then the players each pick up to two decks from the 18 different factions ranging from undead to angels to steampunk. All chosen decks by all players are shuffled together into a single draw pile, from which the minions, Puppets, are drawn into the arena. These can be bought and used by the players or hunted for money, money which can be spent on spells of destruction or items to buff Puppets. It is a flexible game, addictive, easy to learn but hard to master and fits up to 4 players in free for all or 2v2 formats.<br/><br/>The single draw pile is to guarantee all players have access to all things in the game. If there is something directly counter to your strategy in the game in play, you can either buy it up so your opponent can&rsquo;t use it or destroy it before they get it. Players can attack each other, each other&rsquo;s Puppets, or the Puppets in the arena. The replay value of this game is very high due to the massive amount of combinations in the game of Masters and Puppets, plus the different strategies of gaining many cheap puppets or getting just one or two very strong ones and giving them a lot of items, or anything in between.<br/><br/>There are four phases of each turn, during which Players can perform different actions. In the recovery phase players receive gold and replenish their Puppets' energy, and the maintenance phase they can take turns buying items and spells for the upcoming battle. In the possession phase, players bid on Puppets to control using their Master character's strings (a finite resource moved around throughout the battle to control Puppets), the player with the highest bid on a Puppet gets it as their own. Then, finally, the action phase, where players use spells and Puppets to attack each other. Player turns in each round are infinite as long as you have things to do. This is limited instead by money/strings/Puppet strength to perform actions.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one player/team left in the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the last Player/Team remaining on the field.  If a player is reduced to 0 hit points, they are out of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Recreate the Air War over the European theater of World War II as part of the epic clash between the Allies and Germans in some of the most historic battles of World War II, during the years 1941-1945.<br/> Eagles Over Europe is a historical boardgame where players take the roles of US Army Airforce and the RAF (including the Polish pilots, of course!) to participate in WWII's most famous battles, including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra, and the Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge).  You'll also deal with the bombing campaign, as Mustangs and Thunderbolts try to protect the B-17s from hordes of Luftwaffe fighters. <br/>Eagles Over Europe includes over 15 battle scenarios, all fought out on a huge, 140 cm x 100 cm game board (55&quot; x 39&quot;). Each scenario recreates the historical objectives of the two sides, and includes special events that impacted the battle's outcome.<br/>Eagles Over Europe is designed to be easy-entry, but the game mechanics require strategic card play and finding skillful combinations between the dice, the symbols on the cards, and pilot abilities. In addition to the huge gameboard, Eagles over Europe includes detailed airplane miniatures, beautifully illustrated Combat cards, Scenario, Event and Pilot cards. Special Terrain tiles and Custom dice complete the &quot;wow&quot; people will feel when they open the box. <br/>Those familiar with the &quot;303 Squadron&quot; game will recognize the core game mechanics but enjoy additions like Flak, RADAR, ground attack, and many more. But you don't have to have 303 Squadron to play Eagles Over Europe-- it is a totally free-standing game. <br/>Eagles Over Europe is designed as a co-operative game for 1 - 4 players. The average game length is between 60 and 90 minutes. Each scenario includes innovative and clever mechanics, dynamic gameplay, and startling surprises...all &quot;normal&quot; for Eagles Over Europe!<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of adventurers who&rsquo;ve completed their quest, and now are undergoing the process of divvying up loot scored during their epic undertaking. Characters clash in constant combat for coinage each round. The game is set in the recently rebranded City of Destiny&trade;. A bustling boomtown transformed from the tiny hamlet of Po&rsquo;Dunk. Where there was once a village on the verge of collapse, now stands a thriving metropolis filled to the brim with hustlers and cons. It has become the go-to place for every Hero, Villain, and Mercenary looking to find their place in the world and is in fact the number one tourist trap. The city&rsquo;s ever-changing population leaves only its world-famous hospitality service in its wake. The only permanent fixture of the city being its Inns &amp; Outcasts.<br/><br/>Players start each turn by simultaneously placing a card face down, then counting up initiatives from 1-6. Once a card&rsquo;s initiative is called, all cards of that initiative are revealed. Players make short decisions regarding the specifics of their abilities, then proceed until all cards are shown. When all cards are revealed, special abilities kick in which allows players to add coins to their personal hoard.<br/><br/>Players can make income either through their starting gold (a fixed amount of gold determined by each character card) or through their special abilities. Special abilities can come in the form of reveal effects &ndash; which happen instantly, or through loot abilities which compound at the end of each turn. Loot abilities are high-risk, high reward as they can often be blocked by other cards. Once a card is played, it stays out until 5 turns have gone by, allowing all players to refresh their hands. It&rsquo;s a game about reading your opponents and the situation at hand to make big gains while slowing down your opponents.<br/><br/>The player having the most money at the end of the game being the winner. The game ends once a player crosses a threshold of currency, which is determined by group size &ndash; but just because you&rsquo;re the first over the line doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a win.<br/><br/>",

Now, the various nations on planet Tree have finally come together as the United Forests and have created a planet-wide space program to peacefully explore their solar system. You have been selected as Head of the Exploratory Branch of that program! Send probes into the void to reach distant moons and comets. Go where no Squeak has gone before and put two adorable little paws on another planet. Design and construct never-before seen spacecraft, purpose-made for your missions in interplanetary space. Peacefully explore the Squeak's solar system and establish research outposts on its many worlds and moons. Maybe, just maybe, make startling discoveries out on the final frontier and herald a new era for all of Squeakind!<br/><br/>This solo-game is an entirely player-driven experience, there are no turns and there is no opponent or random events. In 'Interplanetary', you are tackling a &quot;campaign deck&quot; that presents you with a semi-random list of goals you need to achieve, called &quot;directives&quot;.<br/> After the initial setup, play consists of you picking an action from a (rather long) list, executing that action and then paying its cost by moving a cube along a numbered track. This cube tracks the available amount of actions to fulfill your current directive.<br/>Each time the cube reaches the end of its track, the campaign deck gets updated and if you take too long, you might have failed your current directive. When the campaign deck runs out, you tally your score and if that score is better than your previous scores, you can rejoice!<br/><br/>In summary, this is a game of heavy action-economy optimization. You are trying to fulfill your goal with the most optimal sequence of actions while trying to improve your overall situation to have a better chance to also tackle the next directive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Trade - Trade one Story card (Hero, Villain, or Location) for another player&rsquo;s Story card.<br/>2. Cleanse - Remove a Corruption card from your hand by discarding it and a matching &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; Hero card.<br/>3. Explore - Tell a solo story exploring a land by combining one of each Story card type (Hero, Villain, and Location).<br/>4. Raid - Instantly join forces with all the other players to tell a combined story standing against a random raid attack by the evil dragon Luxian!<br/><br/>The game ends when every player has told at least one solo story, and all 9 &ldquo;map&rdquo; slots are filled with cards. Explored Locations, failed Raids, and Corruption cards form a 3x3 grid on the table, completing your map. The group scores (1) victory point for each successfully explored Location card. If the majority of the 9 cards are successfully explored Locations, the heroes are victorious! If all 9 are successfully explored Locations, celebrate a perfect victory as top tier &ldquo;CARDtographers&rdquo;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Histories of the Empire, Volume 1: The Stormcloak Rebellion is a narrative driven expansion to The Elder Scroll: Call to Arms. Enabling its players to take part in pivotal events such as the search for the Jagged Crown and the Battle for Whiterun, culminating with the final push on the capitals of Solitude or Windhelm.<br/><br/>It includes a three-part campaign detailing the rise or fall of the Stormcloak Rebellion in their fight against the Imperial Legion. The first act details the skirmishes and rising tensions that lead to the Battle for Whiterun. The second places the player in command of their chosen faction, allowing them to tactically decide which holds to attack and gradually push their front lines toward the enemy&rsquo;s capital. The third and final act entirely focuses on the siege of a faction&rsquo;s capital, moving from the walls into the city itself and culminating in the hero&rsquo;s facing each other for a final confrontation that will decide the fate of Skyrim.<br/><br/>Included within this book are new rules for setting your battles within any of the nine Holds of Skyrim. From Haafingar with its soaring peaks to The Rift and its many beast nests. These new Hold rules allow players to further expand on the environment mechanics presented in the core rules and experience more thematic battlefields.<br/><br/>Building and expanding on the existing rules for Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms, this book offers new and exciting experiences for fighting in Tamriel. Adding extra effects to environments, altering what equipment each faction can take and offering thematic bonuses based on the holds the player controls, these expanded rules add a new depth to the game so the player can truly control how their faction handles the war.<br/><br/>Also included are rules for an entirely new faction - Hold Guards. Included are Heroes, Followers and Adversary cards that can be used as allies or enemies in your struggle for dominance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tributo de Sangre (Tribute of Blood) is an operational game for two players, framed in the colonial conflict that confronted the Spanish Army with the hardened local tribes of the Rif (North of the Moroccan Sultanate) which was administered by Spain as a Protectorate. The game focuses on the peak phase of the conflict, led by the Campaign before and after the so-called &quot;Annual Disaster&quot; (1921), which caused the death in combat of thousands of Spanish soldiers. A tragic episode that would decisively mark the political and military future of Spain during the two incoming decades.<br/><br/>Tribute of Blood is a card driven game, with a map of areas that replicates the domains of the Riffian tribes, and a network of connected spaces that allow a &ldquo;point to point&rdquo; movement through a rugged territory, suitable for ambushes and surprise raids The basic mechanics consist of the use of action points to deploy movement, logistics, offensive and diplomatic operations. The events of the cards will serve as drivers of these actions, while providing the necessary &quot;historical flavor&quot;. During each game turn, players will be able to launch raids, incursions, charges, sieges, assaults..., as well as pressure their opponent with various diplomatic actions.<br/><br/>In Tribute of Blood, one player represents the Spanish Army and another the Riffian rebels. The game can be summarized in a pendulum movement, with both sides adopting offensive and defensive postures during different phases of the Campaign: the Rif side enjoys the initiative during the first turns and has the chance to cause a disaster similar to the historical one in Spanish lines. Starting on turns 6 and 7, the Spanish reinforcements will even the scales and provide the opportunity to regain control of the territory and avenge their deaths. The game is asymmetrical in many of its mechanics, beginning with the different positional &quot;habitat&quot; of each of the contenders: the Spanish formations move from point to point, through connection lines, while the Riffian rebels (harcas) unfold and move inside and through the areas (Cabilas). This means that there is not a defined combat front, and the Spanish must launch constant incursions to confront Abd-el Krim's warriors. It is a simulation of an irregular and asymmetric warfare, with interesting innovations on mechanics and interactions.<br/><br/>Tribute of Blood consists of the following scenarios, each with an increasing level of depth and complexity:<br/><br/>- 1. Historical Scenario: &quot;Annual's Disaster&quot; (5 turns)<br/>- 2. Alternative Scenario: &quot;Avoiding Disaster&quot; (5 turns)<br/>- 3. Advanced Scenario: &ldquo;Recapture of the Kert&rdquo; (11 turns)<br/>- 4. Annual Campaign; 1921: (16 turns)<br/><br/>",

They explore how the organism&rsquo;s biology, the environment it was deposited in, the physical and chemical changes during burial and decomposition, as well as discovery biases, can influence whether or not an organism is collected. Players attempt to preserve the best fossil collection by &ldquo;time traveling&rdquo; to the Jurassic; there they protect their specimens from taphonomic factors (either from random environmental events or other players) and learn what processes enhance or diminish preservation. Players then return to the present to recover their specimens and learn that collection issues can also bias sample recovery.<br/><br/>Developed by former Ph.D. student, Anna Weiss, and Dr. Rowan Martindale at The Jackson School of Geosciences at The University of Texas at Austin, play this educational board game at your favorite game night or as an educational tool in your classroom!

Over the course of 12 game rounds (lasting 60-90 minutes), players attempt to gain the most victory points by controlling land, burning Roman infrastructure, and reducing enemy forces.<br/><br/>Rebellion: Britannia is a card-driven wargame. Each player&rsquo;s available actions are largely dictated by the cards they currently have available to them, and, following a simple Sequence of Play, players use these cards to recruit and move pieces on the board, secure control of regions, engage in diplomacy, form alliances, and battle against their rivals.<br/><br/>Rebellion: Britannia is fast to learn&mdash;it&rsquo;s a low complexity asymmetric game with few rules, a simple sequence of play, and a high quotient of strategic choices. The game depicts a dynamic military and political situation in first-century. Britain, distilled into 60-90 minutes of play time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Just your luck, though, that someone else has the exact same idea. Two water parks! What a world. Guess you&rsquo;ll just have to build a bigger and better one. Welcome to Seven Waters!<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Seven Waters is a two-player card-drafting and placement game that can be played with a traditional deck of cards (jokers included). Snag cards from a shared tableau as you attempt to create the most appealing water park, filled with four slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool!<br/><br/>Each turn, you may either (1) draft an available card from a shared pyramid, or (2) play a card from your hand into your water park.  Build water slides by matching the ride value to the rope line value, build a wave pool with matching suits, build a lazy river with straight runs, and theme your park by choosing a bonus value suit.  Best park wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players will use Gardeners to gather resources like water and compost and then will play cards ranging from dill to strawberries to butternut squash. The player who has scored the most points through growing their garden and collecting Harvest cards wins the game. But this is a community garden, so you&rsquo;ll be helping your fellow players acquire the resources they need to make their plots prosper as well.<br/><br/>Community Garden is played over 7 rounds, in which players are aiming to collect resources - water, compost, trowels, and seedlings - in order to play Garden cards, such as oregano, collard greens, and shishito pepper. On their turn, players will place one Gardener on the board to gain resources, gain Garden cards, or to use Tool cards.<br/><br/>Players will also be collecting Green Thumbs, which are then spent in order to join other players in busy garden spaces. Green Thumbs also have another benefit: they often allow you to activate Tool cards. Each Tool card has a unique effect, and when you place a Gardener on a tool, you use the effect listed on the card. This might help you gain a number of resources at once, take an extra turn, or create other combinations of effects.<br/><br/>Players also use their Gardeners to draw cards from the Garden beds, strategically adding new Garden Cards to their hand that will give them points and helpful bonuses.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, after they've placed a gardener, they'll be able to spend resources they've collected to plant (play) Garden cards from their hand. They'll then place the Garden card they've just played in collections in front of them into plots of the same color. And any time a player completes a pair of the same color of Garden cards (such as two brown Garden cards) or a row of all the colors (brown, pink, silver, and red), they will draw bonus Harvest cards. Each Harvest card is randomly worth anywhere from 1 to 3 points.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds, the player who has scored the most points through planting Garden cards and collecting Harvest cards, wins the game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Within Stock Monarchy you will play as the ruler of a small Kingdom listed on the stock market. The competition will be relentless. To win, players must bring their Kingdom to dominate the stock market with a savvy combination of warfare, technology and trade.<br/><br/>THE STOCK STATES<br/>The Stock States are a rich empire with a bizarre form of government: a stock monarchy. The Supreme Sovereign wields absolute power, but his election and term in office are determined by the satisfaction of the stockholders, the true masters of the Land.<br/><br/>CORONATION CHALLENGE<br/>The time has come to nominate a new Supreme Sovereign. As usual, the Coronation Challenge is issued so as to find the most talented contestant amongst the richest Houses of the Realm. The winner of the Challenge will be crowned Ruler of the Stock States.<br/>The Challenge will take place on one of the peripheral and uncivilized islands of the empire. The Island is inhabited by Mattoks, somewhat obtuse and na&iuml;ve creatures with a very basic lifestyle. Mattoks can&rsquo;t quite discern between good and evil and are therefore easy to manipulate or to corrupt. They are not to be entrusted with complex tasks, but they are excellent at following simple instructions and will comply with whatever command in exchange for a few shiny coins.<br/>At the beginning of the Challenge every participant will be assigned a starting region of equal dimension and three months&rsquo; time to showcase their strategic skills and &ndash; most important of all &ndash; to enrich the stockholders.<br/>The management of the Realms on the Island mirrors the stock monarchy of the Stock States: each scion will be free to act as an authentic absolute monarch, but his choices will be evaluated by the stock market. Dominating the market, however, will not be easy: all shareholders ultimately desire to grow richer and see the value of their shares rise, but some of them also have specific preferences on how this should be done. The two most prominent examples are definitely the conqueror and pioneer currents. The conquerors want a Ruler in power who pursues profit through military expansion, while the pioneers prefer one who will enrich them by investing in technological growth. Therefore, whoever wants to sit on the Throne of the Stock States will not only have to effectively administer his own Realm, but will also have to distribute copious dividends and support, at least in part, the interests of conquerors and pioneers.

Each player has a nest or home base, and a number of starting ants. Resources are evenly distributed over the board. There is also 3 decks of colony cards, each consisting of various different types of ants. Lastly there are a set number of larva tokens set on the game board (dependent on the number of players in the game). The goal of the game is to be the first colony in bringing back 4 larva back to the colony and guaranteeing dominance of your colony over all the ants.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turn to take up to 5 resources from the board, these resources can be used to purchase colony cards from on of three decks. These cards represent one of 6 different ant types and is kept in the players hand. Once per round a player may play a card in their hand and place a matching ant type hexagon tile on the board in a continuous path from their nest towards any of the larva tokens. The player who completes a unbroken path towards a larva first, may carry the larva token back to its nest and continue their path towards the next larva. While players with long routes can easily cut off other players from larva and control a large playing area, there are mechanisms that keep all players in the game until close to the end. Players may attack each other with warrior ants and even play a highly valuable flying ant and steal a larva right under the nose of another.<br/><br/>Once a player returns their 4th larva back to the nest, the game ends and the player wins, becoming the queen ant to rule them all!<br/><br/>",

After capturing two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners ever captured by an American army to that time, Grant made a daring advance up the Tennessee River, while supporting armies advanced down the Mississippi and overland through Tennessee. But the Confederate army under A.S. Johnston hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.<br/><br/>GRANT: The Western Campaign of 1862 puts you in charge of the entire Tennessee campaign. As the Union player, you must coordinate three armies, using both naval and land forces to advance along the major rivers, take the important objectives of Nashville and Corinth, and seize the fortress of Island Number Ten to open the Mississippi River. As the Confederate player you are trying to block the Union offensives, choose your moment to counterattack, and if possible, take the war into Kentucky. Movement and combat by river is just as important as land, giving this campaign a unique feel in Civil War history. A chit-based sequence of play makes the game highly variable and models the abilities of Grant and Johnston.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

King Phillip&rsquo;s war in 1675 would be the first time the colonies were ever forced to co-operate against a highly mobile indigenous enemy whos tactics of raid and ambush would typify the type of warfare that would terrorize the Frontier life. King William&rsquo;s war 1689-1697 would be the first in what would become known as the French and Indian wars, and is seen by some as the first truly global war as it was fought between rival European powers from Flanders to the Caribbean and beyond; vicious and combining both western and frontier styles of fighting, King William&rsquo;s war would start a cycle of violence that would continue until the French cession of Canada to the British in 1763.<br/><br/>This expansion will require the No Peace Beyond the Line Expansion Book.<br/><br/>Softcover, 78 pages<br/><br/>",

The entrance to the buried ruins of the ancient city of Lamur have been discovered, and you&rsquo;ve rushed to put together an expedition. After long weeks of travel, you crest a mountain pass at the head of your caravan, and look down on the lost valley. As you near the ruins, other groups approach from other directions, and who should be leading them but your greatest rivals! None of you are the type to share glory, so one of you suggests a wager: whoever manages to leave the city with the greatest collection of discoveries will take everything, including all the fame!<br/><br/>You start the game by placing the entrance tile. Each player chooses a Player Piece and places it on the Entrance. Each player gets 5 Discovery cards to start the game, which represent the equipment &amp; supplies you bring with you into the ruin. On each turn, a player can:<br/>&ndash; Explore by placing a new Tile card next to the Tile they&rsquo;re on. If the Tile is a room with a number, you place that number of Discovery cards face-up on the Tile to represent the things occupying the room.<br/>&ndash; Move by discarding a card from their hand. You can move a number of tiles up to the value of the discarded card. You then draw a card to represent discoveries you made along the way. Every player should always have 5 cards in their hand.<br/>&ndash; Claim the top card from the pile on the Tile they&rsquo;re on (if there are any). In order to do this, you need to discard a card from your hand that is worth the same or more than the card being claimed. Each type of card is worth double against one other type, and half against another.<br/><br/>The objective is to have the highest-scoring hand when the game ends. The basic scoring system, and a few optional variants, are laid-out in the rules included with the game, but house rules are encouraged! The game ends when the last card is drawn from the Discovery card deck. It&rsquo;s also possible for a player to deliberately end the game if no more Tiles can be placed, and they can get to the Entrance tile.<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your ancestors have lived in the forest for generations, surviving by following the Leylines - tangled wisps of magic that weave between the pines and lead to the forest&rsquo;s most coveted bounties. But you can&rsquo;t sustain yourself on only moss and berries for long. Every solstice, the fae-markets roll into the forest with their caravans bursting with food and supplies.  Gather what you can from the woodland floor and seek out the markets before they move on.<br/><br/>Leylines is a re-imagining/update of the classic game Auf Achse by Wolfgang Kramer set in a brand new world with new rules by Daryl Andrews, featuring beautiful acrylic standees and a circular board filled magical leylines and mystical markets!<br/><br/>To win players must collect resources in the forest and bring them back along the leylines to the markets to sell them. Be aware though the magical merchants pay different amounts depending on what they are interested in!<br/><br/>Each round players will take turns waking up and preparing for the day by placing their dice to program their actions and then adventuring through the forest using their placed dice. Along the way picking up resources and delivering them to the markets for either Gold or Magical items to help them in their journey.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Work to fill up the empty star spaces on your constellation cards to earn points and abilities. Spin the Drop Zone Spinner for an added challenge to your grab. Bounce the ball and try to grab the correct number of Jaxx.<br/><br/>Each turn players try to complete their Constellation Cards by collecting and placing the correct colors of Jaxx onto their cards. In order to collect Jaxx players have to bounce the Space Ball and grab Jaxx before the ball hits the table a second time. A player's Star Gear will tell them how many Jaxx they need to collect in a turn. Take too many or too few Jaxx and your turn is unsuccessful; drop all of those Jaxx back into the center. The more a player succeeds the higher their Star Gear Tracker will go, but one wrong move and their Star Gear goes back to the start.<br/><br/>Every successfully grabbed Jaxx a player gets goes onto their Constellation Card. Each constellation card requires a certain number and set of colors to complete. Once all those requirements are met, that player scores their card and gets a new Constellation. The first player to get 15 or more points, WINS!<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this turn-base strategy game, you and up to three Mage companions savvy in an elemental form of magic work together to ascent the Tower of Rogue Mana. Mages will battle devious enemies and tower chaos magic to find treasures and new spells. As a collective, the Mages work to ascend the Tower and receive the highest marks of wizardry!<br/><br/>Rogue Mana is a classic dungeon-crawler, great for newbies and veteran gamers alike. The growth of power format allows Rogue Mana to be played as a campaign over seven sessions. During each session, the Mages enter a new floor of the Tower that they must conquer until they defeat the 7th and final floor to receive their marks. There are 14 levels for variation and deployability.<br/><br/>During each turn, players collect Mana Crystals which are used to cast spells in your hand. These spells may harm an enemy, allow you to assist a fellow player in need, or manipulate the environment around you. As players draw mana or cast spells, a Rogue Event may be triggered by the Tower, which is known for its chaotic tendencies. Fate (i.e., dice) then decides whether a boon is given the mages, spikes fly out of the wall, or a barrel of fish randomly appears (for example). Once the players turn is done, then the enemies have their turn. They target the mages with unending ambition, though they may have weaknesses that the mages can exploit.<br/><br/>In Rogue Mana, each floor has its own unique layout, enemies, and challenges. Beyond just surviving, the mages can try to collect 3 additional accolades (up to 4 total); two by collecting specific treasures, and one for collecting a magical orb. The more accolades collected upon completing the level, the more talented and powerful wizards they will become once they defeat the tower.<br/><br/>The campaign/game ends once the mages defeat the final level in the tower.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will share economic resources, city-building cards, and defeat. However, if they succeed, only the leader of the tribe most represented in the city will be remembered throughout all of time.<br/><br/>The game can be enjoyed solo, or with up to four players, and is played using city-building cards and economic resource tokens. Each player takes the mantle of a Tribal Leader over one of six unique tribes, each with their own focus and deck of city-building cards. As Tribal Leaders, players must negotiate with one another to play cards from their own tribe, to enhance their dominion over the city, while also ensuring the city doesn't fall to chaos or destruction due to their selfishness.<br/><br/>Pulling from a shared deck of compiled city-building cards, players take turns either placing or discarding cards from their hand. When placed, this card will trigger positive (or negative)effects based on the type(s) of cards adjacent in the play area. However, when a card is discarded, it is considered unplayable for the rest of the game and attracts attention from prowling Invaders who wish to do harm to the city. Each action must be carefully balanced to pursue one's own personal interests while maintaining the health of the shared city.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Everything needed to play is included.  There are NO game parts to buy with this set.<br/><br/>As the name implies, this quick play game provides you with a final score for an Pro Football game. Allowing you to rapidly play games and watch standings unfold before your eyes. However, there is more to the game than just generating scores. There is plenty of excitement and drama along the way, keeping the game play exciting and compelling. You will have late in the game touchdowns, field goals and fantastic defensive stands.<br/><br/>The Final Score Football line of games differs from our other quick play line, Ultra Quick, as the games all unfold in a quarter-by-quarter manner.<br/><br/>Each team is rated individually for Offense, Defense, and Home Field Advantage. And while there will surely be some surprises along the way, since this is a game, after all, the accuracy of the game will astound you. We also have a normalization system for every team and league we rate, so you can play across seasons to determine the best team of all-time.<br/><br/>",

However, the new president wanted &ldquo;plausible deniability&rdquo; and the CIA invasion plans were extensively modified, with all of the Cuban exile aircraft relocated to Nicaragua airbases, and removing any direct support by US armed forces. What was left was very weakened, yet still powerful Cuban exile invasion force armed with tanks, heavy weapons and well trained for sustained combat operations. All that remained was for the Cuban people to rally to their support once the invasion commenced. Can you do as well or better than your opponents? Learn and enjoy!<br/><br/>The game also includes variant units for use with possible US intervention, as well as a second full-sized map for the CIA's preferred invasion site at Trinidad.<br/><br/>The game uses a standard deck of playing cards to determine which player can activate units and how many activations can be made.<br/><br/>The game ends when 12 turns have been played.<br/><br/>The player that scores the most victory points by the end of the last turn of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is composed of the following:<br/><br/>Four 11 by 17 inch map sheets<br/><br/>Two full and one partial sheet of 194 (total) un-mounted, double-sided counters<br/><br/>One Terrain Effects Chart<br/><br/>Ten pages of rules and 4 pages of variant rules<br/><br/>Players will also need a six-sided and a ten-sided set of dice, as well as a standard deck of playing cards to play the game.

Programmers have been working on MAI for years to change the landscape of robotics for years to come. There is only one problem. MAI-42 doesn't behave as it should. It seems that some bug or virus is preventing MAI from working properly and resists following simple verbal directions. The show is about to begin, so the programmers will have to manage with simple tasks.<br/><br/>In the game, all players play the role of MAI once and the rest of players play the role of programmers competing to get the highest score by getting MAI to perform the assigned task successfully. Role playing is a very important component of this game, as a robot you can enjoy improvising and applying your ingenuity when executing the instructions. At the same time, as a programmer you should make an effort to try to write specific and detailed instructions to the robot, understanding they can execute them in the most diverse and curious ways.<br/><br/>Each programmer reads aloud their code, line by line, allowing MAI to run the instructions. MAI listens to the instructions and carries them out to the letter as much as possible, while actively looking for ways to &quot;misinterpret&quot; the commands.<br/><br/>The game takes place over as many rounds as players. In each round, a player role plays MAI-42 and the rest of the players are programmers.

        "description": "Brief Border Wars 2 is the second set of four small operational level games on short border conflicts from Compass Games. The game system uses a card-driven system first introduced in Brief Border Wars that models the chaotic, stop-and-start nature of these impromptu wars. Four sets of exclusive rules reflect the peculiar nature of each conflict. Your sense of improvisation will be challenged as you explore four of the more interesting small wars fought in the early 20th century.<br/><br/>The four conflicts include:<br/><br/>1913: Second Balkan War (also known as &ldquo;The Interallied War&rdquo;)<br/>1919: The Seven-Day War (also known as &ldquo;Teschen&rdquo;)<br/>1939: The Nomonhan Incident (also known as &ldquo;The Battle of Khalkin Gol&rdquo;)<br/>1940: The Italo-Greek War (also known as &ldquo;The Balkan Defiance&rdquo;)<br/><br/>Here is more background on each border war portrayed.<br/><br/>1913: Second Balkan War<br/>The division of lands given up by the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First Balkan War was soon the subject of squabbles between the allied nations that had defeated the Empire. Bulgaria decided to grab as much of this territory as it could by a surprise attack on June 30, 1913 against Serbia and Greece. The offensive by their more powerful army soon petered out due to poor logistical depth and bad coordination, then in mid-July Romanian and Ottoman forces crossed Bulgaria&rsquo;s borders. This made Bulgaria sue for peace but if the Bulgarian player has seized enough territory and made significant diplomatic assurances, they will have a better position in the negotiations.<br/><br/>1919: The Seven-Day War<br/>The Duchy of Teschen (Cieszyn in Polish) was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of the war. The two new countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland both laid claim to the territory on historic and ethnic grounds; more urgently, both countries desperately needed the land because of its large coal deposits and valuable mines, as well as the important iron and steel works at Trinec. On January 23, 1919, Czechoslovakia invaded to seize control of as much of the region as they could to stop Poland&rsquo;s efforts to claim sovereignty over it. After seven days of fighting, the Entente nations forced a ceasefire and the two antagonists signed an agreement establishing a border at the Olza River, dividing the city of Cieszyn.<br/><br/>1939: The Nomonhan Incident<br/>Also called the Battle of Khalkin Gol, this border clash between Japanese and Soviet forces in a remote part of the Mongolian grasslands had an impact on the development of the Second World War in the Pacific all out of proportion to the numbers involved. The game covers the early to mid-July 1939 period, the only time frame in which the Japanese Army could have succeeded in overpowering the local Soviet forces and establishing their claim to the zone between the Soviet claimed boundary and the Halha River. The attack provoked extensive reinforcements for the Soviet 57th Corps and their counteroffensive in August under the command of General Georgi Zhukov discouraged the Japanese Empire from contemplating further attacks on Mongolia or the USSR.<br/><br/>1940: The Italo-Greek War<br/>This game covers the first two months of the Italian invasion of Greece in the fall and winter of 1940. Hardly anything went right for the Italians; chaotic logistics and poor communication nullified their great advantage in men and machines and their offensive was halted and then thrown back into Albania by the determined Greek forces. Could you have done better than Mussolini?<br/><br/>These games are ideal short matches to finish off an evening of gaming, or fill a lunch hour. Either way your sense of improvisation will be challenged, and you&rsquo;ll explore four of the interesting yet obscure small wars of the last 50 years.<br/><br/>Product information<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: variable (1 day to 1 week per turn)<br/>Map Scale: variable (area movement)<br/>Unit Scale: variable (paramilitary &ldquo;groups&rdquo; to divisions)<br/>Players: 1-2 (best with 2)<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 hours each<br/>Designer: Brian Train<br/>Components<br/><br/>Four maps at 17&rdquo; by 22&rdquo;<br/>One countersheet of 176 9/16&rdquo; counters<br/>One Player Aid Card<br/>One deck of 54 playing cards<br/>One system rules booklet<br/>Four exclusive rules booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

You can lose badly through much of the game and still emerge the winner at the very end.<br/><br/>The powerful face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are always a menace during play. Aces are so vulnerable that often only the powerful face cards can help them.<br/><br/>A good hand will only win if it is played with care. Take too many tricks, and you lose! This is a card game for the cautious card player, the beginning card player, and the flamboyant old pro! All will enjoy the mayhem; and if the name proves too discreet, you may feel compelled at times to use your own favorite expletive.

You could also call it a tactical level wargame, but without the nasty subject.<br/><br/>In this game two squirrel families try to collect and bury as many nuts as possible, before winter sets in. In the process they have to use the terrain to their advantage, block the opponent from reaching nuts, steal each other's nuts and also throw a nut or two at each other every once in a while. It's mad family-friendly fun, even for the most seasoned Grognard.<br/><br/>Each squirrel has a certain amount of hexes it can move and an amount of nuts it can carry. Then there are special abilities, like burying nuts for points. This way there is no dice rolling apart from figuring out random events and the exact result of throwing nuts at each other (the targeted squirrel might lose the nuts on its hex!).<br/><br/>Squirrel Tactics is available for download on Wargame Vault.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game covers the months from Operation Husky through the initial landings in the southern peninsula up to the Anzio invasion and first battle of Monte Cassino. This was the time when the Allies could have gained a decisive victory but were stopped when German forces under the command of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring fought a series of delaying actions and then held a line south of Rome. The game system portrays operations across the theater within a framework of logistical and command/control restraints, modeled as Action Points. The objective of the Allied player is to seize major objectives in Italy, while the Germans are trying to stop them or, by judicious counterattacks, turn the tide in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Each turn of play represents a month of operations. Ground units represent mostly divisions, independent brigades, and regiments. Air units represent the equivalent of a Luftwaffe Geschwader, USAAF wing or RAF group (9 to 15 squadrons). Naval units represent task forces.<br/><br/>22 x 34-inch game map 176 5/8-inch counters.<br/><br/>World at War #94, December 2023<br/><br/>",

I don&rsquo;t think it ever stopped.<br/><br/>Known to those who live here only as &ldquo;The Dust&rdquo;, this is one of the least hospitable regions of the world. A land of rocky ground and endless desert, saturated with magic. It is also a land rich with history and a sprawling civilization, making the most of a dangerous and precarious situation. The Dust was not always as it is today. Records tell of an ancient land so green it was known as the Emerald Fields before the rise (and fall) of a great evil. Deep in the sands, the minions of the Warlord are stirring again. Dead soldiers rise, and bands of warriors find themselves stolen across time, knowing that the Warlord calls them to service. Even the spirits that embody the desert itself feel restless, mocking mortals that a great time of war will soon be upon them again.<br/><br/>The Ancient Land of Dust is an adventure expansion for the Five Leagues From the Borderlands solo adventure wargame. Use the new rules, tables, and guidance to bring your characters to The Dust, or create new characters from the region. Fight ancient evils, seek fame and riches, or simply try to make your mark. The Ancient Land of Dust is filled with danger and rewards for all!<br/><br/>This 58-page pdf only expansion includes:<br/><br/>New options for character creation.<br/>Environment and region rules for playing in The Dust.<br/>Undertake a quest to learn the Serpentine Arts - a new form of magic with new spells and mechanics.<br/>Details on joining The Desert Scouts who watch for danger in The Dust.<br/>New settlements, events, and modifications to campaign activities.<br/>Desert encounters, Temples of the Old War, deadly new enemies and Aberrations.<br/>Guidance on preparing your tabletop and terrain.

They are opposed by a Player representing the Taliban. (For classroom purposes, Players may also be teams instead of individuals.)<br/><br/>The game is based using modified mechanics of the popular game AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game, by Rex Brynen, notably with an inverse timeline represented in the game turn sequence.<br/><br/>The allies&rsquo; main purpose is to evacuate refugees from Kabul as it falls to the Taliban before the agreed upon withdrawal date of ISAF on 31 August 2021. The Taliban Player&rsquo;s purpose is to inhibit these evacuations.<br/><br/>Refugee Tokens still on the Kabul map at the end of the game are considered failed evacuations.  The game is a win or lose proposition for the allies.  Since there is no game mechanic that shows whether an ally did better than another, it is suggested that all allied Players cooperate to the best of their ability.<br/><br/>Refugee evacuation is regulated by the Perceived Threat Urgency Index (PTUI).  As the PTUI increases, refugee tokens can be evacuated quicker.<br/><br/>In fixed Player order 1) Taliban, 2) Afghan Gov't, 3) NGO, &amp; 4) ISAF; players may draw Coordination cards, then a mandatory Event Card, move their tokens in the TAD phase, perform two actions (e.g. move refugees to airport, eliminate other player tokens, or media outreach, &amp; evacuate refugees from airport), then get or take supplies.  Too many hostile acts may raise the Public Affairs Tracy and the game may be lost early.  There are more actions than can be mentioned here.  8 pages of rules.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese title translates more correctly as 'Let's Go To School!', but the box title is given as above.<br/><br/>In this game, five schoolgirls are late for school. The players must help them get to school on time. The cards are double-side, and the players sit facing each other. A player can see the back-side of the cards in their hand, and the front-side of the other player's cards. Working together, they place the cards into a tableau, to bring the children to school on time.<br/><br/>The side facing away from the player helps them draw more cards to hand, but also makes the children later for school. Players must deduce which cards they are holding, and which to play face-up or face-down.<br/><br/>If they can get the children to school on time, the players win.<br/><br/>The original game is for 2 players, but a later expansion pack allows 3 or 4 players.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Played in turns, each player rolls the dice and moves the squirrel family along the path. We have to make simple calculations to work out the most effective strategy. As usual, the dice indicates the number of squares that we can advance, however, we must be careful. The number on the dice gets deducted by the total number of acrons we are carrying, thus reducing the number of squares that we can advance.<br/>The game ends when all the acorns are gone. Winter has arrived and it's time to count....<br/>It is a game for two to four players. It includes two game boards, which can be substituted depending on the number of players.<br/>In this strategy game, the family of squirrels that manages to bring the most acorns to their burrow will be the winner.

Eliot penned, &quot;April is the cruelest month&quot;, he was talking about seasonal and life stages, not about a dreadful offensive on the Western Front that would be called the &quot;Battle of Arras&quot; but remembered far better for what the Royal Flying Corps called it-- &quot;Bloody April.&quot; Still flying mostly outdated aircraft, General &quot;Boom&quot; Trenchard insisted on constant offensive actions and round-the-clock missions for recon, artillery spotting, mapping, etc. With the most common plane involved in this work being the dreadfully vulnerable Be2C, facing up against the likes of Baron von Richthofen's Jasta 11, the results were woeful losses. To the RFC's credit, they continually fulfilled the missions, despite the losses.<br/><br/>Now, Paul Rohrbaugh's The Cruelest Month looks at this struggle, with the focus primarily on air operations and ground battle abstracted (something like he did in Chennault's First Fight.) As the British player, you will marshal your limited numbers of fighters to help secure the skies for 2-seaters that would be better suited to training planes. As the German player, you will employ your well-armed modern fighters against waves of RFC planes that simply keep coming, regardless of how many you shoot down.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Against the Odds ANNUAL 2020 issue<br/><br/>",

You will have to manage and increase you assets, misguide and disrupt opponents, and most of all protect and collect secret data.<br/><br/>Black Tie is a twist on deck builders where players are competing to gain the most points. Players earn points by procuring cards, called assets, and by stealing data cards from other players.<br/><br/>On their turn players can play cards to perform a variety of actions including building security systems, activating agents, sabotaging other players, and stealing assets.<br/><br/>Black Tie takes hand management to a whole new level with mechanics such as card storage, partial hand retention, and the ability to increase hand size. Careful hand management is more important than ever thanks to Black Tie's unique card stacking mechanism where players may play multiple identical cards as one move in order to pull off more and more powerful actions.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when all of the double agent cards have been purchased and played.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The dark, Gothic windows will be illuminated with countless colors, and the paintings and inscriptions will remind you of extraordinary events from the Bible. Each stained-glass window will tell the story of a different character, and the wonderful work will be crowned with the Latin words GLORIA DEI, because everything is for the Glory of God.<br/>In GLORIA DEI, each player takes on the role of a stained glass maker. He receives his own boards with windows, which during the game he will fill with pictures showing fragments of stained glass.<br/>The winner will be the one who will make thoughtful, logical decisions, who will be lucky and who will show perceptiveness.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Master Edition combines both CC: Europe and CC: Mediterranean into one package and includes the new Minor Nations Battle Pack material as well. This version is how the game was originally conceived and designed.<br/><br/>Combat Commander is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis forces while another player commands the Allied forces. These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.<br/><br/>Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.<br/><br/>A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.<br/><br/>SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.<br/><br/>Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR &mdash; are represented by their own counters.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    6&frac12; countersheets<br/>    One 24-page Rulebook<br/>    One 52-page Playbook<br/>    Eight PAC sheets (6 two-sided nationality cards, one Terrain chart, one misc. play aids chart)<br/>    439 Cards (6 decks of 72 cards each, 1 Fate card, 6 nationality reference cards)<br/>    24 Maps on 12 double-sided 17&quot; x 22&quot; sheets<br/>    One 8&frac12;&quot; x 22&quot; Track Display<br/><br/>",

Suddenly you see one, and put your plane into a dive from out of the sun...<br/><br/>Eagles in the Sky is a 2-player card-based game on plane to plane warfare during the last year and a half of the First World War. Players each command a &quot;flight&quot; of 1 to 6 aircraft during any of several types of missions, including patrols, photo recon and even balloon busting.<br/><br/>The game includes all of the major types of aircraft active on the Western Front in that period, including the Fokker triplane, Sopwith Camel, SPAD XIII and Fokker DVII.<br/><br/>Eagles in the Sky may be played in one of two ways: individual engagements or campaigns, in which the players control &quot;squadrons&quot; and complete 5 days of missions, taking into account losses, pilot fatigue and the requirements of higher headquarters.<br/><br/>Each engagement is 8 turns long, and each turn except for the first begins with a random event. These can add or subtract aircraft from the engagement, cause flak fire or other effects. The players then determine who has the initiative and draw a hand of cards based on the number of scouts (fighters) in their flight and the ratings of the flight leader. They then (beginning with the player with initiative) alternate playing cards to activate their aircraft. Activations can be Targeted against another plane or ground target or Untargeted (things like clearing gun jams). When targeting another aircraft the target can play a card in response. Depending on the planes' ratings and the cards played one aircraft may gain Position over another, which allows it to attack. Attacks are resolved by drawing a card and checking the combat portion of that card to see if the attack succeeds and how much damage it does.<br/><br/>In a campaign each day begins with one player drawing cards to see which particular missions will occur that day. Players then resolve each mission in turn, starting by assigning aircraft and pilots to it. A given pilot can fly as many times per day as the player wishes, but each flight incurs fatigue, which will eventually exhaust that pilot.<br/><br/>Missions are resolved as engagements (using the base rules) or encounters, where each side's aircraft meet a non-player opposing force. At the end of each day, players reduce fatigue of their pilots, repair damaged aircraft and attempt to get replacements for any planes or pilots that have been lost.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly; a one on one dogfight can take as little as 15 minutes, and even a campaign can be completed in a long evening. Components include a play mat, 140 1&quot; square aircraft counters, 176 5/8&rdquo; square markers, 110 cards and numerous play aids and record sheets.<br/><br/><br/>",

(GPT-4) generated game for pen, paper, or printer, 2 dice and 2 players. (tokens were generated by OpenAi GPT-4 as .svg code)<br/><br/>Expanded description of the game Wormhole Bounty Hunters:<br/>Wormhole Bounty Hunters is a thrilling two-player board game that takes place in the far reaches of the galaxy. Your objective as a player is to outsmart and outmaneuver your opponent to be the first to capture three bounties. The bounties represent (for instance) notorious criminals on the run, hiding in the vast expanse of space, waiting to be captured.<br/><br/>The game unfolds on a 6x6 matrix board, representing the galactic expanse with 36 possible locations. These locations can be empty space, have a bounty value from 1 to 6, or contain a wormhole.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns navigating through the galaxy, moving their spaceship from one location to another based on die rolls. The players begin the game at an xy-dice values based location and from there, they explore the galaxy, by rolling with their die and moving horizontally and or vertically, but not diagonally, the corresponding number of steps to a new (or same) location.<br/><br/>Exploring a location reveals what's hidden in that sector of space. If it's a bounty, the player captures it by trying to throw the corresponding die value, add the bounty to their collection and place a space station (offering the possibilities for upgrade and shield tokens).<br/>If it's a wormhole, the player's spaceship is sucked in and spat out at a new xy location on the board, offering an unpredictable twist. <br/>If a bounty hunter arrives on a location where another bounty hunter is located, either by moving there, or via a wormhole, they can try to steal one of the opponents bounties by rolling a 6.<br/><br/>The first player to capture three bounties and return safely to one of its own Space Stations wins the game.<br/><br/>Wormhole Bounty Hunters is a game of strategy, luck, and exploration, filled with anticipation and surprises. Whether you're traversing through open space, capturing bounties, or tumbling through wormholes, every turn brings a new challenge.<br/><br/>Generated by GPT-4, Wormhole Bounty Hunters is more than just a game; it's an adventure waiting to unfold. So gather your dice, draw or print your tokens, and embark on a thrilling hunt across the galaxy!<br/><br/>",

It uses real-life batting and bowling averages to rate players with a match playing out as batting partnerships until ten wickets have been taken, ending the innings. Each team has two innings with the higher aggregate score over both innings winning or, after five-days' worth of play has occurred without a result, the match being declared a draw.<br/><br/>Each batsman rolls the dice once and references a scoring chart to determine how many runs they score, with higher-rated batsmen likely to reach higher run totals. The game also includes ways of incorporating weather and pitch conditions as well as the important aspect of determining how each batsman was out and the bowler/fielder involved in the dismissal.<br/><br/>A full match can be played to completion in 90-120 minutes.<br/><br/>There is also a refinement of the charts to utilise percentage dice (2 x D10) which the designer refers to as &quot;Percentage Cricket.&quot; The gameplay is the same, the charts just give slightly different results.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bohemia, 1420. The King was dead. Less and less able to resist the encroachments of higher nobility and ever more prone to leaving the matters of state in the hands of others, Wenceslas IV of Bohemia had passed away that previous August. Allegedly, a stroke killed him upon hearing the news of the defenestration in Prague of anti-Reformation councillors. Wenceslas&rsquo;s brother Sigmund (or Sigismund) of Luxembourg, King of the Romans, expected to succeed to the Bohemian throne.<br/> Enter the Hussites. By early 1420, the Bohemian adherents of early-Reformation scholar and preacher Jan Hus, who died a martyr&rsquo;s death in 1415, had grown in number and confidence. Radical Hussites even founded communes, awaiting the Second Coming of Christ.<br/> Sigmund, frustrated by his stalled succession and obligated to the Catholic Church, organized a crusade against the Bohemian heretics, supported by his Catholic loyalists. The Hussite factions rallied, fought the crusaders, and in June 1420 soundly defeated them before the gates of Prague. When Sigmund&rsquo;s rivals in the Holy Roman Empire launched a second crusade, the Hussites beat them again in late 1421. In the first two years of the Hussite Wars, the one-eyed haytman Jan Žižka and other Hussite leaders had managed to secure two great strongholds&mdash;Prague and Thabor&mdash;along with most of Bohemia, making the Hussites a power which would soon threaten all of neighboring Europe.<br/> In Žižka, designer Petr Mojž&iacute;&scaron; (The Bell of Treason) brings Volko's Levy &amp; Campaign series to the heart of late Middle-Ages Europe. The iron Lords of the Holy Roman Empire can withstand even crossbow bolts, and gunpowder is in its infancy. A new army emerges to collide with the seemingly invincible knights: peasants with no training but fanatical religious faith and therefore no mercy.<br/>  <br/>The Hussites start with almost no Strongholds, cannot obtain Coin from the populace, and are slowed by the vulnerable flock of women and children accompanying their flailmen. They must build their capabilities step by step and use unorthodox tactics and weapons like war wagons and various firearms. Or perhaps their religious songs can even scare away the crusaders!<br/> The seemingly strong Catholics have challenges too. The number of crusaders joining the cause as well as the timing of the crusade are uncertain and the logistics daunting. Two mighty fortresses and a fortified hill complicate the struggle for control of Praha (Prague).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Colour Crazy will twist your mind, test your reflexes and leave you craving for just one more game.<br/><br/>To begin, set up enough matching piles on the table for the player count and then deal out each player's cards face down. Once the dealer shouts &quot;Start,&quot; each player quickly grabs their top seven cards and must match them with the cards on the table. Matches can be made by pairing the word on one card with the colour of another. Once you place all the cards in your pile you win the round. Everyone else keeps the remaining cards in their hand for the next round. After three rounds whoever gets rid of all their cards is the winner!<br/><br/>In what seems like a simple matching task will split your brain in a mad rush to the finish. Use wild and block cards at opportune times to break up your opponents rhythm or string together a run of matches to grab the victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players can also use special action cards to leap over cards, traverse from one side of the field to the other, or block an opponent's move. The game concludes when only one player remains in the meadow.

        "description": "I&rsquo;m Dreaming of a White Christmas, sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford. &ndash;Song played on Radio Saigon to signal Americans to assemble for an evacuation of South Vietnam.<br/><br/>After President Nixon&rsquo;s sudden resignation in August 1974 the leaders of North Vietnam realized that the timetable and &ldquo;Blooming Lotus&rdquo; plan set for late 1976 or early 1977 for invading South Vietnam to reunite all of Vietnam could be advanced. The invasion began with a series of Communist attacks in the Central Highlands on March 8th, 1975. This led to the capture of several ARVN positions that prompted South Vietnamese President, Nguyen Van Thieu to order an evacuation, which was soon counter-manded and then reordered again. The South Vietnamese command indecision led to confusion and then panic when Communist forces crossed the DMZ (de-militarized zone) that separated North and South Vietnam a week later with a massive conventional invasion bolstered by tanks, artillery and mobile anti-aircraft batteries. The northern-most city in South Vietnam of Quang Tri fell quickly in a night time assault with Communist troops and tanks, with head lights blazing, herded more than attacked their foes into flight and captivity. The Imperial City of Hue was soon cut off from direct communications with Saigon to the south, and this prompted a complete breakdown of ARVN troops in I Corps (northern most command in South Vietnam) with many fleeing to Danang and any other ports or roads south to escape the Communist onslaught.<br/><br/>Viewing their foe&rsquo;s growing collapse, the North Vietnamese High Command issued new orders to capture Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, by the anniversary of Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s birth on May 9th. The final battle of the thirty-year long war was now set. White Christmas is moderate level complexity game on the battle for Saigon in April 1975. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts? Learn and enjoy!<br/><br/>Each copy of White Christmas? is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch maps with game tracks and tables.<br/>&bull;    168 double-sided counters<br/>&bull;    This set of rules<br/><br/>Players will need an opaque container (mug, envelope or anything similar) to play the game.

        "description": "Striking Flint is a co-operative game that recreates the 1937 United Auto Workers (UAW) strike in Flint, Michigan.<br/><br/>John du Bois ... recreates a pivotal episode in American Labor History in Striking Flint. The 1937 sit-down strike in Flint, Michigan forced General Motors to address the abysmal working and living conditions of their employees, and to recognize the newly-formed United Auto Workers union.<br/><br/>In this cooperative game, players control five committees each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and prerogatives. GM has considerable resources at their disposal, including city authorities, deep pockets, hired thugs, and the sympathies of the press. To force them to make concessions, you&rsquo;ll need to work together to weather the forces arrayed against you &ndash; fending off attempts at eviction, the effects of exhaustion, and the presence of strikebreakers &ndash; while occupying factories in the plant complex. Here, the game cleverly subverts the worker placement paradigm: by placing workers, you do not cause actions to take place, but prevent them.<br/><br/>With a deck of events each based on a real headline from contemporary reporting, this game for one to five players is both a compelling co-op gaming experience and a meditation on protest and solidarity &ndash; themes that are more resonant and important today than they were nearly eighty years ago.<br/><br/>&ndash; from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players take turns revealing Terrain cards (from a total of 65), which pit a different set of enemies against the heroes. During their turn, the player controls their heroes, while the monsters are controlled by another player, reducing downtime. In a two-player game, you will never be idle, as you&rsquo;re either playing with your heroes or controlling the monsters against your opponent.<br/><br/>The game features a total of 100 unique monsters to face. During combat, players use their action cards (from a pool of 100), which have stat prerequisites that correlate to the heroes/monster stats: hand management is a key aspect of the game. Dice, in combination with various stats, are used to determine the result of some actions and the winner of successive rounds. Once monsters are defeated, the heroes gain treasure (from a total of 100 unique treasure cards) and experience, becoming stronger and able to use more powerful action cards. The game continues until one player reaches a predefined goal.<br/><br/>There are other gameplay modes, including &ldquo;Arena&rdquo; - a free-for-all single combat between two parties, &ldquo;Bestial Arena&rdquo; - where monsters face off against each other in quick combat, and solo play. The game is highly customizable with many optional rules and is open to house rules as well. One box contains 400 cards, a pair of dice and the rulebook.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Miniatures can be placed inside buildings with detailed floor plans and move up/down levels, even onto the roofs.<br/><br/>From 2-4 players construct outlaw gangs armed with a variety of pistols, shotguns, and rifles, name their characters, and assign random skills. After deploying on the edge of town, each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards that are used to determine turn initiative, outdraw opponents in a gun fight, and engage in brawls. Each player takes up to three actions on their turn moving, aiming, shooting, reloading, recovering, or healing.<br/><br/>Hitting and wounding opponents is determined by dice rolls with customized dice and players keep track of their gang members' wounds and rounds expended on specially designed cards.<br/><br/>Gold coins are awarded for wounding and killing opponents, carrying money bags to the edge of town, or completing objectives.<br/><br/>Each game normally ends with a bloody showdown on main street, with gold awarded to the last man standing. The player that has collected the most gold wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When you place a card in the row with the Jumping Cow, use the card to the left of the Jumping Cow as your reference.<br/><br/>When you place your card in the Jumping Cow&rsquo;s row, it jumps to one of the other three rows &ndash; to the one that has the lowest value as its last (rightmost) card.<br/><br/><br/>The Jumping Cow may not have a value, but it counts towards the row&rsquo;s card limit. A row counts as full if it has four number cards and the Jumping Cow in it.<br/><br/>If you take the row with the Jumping Cow in it, it jumps. First, take the number cards (but not the Cow) as usual, put them in your bull pile, and make the card you played the first card of the row. Then, the Cow jumps to another row as described above.<br/><br/>",

Standup blocks hide coastwatching stations, guerrillas, refugees, and stranded Allied crew. Facedown counters hide the buildup of Japanese forces, which the coastwatchers seek to observe and report to headquarters. Other counters show where Japanese patrols are searching for coastwatchers or go into and get drawn from cups to run Japanese searches and Allied delivery missions.<br/><br/>Each side has Mission cards. Allied Missions assign side tasks to the coastwatchers. Japanese Missions lay out secret military objectives for victory points, including air and sea operations against which the coastwatchers are to warn Allied forces. By hunting coastwatchers while building up military readiness and guiding operations, the Japanese player seeks to slip through the enemy intelligence net. Players also draw Asset cards: special abilities to augment actions and perhaps add victory points.<br/><br/>Coast Watchers offers 15 standalone &ldquo;Situations&rdquo; plus 4 campaigns to tie them together. The Situations span the early-1942 Japanese incursion into the South Pacific to the neutralization of their great base at Rabaul by the end of 1943. Solitaire rules are in development.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Among these cards are also technology cards which, when played, allow new actions to be discovered. Each turn, players also send out their workers to carry out various tasks (e.g. extracting natural resources and energy, building military units, carrying out research, etc.). The main part of the game takes place on a board consisting of 17 rocky worlds in the Solar System, which are controlled by 5 factions, with the players at the helm. The aim of the game is to gain dominance in the Solar System, scoring points by creating new outposts and taking over more areas, building citadels, military units, winning battles with other players, carrying out research, etc. The game ends when players have fulfilled a certain proportion of the requirements on the end-of-game conditions list.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You are now one of the candidates to work on a revolutionary study that, through labyrinth experiments, will teach mice to help people escape from natural disasters. On your first day at the lab, you are introduced to your new little friend, and together, you will discover new possibilities for rat intelligence.<br/><br/>In Mouse Maze, players represent young scientists working on various experiments, building the best mouse maze to maximize the mouse's path, trying to get through the most cheese and candy (positive points) while avoiding or closing the mousetraps (negative points).<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a flip and write game in which the players draw the walls of the maze, but it's the opponent who will trace the path (and of course, he&rsquo;ll make the worst route possible). In each turn, one card is flipped to determine which kind of walls the players can draw, some of them including more cheese, candies, or new mousetraps.<br/><br/>The game has a campaign with 30 exciting episodes (split into 10 chapters) that can be played by 1 to 4 players. New rules, objectives and game elements are introduced with each episode, giving players new choices and strategies (without destroying any components). For players who do not want to experience the campaign, each episode can also be played independently of the campaign and out of order, as well as increasing the number of possible players.<br/><br/>That's 30 games in one, and you can choose the best one for you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles of Napoleon is an epic game series that simulates the most famous battles of Napoleon on a tactical scale sharing the same basic rules.<br/><br/>The series portrays the most important aspects of battles of the Napoleonic era with easy to learn and remember rules, intuitive mechanics and procedures. Players may focus on taking decisions and playing rather than consulting rules.<br/><br/>The system focusses on the &ldquo;cat-and-mouse game&rdquo; of coordination and timing of the various formations of the different arms without too much crunchy chrome.<br/><br/>Infantry was the predominant and most important element in every European army of the period. It usually formed between 60 and 90 per cent of an army in battle, and was both the cheapest and the most versatile type of troops. The foot soldiers had to endure most of the fighting and casualties. Depending on their task, they were either deployed in line (fire power), column (maneuver and assault) or square formation (protection against enemy cavalry).<br/><br/>Cavalry were screening the own army and provided the shock element on a Napoleonic battlefield. Due to their shock power they fixed enemy infantry and forced them to take shelter in square formation. If infantry failed to form square they were overrun. If infantry was fixed in semi-static squares they were very vulnerable to artillery fire.<br/> Artillery, the queen of the battlefield, was on the one hand having devastating effects on square and closely packed formations, on the other hand artillery alone was extremely vulnerable when getting charged by enemy units.<br/><br/>Generals are tasked with taking advantage of favorable terrain like the famous Duke of Wellington who mastered the reverse slope tactic.<br/><br/>By a simple game mechanic, players will never know the exact strength and power of an enemy unit. Units have a number of strength points that will gradually decrease while engaged with enemy units.<br/><br/>An innovative chit-based Command system, where players randomly draw activation chits determines which army may activate a formation, leads to highly interactive game play. Reaction follows action. We bring the chit-based Command system to a new level: In this games series, players decide which formation is activated when a chit is drawn. A formation may be activated several times per turn. But by each new activation it performs less effective.<br/><br/>During a game turn the players are under constant pressure to decide which formation to activate. By efficient timing of activation players are in the &ldquo;driver&rsquo;s seat&rdquo; to dictate the pace of a battle.<br/><br/>Formations are given orders at the beginning of a game turn and are therefore limited by the actions they can perform on the battlefield. The more &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders formations will receive, the more likely is the army will collapse due to fatigue. On the other hand, an army is more likely to gain the initiative on the battlefield by &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders.<br/><br/>The scale of the series is appr. 150 meters per hex, infantry units are battalions, artillery is batteries and cavalry is represented as regiments. A game turn represents 60 minutes. Within a game turn a formation may be activated up to three times (with lower performance on each activation).<br/><br/>The bloody winter battle of EYLAU 1807 will be the first volume in this series. Special rules like the possibility to launch a massive cavalry charge and features like snow storms, Russian Cossacks and the French Guard add distinctive flavor of the battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players use a simple online interface to view each gift and then to input their answer. A correct answer will take the players to another floor, while an incorrect answer won't budge the elevator.<br/><br/>Mr. Hincks is waiting on the top floor, ready to inscribe your name on his leaderboard.

We&rsquo;ve added deserts, and jungles, channel ports, and more!<br/><br/>We have also updated significantly the rules for convoy raiding and escorts and added many new rules, new technologies, and revised all the play aids and National Reference sheets for greater clarify and playability.   We have fixed some loop holes and added clarity and examples everywhere we could.  In short, this has been a community effort with people from many countries contributing their knowledge, time and experise for the love of the game.<br/><br/>Global War is, and will continue to be the most expanded game of its time with some 30 expansions and counting already produced we will soon add linking games to 1946 and 1914 with a flurry of expansions for each.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bomb Run is designed to provide the framework of an immersive and sometimes emotional experience that may or may not have a happy ending. No mission will be the same but it is your story and your imagination forms the narrative.<br/><br/>Each game simulates a World War II Bombing mission over Europe in a B17G Flying Fortress. Each mission builds on the last mission with the ultimate objective to get as much of the 10-man crew through the required 25 missions.<br/><br/>Players will physically mark on the crew cards to show their record of downed enemy planes and completed missions. Use a sharpee. The cards are coated with a UV protection which allows you to clean your card off with an alcohol swab to reset it.<br/><br/>Bomb Run is a solitaire, deck-in-hand, card game. That means there is no table-top required and the entire game fits in the player&rsquo;s hand. Each mission takes on average less than 10 minutes but it can easily be put away and picked up later and continued mid-mission.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dominate &amp; Delegate is a 2 layer legacy campaign games and a skirmisher for up to 4 players &amp; inspired by video games like Command &amp; Conquer.<br/><br/>In the legacy campaign, each player choose a side and receive their own information needed for the current mission. Both players have secret which are unknown to the opponent. Thanks to a deep and immersive story, both players advance their teams, fighting battles and try to see the best possible outcome for their faction at the end of the campaign... and there are lots of possible endings available, depending on the decisions of both players.<br/><br/>In the Skirmish Mode, you can play up to 4 players, you can fight All vs All or even Team vs Team. Thanks to different scenarios, you have lots of options for maps, conditions and possible complexity and game length.<br/><br/>The game is heavily based on Strategy, Area Control and keeping secrets hidden.<br/>You are moving your units, building factories and try to conquer the world. Thanks to a secret fog of war, your enemy don't know what you manufacture in the weapon factory, also the amount of  production is a secret until the units are ready.<br/><br/>Dominate &amp; Delegate offers a unique campaign with dramatic twists and plots.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>More Details:<br/><br/>A long 2 Player Campaign-Mode:<br/>Strategic Wargame-Missions with Ground/Air-Units, Infantry, Transport-Units, Building-Capturing, Special-Forces, Orbital-Strike, Unit-Production-Systems, Base-Building, Resources-Gathering, Energy-/Financial-Management, Shadow-of-War-System, Stealth-Units and Modular Ground-Tiles.<br/>Also Dungeoncrawler-Missions like Exploration-, Escape-, Puzzle-, Exit-Games with Shadow-of-War-System, Defensive-System, manipulable Objects and Guardsmen-Scripting.<br/>Players can highly interfere the Campain-Tree and there are lots of Secrets, Rewards and Solutions. Player can either behave brutal or gentle - that will have an effect.<br/>According to the Mission description, the antagonsit player (like the computer in a computergame) deploys the start condition of the mission. both players read their mission-rules, story, primary goals and orders from their generals. The agonist player tries to win the mission and also tries to find secret infos and goodies or alternative solutions. The antagonsit player plays tactically against the agonist player and he has also a conditions/effects-skript that he must manage. If one of the 2 player fulfill his goal, he wins that mission. after each mission these 2 players change role and the other player is the agonist. Dome special and secret indoor-missions can be discovered. These are rather tricky puzzles.<br/><br/>A Skirmish-Mode:<br/>There is a 2 or 4 Player Skirmish included with lots of symmetrical stand alone Missions. Here the 2-4 player start with a mobile construction vehicle and starting funds. They establish a base, gather resources, deploy defences, deploy production buildings, produce units (infantry, tanks, artillery, transports, bomber, fighter, huge tanks, orbital-superweapons,...) These player try to kill the opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

New designer Matsuura Yutaka has created a five-turn OCS mini-game that recreates this period of intense maneuvering. General Wainwright, commander of the North Luzon Force, conducted a brilliant retreat against the advancing Japanese blitzkrieg, and succeeded in getting a large number of troops to Bataan. In Luzon: Race for Bataan, the U.S.-Philippine Army must delay the Japanese advance and gather forces in the Bataan peninsula. As directed by Imperial General Headquarters, the Japanese priority is to capture Manila. However, if the U.S.-Philippine Army can be outmaneuvered, the Japanese could both occupy Manila and deal a devastating blow to the U.S.-Philippine Army. The game pits a small-but-elite Japanese force which must make fast progress against a larger, less-effective opponent.<br/><br/>Luzon: Race for Bataan has a single 22&quot; x 34&quot; map, fewer than 50 combat units, and is played at a scale of 5-miles per hex and 3.5 days per turn.

        "description": "STARLORD was an independently published Science-Fiction Strategic level, Empire-Building board-wargame. The game came in a large manila envelope. It came with 4 large blue-print card stock star maps, a small rule book, and four sets of tables and record sheets in plastic covers to allow writing with grease pencils. Each set had a star system record sheet, a distance chart, a ships log, and a Ship Statistics Table. Players had to provide a die and grease pencils.<br/><br/>The die was only used to determine the number of planets at each star explored. There were no other random elements in the game.<br/><br/>Each turn the players would write movement orders for their ships. Then if players encountered each other at a Star, combat could be resolved. Finally minerals would be collected at each controlled planet and loaded on transports for shipping to industrial planets for construction of ships.<br/>Each player kept all their activities secret on their record sheets, and the dice-less system of resolving combat allowed the players to know how many ships the opponent had in a combat, but not what type.<br/><br/>The game worked best when there was a referee processing the players' input, and thus was very amenable to play by mail. However it could also be played without a referee.<br/>The game also included rules for alternate species that had special abilities and significantly different motivations, represented by different victory conditions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great Lakes area between the United States and Canada was the scene of much fierce fighting during the War of 1812, however subsequent years brought a series of treaties that effectively demilitarized not only the Lakes region but the entire U.S.-Canadian border.  Nevertheless, throughout the 1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s, periodic tensions arose between the two North American neighbors, whether over direct political, territorial or trade concerns or (in most cases) by extension of the rivalry between the United States and the British Empire.  With the right spark, history might once again have found the Great Lakes area becoming a fortified region between the U.S. and the Dominion of Canada, with modern steel warships cruising the interconnected freshwater bodies of Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is a complete boxed game in the Great War at Sea series, that examines this unusual alternate history in which the United States and the Dominion of Canada rearm for conflict on and around the Great Lakes over the period 1900-1922. Taking its name from the 1930 U.S. Army-Navy Joint Board War Plan Red color designation for Canada (&ldquo;Crimson&rdquo;), the game presents hypothetical warships designed for service in the unique environment of the lakes, and characterizes the potential actions for control of the region through 12 battle and 22 operational  scenarios.  All of the pieces necessary to play the game are present: a 24 x 28-inch operational map of the Great Lakes region including lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior, a 24 x 24-inch tactical map, 50 &quot;long&quot; double-sized ship pieces and 180 standard-sized pieces, all of them laser-cut and mounted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A card drafting and programming party game in the vein of old 2D turn-based artillery games!&quot;<br/><br/>Rocket Cats is a light-hearted, accessible, and exciting strategy game (with an easy to learn Party Mode) where teams of cats try to take out their traitorous family member (either Romeow or Julicat). The first team to take all 9 lives of their traitor wins the game!<br/><br/>But these families are bringing in the big guns. We're talking drone strikes, holy hand grenades, rocket launchers, sticky bombs, napalm strikes, explosive arrows, and more!<br/><br/>Each turn, you will draft 5 cards, program them out in front of you (choosing the top or bottom action of each card), then watch the chaos unfold. After each turn, projectiles move (either due to gravity or due to their momentum) and airborne cats fall toward the ground.<br/><br/>Just remember, no plan survives contact with the enemy. Your carefully placed grenade might be run into by your own teammate. Your sprint could be negated as you're pushed off the ceiling fan. Your enemy could slap you so hard you spin around and start attacking your own team!<br/><br/>Rocket Cats was born out of our love for old-school, 2-dimensional, side-scrolling artillery games like Worms Armageddon and Scorched Earth. We wanted to take the fun, chaotic excitement from these games and transform it into a boardgame. A game where you know things probably won&rsquo;t end up exactly as you planned&hellip; which is half the fun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Well all that&rsquo;s about to change, as the &ldquo;Mighty&rdquo; Crud Creek Nosepickers have blasted down the barriers to bravely (or foolishly) pave the way for their diminutive kin. They're ready to flood the gridiron with a squirming, stinking wave of pint-sized players, along with all the zany contraptions and silly tricks they could dream up in their mushroom-addled brains.<br/><br/>While Snotlings may make Halfling teams look downright athletic, and Goblins seem burly in comparison, what these little blighters have in spades is, well, lots more of themselves! They're so small and energetic, the refs can never keep count of how many are on the field at once! Their numerical advantage, combined with a willingness to bend and break the rules, makes them very unpredictable indeed. In short, Snotlings are all about the sort of wild shenanigans that make Blood Bowl an absolute pleasure to play. Not only are they fun, but they have some devious tricks that can actually win a game from time to time, quite literally keeping your opponent on their toes.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you'll need to build the Crud Creek Nosepickers, a Snotling team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 12 Snotlings, 2 Snotling Fungus Flingas, 2 Snotling Fun-Hoppas, 2 Snotling Stilty Runnas, and 2 Snotling Pump Wagons! You'll also find 2 turn counters, 2 coins, 4 Snotling-themed balls, 20x 25mm bases, and 2x 32mm bases with holes.<br/><br/>-Key Features-<br/>Flood the field with scrappy underdogs<br/>Rush the pitch with Pump Wagons!<br/>Cheat to win, and have an absolute blas<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, the more objectives players complete earn them more points which they can use to outfit and re-fit their forces.<br/><br/>You receive from the campaigns a combined 13 scenarios plus an additional 15 stand alone scenarios and another 15 scenarios from our Line of Fire magazine for a total 43 scenarios in total as well as two redesigned maps. NaW Compendium Vol. 1 is the joining of two previous released expansions titled Airborne, Operation Cobra and all the NaW scenarios from Line of Fire magazine.

It includes everything required to integrate the new miniatures and terrain with the starter set, including equipment tokens, event cards and a mission booklet.<br/><br/>The new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders visit the Trading Post hoping for a big score from their recently acquired alien loot. They can peruse the stores, meet with contacts, and even recruit new Traders to their cause. However, the aliens that they so rudely awakened have followed them back&hellip; Can they defend the settlement from its attackers trying to reclaim their asteroid home?<br/><br/>The new terrain in the set forms part of Trading Post 5 and is made up of shops and cargo in pre-fab containers. The expansion is populated by new NPCs, including Civilians, a lone Galactic Corps agent, and the Ganger proprietor of the Trading Post. All of these can be used in the new expansion or combined with their respective NPC types from other expansions.<br/><br/>On top of this there are four new playable Traders. These wandering Traders can be hired by any crew, or combined as a crew in their own right!<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Vimy Ridge, April 9th to April 12th, 1917, was part of the Battle of Arras in north-eastern France and took place during World War One. It was the first time that the four Divisions of the Canadian Corps fought together as one and is arguably Canada&rsquo;s most celebrated military victory. The Ridge itself was a crucial strategic location and previous attempts by the British and French to take it had failed. New tactics for assaulting trenches were employed, where enemy units were pinned and suppressed with machine gun fire and other weapons before infantry ran in with bayonets to finish the job. Soldiers were given more flexibility to make decisions &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; supported by non-commissioned officers as the battle developed or in situations where officers had been lost to enemy fire. In addition, troops were allocated specific roles, for example as specialist grenade throwers. In addition, the Canadian forces were advancing behind a rolling barrage of artillery fire which caused German soldiers to run for cover into underground chambers to avoid annihilation. This helped the Canadians to enter the trenches before the enemy could recover and reinforce. The Ridge was taken, and the battle was over in four days.<br/><br/>In the game, the Player will take control of a Sergeant who finds himself as the highest ranking soldier amongst a selection of various units, representing small groups of remaining men in rifle squads, grenade squads and machine gun teams, seeking to achieve various Objectives. The exploits of each of the four Divisions of the Canadian Corps is represented by three connected mission maps, giving twelve mission maps in total. The game should be played as four distinct campaigns consisting of the three mission maps for each Division.<br/><br/>The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not claim to be entirely realistic, but the game mechanics do represent the historical characteristics of the assault as set out above. Each of the 12 mission maps should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the outcome of the many action points in the game.<br/><br/>This book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will probably need around a dozen or so standard six-sided dice, although this will vary a little depending on what exactly happens in the game, and the number of dice needed can easily be reduced simply by rolling fewer dice several times as required.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

In this title, a gigantic armada of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life. Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat. The game background text describes this as:<br/><br/>The ominous approach of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot;, it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely kept in the dark by their &quot;superiors&quot;, so as not to cause any undue panic. What good was it to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished?<br/><br/>To Professor Lee Dambroke, Dean of the Department of Xenobiology on the university world of Harvard, the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot; was a matter of science and knowledge; the line must be breached and stopped, or the darkness of ignorance and stagnation would fall over the galaxy for all eternity.<br/><br/>To Laran Darkwatch, mystic Disciple of the Final Church of Man, it was a question of faith; faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, faith in the Founders of the Final Church, and faith in their vision of mankind's place in the Cosmos.<br/><br/>To M.J. Turner, the top pilot in the Space Patrol, or the whole galaxy for that matter, it was a question of pride; pride in the abilities of mankind to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of its ultimate destiny ... to rule the stars.<br/><br/>All were impressive goals, solid tenets upon which to build a society and a glittering future. Or were they merely brittle conceits, ready to crumble at the first pressure from the &quot;Clathran Menace&quot;?<br/><br/>Although Star Saga was to be released as a trilogy, Masterplay went out of business before the third game was released, leaving only Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary and Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace.<br/><br/>The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.<br/><br/> Sequel to: <br/><br/><br/>     Star Saga: One – Beyond The Boundary<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kontact Now: Red Eclipse is the first game in a new tactical system.  Kontact Now: Red Eclipse (KNRE) covers the Cold War Gone HOT in West Germany in 1989. KNRE is designed and developed by Steve Overton with Jon Southard, designer of the original Fire Team game consulting and graphic design by Shayne Logan.<br/><br/>KNRE covers the US and Soviet forces fight on geomorphic maps that are represented at 50-meter hexes and 2 - 5-minute turns.<br/><br/>KNRE brings together mechanics to represent the OODA Loop, training and experience of military organizations, Command and Control of tactical combat units, random impulses based on the capabilities of your leaders on the map, intuitive game play based on the units responding to game play as soldiers do in actual situations, and the ability to create random events such as happen in small unit actions.<br/><br/>Couple the OODA Loop with the training and experience of each nations organizations in the series to create a unique blend of Command and Control with organizational traits. Tactical Event Cards add additional options for play, Command Points give you a varying number of orders per impulse - determined by the quality and condition of the leaders you currently have in play on the map. As the overall leader in the game, you can do whatever you want. You just won't be able to do it all at the same time. If one of your Command Point chits is drawn, you will have between 1 and three orders to issue. Those orders range from firing at the enemy to repairing support weapons and everything in between. That's all great but which orders do you give 'RIGHT NOW'? Each of us has a different idea about what's the most important thing to do at any given moment.<br/><br/>Leaders play the pivotal role in the game by creating orders, directing fire, providing a movement bonus, and assisting in rallying of broken/disrupted units. The state of your leaders on the map determines how many orders they can give each impulse during the turn. The organization of the nationality you have determines the number of orders you may get in an impulse. The player who can utilize his leaders to the greatest effect will usually be the winner. Usually, because nothing is ever 100% certain in the KN game series.<br/><br/>Weaponry has not been left out of the game. All weapons of the era are in the game. All weapons systems in the series have been created using the same formulas. This allows each unit - weapons system - to be created with it's own unique values in relation to the other weapons of that same weapons class over the past 70+ years and into the future. Armor penetration values are constant throughout the series as are armor defensive values; for all vehicles and helicopters. Each weapons class has been exhaustively researched to give you the best unit values to work with. You don't have to worry about the weapons and the systems. All you have to worry about is using them in a winning combination.<br/><br/>KNRE will include Off-Map Artillery, night rules, multi-level buildings, rubble, fires, roadblocks, helicopter, Close Air Support (CAS), Antitank Guided Missiles, Surface to Air Missiles, Man Portable Air Defense systems.<br/><br/>KNRE will include both high and low counter density scenarios; with a variety of complexity. From basic infantry only all the way to helicopter supported combined arms battles.<br/><br/>Asymmetrical Victory Conditions combined with the Tactical Event Cards and concealment counters, random CAS attack packages, random size artillery missions, and Opportunity Fire adds a heavy layer of Fog of War to the system.<br/><br/>Because of the random chit draw for each impulse during a turn, the series is extremely solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>KN very much adheres to the chaos gaming method. This is not an &quot;I take a turn/ You take a turn&quot; game. This is random events, varying length impulses per turn, surprises at every moment kind of a game with an intuitive set of rules. It is not so random that you have nothing to do but sit back and let the game play itself. The choices are there every impulse for the gamer to impact game play. Tactical Event Cards can be played at any time, no matter whose impulse it is. Game play gets so intense that the gaming table may crack!!<br/><br/>Good Hunting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Book of the Dead is a fast-paced co-operative card game for 2-6 players that takes 9 minutes (or less) to play. Players must work together to collect the scattered pages, place them back into the book by matching arcane symbols and close the covers in time to prevent the return of Great Cthulhu.<br/><br/>At the start of each player's turn, they must roll the die of the dead, and then follow the instructions of the icon rolled before they take their action.  The Skull may force players to discard cards from their hand, and the Book may eject pages from the book, back to the vortex.   In the basic game, the Vortex icon is not used, and represents a brief respite for the players.<br/><br/>Each page of the book of the dead is represented by a double sided poker-sized card (with rounded corners) that feature 1-6 arcane icons.  To bring two pages together, the icons must match.  On your turn, after you have rolled the dice, you have one action, such as taking a card from the Vortex (the central pool of cards in the table), adding your 'stack' of cards to the book and finally, if able, to close the book and win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

However, over the last age the Four Towers were mysteriously abandoned and Fognik left in disarray.<br/><br/>You and a small group of other demigods have come to rule Fognik and restore the Four Towers to its rightful place as a center of power.  There can be only one ultimate ruler of this magical land.<br/><br/>Four clans of humans and a myriad of mysterious creatures inhabit Fognik.<br/>You can claim your power by having followers and using your influence to enlighten worthy peasants.<br/><br/>Those that climb beyond the blue mountains shall be enlightened and will reside in one of the four towers.<br/><br/>Those that claim the fiery depths of the red gorge shall find themselves cast as demons in the underworld.  The power of the underworld is strong and every new demon that turns to the depths of darkness also dims the light and casts a lord from the four towers into the depths.<br/><br/>Train some of the humans as mercenaries, merchants and mountaineers to help your cause.  Sacrifice your followers in the champion&rsquo;s temple to gain the will of powerful creatures that inhabit this strange and varied land.<br/><br/>If you can use all of the tools at your disposal you could rule this mystical place and control the Four Towers!<br/><br/>Four Towers is played on a concentric grid laid out on a map of the four clans domain.  Each turn a player places one peasant from any of the four clans on the grid and places two other peasants as followers or as one of the three occupations; mercenaries, merchants or minstrels.  The grid represents the power struggle for control.  Peasants that make it to the outer circle of the grid become lords while those that gravitate towards the center go to the underworld and become demons.<br/><br/>Players collect followers as a means of supporting and predicting which clan will have the most lords.  Mercenaries, merchants and minstrels each score influence points at the end of the game while also presenting additional capabilities.<br/><br/>Sixteen unique champion cards each with their own special skill and/or bonus point structure helps to make every game completely unique and presents an enormous number of paths to success.<br/><br/>Points are calculated by multiplying each clans followers by the number of lords, calculating the bonuses from the champion cards and collecting influence points from the different occupations.  The player with the most points is victorious.<br/><br/>",

To navigate through the Death Path, Subjects will reveal cards at the same time. Much of the Death Path are clear paths but occasionally you will run into a choice with multiple options. This will cause your deck to split in hopes of finding a quicker path to the end. You may also encounter Pathfinders, crude government-control cyber-dudes trying to slow your progress. There are weapons.... and you'll need them!<br/><br/>Each time you reveal a 'Stash' card from your Maze Deck, you will draw and Item Card and have the option to equip it.<br/><br/>Each weapon you find will have a custom die associated with it. D8's for one-handed weapons and D12's for two-handed weapons. They are custom and not numbered traditionally. The number on each side indicates the damage inflicted if you hit. Some weapons, like the volatile Fusion Staff, have low and high damage results representing more risk/reward while others like the trusty Power Nux are more consistent with the damage they inflict.<br/><br/>The first Subject to finish revealing all the cards in their Maze Deck is the winner. If any Subject loses all their Health tokens, they are dead and out of the game. In a two player game, this means their opponent wins. In multi-player, the others keep navigating through the Death Path until there is a winner!<br/><br/>A 2 player game takes approximately 20min to play, while adding additional players can increase that to 30-40min.<br/><br/>",

No more cheesy, premade answers like in other games - you must think up your own answer and try to obtain the letters needed to spell it. But it's not that easy... As other players may be vying for the same letters as you. So be witty, think quickly, and just spell it out!<br/><br/>Gameplay (Multiple Variations) - Players will be competing to collect letters and spell their answers as quickly as possible. In order to do so, players will be discarding letters they don't need, stealing and collecting ones they do, all while running into a bit of confused chaos along the way. The players to finish their answer each round will receive points on the board for how many letters they have used. The first player to 30 points wins!<br/><br/>",

Build the best path, but beware of your opponents' tricks.<br/><br/>During the game, each player will build their own path (while sabotaging others) to escape the volcano's wrath. Your have two goals, to get as far away as possible from the volcano in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and not to get caught by the lava.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player must choose between one of two possible actions - Play a tile adjacent to one of his tiles, building his own path or play a tile adjacent to one of his opponents tiles (meddling with the opponent's path) and moving two spaces on his path.<br/><br/>Whenever a tile featuring an Eruption Icon is played, an Eruption token is placed on the volcano. If one of those tiles is played and there are no more Eruption tokens available, an eruption happens, spreading lava throughout the player's paths.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as the tiles run out and the player who is the farthest from the volcano (in one of the directions) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Powerful by themselves, only by socketing them with magical gems will you acquire mighty abilities that allow you to prevail in a duel with another Gemwielder.<br/><br/>Gemwielders is designed around interaction from the ground up. The innovative combat system allows the attack and defense cards to clash each turn and interact meaningfully. You need to consider your attack patterns and draft decisions carefully, taking the strategy and defense setup of your opponent into account.<br/><br/>Each game you adapt to the cards that appear and craft a new deck with a unique color combination. You form a plan on the fly, discover synergies that match your play style and go well with the abilities of your favorite Gembearer. If you keep an open mind and seize the presented opportunities, you will be rewarded.<br/><br/>All you need to play a game of Gemwielders are two Gembearers and five Gems, as included in the Core Set. While new Gems and Gembearers are introduced, the number of Gems used in a single game remain the same. Through random combination of the available pieces, never seen situations emerge each game.<br/><br/>All cards are illustrated traditionally in pencil, ink and watercolor, giving the game a unique and mature feel. Combined with the haptic and visual satisfacition of gems being placed on Gembearers, this makes for a truly exceptional playing experience.<br/><br/>",

This new command pack expansion features exciting new Mercenary allies with amazing never before seen abilities that will challenge the mightiest Jotune warriors and lethal Synthien drones alike.<br/><br/>Introducing 3 NEW keywords! &ndash; BOUNTY, QUICK, and BERSERKER. In addition to these powerful keywords, we have also added our first characteristic, known as Warrior, which is bestowed upon only the most tenacious of the Jotune fighting class.<br/><br/>BOUNTY: X &ndash; This keyword allows a combatant to directly attack another combatant! Mechanically speaking, it enables a combatant to activate and deal damage equal to its BOUNTY value [X] to target combatant controlled by opponent, that combatant deals damage equal to its attack value back to the combatant with BOUNTY. Since this is an activated ability, it can happen at any time a combatant with BOUNTY could take an action! Keep one eye open with a bounty hunter around!<br/><br/>QUICK &ndash; This keyword is very straight forward and simply enables a combatant to be deployed reset. And as a reminder, if a combatant is reset, they may be able to attack, defend, or use abilities as normal. It's not always the size of your gun, but how quick you draw it that will determine if you live or die.<br/><br/>BERSERKER &ndash; This keyword is all about playing with aggressive combatants! Each time a combatant with BERSERKER declares an attack, their attack and defense values go up +1/+1! These combatants can definitely get out of hand if left unchecked.<br/><br/>Warrior &ndash; These are not just mere combatants, they are warriors! Characteristics by themselves do not bestow any additional benefit to the combatant. However, there are cards in the game that affect combatants with specific characteristics, which typically results in sudden losses by the opponent.<br/><br/>",

The game is organized through a series of Game Rounds, and in each Round, each player has their own Active Turn. During their Active Turn, each player assigns<br/><br/>Orders to the Troopers to activate and play with them, moving them about the table, attacking enemy Troopers, and accomplishing the scenario objectives. At the same time, the opponent is also playing, by reacting to the actions made by the player who has the Active Turn, thanks to Automatic Reaction Orders (ARO).<br/><br/>During the game, the Rounds continue until the End-Game conditions are met, which ends the game. Once the game has finished, the players check their Objective Points and their Victory Points to determine who the winner is.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fans of the classic naval wargames War at Sea and Victory in The Pacific have for many years combined the two into an ad hoc simulation of the global naval struggle that was World War II. There were issues, however: a wide variety of house rules, battle resolution that drastically changed depending on the sea area in which it took place, to say nothing of numerous historical &quot;anomalies&quot;. Now these two games have been reimagined, re-researched, and recombined into a single seamless contest for either two or four players. This ain't your Daddy's War At Sea.<br/><br/>Can the Royal Navy protect the shipping lanes of Britain's far-flung empire long enough to turn the tide against the U-boats? Or will the Kreigsmarine and Supermarina cut England's merchant marine lifeline? Will the French remain loyal to the Allies, or will they bring to life Churchill's greatest nightmare and fight alongside the Germans? Can the Americans withstand the Japanese onslaught long enough to bring their mushrooming strength to bear? Or will Japan complete its conquests in the Pacific and force the Allies to negotiate for peace?<br/><br/>Among the new features<br/><br/><br/>     A movement &amp; combat system consistent over both the Atlantic and Pacific<br/>     All ships evaluated uniformly<br/>     Redesigned counters<br/>     Added sea areas including a completely new Atlantic map<br/>     More emphasis on U-Boats<br/>     Designed from the start as a single game<br/><br/><br/>New Rules Require New Tactics:<br/>Players employing &quot;classic&quot; strategies may quickly find themselves in trouble. Atlantic Jutland-esque battles are replaced with a tense balancing act: Only patrolling ships can combat U-Boats, but raiding ships are needed to prevent German surface raiders. An IJN pressing the early edge too hard may be met with Atlantic Fleet reinforcements, making a Hawaiian invasion more realistically difficult.<br/><br/>",

Each one of the species in the game, represented by Biodiversity Cards, will play a role in the ecosystem, forming trophic hierarchies (food chains).<br/>The players will get to experience different ecosystems in a fun way while never fully controlling nature itself, given that each organism acts in unexpected and surprising ways.<br/><br/>&ndash; Description provided by the publisher.<br/><br/>In Toskasi players are racing to be the first to get to 50 points on the point track. They&rsquo;ll win points by acquiring and combining different cards depicting organisms (Biodiversity Cards), either through building food chains according to their relationships within the different ecosystems or by possessing majorities on the different kinds of cards acquired.<br/><br/>The player board is divided into four quadrants, each one depicting an ecosystem. These quadrants are traversed by tracks with different symbols on them.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player will roll a die and move their Explorer into the track across one of the four ecosystems, advancing as many spaces as indicated by the roll. If later on any other player lands on the same space, they will share it.<br/><br/>Upon landing on a space, the player will immediately take a card depending on the symbol depicted on that space: Biodiversity Cards, depicting an organism and an ability; &lsquo;Unknowns&rsquo; event cards, which might affect other player&rsquo;s cards and are resolved immediately; and &lsquo;Wisdom of Nature&rsquo; special power cards. The event cards will also toggle the Day-Night Cycle, which will affect the abilities on the Biodiversity Cards.<br/><br/>All Biodiversity Cards acquired are laid face up on the table, building rows. As soon as a row has been built up as a complete food chain, it must be scored. All the cards which were used to build it are then discarded into a discard pile.<br/><br/>After all actions for that player have been resolved, gameplay goes around the table in clockwise order and the first player to get to 50 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dugout Steps Baseball is a full simulation of the game of Baseball that features a highly detailed interaction between Pitchers and Batters, giving flavor to the age-old battle between Hurler and Slugger. Dugout Steps Baseball provides for a wide variety in Pitcher Performance which, in turn, makes each game unique and detailed. Once a ball is put into play, the action really heats up in Dugout Steps Baseball. Ballparks and Fielders are easily incorporated into game play and you will certainly know the difference between playing at Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium. Great Fielders who flash the leather really make a difference in Dugout Steps Baseball as they bail out Pitchers with great defensive plays. Big Bat and No Leather players will provide pop at the plate, but fizzle in the field. Drama surrounds Big Flys that can either get out or fall short of the wall. Fielders can pick 'em off the top of the fence and wind can blow a Big Fly foul. When men are on base, Strategy becomes involved and adds fun.<br/><br/>Dugout Steps Baseball features a highly sophisticated system for knowing the location of a batted ball without having to do anything more than simply look at a number. This one number, however, opens up a world of possibility in Fielding and Baserunning. Baserunner Advancement features Collisions and Close Plays where the Baserunner attempts to avoid a tag or the Fielder tries to slap the tag on the Baserunner. Blown Calls add drama and fun and trigger Manager Arguments. Plays involving the Pivot are handled easily, but with great detail, as Middle Infielders try to Turn Two or a Baserunner attempts to break up a Twin Killing.<br/><br/>Dugout Steps Baseball includes the option to be played at a Basic Level and even contains an optional Add-On for determining Pitch Counts easily and seamlessly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Visual creativity game where players interpret inkblots to tell stories.  Has many models of play a few of which we review here.  More on our website.<br/><br/>Story Play: The Simplest RoarStack game, for casual group play or children,  is Story Play wherein you relate your card to the previously played card, possibly within the optional theme of the round.  In Story Play, the added sayings and card value/suits don't matter, just the inkblots and the story. This is a good mode for young children and people more interested in collaboration and storytelling than the competition.<br/><br/>Point Play: If you want to keep score and compete with others, then you can add the dimension of point play where victory points are scored based on phrase+value on the story cards when the conversation of the group matches the phrase. You play your victory cards at any time. Victory points can come from mundane things in the conversation from the weather, to social relations, to pop culture. Your inkblots and storytelling can help lead the conversation, but you don't score victory points from what you do/say, only from what your friends do/say.  This mode encourages talking with and listening to your friends and is great for party play. Even when it is not your turn to play a card, you need to pay attention and engage in dialog, maybe even trying to guide the conversation so you can score points. However, you also have to be active in the round to score so you have to keep that story going when it is your turn.  Victory scoring is generally simple -- you play the victory card in front of you so just count them at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Gestour/Best play: A mode good for larger groups or big/noisy parties is Gestour/Best mode where everyone competes to try to extend the same story. A gestour is a teller of legendary tales. In this mode, the gestour starts a story and everyone picks a card from their had and tries to be the best extension of that story based on the inkblot on their card. After the cards to play are exposed, the gestour defines how they will define &quot;best&quot;. There is an optional 30 second free-for-all period where everyone tries to convince others that theirs is the best extension. The gestour then begins calling on players who have 10 seconds to tell their card's story. The gestour picks the &quot;best&quot; answer and that person becomes the new gestour. Everyone else draws a replacement card. The first person out of cards wins the hand.<br/><br/>Twisted Play: Another mode of play is Twisted play, which is good for people who play traditional card games. In Twisted play, you use just the playing card deck, and play your favorite classic card game, with a twist -- you can use the inkblots to connect cards or as wild cards. For example, in Roaring Rummy you might connect a random card into a part of a straight by telling the inkblots' secret stories and connecting misfit cards to those before and after it in sequence. In Roaring Go Fish, when you pull a card from the pool you can also match it if you can tell the story to connect it to your matching card.  In Solitary Stories you can play any card anywhere, but only if you can tell its story. Here, the role of the stories is to directly help you score points in a classic game. These add RoarStack Story play to existing games, making almost any card wild by using your creativity. It adds a new twist and often a lot more laughter, to well-known games.<br/><br/>Ideation Play: Another mode of play is ideation -- the generation of ideas related to solving a problem.  Here, the player(s) takes a problem to be solved and uses the cards to help explore the problem, the constraints, and potential solutions. RoarStack is not only a fun game; it can also be an innovation tool for improving creativity and problem-solving. Creativity in innovation and problem-solving is often about linking disparate ideas together. Given a topic, people see different things in the cards, and seeing things in the cards makes connections to other ideas. In the words of the very innovative Steve Jobs: &quot;Creativity is just connecting things.&quot;  Dr. Boult, one of the creators, has use it in multiple corporate innovation tranining sessions and in the classroom with significant results.<br/><br/>Kickstarter edition sold out. Second edition printed in 2017 with new custom case and printed instructions.   THe second edition also modified some of the &quot;point&quot; questions based on user feedback from the first edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arcadia Tenebra is a heavily story-driven mystery adventure RPG board game in which you assume the role of the investigator on the quest of stopping a serial killer before The Blood Moon rises.<br/><br/>The story is set in the late 19th century, in a fictional province of Arcadia Tenebra.  A part of The Hungarian-Austrian Empire, Arcadia Tenebra is located somewhere in a south-eastern Europe, today commonly known as Balkan Peninsula. The setting is not exactly historically accurate: it is partially inspired by history and then fictionally upgraded, with a twist of absurd and dark humor on the trail of Monty Python and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That&rsquo;s why players will meet Nikola Tesla or T-1800, half-man half-steam machine (or vice versa?), who roams Arcadian forests in search for some chick named Marah Pommor that no one never heard of.<br/><br/>Become one of six antihero investigators with their respectively unique special abilities and explore Arcadia Tenebra following the Leads and collecting the Clues, as each of those will bring you one step closer to busting the mad killer. As the story unfolds, soon enough you'll find out that in Arcadia Tenebra everybody's hiding something and nobody likes you.

Mars, the barren crimson jewel of our solar system, teems with untapped potential. Earth's global powers and private corporations have launched an ambitious project : to transform Mars into a second home for humanity.<br/><br/>Equipped with advanced technology, in Pioneers on Mars two factions compete to claim and colonize different regions of Mars. Their mission is not only about survival, but about harnessing the planet's unique resources and establishing a self-sustaining settlement.<br/><br/>The duel for Mars begins with the selection of specialized tools, each represented by unique icons: dust devils to simulate the Martian environment, rovers for exploration, solar panels to harvest the sunlight, greenhouses for cultivating food, satellites for communication, settlers as the brave pioneers, and volcanoes as potential energy sources.<br/><br/>The Mars colonization project is an incredible journey, a testament to human tenacity and ingenuity. Each turn, each decision brings them one step closer to creating a new world, a new home, a new beginning. The players are no longer merely participants in a game; they become architects of the future. The survival of humanity is now in their hands. The countdown to colonize Mars starts now.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In this first instalment, the action takes place in the South China Sky, where the Dynastic naval armada is facing off against the combined fleets of the Singasari League to exert supremacy over strategic islands and control rich trade routes plying exotic goods.<br/><br/>Avertigos features modular miniatures and player boards - the modules on the ships can be mixed and matched to create unique load-outs with different strengths and capabilities.<br/><br/>Players navigate the skies via an innovative card-based manoeuvring system, where they lay out their intended course with cards earned, which may also allow them to reap certain bonuses or suffer penalties. This system is singular in that it can work with or without the game&rsquo;s board.<br/><br/>Players will use their formidable flying sail-ships and fearsome meeple armies to capture settlements and earn money to buy more powerful ships that will allow them to defeat their rivals and fully control the trade and resources of the islands. Players will trade bribes and favours to advance the interests of their own merchant clan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game book series distinguishes itself from the other mainstream game books in various ways, adding up to the complexity of the rules and providing a combat system that is very similar to the miniatures combat system as used for instance in &quot;Heroquest&quot;. Whenever there is a fight, a map is provided showing where the players and their foes are located, and players must resolve the fight using counters or miniatures.<br/>The series supports up to four players; a single person may play with a powerful character, or a team of four people may play with a diversified group of less powerful characters (a Warrior, an Enchanter, a Sage and a Trickster). When multiple players participate, a single person is designated as the reader, and he or she must read the book aloud to the group; however, at certain points, different characters have to read sections to themselves privately, giving different knowledge to different people.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme: &quot;In 1808 at Oak City, a mutiny in the prison ends with the escape of all prisoners. The authorities then distribute posters depicting the fugitives, promising appetizing values for each catch. Each player represents a group of armed cowboys who wants to get the opportunity to enrich easily, while working with the sheriff and his co-workers. But the prices set for each capture are not invariable and it will take as much force as diplomacy to pocket.&quot;<br/><br/>Wanted! The rewards is a tactic game of area control, where players must capture the most fugitives they can, for the highest price. Each player has 16 cards (cowboys) with a specific strenght (0 to 5) and special habilities. Each card is played to influence the meeples (fugitives) that borders it. When an area containing meeples is completly surrounded, the player with more strenght wins the current money for each of them (if there is a tie, a duel happens!). Besides surrounding areas containing fugitives, players must also make the better use of their card habilities to obtain the best rewards. This happens because the prices are variable. The player who uses best the &quot;prices market&quot; will take an important advantage, because it's preferable to capture less if the price is higher. Cards may be played face up and face down. For each card side players may choose do to the card hability or not. When playing a card face down, besides the bluff, you may move the &quot;sheriff&quot; of your color up to two intersections. This pawn has a strategic interest, because he strenghts all the player cards of his color by +1 (only the ones he touches). Some strategic combinations of cards can be made to prevent other players to gain a lot of money.<br/><br/>Besides the basic game players may choose to play it in the advanced mode, which includes a Horse which helps the player who controls it to move his sheriff further, while being stronger, and a Prison (for an ending score).<br/><br/>In June 2012 the game was finalist in the Plateau d'Or Boardgame Design Contest (Canada).<br/>In April 2013 the game was finalist among 138 in Granollers Boardgame Design Contest (Spain).<br/>In April 2013 the game won the &laquo;Coup de Coeur&raquo; prize in the NTPSLM Boardgame Design Contest (Canada) among 124 games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this alternate history game, a nuclear event began to devastate the world and most of the world is now covered in the ocean.<br/>To avoid extinction, the survivors have built massive floating cities that need to be constantly powered to keep the cities moving.<br/>This requires expeditions to the few remaining land masses and even the deep ocean to find the necessary materials for the cities. But resources are scarce...<br/><br/>In Scarce players need to finish the construction of the nuclear plant that powers their floating city. Each player is in control of a dragonfly ship, a vehicle that can travel in the air, on the ocean surface, and in the deep ocean.<br/>Players can upgrade and manage the crew and modules of their ships to maximize resource gathering. All this while avoiding a doomsday cult, hellbent on destroying the city. The cult has its city on the way and several scouting forces already in the vicinity of the player city. Players will need to move carefully to avoid enemies and be time-efficient to get their city moving before the enemy city arrives. The deep sea is not safe either as strange creatures lurk in the dark.<br/><br/>Scarce offers versatile gameplay, allowing you to engage either cooperatively, where collaboration is key to city repair, or competitively, where captains vie against each other to claim the title of the most successful.<br/><br/>- Explore resource tokens above and below the ocean surface as you move your craft on a multi-dimensional gameboard. This is done while avoiding dangers on both levels. Outmaneuver or defeat these threats as you see fit!<br/><br/>- Upgrade your craft by attaching modules, recruiting crew members, and acquiring ability cards to maximize the efficiency of your turn. You will also need to play your cards right! Use your deck of cards to maneuver the craft, assign crew members to new posts, and execute powerful abilities. Using the right card at the right time might be enough to avoid disaster.<br/><br/>- Manage your resources well! You will need to use them to build the nuclear plant to achieve victory but you will also need to use them to slow the progress of the enemy city that is constantly closing in on you. If the time is up and the enemy city reaches you, it is too late and all is lost.<br/><br/>This is a game with a lot of choices, possibilities, strategies, and changing conditions.

        "description": "May 3rd, 1863 is a somewhat forgotten day in ACW history but it had 21,357 casualties and was the second bloodiest day of the American Civil War. Part of that day's butcher bill involved General John Sedgwick's VI Corps. General hooker was losing possession of the Chancellorsville Crossroads and he ordered Sedgwick to advance out of the Fredericksburg, take Mayre's Heights and come up behind Lee's army at Chancellorsville. It was a tall order but Sedgwick was able to take Marye's Heights, which had been impregnable four and a half months ago, and suddenly the way to Chancellorsville looked open.<br/><br/>Sedgwick continued on his way but immediately started looking over his shoulder, worried about Early's Confederate forces. They had retreated from their Fredericksburg positions but were reforming in Sedgwick's rear. Sedgwick then makes a mistake and stopped to reshuffle his troops for his advance towards Lee's forces. He traded time for strength Cadmus Wilcox showed real initiative and conducted a skillful delaying action with his Confederate troops. AL the while, troops sent by Lee rushed to help Wilcox's small Brigade. Sedgwick was now heading for an ambush and his Corps was in much bigger trouble than he realized.<br/><br/>Sedgwick Attacks gives players the chance to do what Sedgwick couldn't, get to Hooker's aid. Should the Union trade time for fresh troops or shoud he push on with his bloodied troops leading the way? Three different scenarios give the players a chance to find out. The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of the battle that can be completed in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules normally found in such games. while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features &quot;Blind Swords&quot; chit-pull system, which emphasizes the the &quot;FOW's&quot; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war, and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises - an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players draw a &ldquo;junk card&rdquo; which represents an item found at the junkyard that can be used to part out and form different robot components (arms, legs, body, head) to help complete the mission.

It had an advanced and aerodynamic design, but was not easy to fly due to its stiff controls and high landing speed. Introduced in 1915, the Morane-Saulnier N was adopted by French A&eacute;ronautique Militaire, GB Royal Flying Corps and Imperial Russian Air Force. This aircraft was seen on the western front in April 1915, and was piloted by Aces such as Sergent Eugene Gilbert, Jean Chaput, and Jean Navarre.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. This is not a complete game.

Henry of Lancaster possessed it twice, while his son was dispossessed once.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that this is one of our best campaign games. We managed to work in all kinds of period flavour while making the game easy and playable, in a system that brings a historical result. The decisions are agonizing, but play moves very quickly, and with most scenarios only a few turns long, you could easily get two into one game night!<br/><br/>Most scenarios begin with few troops in play- a faction must use their nobles in the ancestral lands to gather Well-Wishers, Retainers and Array troops and lead them into battle. Spend too much time recruiting and you'll find your side already beaten leaving you nothing for it but to abandon your troops and flight to the Continent! You have to act quickly and often risk the game on one move that will make or break your claimant's chance at the throne...<br/><br/>Above Description from game's web site<br/><br/>The game is played after choosing a scenario depicting one campaign during the wars. Typical victory conditions include clearing a geographic area or capturing/killing specified enemy personalities. To that end players maneuver their nobles on an area map of England seeking to raise troops and then confront their opponent. A robust battle system is included, but battles may also be played out using the related &quot;A Coat of Steel&quot; miniatures rules if the players prefer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This miniatures rule set is a 2011 re-issue and re-working of the earlier Hammerin' Iron and Hammerin' Iron 2.<br/><br/>The rules are backed with a large range of 1/600th miniatures, a hexgrid play mat and various markers and accessories.<br/><br/>There are amended game systems within the rules, but at heart the game retains the same historical focus on naval warfare in the American Civil War. As such the earlier historical description comments still apply:<br/><br/>&quot;This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.&quot;<br/><br/>",

And lastly &quot;The Battle of Waterloo &ndash; Earlier Start&quot; allows you to do some investigating if it would have been better for Napoleon to start the battle earlier in the day.  &quot;The Battle of Waterloo &ndash; Historical&quot; is the just that.<br/><br/>As an added feature the rules supplement has a short section describing how to use the unit counters from the Waterloo game, those of the French I Corps, to aid the earlier battles for Quatre Bras and Ligny.<br/><br/>There are a number of interesting options for inclusion into scenarios in this game:<br/><br/>        Soggy Ground for those that want to try the earlier start time<br/>        The French 1st Chasseur Regiment does not guard the Emperor's baggage and gold<br/>        The French 7th Infantry Division does not take as bad a hammering at Ligny and is available to help<br/>        The French 21st Infantry Division of the VI Corps does not get detached to Grouchy and is available<br/>        The Prussians don't arrive<br/><br/><br/>Key Features                                                                     <br/><br/>        (12) 11&quot; x 17&quot; Full Color Map Sheets of the Waterloo area<br/>        Variable combat strengths<br/>        Reduction by Levels of Order<br/>        Waterloo Rules Supplement with National Doctrinal Rules<br/>        Approximately 2400 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers<br/>        Infantry and Cavalry units at the company and squadron level and artillery at the section level<br/>        Battalion level infantry and Regiment level cavalry units<br/>        (7) Scenarios that allow play on smaller parts of the battle or the entire affair<br/>        Excellent Solitaire Play<br/><br/><br/>(from Grognard sim's website)<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you play a card from your hand. These cards will let you draw more cards in 5 different ways. But, there&rsquo;s a little twist, to use the card, you must maintain a special pose/gesture (specified on the card) until your next turn. After drawing some cards, hopefully you will have enough to purchase equipments from the store. These equipments may help you in various ways or win you the game.<br/><br/>The most exciting part of Style Up is AFTER the game ends. Because the Losers must make silly pose (based on the cards) and have their photos taken. Furthermore, those photos will be shared online for the world to see.<br/><br/>There you have it, a simple relaxing game that&rsquo;s a fine combo of two trending hobby!<br/><br/>And don&rsquo;t forget to #StyleUp when sharing your trophy (embarrassing photos of your friends)!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The unpredictable world of Push Up Poppies offers rewards and inflicts pain. Plantation owners in Afghanistan have devilish tricks and creative tools to grow and harvest their poppies.<br/><br/>In this card game, each player has their own poppy plantation and their goal is to harvest the most poppies by maximizing their plantation's productivity and stifling the opposition.<br/><br/>There are four types of card:<br/><br/>     The Field cards, which are the cards the players can harvest. Most of these are poppy cards, which have a value from 1 to 8.<br/>     The Infrastructure cards, which permanently affect the player's plantation in various ways.<br/>     The Action cards, which boost poppy production or sabotage the competition. These cards are discarded immediately after being played.<br/>     The Wild cards, which behave differently depending on what the player chooses them to be.<br/><br/><br/>Each player must have five cards in their hand at the start of their turn. During their turn, the player must draw one card from the common stack and then play one card, either by placing it in front of them in their plantation (Field or Infrastructure cards) or by resolving its action (Action cards). They can also simply discard a card. If they so choose, they can play a second one and if they do, they have to draw a second card from the stack afterwards.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has five Field cards in their plantation, they must harvest it. The harvest is worth the combined value of the poppy cards harvested. The first player reaching 69 points wins!<br/><br/>Note: One deck allows to play with up to six players, but one can combine several decks together to play with many more people.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A kingdom on the crossroads gets invaded by its greedy neighbours. On the brink of defeat, its wizards launch the final retaliation - they open a rift to the realms of chaos. Mighty demons with their servants swarm the land, turning it into waste. The invading kingdoms face an opponent they are not ready for. Regular armies are helpless against horrors of wraiths, turning people into possessed who fight against their own kind. Only elite units, heroes and battle mages dare to face the dark forces. The goal is to buy time for the archmages to prepare a spell that would close the rift. The help might come too late - if the destruction of the lands is too severe, people will abandon hope and wait defenceless for the doom.<br/><br/>Players - alone or in 2-player teams - take the role of chaos forces and the defending kingdoms. The chaos has the upper hand - they decide which kingdom will be invaded and with which forces. The defenders have to predict the attack directions and send their forces there. They are not completely blind - their scouts and clairvoyants can detect enemy&rsquo;s movements. Chaos forces crave resources that are spread across the land - this also gives hints where they would like to strike. Some kingdoms are more vulnerable - or resistant - against some types of attacks, but the best strike is often the most obvious one. Both sides have to raise new armies - their starting forces need reinforcements as the units need rest after every battle. Both sides have also to deal with casualties that come with every war.<br/><br/>Chaos forces need resources taken from the lands to raise new armies and launch the attacks. As their domain gets bigger, the conquered sources of resources get depleted. Chaos armies can pillage the lands for additional resources but this comes at the cost of precious time.<br/><br/>This is where the game starts - chaos leaders have seven rounds of time to destroy the most vital parts of the kingdoms, so that any help from the archmages comes too late. They have to find a way to plan successful attacks deceiving the defenders. Defending players have to deduct chaos assaults and counter them. Wrong guess of direction gives an opportunity to fortify the borders against future attack. Wrong choice of the defending unit still slows the opponent down. Right unit at the right border will stop the invasion - at least once.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While many think of the war&rsquo;s naval campaigns as a static blockade, the truth is that it was actually just as desperate and bloody as other aspects of the conflict. From the coastal regions of Virginia and the muddy rivers of the Mississippi Valley to the far flung freezing waters of Alaska&rsquo;s Bering Strait, Union and Confederate navies fought for dominance.<br/><br/>Dawn of Iron puts you in command of a Civil War-era vessel, or a full squadron of them. Assemble your fleet, engage the enemy, and send them to the bottom!<br/><br/>The 24-page Dawn of Iron rulebook includes all the rules you'll need to play in a concise 15-pages with diagrams and illustrations. There's also a few pages dedicated to open sea and coastal battlefields that you will fight on (riverine coming soon!) and four general play missions that should get you sailing in no time!<br/><br/>",

The dispute over the vote in the provinces of the national territory should be your main priority to win the elections, although your actions will not be the only thing you should take into account. Public opinion has often weighed on people's decisions and actions; some have even called it the fourth estate. You will have to find a way to make friends with opinion leaders who may not respect your ideology, but do serve to improve your approval in society, for example. Or maybe you decide to join a very prestigious media that shares your ideals, which will be your ally throughout the campaign to provide you with its services.<br/><br/>Nowadays, unpredictability can reign in the country, so chance can play tricks on you or be beneficial for your campaign. But be careful because the economy here is fragile, and your budget funds will be limited. The key to managing them can be decisive in reaching the last week of the campaign with a chance, and not losing the possibility of increasing your cultural capital by multiplying your chances of victory. Sometimes it is not the one who has the most money who wins, but the one who best represents the culture of his country, or who has the political skills to influence his adversaries; But above all, the most important thing is that they don't put you in prison. At least until now we do not know of any ruler who has run while behind bars.<br/><br/>Enjoy a fun game of strategy, planning and financial intelligence to enjoy for hours with friends and/or family. And let whoever is the best politician win.<br/><br/>Clarification: The game will not be responsible for fights and/or discussions that may cause or possible deepening of the crack. Or yes... we talked about it in Segurola and Havana.<br/><br/>",

Each game features a scenario with specific starting conditions and a set of random challenges. The player who completes the most of these challenges wins.<br/><br/>The map, called the territory, is created by the players placing territory tiles. These tiles create biomes can span several tiles. It is not specified where in the world the game takes place, but the biomes are based on the ones that existed during the Cretaceous period. The map is mostly unknown at the start of the game and is gradually revealed as players spread and explore it.<br/><br/>There are alternative ways to play using different map set-ups called scenarios, playing in teams and even playing several games as a campaign. In addition, a &quot;legendary&quot; part of the game gives players the ability to change between species inside a dynasty and save their current development over several games. This can be used to get suitable dinosaur variants to manage harder scenarios; it can also be used to get a specific dinosaur or combination of dinosaurs to best counter opponents.<br/><br/>The foundation for this game is facts, what is known and theorized by the latest scientific discoveries regarding different dinosaur species, but in Dino Dynasty, the players can explore the fantasy of what could have been. What would have happened if a dinosaur had developed in an evolutionary direction other than it did? These possible changes are still within reasonable limits and are based on the real physical characteristics of the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Night of the Ninja is a blue-black deck built around Ninjas and ninjutsu, from Betrayers of Kamigawa.<br/><br/>Planechase is a card game and a variant of Magic: The Gathering with an emphasis on multi-player games. The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.<br/><br/>To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a &quot;shared planar deck,&quot; which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one &quot;Chaos&quot; ability.<br/><br/>Players also need a six-sided die, called the &quot;planar die.&quot; Each Planechase pre-constructed deck comes with a &quot;planar die&quot; that has four blank faces, one &quot;Planeswalk&quot; face with the &quot;Planeswalker&quot; symbol, and one &quot;Chaos&quot; face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If &quot;Chaos&quot; is rolled, the &quot;Chaos&quot; ability of the current plane card triggers. If the &quot;Planeswalk&quot; symbol is rolled, the player &quot;planeswalks away&quot; from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been &quot;planeswalked to.&quot; A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.<br/><br/>Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.<br/><br/>Planechase 2012 introduced the &quot;phenomenon&quot; card type. A player may have up to two different phenomenon cards in his or her planar deck, which cannot have the same name. When a player planeswalks to a phenomenon, he or she follows the instructions on the card, then immediately planeswalks away from it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface. All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters. Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.<br/><br/>Each player has a flight of four bombers, represented by two counters. Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.<br/>Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.<br/><br/>TAC is designed for portability: the entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.<br/><br/>This set is a self-contained rulebook that includes miniatures for the British heavy bomber Lancaster.<br/>In addition to the Lancaster bombers, this set also includes:<br/><br/>     ground targets for the city of Augsburg, Valentin U-boat factory, Mohne Dam, and Battleship Tirpitz.<br/>     Spotlight templates as part of of the new night-fighting rules.<br/>     Bomb hit and illumination markers.<br/>     Flak templates.<br/><br/><br/>This set contains five scenarios.<br/>Operation Millennium: A mass of Lancasters brave spotlights and flak to attack Cologne at night.<br/>Augsburg: Unescorted Lancasters attack a German city. The Luftwaffe defends the city with Bf-109F fighters.<br/>Dambusters: In this low-level, night mission, Lancasters drop a special &ldquo;skip bomb&rdquo; to breach a dam in Germany&rsquo;s Ruhr Valley.<br/>Tirpitz: The German battleship Tirpitz sits crippled in a Norwegian fjord. Lancasters drop 12,000lb Tallboy bombs to sink her.<br/>Grand Slam: The 22,000lb &ldquo;earthquake bomb&rdquo; is used against the hardened Valentin U-boat factory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the cooperative setup, you take on the role of museum creators, working together to put together a grid of museum rooms for a museum of whatever theme you decide as a group. Picking a theme has no mechanical purpose, but the game encourages light roleplaying, so knowing whether you&rsquo;re making a bacon or donut museum helps encourage that. Rooms are things like the gift shop, special exhibit, hands-on exhibit, bathroom, etc&hellip;<br/><br/>Then you get dealt one of 6 characters: three museum employees (Docent, Janitor, Volunteer) and 3 family members (Grandparent, Parent, Teen). The mechanic involved is age; players and NPC visitors in the museum are either Youth, Adult, or Senior. Of course there are roleplaying opportunities here too.<br/><br/>Then you get dealt Attribute Cards, basically sets to collect by moving around collecting memory tokens (Education, Bonding, Romance, and Mischief). You&rsquo;ll get to manage your cards by drawing and discarding as the game goes on. It&rsquo;s played over 7 turns, or the 7 hours the museum is open.<br/><br/>Each turn you have 5 Actions you can do, kept track of by cards you flip over. One Action, the Hour Action, changes each hour to keep things fresh. There are certain conditions that have to be met, involving the number of people in a room and their ages, to collect the memory tokens. The roleplaying charm comes from describing these actions, including what mischievous things you do, as you do them.<br/><br/>At the end you complete the best sets you can with the tokens you&rsquo;ve collected and add up the points.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After 400 years under Ottoman occupation, the Greeks decide to rebel and claim their freedom. Will they manage to prevail or will they get squashed by the Ottoman empire?<br/><br/>1821: Fight for Freedom is a strategy card game that puts the players in the role of the rebellion's main characters. By playing cards from their hands, the players try to gain control of large areas of Greece and minimize their opponent's potential. Whoever manages to gain control of these areas, is the game's winner!<br/><br/>In the game, the players have cards in their hands with the main characters from Greece's War of Independence. They also have 3 cards in front of them, representing 3 large areas of Greece. Each player, on their turn, may place more units in those areas or discard cards to move the existing units. When units of opposite sides end up next to each other, battles occur which are determined by the units' strength and cards played for support. If a player ends up having a total of 10 or more power in one area, at the beginning of their turn, they gain a control marker in that area. The first player to place a control marker in each area or 5 markers in total, is the winner!<br/><br/>The game is also played with 4 players in teams - 2 vs 2. In this case, the player fight for the control of 4 areas in total and the winning team is the one that either places a control marker in all 4 areas or places 7 control markers in total.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>&Mu;&epsilon;&tau;ά &alpha;&pi;ό 400 &chi;&rho;ό&nu;&iota;&alpha; &sigma;&kappa;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&iota;ά&sigmaf; &omicron;&iota; Έ&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &alpha;&pi;&omicron;&phi;&alpha;&sigma;ί&zeta;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &nu;&alpha; &xi;&epsilon;&sigma;&eta;&kappa;&omega;&theta;&omicron;ύ&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &nu;&alpha; &delta;&iota;&epsilon;&kappa;&delta;&iota;&kappa;ή&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &tau;&eta;&nu; &epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&theta;&epsilon;&rho;ί&alpha; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;. &Theta;&alpha; &tau;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&phi;έ&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; ή &theta;&alpha; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &sigma;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&alpha;&tau;ή&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &omicron;&iota; &delta;&upsilon;&nu;ά&mu;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega;&nu; &Omicron;&theta;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&nu;ώ&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&eta;&tau;ώ&nu;;<br/><br/>&Tau;&omicron; 1821: &Alpha;&gamma;ώ&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf; &gamma;&iota;&alpha; &Lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;ά &epsilon;ί&nu;&alpha;&iota; έ&nu;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;ί&delta;&iota; &sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&eta;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;ή&sigmaf; &mu;&epsilon; &kappa;ά&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;, &pi;&omicron;&upsilon; &beta;ά&zeta;&epsilon;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &pi;&alpha;ί&kappa;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &rho;ό&lambda;&omicron; &tau;&omega;&nu; &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&iota;&sigma;&tau;ώ&nu; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&nu;ά&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf;. &Pi;&alpha;ί&zeta;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&iota;&sigmaf; &kappa;ά&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &pi;&omicron;&upsilon; &kappa;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;ύ&nu; &sigma;&tau;&omicron; &chi;έ&rho;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, &omicron;&iota; &pi;&alpha;ί&kappa;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&pi;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;ύ&nu; &nu;&alpha; &kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;ί&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&nu; έ&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron; &mu;&epsilon;&gamma;ά&lambda;&omega;&nu; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&chi;ώ&nu; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;ά&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &nu;&alpha; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&rho;ί&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &tau;&eta; &delta;ύ&nu;&alpha;&mu;&eta; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&pi;ά&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;.

Each player plays a number (8, 10, or more) of different contracts during the course of the game. The biggest difference between Barbu and Coiffeur-Jass is that players are trying to win as many valuable cards by capturing them in tricks. Typical contracts include:<br/><br/><br/>    Acorns, Shields, Bells, Flowers: Play with the specified suit as trumps.<br/>    Obenabe: Play with no trumps.<br/>    Undenufe: Play with no trumps, but the ranks of the cards are reversed.<br/>    Slalom: Play with no trumps, but tricks are played alternately with the Obenabe and Undenufe rankings. <br/>    Gustav: Play with no trumps; either the first six tricks are played with the suits in Obenabe order and the next six tricks in Undenufe order, or vice versa.<br/>    Joker: Declarer chooses any of the above contracts.<br/><br/><br/>In Switzerland, you can purchase blackboards that have a Coiffeur-Jass scoring table printed on it.<br/><br/>",

Players place face-up on the table all the food pairs found in their hands. On their turn, players draw a random card from the player on their left. If the card matches a card in their hand, they place the matching pair face-up on the table. Play continues until a player has matched all the cards in his hand. The first player to do so takes the First Out card. After the first player goes out, play continues until all pairs are matched and a single player holds The Beef card. Each matching pair is worth either 1, 2, or 3 points. The pair of Clara Peller cards is worth 5 points, the First Out card is worth 8 points and The Beef card is worth 10 points.<br/><br/>The player who scores the most points at the end of 3 rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Although England and France support Poland and on September the 3rd declare war on Germany, the Poles are left to fight alone&hellip;.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>- Book-case box<br/>- 70 x 50 cm map (28 x 20 in)<br/>- 264 die-cut counters <br/>- Game rules <br/>- 1 die<br/><br/>In the late 1930s, Polish generals Berbecki, Bortnowski, Kasprzycki, Kutrzeba and R&oacute;mmel designed Plan West (Plan Zach&oacute;d) for the defence against a German invasion. The planners had predicted the direction of most of the German thrusts, with the exception of the intensity of the flanking movement via Prussia and Slovakia. Although the Polish Army had already started their mobilization during mid-August, the final part was postponed until August the 30th due to the political situation and the work to find a diplomatic solution. However, on the German side, a general mobilization had already been completed under the cover of a military exercise, and the German army was deployed around the Polish border according to the German strategic invasion plan, Case White (Fall Wei&szlig;), originally developed by generals Blumentritt and von Manstein. <br/> Plan West&trade; is an attempt to create a fun and fast-paced board game on one of the most decisive campaigns during World War II. The game is based around a chit-pull system and a Victory Point time track that forces the Germans to operate at a historical tempo during the game. Plan West&trade; covers the first 10 days of the campaign and is played on a coffee table sized map.<br/><br/>It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Stargard Solstice, Plan West and Army Group Narwa and utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.<br/><br/>",

Though its construction techniques gave it a light air frame, the Pfalz was known for being both sturdy and a little slow on the controls. Poor in climbing, it was an excellent diving airplane and popular to use for balloon attacks. The D.IIIa version solved many of the problems, with guns repositioned to assist pilot in clearing weapons of jams, and made up the majority of the 1100 airplanes built by war&rsquo;s end, with most of them flown by Bavarian Jastas.<br/><br/>Pfalz D.IIIa (Berthold)<br/>Rudolf Berthold (44 victories) flew missions from the very beginning of the war until nearly the end, even after having suffered serious injuries in addition to having lost the use of his right arm.<br/><br/>Pfalz D.IIIa (Holtzem)<br/>Max Holtzem was a German test pilot, flight instructor and member of a Bavarian pursuit squadron. He received the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Bavarian Military Merit Order with Swords.<br/><br/>Pfalz D.III (Voss)<br/>Werner Voss was a very remarkable pilot that deserved many awards for his numerous enemies shot down in combat (48 victories), and a good friend of Manfred Von Richtofen.<br/><br/>Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>",

Players are invited to debate ridiculous policies, serve unscrupulous interest groups and wheel-and-deal to win power!<br/><br/>Players try to convince each other to support policies and contribute influence in a 'vote'. But be careful, players don't have to do what they say, and can even smear a policy to ensure it doesn't pass!<br/><br/>While players may need to lie from time to time, they can build and rebuild trust dozens of times over the course of a game. This creates a wonderful cadence of shifting alliances and social dynamics that will keep you coming back time and time again.<br/><br/>There are also interesting strategic dimensions to the game-play. Players receive secret mission cards in the form of 'Special Interest' groups.

        "description": "The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Chase&hellip;<br/><br/>We spend so much time inside our heads, we often fail to see the world around us clearly. Only by slowing down, noticing our minds have distracted us and letting go can we truly experience life in its purest form.<br/><br/>Nevermind The Distraction is a short, fast-paced, yet surprisingly relaxing abstract solitaire card game inspired by the principles of mindfulness and beginning meditation. Take on the role of The Watcher and engage your own mind in a contest of wills to determine the ultimate fate of your wandering thoughts. Breathe, and try not to get too distracted!<br/><br/>Setup begins by preparing the meditating consciousness using small decks called Distraction Packs. These themed packs contain beautiful and evocative imagery depicting various occurring thoughts. Three packs are combined each game based on your mood, thoughts, or plans for the day, creating a unique visual tableau every session.<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Mind revealing a new thought - or intensifying an existing one - ultimately trying to turn them into Distractions. Distractions cause time to pass more quickly, and when the Timer deck is empty, the mediation is over!  The Mind&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to waste time keeping us distracted as long as possible.<br/><br/>During the Watcher phase, players choose one of these thoughts and take an action to calm or quiet it, pulling it one step back from becoming a Distraction. Do this enough times and a thought is eventually Let Go, releasing it completely and blocking the Mind&rsquo;s ability to manipulate it. The player&rsquo;s goal is to Let Go of as many thoughts as possible before the Timer deck runs out.<br/><br/>What follows is an engaging, fast-paced yet relaxing 8-way Tug of War that, when combined with the beautiful minimalist aesthetic, create the perfect conditions for the player to enter a flow state, not unlike that of meditation.<br/><br/>Regular practice will eventually result in a perfect score. These &ldquo;Zen Master&rdquo; wins unlock additional levels of game play and introduce new challenges, mechanics and strategies letting the game grow with you.<br/><br/>The short play time, small box and limited table space needed make this an excellent addition to any daily self-care routine regardless of whether or not you practice meditation!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Comes complete with 4 new double sided map tiles that add water barriers to the game as well as 5 new Encounters for this new land.<br/><br/>Skriga paddled her boat idly. Life at sea suited her fine. Sure, there were no stupid minions to kick, but no Demons to kick her either. And plenty of fish! Leave them in the bottom of the boat for a couple of days and they get really tasty. Sea dragons would fetch the really ugly fishes from the depths, if you shout at them loud enough. Ugly ones tasted best and it felt good to push the sea dragons around. They were so full of themselves! Anything could swim. She could learn if she wanted to.<br/><br/>Looking up she saw a storm brewing, small but close. Perfect, everyone likes a little rain in their face, trickling down their backs. She turned the boat to head towards the better weather. <br/><br/>As she paddled, it became clear this was not a simple storm. Water splashed and circled in the air, the vortex moving towards her faster than she moved towards it. Then it was upon her, and everything changed. She was under the water, not on it, and her precious boat was torn to pieces around her. And it was cold, so cold. As she floated towards the dim and strangely diffuse light above her, the cold dragged her mind to a dark, silent place. And then she cracked her face against the sheet of ice above her.<br/><br/>Trapped beneath the ice for decades, Skriga could barely be called alive. Frozen in place, she was too chilled to draw power from Neemoss but the fading tendrils of her magic could feel the dead and drowned around her, together with the rotting flotsam and jetsam that is human decay. Her slowed thoughts could imagine new spells to use her surroundings to her advantage and when the ice began to thaw, she was a new Witch. We might call her a necromancer, although she had no name for what she had become.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This locomotive introduces a luck based mechanic to Snowdonia. <br/> During the Jack Vasel 2015 charity auction, Tony Boydell offered his services to design a card for Snowdonia.  This is the card which was produced.  For this reason, the Battlepuppy Express is one of the rarest Snowdonia cards as only a few were printed.<br/><br/>The locomotive is based on the Double Fairlie engines which are used on the Ffestiniog mountain railway in North Wales.  This 'double-ended' design dates back to 1869, and is characterized by the locomotives having a central cab with a firebox, boiler and smoke stack on either side.<br/><br/>The Battlepuppy (a small knitted dog) is a boardgaming celebrity, most often found in North West England. Battlepuppy is well-known for improving the luck of the player is he with.  When a gamer takes possession of this locomotive card, he chooses which side of the card he wants to play with, and he may also borrow the Battlepuppy.<br/><br/>",

In each round, players are dealt a hand of seven cards (ten cards for a three-player game), then the first and second player of the round announce the trump number and trump color. Players must state how many tricks they expect to win, then teammates add their claims together ; teams have to reach their summed number of tricks to score important bonus points, the value of which depends on the initial claim.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules, with the exception that you don't have to follow the lead suit. Instead, the highest card wins the trick, which leads to often unpredictable victories because the six special cards have different skills.<br/><br/>To win the game, teams have to estimate the risk of stating the expected tricks, use the special cards cleverly, and harmonize as an unit without either of them knowing what the other person holds.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Use your action cards wisely. Build up your economy and increase the living standards of your people. Precise planning is the key to victory. But be careful! Even the best plans may be derailed by events like the 1973 Oil Crisis or the Monday demos. Mass protests, that may seal your fate, are always on the horizon.<br/><br/>With &quot;2+2&quot; the USA and thee Soviet Union enter the game. Players form two partnerships &mdash; but there can only be ONE winner! Therefore every decision is a nail-biter: What is more important right now? Your side's interests or your own?<br/><br/>In &quot;2+2&quot;, the range of strategic choices is significantly widened, turning it to a completely different game: While you are building up &quot;your&quot; Germany (as in the base game) you also seek to manipulate your partner's choices, or even to sabotage their plans. In addition, the super powers struggle for global dominance and compete in the arms and space race.

In this game each player will earn points by completing their unique objective card and by outscoring their opponents.<br/><br/>FREE LANCES refers to mercenaries whose lance was free of any lord&rsquo;s service. Each mercenary will offer you a single use ability that could tip the round in your favor, but be careful not to let their valuable skills go to waste.<br/><br/>TERRA NOVA meaning, &quot;New Land&quot; brings about a new land card each round that applies to all players requiring you to significantly alter your strategy. Learn the terrain and use it to your advantage or fail to adapt and see an abrupt end to your thoughts of victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Drop Zone - Introduction<br/><br/>As was indicated by our labeling our first publication, &quot;Great Battles of World War II - Volume 1&quot;, we always intended to publish more additions and make a series of the rules. The question quickly arose; which topic, era, theater etc. should our second volume cover? We wanted something limited in scope, but that would offer a good number of ping-pong table sized battles. We also prefer to do subjects that have not been yet covered in miniatures. Island War came immediately to mind. The battles of the Pacific islands would certainly provide the proper size actions and only a game of Great Battles scope could cover the forces and time scales needed. Finally, we could include a Canadian action (Hong Kong) - always a bonus in our view. There was also German operations in Poland, France and the Mediterranean. Finally, of course there was the whole Eastern Front to choose from. We felt, however, that we should experiment more with the system before we wrote the definitive scenario book for WWII miniatures gamers - the Steppes of Russia.<br/><br/>I think it was Marcel Van der Sleen who first floated the idea that Great Battles was the perfect vehicle to present airborne actions. He had done a fair bit of work on Operation Market Garden and insisted that Great Battle's scope and time scale could be worked into three or four linked scenarios leading to a grand-campaign that would reflect the whole operation. In addition, Marcel claimed that very few adjustments would be needed. The movement, combat and morale would be left unchanged. We had already worked with the basic organizations in Canadians in Europe. He was correct. Great Battles remained unchanged, throughout the project. The only differences were the additions of landing rules and the use of activation cards instead of a set number of activation points.<br/><br/>Once into the research, I found that not only did the airborne operations offer interesting scenarios, but there was &quot;a little bit for everyone&quot;. There are air-drops of course but also tank-to-tank confrontations, elite units, militia units, street fighting, battalion operations, division operation and even corps operations. In addition, the Operations Mercury (Crete) and Operation Market Garden (Holland) could be linked into a grand campaign using defined battlefields (ping-pong tables) but allowing for area-to-area movement between tables - a rarity in miniatures gaming.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we feel that Drop Zone offers a different type of miniatures scenarios. Those that have played Canadians in Europe will immediately notice the difference, in texture, between the set-piece co-ordinated attack-defend actions and the tenuous, nail-biting to-and-fro of an airborne operation. For those who have not played the other scenarios in this series, be prepared for a new gaming experience. Your games will not simulate a 40 minute fight for the local farmhouse or crossroads. Instead, you will have to plan a multi-day operation - to land parachute brigades or even divisions behind enemy lines and then relieve them. Great Battles puts you in the general's chair where deployment and activation of forces, weather, supply, recovery and reinforcements artillery and air support are more important than the penetrating power of a shell or the armor thickness of a turret.<br/><br/>We are quite proud of Drop Zone and very pleased that Great Battles has made the transition to this new topic with such ease. We look forward to exploring other eras and theaters with Great Battles of World War II.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The period starts in 1496 with the French invasion of Italy and ends in 1660 prior to the wars of Louis XIV.<br/><br/>The beginning of the period saw the pike as the main weapon to enable a foot soldier to stand against mounted opponents. The pike was used throughout the period supported by or supporting an increasing number of shot troops, only falling into disuse when the introduction of the bayonet merged the fire and shock capability of the infantry into one man. This period saw  the development of the gunpowder weapons from simple handguns and bombards of the middle ages to the mobile cannon and muskets that ruled the battlefield until the 19th century.<br/><br/>Like all the Principles of War rules, these rules have a simple mechanism with the emphasis on leaders' command and control. This is to represent the problems of commanding troops in battle which confronted kings, princes and mercenary leaders., rather than how many casualties each unit was taking at each stage of the battle. Major European conflicts ( including the English Civil war and Thirty Years war) covered in the 64 army lists. Now includes armies for Asia including Japan and Korea.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Naval Warfare, 1560-1603<br/><br/>Now then, what's Sail!  like anyway?<br/><br/>We were after something more than fast play, but much less than complexity. These rules were originally meant for each model to represent more than one ship, and you can still play it that way. However at one-to-one it works best. As is our way, we wanted players to feel like they were playing their favorite navies. The tactics of one fleet will not work for another.<br/><br/>Which nations are represented?<br/><br/>We have decided to start out with Spanish/Portuguese, English and Dutch navies. French and Hansards are provided for to a lesser extent. Other navies, particularly Danish and Swedish, will be the subjects of later supplements.<br/><br/>How many ships can you play a side?<br/><br/>You can have from one ship per side up to forty, and still have a good time. As you'll see below, the game is intriguingly uncomplicated without being &quot;fast play&quot;, meaning no engagement is too small, and the larger battles can still be played without overly bogging down. We suggest each player control no more than 15-20 ships each, so with several players per side (and a big enough board) you could re-fight the whole Armada campaign!<br/><br/>Does it take long to play?<br/><br/>We finished a game with 15 ships per side in less than 90 minutes. Yet we do not consider<br/>these rules &quot;fast play&quot; (in other words, sacrificing too much realism for speed)<br/><br/>Do I have to write anything down?<br/><br/>Now you know how the Captain feels about record keeping.....

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>In the spring and summer of 1916, American troops crossed into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, whose troops had sacked Columbus, New Mexico following a dispute with an arms dealer based there.  After several small clashes, the biggest battle of the campaign came not against Villa's Division del Norte, but another force also on Villa's trail: the Mexican Federal Army.<br/><br/>Just what happened at Carrizal in June 1916 is not clear: Mexican and American accounts vary wildly.  What is clear is that two dozen American cavalrymen were taken prisoner and up to 50 soldiers on both sides were killed including the &quot;Hero of Carrizal,&quot; the 29-year-old Mexican commander Gen. Felix Uresti Gomez. Only the looming war in Europe prevented open war between the two North American nations.<br/><br/>The Chihuahua Incident is a stand-alone game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the four scenarios. The game is designed as a preview of the Infantry Attacks system for our hard-core fans, the Gold Club members. It includes a handful of small scenarios taking place on one game board &mdash; one based on the actual battle of Carrizal (or at least our reading of the different versions) with the others based on hypothetical variations that show the game system's take on infantry and cavalry battles.<br/><br/>The game includes the pre-release edition of the new series rules and charts, which may be altered before the release of the first boxed game, Infantry Attacks: August 1914.  The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a collection of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components. The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of the Gold Club.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Salamanca: Marmont vs Wellington covers the turning point of the 1812 campaign on the Spanish Peninsula, where Wellington showed he was not just a skilled defender, but could also deliver a decisive attack. It uses the Napoleon's Later Campaigns system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of Napoleonic battles.  Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!).  To win, you have to use your army like a Napoleonic commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go.  How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.<br/><br/>The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of Napoleonic command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are provided for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire.  Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.<br/><br/>The Salamanca special rules deal with particular units of the campaign (such as the British Light Division), reverse slope defense (used by the French in this battle!), and supply.  Scenarios cover the historical battle (playing time 2-3 hours between experienced players), and the full day (3-4 hours), enabling both sides to set the strategy for the battle as they choose.  Can you repeat Wellington's crushing victory or, as Marmont, draw your head out of the noose?<br/><br/>Scale: <br/>500m per hex<br/>1 hour per turn<br/>brigade level units<br/>Individual army and division commanders<br/><br/>A professionally produced version of the game is planned for the future through Clash of Arms Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionLoose is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized, initially empty square board. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of stones colored black on one side and white on the other.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is having the most stones on the board when both players have passed. Loose features surround capture, like Go, but surrounded stones are flipped instead of removed, and a natural, game-defining mechanism is used to favour (rather than ensure) eye creation upon captures. Since no stones are ever removed from the board, cycles are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn this rules, adjacent always means orthogonally adjacent.<br/><br/>A group is a set of like-colored, adjacent stones.<br/><br/>A liberty is an empty point adjacent to a group. A false liberty is an empty point which is adjacent to at least one stone of each color and no empty points. Liberties which are not false are true.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayStarting with Black, the players take turns placing stones with their color showing on empty points of the board, one stone per turn.<br/><br/>After a placement, all enemy groups with no true liberties are flipped, i.e. all the stones in them are turned round to show the player's color, after which the turn ends.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, every group on the board must have at least one true liberty. Otherwise, the move is illegal and the player must choose another one.<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment. When both players pass in succession, the game ends, and the one with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>A player's score is the number of stones with his color showing that there are on the board, plus a komi (see below) in the case of White. In the event of a tie, whoever made the last move loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the even number of points which are added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player tells his opponent the even number which will be used as komi, and then the second player chooses which color to play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAuthor's notesA very interesting, non-obvious feature of Loose is that, assuming that players will only pass their turn when there are no more useful moves available, the game will never end in a tie. In Go, ties can occur if there is an odd number of empty points in seki, but seki patterns in Loose always involve an even number of them. The tie-break rule is just included to make the game theoretically drawless, rather than just in practice.<br/><br/>",

Meyer's men passed through the city center and held a blocking position despite being surrounded for two days, armed with the new MG 42 belt fed machine guns aided greatly in their defense, until contact was reestablished by a sister battalion commanded by Major Peiper. Lt. General Rybalko's forces in the city were composed of a Tank Brigade and NKVD security troops of his Third Tank Army. General Rybalko ordered his units to block the German units from moving through the city, establishing defense lines along the small river meandering through Kharkov. The local militias were called up to aid in the defense of the city and many were thrown piece meal against the SS units armed with new &quot;wonder&quot; weapons. Those new weapons included the MG 42, whose rate of fire almost doubled over the previous MG 34, from 600-800 rpm to 1100 to 1200 rpm. The German forces would begin to have a new type of problem, an inability to maintain a high enough level of supply of ammunition to take advantage of the high rate of fire of the MG42. Many soldiers interviewed after the battle were quoted to say that the rate of fire was so high it was impossible to discern acoustically the individual shells firing. Many cited that the machine guns sounded like the tearing of canvas.<br/><br/>On 12 March, the LSSAH made progress into the center of the city of Kharkov, breaking through hardened enemy defenses in the northern suburbs. What followed was a house-to-house bloodbath as the Germans pressed ever closer to city center. By the end of the day, the division had reached a position just two blocks north of Dzerzhinsky Square. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment's 2nd Battalion was able to surround the square, after taking heavy casualties from Soviet snipers and other defenders, by evening. When taken, the square was renamed Platz der Leibstandarte. That night, 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment's 3rd Battalion, under the command of Joachim Peiper, linked up with the 2nd Battalion in Dzerzhinsky Square and attacked southwards, crossing the Kharkov River and creating a bridgehead, opening the road to Moscow Avenue. Meanwhile, the division's left wing reached the junction of the Volchansk and Chuhuiv exit roads and went on the defensive, fighting off a number of enemy counter-attacks.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the debacle at Stalingrad it almost defies belief that German soldiers, in this some of the last elite units available on the Eastern Front ... would plunge into the heart of a massive urban center and initiate house-to-house combat. But that's exactly what took place in Kharkov during the winter of 1943 and the results were a victory ... of sorts. The decline of German fortunes in the East were halted and the desire of Hitler to launch another offensive, to eliminate the Kursk Salient, was whetted. The battle also pointed some historians toward an answer to the 'what if' ... as in what if Hitler had assigned Waffen SS units to attack Stalingrad.<br/><br/>KHARKOV: BATTLE FOR THE SQUARE places you in the heart of an urban battlefield with nothing to fight with but elite units on both sides. The counter collection is impressive: ALL THE COMBAT COUNTERS NEEDED TO PLAY ALL OF THE SCENARIOS ... in ALL NEW presentations ... Germans AND Russians in Winter 1943 uniforms. And all AFV counters are 'winterized' ... aka 'whitewashed' ... to be more evocative than ever. What's more, the battlefield map is also done up in winter colors!<br/><br/>Players take the side of Either the German or Russian troops fighting in the City of Kharkov.<br/>They fight historical battles/scenarios and try to win by fulfilling a set of victtory conditions<br/><br/>",

It is essentially a simplification of Quadrille, itself a four-player adaptation of Ombre. As in Quadrille, players bid for the privilege of declaring trumps and deciding whether to play alone or with a partner.<br/><br/>Each player receives 8 cards dealt in 3-2-3, with two dealt to the  blind (received by the winning bidder). Aces rank high and tens rank low. The queen of clubs or spadille is always the highest trump, and the queen of spades or baste is always the third highest trump. Both do not count as members of their natural suits. The trump seven or manille is elevated to the rank of second highest trump. Below that the cards rank normally, except for omitting the queen if it is black. Thus depending on whether the trump suit is black or red, it contains 10 or 9 cards. Black plain suits contain 7 cards, and red plain suits contain 8 cards.<br/><br/>Bidding and scoring are complicated and not uniform. Bidding begins with the player to the left of the dealer. To bid, a player declares &quot;I can play&quot; (at least a 5 bid). The next bidder to bid either passes or declares &quot;I can play too&quot; (at least 5 clubs or 6). Once all but one player has passed, that player can declare a suit and call for an ace of another suit to be partner or decide to play &quot;solo&quot;.<br/><br/>Scoring can be point based or played using dimes and nickels. The bidding and scoring hierarchy is as follows.<br/><br/>5 hearts, diamonds, or spades - 5 cents<br/>5 clubs (called &quot;better&quot; when bidding) - 10 cents<br/>6-8 bids increase the bid by 5 cents per level<br/>solo bids outrank regular bids andearn more money because everyone pays the bidder (in partner games, both the bidder and the partner get paid on winning or pay out on loosing).<br/><br/>Trick-play is as in Whist. Player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible; if not they can play anything. Whoever played the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Bidder's, i.e. declarer as a soloist or together with his or her partner, must win the number of tricks bid. If bidder's party wins all tricks to the number bid, they can stop the game and get a bonus for prime. If they continue playing at that point they cannot score prime, but may be able to score slam for winning all tricks (bonus 5 cents).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Be sure to see &quot;Community Wiki&quot; towards the bottom (after the &ldquo;Files&rdquo; section) for quick download file links and useful information.<br/><br/>FLAC (Fast Large Air Combats) is a free set of rules designed for a fast paced, action packed, hex-based, WW2 air combat game using  any scale of miniatures (1:200, 1:144 or 1:100 scale work best) where a single player can control a multiple number of aircraft. The only limitation is the size of the game mat and the number of aircraft models you have. For beginners, we recommend no more than 2-3 aircraft per player, and no more than six to eight players per game.<br/><br/>By design, FLAC is fairly abstract, but that is only because it is designed to capture the flavor of air combat rather than overwhelm the players with lots of detailed characteristics of air combat. For example, there are only six altitude levels in FLAC, which is a fraction of what it should be, but trying to keep track of a vast array of altitudes can be tedious. Also, it would not make for fast, fun game play because aircraft at very different altitudes do not interact well. Overall, FLAC is designed to capture the flavor of air combat in a simple, fast, and enjoyable way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The War of Ashes is not a war of front lines and set piece battles. Small groups encounter each other in every manner, and there can be neither truce nor quarter. Scouts and foraging parties, messengers, guards, and lost soldiers meet. They fight over a cache of food, a lost animal, a footbridge, a message, or just to get back home. These desperate skirmishes take place amongst camps and baggage, in ravines, at the edge of swamps, or on the decks of small ships. There is no warning and no time to call for help. These small battles that will never be named or recorded are decided by the choices and skill of a handful of fighters, and in turn these skirmishes decide the course of the war.<br/><br/>Shieldbash is the skirmish wargame for the War of Ashes setting.  The fights are very flavorful, with ships that move beneath you as you fight on their decks, cavalry, darkness, archers, musicians, berserkers, carnivorous plants, and lumbering trolls.<br/><br/>Two new races of Agaptus are introduced in Shieldbash: the lizard-like Ki-Kak seeking vengeance on the Vidaar, and the True Atronians, does from the Elvorix, Vidaar, and Jaarl people who fight to unify their peoples against the Kuld menace.<br/><br/>A blind activation system leaves the commander unsure of how far he can push his fighters before the momentum of battle changes. Shieldbash concentrates on a commander's ability to use his fighters to best effect. Designed for ease of play, commanders can fight several skirmishes in an evening, following the tale of their warbands as they grow in power and renown. Gather your fighters, plan your attack, and fight for your people. Lead with your sword, keeping an eye open for the errant Shieldbash!<br/><br/>",

Units are modeled as German Platoons or Companies and Red Army Companies.  The game includes the components for the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements.

There are rules covering all the Battlefield Operating Systems and they integrate well together forcing players to make critical decisions that will effect the outcome of the battle and of each smaller engagement.<br/><br/>This game comes with 5 daily scenarios for 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 July and 2 small scenarios that use extremely small footprints and can be played in an afternoon sitting or two.  If you already own Totenkopf then you will be able connect this game with it and play the battle from the Psel crossing to the town of Prokhorovka.

        "description": "Droggn is a three-player trick-taking card game played with an unusually-long Tarock deck containing 66 cards (easily created by removing some cards from a standard Tarot deck). Its main rules are mostly the same as in any other Tarock game, but there are a few rules that make it distinct: buying a card (see below) and rules for the Fool, which works like the French Tarot Excuse rather than its usual Tarock function of the highest trump.<br/><br/>All but 3 cards are dealt out, these last three forming a talon. Then, the players have a single round of bidding to determine who will be the declarer in this round. The declarer always plays against the other two players, who form a temporary partnership. The possible bids are to take the talon and buy a card (exchange a card from the declarer's hand for any other card he calls for), take the talon without buying a card, or not take the talon at all. There is also an ultimate bid where the declarer binds himself to take all tricks.<br/><br/>After a card has been bought and an exchange with the talon has been made by the declarer (if any of these were a part of the highest bid), eldest leads a card to first trick. As usual in Tarock, players are obliged to follow suit and trump if they cannot. To win a normal bid, a player must take at least half of the card-points - an expection is the bid where all tricks have to be taken.<br/><br/>After a deal has been scored (loser(s) paying an amount of points based on the bid and the number of card-points taken by the declarer to the winner(s)), the declarer becomes the dealer for the next round. As the dealer always bids last, the player who was the declarer last round will have to bid high to play again in the following one.<br/><br/>For a detailed description and rules of the game, see a link to Pagat.com below.<br/><br/>",

It grew so large as to become the biggest symbol of resistance to slavery in the Americas during the XVI and XVII centuries.<br/><br/>Frequent parties were sent to destroy Palmares, but always succumbed to their guerilla tactics. Palmares was only defeated after the largest army to date in the colonies was assembled to vanquish it.<br/><br/>Your job is to try to set another ending to this story. As a village chief, on each of the 8 turns you will secretly allocate your villagers among the 5 possible actions: hunt for food, harvest wood, raid farms, build structures and pray for the Orishas. Then you reveal what you did and compare with the other players, action by action. If you allocated more villagers than the other players, you'll get more benefits.<br/><br/>But beware of the attacking parties that each turn come closer to Palmares. When they attack, all players should be ready to defend collectively, or you may have your village sacked.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chesscalation is a two player strategy game based off of Chess and Shogi. It's designed to avoid analysis paralysis and avalanching by favoring the defender and easing the pressure of each move - all while still keeping the strategic depth of Chess. It also has a bunch of fun unique pieces. The main difference from Chess is that players can chose to upgrade pieces or even put new pieces on the board.<br/><br/>There is a risk versus reward mechanic as higher value pieces limit the player's ability to upgrade and make new units. On the flip side, losing a high value piece may actually be an opportunity in disguise. It frees up the player to be able to place new pieces, which makes recovering easy. Also since you can place pieces anywhere on your own side, you can really easily block a checkmate. The increased complexity introduced by upgrading and placing new units makes it essentially becomes impossible to predict your opponent more than a few moves in advance. Each move is important, but not crushingly so. Each player feels like they have a chance to win up until the very end.<br/><br/>There are two modes of play. The default mode plays the most like Chess. In it, the goal is simply to force a checkmate on the opponent. When pieces are captured, they are removed from play, so each player only has a set amount of pieces to work with. In the other mode, players earn points for each piece they capture. Captured pieces go back into the player's pool. The goal of the game is to capture 100 points worth of their opponent's pieces without losing their King.<br/><br/>",

It introduced many new rules and Kindred to fully add the Sabbat to the game; previous expansions and the original edition focused on vampires of the Camarilla or Independent clans.<br/><br/>As well as many new Lasombra and Tzimisce vampires, the Sabbat expansion also added antitribu vampires of all Camarilla clans and rules for Sabbat titles, Disciplines, rituals and tactics. Each pack of expansion cards included an update explaining these new rules.<br/><br/>Additionally, a number of non-crypt cards from the original Jyhad/V:TES set were reprinted in this set; many of these were given new art, and in most cases this new art was retained for future sets' reprints of those cards.<br/><br/>Sabbat was the final V:TES set released by Wizards of the Coast. Four years later, White Wolf resumed publication of the game with the Sabbat War set. That set reprinted most (but not all) cards from the Sabbat set, as well as a number of other cards from the original core Jyhad/V:TES set.<br/><br/>",

Rather than preconstructed starter decks or booster packs, the set instead consisted of two preconstructed factory sets of 100 cards each. The set consists almost entirely of reprints of cards that were originally published by Wizards of the Coast (mainly crypt cards from the core Jyhad/V:TES set) that had not yet been reprinted by White Wolf and had thus been out of print for the better part of a decade. Only ten new cards were produced for 10th Anniversary, and all ten were included in each of the two sets. The rest of the cards in each set are unique, meaning that each set included 90 different reprinted cards (or 180 different cards in total between the two) in addition to the ten new cards that came with both sets.<br/><br/>Symbol: Foil &quot;10&quot;<br/>Code: Tenth<br/>Total Cards: 190<br/>New Cards: 10<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Courtside Basketball by FTP sports Games is a full-stats simulation of pro basketball. Players are rated individually for both offensive and defensive characteristics. A few examples are the player's ability to shoot, pass, drive to the basket, draw and commit fouls, rebounds, steals, blocked shots. etc.  The game is played either using Play Result Cards or using the designer's self-created Gamecenter, an Excel spreadsheet that not only flips the cards for you, but also helps track the score and stats.<br/><br/>After choosing your teams, you first set up the pre-game warm up, which includes whether referees will call the game tight (thus more fouls), normal mode or &quot;let them play&quot; (less fouls).  You also choose how physical the game will be depending on whether the teams historically are rivals or not. Finally, you assign each starter a specific color code, which will determine how often they control the ball.<br/><br/>Game play starts like any other basketball game, with the opening tip.  Once a team gains control, you first determine through team ratings if the offensive team will run a set offensive play or a faster transition play.  The play result cards or Gamecenter chooses the player by the color code and you choose to have the player shoot, drive to the basket, make a low post move or pass!  Random numbers determine if the basket is good, defensive stops, fouls, etc.  If the shot is no good, new cards drawn determine rebounding, blocked shots, etc.<br/><br/>Play continues as a regular basketball game in 15 second increments, however does capture the flow of a pro basketball game.  Each team is carded with every player who played for that team in the year chosen.  The game is played either solitaire or with 2 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Agents in Time is a time travelling game in which players begin with a team of two Agents, and are charged with flitting in and out of parallel time lines trying to achieve Objectives dictated by cards drawn at the start and during the game, all the while avoiding the Xanadu Time Patrol and ideally ensuring they keep overall control of their misdemeanours through time...<br/><br/>Part worker-placement, part abstract strategy, and part 'take that' (and part educational for those with a passing interest in history!), Agents in Time has a number of unique mechanics which make it unlike many other games, whilst still being familiar and easy to pick up.<br/><br/>Using a modular board of 36 hexes (Timespots), centered around a Main Timeline, the game plays out in a series of turns in which players Assign and Recall Agents, Paradox and Resolve minor and major events across time, claim Objectives, and more than likely trip over other time travellers...<br/><br/>A unique scoring tracker keeps a tally of both your Black Spot count (Blot) and Paradox Point totals, and the aim of the game is to complete Objectives and reduce your Paradox Score down to zero, but you start with a number of Black Spots (Blots) on your scorecard, and need to gradually erode those down to zero as well, because those Black Spots (Blots) will also hold up your Paradox Score (the latter can&rsquo;t go below the former, but the Blots can push your Paradox score back the other way). How come? Because in order to complete your objectives you have to 'flip&rsquo;n&rsquo;ripple' various Timespots (hexes) which in turn creates further paradoxes and causes your Blot count to start rising (and those of your opponents if they&rsquo;re on the same space, or adjacent to you!) &ndash; And how do you get your Blot count down? By &lsquo;fixing the timeline&rsquo; and putting things back again (called a Resolve action), but this could also benefit your opponents, who will similarly lose Blots for your good deed!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Abak Evolution is a variant of the traditional Backgammon game that includes different classes of checkers in the game, with special features each. These features are the ability to go backward, trapping a checker instead of hitting it, limited movement (an analogy of wounded soldiers), and extra strength (or an analogy for it).<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGeneral RulesAll of the backgammon rules are present in Abak Evolution, with 3 general additions:<br/><br/><br/>    A point or column can only stack five checkers (this is known as the Egyptian rule on standard backgammon, but is not often used in the classic version).<br/>    The checkers in a column must be moved in order from top to bottom.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tClasses:\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThere are 6 classes of checkers:<br/>    General: It can move backward.<br/>    Druid: It immobilizes an opponent, instead of hit it.<br/>    Guards (x2): It can block the column being alone in it.<br/>    Regular (x9): No difference with backgammon.<br/>    Wounded:<br/>         Odd: It can only move if the die number is 1,3,5. Odd numbers.<br/>         Even: It can only move if the die number is 2,4,6. Even numbers.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Each of these classes has its own set of rules, and all rules must be fulfilled to make a legal move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDescription of Classes:\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGeneral:The General is a checker that can go backward. Some limitations are applied:<br/><br/>     During a turn, when it goes backward, it can no move again, neither backward nor forward.<br/>     During a turn, when it goes forward, it can not move backward on the next movement.<br/>     It can only move forward if there are other checkers of his team outside its home.<br/>     When playing from the bar, the next movement can be backward.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDruid:The druid Traps a checker, instead of hitting it. The druid is placed over that checker, not allowing it to move until is off.<br/><br/>     This feature is present only in the middle camp. At any home, it hit the checker, behaving like a regular checker.<br/>     It can be hit by any other class.<br/>     While the druid is trapping an enemy checker, it can stack more checkers over it. If it is alone over the checker, it can be hit by any checker, or trapped by the enemy druid.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGuard:Guards behave like two checkers together. Being alone in a column is a blocked position for a regular checker. The special rules on guards are the following:<br/><br/>     A checker can't hit a single guard unless that checker is another guard.<br/>     The druid can trap a guard when it is alone.<br/>     Two no-guard checkers can hit a guard that is alone if both hit on the guard position in consecutive movements during the turn (a movement known as Jane in the Middle East).<br/>     Each team has 2 guards.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWounded:The checker in the wounded class has limited movements. There is the Even Wounded and The Odd Wounded.<br/><br/>Even Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is even (2,4,6).<br/><br/>     When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.<br/><br/><br/>Odd Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is odd (1,3,5).<br/><br/>     When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSoldiers:<br/>     Regular checkers that behave like backgammon checkers.<br/>     Each team has 9.<br/><br/><br/>",

In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replay ability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files.

        "description": "Libertadores del Sur is a two-player military simulation wargame of the Southern Theater of the Latin American Wars for Independence. The Patriot player controls the Argentine Ruling Directory forces and various federated and allied forces, while the Royalist player controls Spanish Regular Army, trained Loyalist South American forces and militia units. Several other historical armed factions contend for each player's attention when formulating strategy, from a land grabbing Portuguese-Brazilian Imperialist army, to local guerrilla units, breakaway Federal Republics, and a native Incan Rebellion in the Andes Highlands. Each player will face similar daunting logistical and political challenges as they attempt to impose their military will on their opponents over a vast theater of operations spanning Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts Bolivia &amp; Brazil.<br/><br/>Libertadores del Sur is an operational level simulation with a point to point card driven game system. Each turn represents one year's campaigning season. The players have a chance to raise and reorganize new forces prior to beginning operations, and reset their sides' morale, depending on how many provinces they control. During the Operations phase, players take turns playing cards causing historical events and/or activate forces to move and attack. Operations continue until the player's run out of cards, or run out of morale. When operations end, the players have a chance to consolidate political control over provinces where they drove out enemy forces, and combat units fall back to controlled areas. There are three scenarios allowing the players to start at different points of the campaign. The 1810 scenario starts with the first of the local juntas establishing themselves in response to Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. The 1814 scenario begins with Argentine General San Martin superseding Argentine General Belgrano, and the Patriots attempting to recover from various strategic set-backs. The 1817 scenario is a mini-game covering only the liberation of Chile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Citizens of the Kingdom are the majority, but they don&rsquo;t know who belongs to their team; Conspirators are the minority, but they know who belongs to each team, which allows them to plan and collaborate to destroy the Kingdom.<br/><br/>The game develops in alternating day and night phases. In the day phase, the Monarch has the opportunity to condemn a player for conspiracy with the Citizens&rsquo; help; in the night phase, Conspirators secretly wake up to eliminate an innocent Citizen.

Players can have the Viet Cong forces from Heroes of the Nam face off against the German forces from Heroes of Normandy.<br/><br/>We now provide two ways for this, the first is our Generic Unit Point System we&rsquo;ve designed, which can be applied to all games in the series. The second is our Pre-defined Unit Cost Charts. We have also kept the Pre-defined unit cost charts included in the previous Battle Generator. Players can use either the newer Generic Unit Point System or our Pre-defined Point Base Unit Costs. Moving forward, newly released games will include the Pre-defined Point Base Unit Cost Charts with the module rules. The amount of points is defined by the forces in the battle you want to play and then modified up or down by the variables of the battle. This means that you get to the action fast but allow the battle to be very flexible.<br/><br/>This Battle Generator has been tailored to work with all Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical modules in the series past, present, and future.

The base game comes with 3 decks of 30 cards each and all cards are unique. In the match setup, you choose 20 of the 30 cards for that match. Each warrior is unique and has Strength and Dodge values that allow these characters to attack, counterattack or dodge in combat, creating an immersive and intense game. Strength or Dodge points earn a bonus from a D4 to increase the variability of combats and make them more real. No warrior is able to return once they have been defeated and the objective of the game is to leave the opponent's field without any card on it, which means instant victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;re primarily a Wheat farmer but are now experimenting with other crops as the market has become saturated. You've narrowed your choices between Rice, Oats, Corn, Barley or Quinoa to add to your harvest in hopes of getting ahead of the market and to turn a better profit. However, the competition is experimenting with the same philosophy. Can you outthink your neighbors and develop a strategy that yields a better return? Or will you fall victim to your poor investment decisions?<br/><br/>Supporting up to 9 players, Agronomy is the deck building game that combines the reality of life on the farm with real world economics. Each player begins the game with a deck of 8 wheat and 2 random specialty crops. Every round, players take their turns simultaneously and reveal their hands to determine the market value of each crop. Investing in equipment cards will either increase the quantity of your crops or decrease the cost of purchasing additional crops. Market cards will directly affect the value of your crops and in some cases your opponent's. Research cards will either disrupt your opponent's game play or enhance your own. With 24 different cards to choose from, players will randomly choose 3 cards from each category to create a different and exciting challenge each game. Each player has a common goal of being the first to reach $60, but every dollar spent takes you further away from goal. So invest wisely.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bell of Treason is a fast-paced, card-driven board game in which two players experience the existential crisis faced by Czechoslovakia in response to Hitler&rsquo;s territorial demands. One player represents the ideal of trying to Defend the country, even without allies and at any cost. The other player represents the historically victorious ideal of agreeing to Concede the Sudetenland territory, in order to prevent bloodshed and hoping that Hitler&rsquo;s demands would stop there. The game adapts the crisis modeling system originally introduced in Mark Herman's Fort Sumter and then further developed in Fred Serval's Red Flag Over Paris. The game does not make any judgment about whether it would have been the right choice for Czechoslovakia to defend itself in 1938, nor whether such a defense could, in any sense, have been successful. Instead, it allows you to experience for yourself this crisis period of 1938, which forever influenced Czechoslovakia's path and the eventual course of World War II. The game can also be played solo, using an adaption of the innovative and elegant system originally designed by Jason Carr for Red Flag Over Paris.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The townsfolk have worked up the courage to go see what valuable loot they may have left behind.<br/><br/>An asymmetric grid of cards featuring different types of loot is laid out. The first player splits the grid along any single straight line between cards, claiming one set of loot cards for themselves.<br/><br/>Each successive player can choose to further divide any pile in play. If another player has laid claim to the pile you choose to split, that player is &quot;kicked off&quot; that pile of loot and will take another turn. If turn order returns to you without you having been kicked off your loot selection, you keep those cards.<br/><br/>Once everyone has collected their loot, and organized it by color, players draft a merchant card, each with different scoring mechanisms.  Each merchant is assigned to a color of loot, with their scoring mechanism only counting towards the loot collected in that color.<br/><br/>Players move to the next room in the dungeon (represented by a new loot card configuration being laid out) and repeat the process of cleverly splitting loot and looking to draft the most useful merchant.<br/><br/>After 5 rooms of loot have been split, players score each color of loot based on the merchant assigned. Most points wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The art work is inspired by George Orwell's famous book - Animal farm.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>1. Players pick 2 leader cards each and select any 1 leader that they will use to play throughout the game. Each leader has a unique ability that helps them in the game and some initial wealth that they start.<br/><br/>2. Turn order is defined by the leader card selected. On a players turn the player first collects 3 sheep tokens from the bank (these represent voters). The player then proceeds to play any 2 actions from the following:<br/>Seat action: Player gives sheep token to take any seat in a state. Each seat within the state has a number mentioned on it that represents how many sheep tokens are required to acquire that seat. Upon doing so players can collect the benefits mentioned for the state.<br/>Card action: Player may play a card from their hand<br/>Tracker action: Player may spend 2 moolah tokens to move up on either development or culture tracker<br/>Power action: Player may discard power tokens to remove an opponent from their state<br/>State action: Player may use any one benefit of a state they have formed a majority in<br/><br/>Players form a majority by acquiring more than 50% of the seats in a state. Upon forming a majority, the player gets victory points equivalent to the total number of seats in that state.<br/><br/>There are also 3 trackers in the game - Development, Culture and State.<br/>The development and culture tracker can be climbed by acquiring seats in a state that provides the development or culture benefit.<br/>State tracker can be climbed by getting a seat in any new state.<br/><br/>The first player to reach level 5 on the trackers gets 4 victory points.<br/><br/>The game ends when any one condition is met:<br/><br/>     A player has reached 21/23/30 points in a 4/3/2 player game<br/>     All states have a majority or are full<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To end your turn, draw back up to three cards and then it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>You'll either be playing chilli cards to make sets, or special cards to change things up at the table!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the sets will be scored and players compare how many of each card they played. A player with outright majority scores points equal to the set's value. Points are split evenly in the event of a tie, but if you start a set and end up coming outright last you're in for some negative points!<br/><br/>The lower value chillies are easier to win, but the high value chillies offer greater rewards.

Based in Petite-Synthe (Dunkirk), France, you and your observer will be assigned with taking part in nightly solo bombing and strafing raids against various German targets in occupied Belgium. But it won&rsquo;t certainly be a cake walk, as your bomber will frequently encounter deadly FLAK, not to mention nighttime navigation challenges, petrol management, mechanical failures, and even wing icing. And of course, you and your crewmen are not allowed to wear parachutes, so forget about bailing out when things go wrong!<br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with detailed damage modeling, fuel management, numerous crewmen skills, mission weather effects, random events, and a multitude of table modifiers, The Great War: Short Bomber offers memorable experiences and high replay value. Are you up to the challenge of surviving a 30-mission tour of duty?<br/><br/>The player will move his bomber through various travel boxes on a map during each mission on his way to the target zone, then must successfully return back to home base.<br/><br/>Game components include a crewmen placement mat, strategic map mat, tables book, crewmen status sheet, campaign log sheet, and counter sheet representing individual bombers, enemy units, etc.<br/><br/>",

He was working in the automobile industry before being drafted and taught to handle a Tiger I. He was assigned to the then 13. Panzer-Division and sent to Russia. Later he commanded a K&ouml;nigstiger in the now 12. Panzer-Division in Normandy.<br/><br/>In October 1944, he left for Hungary to take part in Operation Debrecen. On April 28, 1945, one day after his promotion to Feldwebel, Knispel was seriously wounded in the head. He died two hours later in a military hospital near Vrbovec.<br/><br/>Kurt managed to destroy 168 tanks! Nicknamed &ldquo;The Black Baron&ldquo;, he truly became the ace of aces of the Wehrmacht tankers. But then, why didn&rsquo;t he have the recognition of a Wittman, or an Otto Carius? Because Kurt didn&rsquo;t give a damn about Nazism, nor its honors or medals. That, combined with his unkempt appearance and modified uniform brought about the tale that he never received the Eisernes Kreuz and was thus dubbed &ldquo;knight without a cross&ldquo;.<br/><br/>This is pure myth, as he received the Eiserne Kreuz I.

Each trap has a unique story and challenge, and there are over 2000 possible combinations in the game.<br/><br/>When you have a complete trap, and a Billy card, you can say the iconic phrase &quot;I want to play a game&quot; and then challenge your opponent to try to escape your creation!<br/><br/>Your opponent has a choice: they can either take the sacrifice - a set amount of damage - or they can try to escape the trap using tool cards and search items. If they're prepared, they could get away without harm! However, if they get it wrong, things could get much worse...<br/><br/>SAW: The Jigsaw Trials has a unique jigsaw damage system. Each player has a character jigsaw, and they must swap their legs and arms for broken x-ray limbs as they take damage. Take too much, and they could lose the limb completely. When that happens, the player will lose blood each turn, and when all their blood is gone they are out!<br/><br/>The last player left standing is worthy of taking the name JIGSAW!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Stargrave supplement of exploration and adventure, full of strange and wonderful alien worlds, species, and technologies.<br/><br/>Just beyond the rim of what was once &lsquo;civilized space&rsquo; lies the vast, colourful expanse of the Crokoan Nebula. Seeking their fortunes, bold independent crews press deep into this largely unexplored sector. But the Ravaged Galaxy is a dangerous place, and the threats that crews face are not limited to those found on a planet&rsquo;s surface. In fact, more independent crews meet their ends in the dark void of space than are wiped out in gunfights. Black holes, asteroid fields, and even the legendary space kraken can all destroy a ship and its crew. It takes a deft hand on the controls, a sharp eye on navigation, and a bit of wizardry with the engines to fly between the stars.<br/><br/>This supplement for&shy; Stargrave focuses on the ships that serve as the crews&rsquo; transports, strategic headquarters, and homes, including new upgrades, a damage system, and rules for crew assignments such as piloting, gunnery, and navigation. New powers, soldiers, technology, and backgrounds for captains and first mates help reinforce crews, while rules for space encounters &ndash; dangerous, interesting, and potentially profitable incidents &ndash; and five new scenarios bring them face to face with strange alien species and other terrifying dangers in weird and wonderful locations, from unexplored planets to the depths of space.&shy;<br/><br/>",

Each of the 5 creatures has a special power to give you more control over your hand and card sets.<br/><br/>Strategic Choices:<br/><br/><br/>     Curate your hand by drawing from either the deck or discard piles.<br/>     Be careful which cards you discard, because other players may pick them up.<br/>     Select which creatures to play based on their powers and the sets you are trying to build.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow to PlayYour primary objective is to score points by building sets of creatures. A set is 3, 4, or 5 cards of matching colour or creature type. Each card may contribute to both a colour set and a creature set (e.g. Red Rabbit scores for both the Red and the Rabbit sets).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tYour TurnYou have a hand of cards. Play cards to the table to form sets. These sets score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw 2 cards from any piles (deck and/or discards).<br/>     Play 1 card to your sets.<br/>     Discard 1 card to your personal discard pile.<br/><br/><br/>When you play a card to a set, you may optionally use the creature's power.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCreature Powers<br/>     Rabbit: draw another card.<br/>     Dragon: score +1 for a set of Dragons.<br/>     Qilin: play another card. You need to discard a card to use this power.<br/>     Fox: snag a matching colour card from another player.<br/>     Tortoise: protect yourself from foxes. <br/><br/><br/>The Tortoise has an additional special power: you may play it out of turn if you have it in your hand when someone plays a matching Fox!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd Game &amp; ScoringThe first time the deck runs out, shuffle all discards into a new deck, and then play until the deck runs out again. (The game includes a Phase Card which helps keep track of the deck running out the first time). You then finish the round and everyone counts up their scores:<br/><br/><br/>     3-card set: 1 point<br/>     4-card set: 2 points<br/>     5-card set: 3 points<br/>     +1 point if you have a set of Dragons<br/><br/><br/>",

The  Operation objective was to arrest two of the faction leaders&rsquo; top advisors. Our brave US soldiers prepared for a quick 90-minute mission to fast-rope in, arrest the two advisors, and quickly get out. The mission was a success, as the two advisors were arrested. However, upon completion of this mission, the first Black Hawk Helicopter was shot out of the skies by an RPG. Shortly after, a 2nd Black Hawk was shot down by another RPG and what was supposed to be a 90-minute mission, turned into a 17-hour struggle.<br/><br/>This expansion shows how the men were not prepared for 17 hours of combat and the difficult situations they encountered in that time. This  expansion will do its best to honor those who lost their lives in this Operation by representing them as Soldier cards, and including the Medals they earned.<br/><br/>This expansion offers 112 cards including:<br/><br/><br/>     10 Player Soldiers <br/>     6 Non-Player Soldiers <br/>     4 Squad Soldiers <br/>     13 Weapons <br/>     6 Eqiupment<br/>     4 Missions<br/>     5 Objectives<br/>     14 Locations<br/>     12 Skills<br/>     9 Medals<br/>     29 Hostiles<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But after some twenty years of peace, in 1940 the storm clouds gather once more.<br/><br/>The Habsburg Fleet is the second book in our alternative history series, The Second Great War.  In the first book, The Kaiser&rsquo;s Navy, we looked at the High Seas Fleet of 1940 and its campaigns in the North Sea and Atlantic. In this new book, the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy, alongside its Turkish allies, wages war in the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces from the old, out-of-print Imperial &amp; Royal Navy booklet, and 75 brand-new laser-cut pieces (scorchless and sootless!) for 285 total: 135 double-sized &quot;long&quot; ship pieces and 150 standard-sized ones representing task forces, aircraft and smaller warships.  The Austro-Hungarian fleet that never was is present, along with French, British, Greek, Italian, German and Turkish ships, aircraft and airships.<br/><br/>There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged on the Mediterranean Sea in this alternate world, plus more of the story of the Second Great War first begun in The Kaiser's Navy.  This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bomb Alley and Black Sea Fleets to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The French victory confirmed their recovery from the mutinies spawned by the disastrous Nivelle Offensive fought over some of the same ground six months earlier.<br/><br/>In a six-day preliminary bombardment, French guns, with a three to one advantage, silenced most of their German counterparts and smothered German rear areas with dense gas to impeded German reinforcements. At 0515 on October 23, (zero hour) six divisions of the French XI, XIV, and XXI corps attacked on a 7.5-mile wide front. French infantry advanced in the predawn twilight behind an elaborate creeping barrage with 63 Schneider and Saint-Chamond tanks in support. Twenty-seven of the 63 tanks bogged before reaching the front line. A combination of German fire and mud stopped 15 more in no man's land.  Twenty-one French tanks (1/3rd of the starting total) actually made it to the German second position. The French 38th Division captured Fort de Malmaison and XXI Corps took Allemant and Vaudesson. From 24 to 25 October, XXI and XIV corps advanced while I Cavalry Corps came forward to exploit a hoped-for German collapse.<br/><br/>With specialized &ldquo;eingreif&rdquo; companies sprinkled all along the front, the Germans launched numerous local counterattacks. However, the French wave was inexorable.  Still, the German 7thArmy retired from the Chemin-des-Dames to the north bank of the Ailette in good order.<br/><br/>By October 26, the French had gained 3.5 miles in some places at a cost of only 12,000 casualties, far fewer than Germany&rsquo;s 38,000 and a significant improvement over the 30,000 French losses suffered in the same area during April&rsquo;s Nivelle Offensive. The French also bagged about 11,500 German prisoners. The Artillerie Sp&eacute;ciale proved its worth by smothering numerous German machine gun posts.<br/><br/>AA is the third volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles.

        "description": "Gomorra is a boomtown on the edge of California&rsquo;s Great Maze, that part of the coast that sunk into the water in 1863, creating a labyrinth of rock riddled with the super fuel known as ghost rock. Over the years, the town was destroyed time and again: by outlaws, demons, cultist fanatics, and more. Most recently, it was ravaged by the Fourth Ring Circus and the Sloane Gang.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, the deputies Xiong &ldquo;Wendy&rdquo; Cheng and Lucinda &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; Clover left for greener pastures. Unfortunately, the pastures they chose were Tombstone, Arizona. They arrived just in time to see the conflict between the Cowboys and Earps reach its fever pitch.<br/><br/>On top of that, the mysterious Bayou Vermilion Railroad had also set up shop in town, and Tombstone&rsquo;s been suffering its own supernatural problems.<br/><br/>And back in Gomorra, a familiar figure rides northward: Jonah Essex, a mysterious huckster associated with the worst events in Gomorra&rsquo;s recent years. He rides toward Deadwood, Dakota, and if the town knew what was good for them, they would fear his coming.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Factions of Sol, humanity launched an early space-age in 1927, spearheaded by Mark Megacore, CEO of MegaCore Inc. In the years following, factions grew their power in various regions of the solar system, establishing a tense but stable status quo&ndash;until Mark Megacore announced his retirement. Now, the mega-billionaire&rsquo;s entire fortune is at stake, and everyone in Sol is racing to earn it. You will take command of one of these 8 factions and do your best to bring them to victory. The path you choose is up to you&ndash;and could lead to unimaginable riches.<br/><br/>But like all things, accomplishing your mission is easier said than done. To impress Megacore, your ship must travel from planet to planet by spending energy onto the board. But moving into a sector costs energy equal to the amount already in the sector, plus one. Because the energy cost is exponential, the board locks down fast. And your ship can only recharge on one planet: Mercury. So while you may need to travel all the way to Neptune, you also need to make sure you can make it back.<br/><br/>Each player only gets one movement and action per turn. Actions include using Mars to upgrade your ship, obtaining explorers at Venus, picking up secret objectives at Saturn, and more. But many actions cost resources, which can only be mined from asteroids. Each round, a limited amount of asteroids are placed on the board. Getting to them before your competitors is key. When a player can&rsquo;t take a movement or an action, they must pass. When all players pass, the board is cleared of energy and the race to planets and resources begins again.<br/><br/>At the end of the third round, the game ends and you total up your victory points from machine upgrades, explored exoplanets, secret objectives, and resources. Knowing this, you may want to come up with a plan and stick to it. But just when you think you have your strategy figured out, a number of things might stand in your way&ndash; or help you cross the finish line.<br/><br/>Gameplay highights.<br/><br/>-Stellar events: Each round, players can vote between two game-changing options, each of which break the game in a new way. Make sure your favored event is chosen, or you may be left behind when it takes effect.<br/>-Orbiting planets: Throughout the game, the planets will orbit, mimicking the actual movement of planets in our solar system. Players can use them to perform well-planned slingshot maneuvers.<br/>-Faction abilities and machines: Each faction has a special ability and machine that changes the way they interact with the game. When used well, your faction ability and machine can give you a much-needed boost.<br/><br/>",

They can also be sent to the Jousting Field, influence the outcome and the King has more knowledge about the income. He can bet on the knight he expects to be the winner of the tournament. Plenty to choose from, but the interaction between the players is strong, since they influence the revenues for each other.<br/><br/>The specialists of the basic game, King of the Valley, have more up their sleeves, since the Priest can also brew and serve beer.

        "description": "Admiral's Order: Naval Tactics in the Age of Sail &ndash; All Hands! is a simulation of naval engagements between ships-of-the-line and frigates in the Age of Fighting Sail. The focus of the game lies on the wars between Britain and France and her allies in the years 1775 to 1815. Each player takes on the role of an admiral, commander or captain whose command could include a single ship or a fleet of several vessels. The core game (&quot;All Hands!&quot;) has five scenarios to choose from, everything from a small, fast and furious encounter between two frigates to a strategic action involving a total of 16 ships-of&ndash;the-line.<br/><br/>A game turn equates to a &frac12;-hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing maneuvers such as tacking, wearing, or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>In larger engagements, ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &quot;Line of Battle&quot;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.<br/><br/>Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat. In such situations, the game &quot;zooms&quot; into the action: Using a set of &quot;Close Action&quot; cards, players can employ grapeshot, grenades, carronades, and sharpshooters to wreak destruction on the opposing vessel's upper deck. Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>All scenarios can be played by two players, but most also provide the option to split command between two players per side. Playing time depends on the scenario. While an engagement between two frigates should last no more than 1-2 hours, fighting the Battle of Cape Henry will take four hours or longer.<br/><br/>The game is produced in a small edition and comes in a beautiful box, designed with a picture from Thomas Whitcombe. It has a wooden presentation box with 36 hand-crafted, wooden ship models. Each ship comes with removable masts and ship names burned into each side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>With Hostile Intent is a table-top starship combat game where players using fleets of starships, ranging from a few vessels to large squadrons, battle each other using strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>The game uses an inertia/vector based movement system and is hex-less - meaning ship placement and movement is not constrained to a location on a hex map or other specific playing surface. Movement and orientation are kept track of in three dimensions using a simple and intuitive (math-less) method of dealing with line of sight, along with easily understood indicators on the ship control sheets. Range determination is performed simply by measuring distance with a tape measure and checking a chart, to take into account altitude.<br/><br/>Damage is tracked through a common damage-box method with damageable systems individually represented, along with hit location charts on the ship control sheets. Weapon information is likewise available on the ship control sheets.<br/><br/>Aside from the 3D aspects of the game, here are some features in development which are not commonly found in starship combat games:<br/><br/>Computer Warfare - the ability for ships to infect enemy vessels with computer viruses, jam missile guidance systems, or even steal control of enemy weapons or systems.<br/><br/>Crew Levels - A ship may drop out of a fight if it takes too many losses to its crew.<br/><br/>Damage Control - Ships can make limited battlefield repairs, things like bringing a damaged weapon back online or getting a thruster to work again.<br/><br/>Fires - Ships can catch fire, fires can spread, and crew members can be sacrificed when fires are vented to space.<br/><br/>Fuel and cargo - Makes for a wider range of possible scenarios as well as a seamless tie-in to campaign games.<br/><br/>Adaptable Game System - While the game will provide its own exciting universe, from the ground up it is being designed with the intent that others can adapt it to their favorite universe with relative ease. Having this foundation will also give the game and its setting the ability to grow without the system falling apart or failing in some regard.<br/><br/>WHI will be consistent and predictable with its ability to simulate movement in space, but it will not be a rigid simulation or necessarily be mathmatically accurate. It will be relatively quick and easy to play but will not be simplistic. It will have a lot of detail suitable for a wide range of battle sizes as well as adaptation to other gaming applications (roleplaying, campaigns, etc), but will avoid being tedious or micromanagerial.<br/><br/>The goal is for the game to be fun to play, first and foremost.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Mikugames website:)<br/><br/>Officially the Lapland War started with the Finnish naval landing at Tornio (at the Swedish border) October 1st, 1944. This was a bold surprise attack in the Germans back, the former brother in arms. Since September 4th, 1944, Finland was no longer at war with the Red Army, as the so called Continuation War had ended. One tough part of the peace terms was, that all German units were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Because this was impossible, due to the fact that there was over 210.000 Germans in the northern Finland, the former brothers in arms had to fight each other under the supervision of the Soviet control commission. In the Barents Sea region, in an attempt to crush the German &ldquo;20.Gebirgs-Armee&rdquo; once and for all, the Soviet Army launched a large-scale attack called the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation. The last Germans left the Finnish soil in April, 1945.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>The final volume of the trilogy is an expansion, also loaded with a lot of extra features for the complete trilogy. In other words, to be able to fully use this package, ownership of both the earlier volumes is a requirement. The Lapland War game includes also the German operations &quot;Tanne West&quot; and &quot;Tanne Ost&quot; as well as the &quot;Birke&quot; and &quot;Nordlicht&quot; plans. The Lapland War game is divided in two separate battles, the one between the retreating Germans and Finnish units and the one between the German Mountain Corps and the Red Army north of the polar circle.<br/><br/>Unit Counters<br/>The game will include one countersheet in a total of 266 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.<br/><br/>The Mapboard<br/>No map is included in the Lapland War expansion.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/>A 8-page coloured rule booklet includes special rules for the Lapland War expansion.<br/><br/>Order of Battle (OOB)<br/>The three full-colour OOBs (Finnish, German and Soviet) include a Main Campaign and two Small Scenarios: (1) Tornio-Kemi '44, and (2) Petsamo-Kirkkenes '44. See further in the Beta News menu. A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.!<br/><br/>Production Volume<br/>300 boxed copies and 40 ziplock copies were produced.<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>    Main Campaign<br/>    2 Small Scenarios (#1 Petsamo-Kirkenes '44 and #2 Kemi-Tornio '44 [FIN vs. GER])<br/>    2 Special Scenarios (Tanne West and Tanne Ost '44)<br/>    Special feature to link Vol. 2 with Vol. 3. <br/><br/><br/>",

Indeed, other units of the Inner Sphere validate their prowess by surviving an encounter with the Dragoons. Among their ranks is Natasha Kerensky, known as the Black Widow, and perhaps the most romanticized MechWarrior in history.<br/><br/>The strategic and tactical knowledge of Jaime Wolf, the heart and soul of the Dragoons, is beyond reproach.<br/><br/>The unit's supplies and equipment are of the finest quality. Their 'Mechs never want for repair parts. Their ranks are closed and private.<br/><br/>Since appearing in the Inner Sphere in 3005, the Dragoons have been employed in turn by every house of the Successor States. No amount of money, political power, or threats have coerced them to renew a contract. Speculation and conjecture over their motives and origin are commonplace and wildly varied. Governmental intelligence and security networks have expended countless man-hours and C-bills trying to learn their secrets.<br/><br/>Now war consumes the Inner Sphere, and the Dragoons' contract with House Kurita has expired. Where they throw their support could determine the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>This ComStar document is the most accurate, up-to-date assemblage of information ever compiled about the Dragoons. Their history, organization, and unique membership are exposed in great detail. Find out the who, what, where, when and why(s) of the most powerful regiment in the Inner Sphere today.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>The true identity of Wolf's Dragoons is perhaps the biggest open secret in modern BattleTech, but at the time of writing this sourcebook was a detailed look at one of the biggest mysteries of the BattleTech game. One of the largest sourcebooks produced by FASA at the time of release, this book is packed with background detail on the history of the Dragoons in the Inner Sphere, their tactics and training, and details on a range of their equipment. This included a number of 'Mech designs which were unique to the Dragoon's at this point, such as the Imp and the Annihilator,<br/><br/>This sourcebook hasn't been reprinted to date, and the current licence holder for BattleTech hasn't announced any intention to do a reprint as at Jan 2011, making this something of a collector's item.<br/><br/>",

The key game mechanics are the avalanche of migration of lemmings that players often can not control (when number of lemmings reach critical max for a territory, they're starting to run all directions randomly). Well, usually, lemmings fall off a cliff, but not all die ...some fly away :)<br/><br/>There are 3 ways to win the game:<br/>1.

The two squads of the Dust Tactics: USMC Heavy Weapons Teams are veterans of many campaigns, men who remain fearless even when heavily outnumbered.<br/><br/>With their .50 cal machine gun, The Choppers serve primarily as defensive support for allied units. When placed in cover, or inside a building, The Choppers can work wonders!<br/><br/>The Leathernecks weapon team has traded its .50 cal. for a 120mm heavy mortar, one of the most reliable weapons you can find for harsh environments. The mortar never jams, is easy to clean, and can be quickly moved from place to place. It also delivers quite a punch!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Perfect Earth Explorer is a card game in which 2 players (ages 7+) get to introduce a rich variety of animals to their own Rainforest, which they first have to grow from a diversity of habitats.<br/><br/>At the start of each game, every player draws an explorer card with a unique mission. Players take turns, which typically consist of drawing a card and playing a card. Players will have to play Rainforest habitat cards before they can start to introduce animals to their Rainforest.<br/><br/>Certain habitat cards allow only certain animal categories to be introduced, whereas other habitat cards will allow any animal to be placed.<br/><br/>That brings us to the animal cards. We have included 36 animal cards in the game. There are 6 animal categories, each of which feature 6 animal cards. The category is specified with the help of a small icon.<br/><br/>12 of the 36 animals are in fact threatened animal species, indicated by the red circle behind the animal. Each animal card is worth a certain amount of points. Threatened species typically generate more points than common species. But placing an animal in its favorite habitat will also trigger bonus points, etc. To add some charm, we have included short facts on every animal card.<br/><br/>There is one more card type we have to introduce to you. We have included 12 event cards to make the game less predictable and to help balancing of the game. We believe the event cards are also a great way to add some extra emotion to the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players introduces a 10th species to his or her rainforest, at which time the point total of both players is calculated.<br/><br/>",

The most dangerous areas of the metropolis are in turmoil. The Chronomancer is destroying the Reality, it is your task to defeat her!&quot;<br/><br/>A team of fighters and experts is looking for OOPART - Out Of Place ARTifacts, and is ready to clash with the worst criminals of the Planet. That group of agents has dared defy the Chronomancer to restore the Reality and Time's order&quot;.<br/><br/>Chronomancer is a cooperative board game, for 2-6 players with a 1-3 hrs/game duration, set in metropolitan areas in hot-spot countries all around the world. Each player controls an Agent of the Chrono Team and has to complete the Mission of the game by recovering weapons, valuables and ancient artifacts. Moving through a scenario that simulates a dangerous city, Agents will fight against mercenaries, evil bosses, powerful creatures that came from the past, and sometimes with the Chronomancer too.<br/><br/>Different kinds of action are available for each Agent, such as melee, fire-arm attacks, technological tools and bombing raids.<br/><br/>The main feature of Chronomancer is the modular design of the board that allows creating countless environments and collision situations, offering a new game experience at every time.<br/><br/>Depending on the missions and on the related objective to be achieved, Chronomancer also suggests a multiple level game structure and an evolving plot. All the Agents get involved in the main quest that must be completed for the final Victory. Each Agent can earn honor points during the fulfillment of the mission, but will also have his/her own agenda of personal goals to be reached. If the main quest has been resolved, the Agent with the greater amount of honor points wins over everyone. Moreover, by following the numerical order of the main missions (Mission 1, Mission 2, etc.), you will discover the Chronomacer's plans, living a long adventure game by game. But you can also pick missions at random and play them on their own, with different sets and enemies every time.<br/><br/>A modular board, 10 mission, 8 characters, 4 bosses an several time themed creature and characters from the past grant an always new gaming experience and great longevity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Authored by three of the world&rsquo;s leading rules designers and Napoleonic historians, Revolution &amp; Empire marks an exciting new approach to grand-tactical miniatures gaming in the Age of the French Revolution and Napoleon (1792-1815). Refight the legendary battles of the period&ndash;Castiglione, Rivoli, Marengo, Austerlitz, Friedland, Borodino, Salamanca, Ligny, Waterloo&ndash;with this meticulously researched rules manual.<br/><br/>In Revolution &amp; Empire players take the role of the great commanders of the period such as Napoleon, Wellington, Blucher, Charles, Suvorov, Mass&eacute;na, and Lannes. Draw up your preliminary battle-plans in hopes of achieving your own decisive victory and watch as subordinates carry it to fruition. Revolution &amp; Empire reflects the intense friction of war during this era, as billowing smoke and thunderous cannonades obscured the battlefield and increased the intense confusion and pressures of battle, and even the best plans can go awry by the accidents of war. Skillful management of reserves plays a decisive role in determining the outcome, as fresh troops must be carefully preserved to respond to the inevitable crisis of the battle.<br/><br/>At the tactical level, players performing as division and corps commanders are faced with mastering the interaction of combined arms. No other period of history presents such a balance, as each arm&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses are dramatically highlighted. Perhaps as no system before, Revolution &amp; Empire demonstrates the evolution of tactics throughout the entire period, from the demise Frederick the Great&rsquo;s linear style of warfare to the development of a new tactical system for a new age. With Revolution &amp; Empire, players will also foster a new appreciation for the brilliant tactics of generals like Wellington and Davout, men who won astonishing victories against staggering odds.<br/><br/>Revolution &amp; Empire is also a valuable historical reference, as hundreds of generals and units are rated on their performance during the period in order to reflect their historical capabilities. Comprehensive rules reflect the many salient aspects of Napoleonic and Revolutionary combat, including massed skirmishers, grand batteries, fatigue, savage town fighting, bridge assaults, weather, and ammunition supply. Whether re-fighting the famous battles, or recreating the scores of smaller actions from the period, Revolution &amp; Empire elegantly reflects warfare in this fascinating and turbulent period of military history.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve been traveling the roads for days, haggard and worn, you find yourself in a small quite town that seems almost abandoned.   You make your way to the local inn and settle down for a nice hot meal when suddenly the door to the inn bursts open and what looks to be the local blacksmith calls out, &ldquo;Derek&rsquo;s farm on the outskirts of town has been attacked and the entire family has been slaughtered!&rdquo;  Never one to shy away from danger you walk over to the distraught blacksmith and ask about the family and what happened.  He tells you of a giant Red Dragon that has been terrorizing the town; sending out his minions to attack the town folk and raid for supplies.  These monsters seem to be coming from a dungeon just outside of town and there&rsquo;s nothing the town folk can do about it. The blacksmith tells you that he has heard of riches beyond imagination within the dungeon but also monsters of unspeakable evil.   After getting the location of the dungeon entrance you return to your party and talk excitedly about the current situation of the town and the Red Dragon.  Again, never one to walk away from a good adventure, although this would be considered your first, your party agrees to find this dungeon, destroy the dragon and all its minions forever!  <br/>   With everyone in agreement you procure a room for the night and settle in with visions of hundreds of screaming villagers chanting your name and praising your heroisms for killing the mighty red dragon and saving the town.   Yet it doesn&rsquo;t take long for a slight chill to run down your spine as your vision turns dark and terrifying with the sight of a massive red dragon and it&rsquo;s all-consuming, breath of molten fire engulfing the entire party and turning everyone to ash!    You quickly shake off the nightmarish vision and tightly close your eyes because tomorrow the adventure of your life begins!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dungeon Hack &ndash; The Dice Game: is a Solo Dice chucking, Dungeon crawling, Dice Placement, character advancing, card game.  You&rsquo;ll take [4] first-time adventurers&rsquo; [Fighter, Cleric, Thief, and Wizard] through a randomly generated dungeon with Rooms, Junction Rooms, Corridor Rooms and Corridors.   You&rsquo;ll have to organize your party with two characters in front and two in back just how you would normally travel in a 10&rsquo; wide dungeon corridor.  The [4] &ldquo;Multi-level&rdquo; Character cards allow YOU to decide your party&rsquo;s order. This creates Front Line attackers/defenders as well as second line defenders.  Your characters will advance to the next level once they&rsquo;ve accumulated enough experience killing monsters. <br/>You&rsquo;ll explore dungeon corridors and rooms, fight monsters, try to avoid and disarm traps, discover gold and magical items, and complete quests.  Each turn you will roll the dice, evaluate your choices and perform your actions; destroying monsters, resolving traps and traveling deeper and deeper into the depths of the dungeon till you finally reach the ultimate goal &ndash; The Giant Red Dragon.<br/>If you can stay alive and escape the dungeon with at least three of your party members, you earn the right to live as heroes; enjoying the spoils of victory. <br/>Lose two or more of your party and you lose the game; becoming the next tragic story told at the local inn of a group of intrepid heroes seeking adventure and glory who never returned from the Red Dragon dungeon.<br/><br/>NOTE:  I would like to thank Tony Go for creating his game Deep Space D6 which not only inspired me to create Dungeon Hack but has help in some of the game play mechanics.  I have been given the ok from Tony Go to use some of the game mechanics within Dungeon Hack: The Dice Game.<br/><br/>",

Bursting out of the ground, it lashes out with its gigantic arms to claw and smash the Heroes, biting off the heads of its most unlucky victims and feeding on the spray of blood that erupts from their necks. The Odokuro is a terrifying beast to behold and the Heroes will need all of their courage to battle their way close enough to the creature to get past its bony defenses. This monstrous XXL Enemy Pack is themed for the Forest of the Dead OtherWorld (as well as the Forbidden Fortress World) and includes the giant-sized Odokuro miniature, Enemy Record Sheet, 1 Mission, and all of the cards needed to add this frightening fiend to your games of Shadows of Brimstone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They will use the gravity of planets as a &ldquo;slingshot&rdquo; to get a boost in speed and reduce fuel consumption.<br/><br/>Two military forces fight for control of the solar system, and slingshot maneuvers are very important to their strategies. Ships equipped with advanced stealth technology are only visible when they fire their boosters. Therefore, firing your rockets out of site of the enemy, and using slingshot maneuvers to conduct attacks on unsuspecting enemies can be absolutely devastating.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Casting powerful Dark Sermons at the Heroes, and wielding a devastating Hellfire Shotgun, the Heretic Preacher and his hordes will put your Heroes to the test!<br/><br/>A Challenge Pack is a new themed set of cards with a terrifying new Enemy and a nightmarish new Mission designed to give the Heroes an extra challenge. These cards are all used together for the included Mission; but can also be added to your card decks to increase the challenge across your normal games of Shadows of Brimstone as well. Many of these new cards are marked with a Challenge Icon, to be easily identified as extra dangerous.<br/><br/>Challenge Packs reward players for having a robust collection of Enemies and Expansions; and contain several Threat cards that include a mix of various Enemies from across the game. Some of these Threat cards even add new bonus ability to the Enemies on the card for thematic ways that they can work together to crush the Heroes.<br/><br/>The following Expansions are highly recommended to get the most out of this Challenge Pack (though these sets are not required to use this Supplement, most of the Threat cards included in this Challenge Pack do use various Enemies from these other Expansions):<br/><br/><br/>     Swamps of Death core set<br/>     Hellfire Succubi mission pack<br/>     Hell Vermin enemy pack<br/>     Scourge Rats and Rats Nest enemy pack<br/>     Forest of the Dead OtherWorld deluxe expansion<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These fearsome Nepalese fighters have deservedly earned a near-legendary reputation of being some of the fiercest and bravest warriors in battle: esteemed by their allies and dreaded by their enemies, and respected by all alike. They are easily recognized by their signature weapon - the long, curved knife known as the kukri - and their motto is &quot;Better to die than to be a coward.&quot;<br/><br/>This set adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII North Africa game, although the Gurkhas historically fought in every theatre of war and can be played with any Warfighter WWII setting.

To do this, players will move their creatures on a board made up of hexagons, then it will be up to them to make the most of the map to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Each player will be able to construct their deck and choose a specific Board that represents their half of the battlefield, once the two players connects their halves the game can start! Both players will then place their Emanation portals and Leaders.<br/><br/>During their turn, players will be be able to:<br/><br/>- Play a card from their hand (Creature or Spell) for 1 Energy Point.<br/>- Move a creature on the board.<br/>- Attack or Activate a Special Ability.<br/>- Draw a Card for 1 Energy Point.<br/><br/>Most of the Creatures will attack and move by the adjacent hexagon but this range can be increased thanks to spells and Special Ability like Throw or Overfly.<br/><br/>First Player that deactivates the 3 Emanation Portals of the opponent wins the game!<br/><br/>Each Creature is unique so during the Deck Construction phase before a match it will be crucial to choose the best combination of Creatures and Spells even of different Temen.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players choose one of four heroes to venture out and kill these monsters, bringing back the trophies of their victories as proof for their bounties. Each player takes a turn performing their chosen action to ultimately gain the most victory points (VP). VP can be acquired by gaining Treasure, using Opportunities, and mainly by killing monsters. There are four classic villains that players may choose to go up against: Master Vampire, Alpha Werewolf, Zombie Horde, and Pharoah Mummy. Each villain&rsquo;s deck is comprised of their minions to help drive the story.<br/><br/>From the Shadows is a turn based, light deck builder. Heroes begin the game with a deck of 15 cards, tailored to their abilities. During the game players can loot more cards from monsters they vanquish, building their deck and making their hero stronger. The final Villain is more difficult than his minions and basic monsters. Once a player kills the Villain the game is over and points are tallied.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Their goal is to save the Earth from destruction by extraterrestrial Titans. Each of the four Titans has its own agenda and requires a specific strategy to be overcome.<br/><br/>Each round, one heroine or hero is the leader, and the remaining heroines and heroes are sidekicks. The leader rolls three dice, and each sidekick rolls one die. This allows everyone to be part of the action at all times and prevents downtime. The dice rolled then trigger the specific actions of the heroines and heroes such as movement, attack or healing. A Titan card is then drawn, which represents the Titan's actions and sinister plans, and brings new challenges for the TDO's heroines and heroes. For example, the Titan can inflict damage directly, or assert its influence on the world through markers. This sequence continues until one side wins the game.<br/><br/>The heroines and heroes win the game when they have destroyed the Titan. The Titan wins when it has either destroyed all three TDO bases, or when a total of three heroines and heroes have been defeated.<br/><br/>TDO lives from the colorful combination of Titans like the lava snail Worldshaper and the diverse heroines and heroes like the chameleon panda duo Barry &amp; Nala, the invisible DJ Kamo Flash, or the awakened demolition robot RAM32. This mix makes each game unique and good teamwork is mandatory to prevail against the super-powerful Titans. The accessible rules make it easy to get started in the game and the heroines and heroes can be individually specialized by upgrades.<br/><br/>TDO is a very varied, entertaining game with witty heroines and heroes who cunningly combine their actions to save the Earth from extinction by the Titans.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Come and join them!<br/><br/>In this game you will be filling the crossword grid with made-up words of the indicated length and required letters in them. The more set conditions you fulfill, the sooner you win! To make the game even more fun and exciting, use the powers of Cruxy and other animals ― their special effects may influence other players and bring you closer to success at the same time.<br/><br/>Four different game modes, fifty double-sided boards of increasing complexity and a unique combination of literacy and strategy make Cruxy a new word in the world of board games!<br/><br/>How to play?<br/><br/>The game is played by turns so players have some time to think over their options and come up with the word of the needed length, with the required letters, or a symbol occupied by the word. All the objections are marked on the playing board. Remember that you can only add a word to the grid using one or more letters already placed in the grid. Also the words to fill in should meet the criteria: a) a word cannot be used twice, b) proper nouns are prohibited, etc. Check the full list in the rules!<br/><br/>Once a player wrote down a word and crossed the things they used out from their box, it's the player's from their left turn.<br/><br/>To make the game even more fun, reach Cruxy's friends, different animals of the South Pole for the special effects they create! These effects may boost your own success or influence other players. <br/>For example, there is a Seagul that allows a player to use shorter or longer words for a moment, or a Kraken that pulls out an extra letter for your opponents, and many other creatures with their own power.<br/><br/>The player who fulfilled all the tasks but any 2 of any kind becomes the winner.<br/><br/><br/>     Add new words to the grid and fulfil different conditions.<br/>     Apply animals&rsquo; effects at the right moment to influence the game play.<br/>     Be the first to cross out the most conditions in your player area and win the game!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The sushi production and distribution in the city of Mininogata is controlled by several feline clans. Leading those clans is the Kumichō, supreme leader of the syndicate, but he is now an old cat and soon will have to decide who will succeed him.<br/><br/>In Neko Syndicate you will lead one of those clans and you will prove the Kumichō who deserves to inherit his position, building an efficient chain of command and fulfilling the great amount of sushi demanded by the population. In addition, you will be rewarded if you are the fastest to achieve the missions by the Kumichō.<br/><br/>During the game you will build and walk down a card&rsquo;s pyramidal structure which represents both a city district under your control and your chain of command. This pyramidal structure will be used as a board and action tree which will allow you to cook sushi and transport it into different delivery zones, trying to achieve the missions by the supreme leader. You will have 15 turns to obtain as many prestige points as possible to please the supreme leader Kumichō and, therefore, win the game.<br/><br/>Neko Syndicate is a &quot;Thinky-filler&quot; by Dani Garc&iacute;a, featuring an innovative tableau building mechanic where cards are both the actions and the goals to achieve: fast set-up, simultaneous play, low interaction and brain burner in a 30 minutes easy to play hard to master beautiful game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is an Expansion for Death Ride Kursk - Gross Deutschland.  Ownership of DRK-GD is required in order to play this game.  This will be the second in the series of games that simulate the battle to eliminate the Kursk Salient.  This game is an expansion game and players must own DRK-GD in order to play this game.  The 3rd Panzer Division held the left flank of XLVIII Panzer Korps and plays a major role in the crossing of the Pena River and keeping the pressure off the Gross Deutschland Divisions left flank so they can push north to Oboyan and Kursk.   This game expands the order of battle by 1 Panzer and 1 Infantry Division, 1 Tank Corps, and a Rifle Division.  Most of the maps from DRK-GD are reused in this game and an additional (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections are added along with about 500 additional unit counters and markers.<br/><br/>Death Ride Kursk - 3rd Panzer is GSI's second offering on the Eastern Front. The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during the German attack at Kursk in July 1943.<br/><br/>The game features the 3rd Panzer Division and some supporting XLVIII Panzer Corps units at mostly Platoon and some Company/Battery level and the Red Army (10th Tank Corps, and other rifle and supporting elements) at Company/Battery level. The combat system utilizes combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. Each hex is 330 meters.  Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night.   The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.  Unlike other games at this level the rules are not massive.  This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement.  These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.  Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.  Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.  Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.  Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).  These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.  They also effect targets differently.   Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.  Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.  Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.  The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle.   The division operated on the left flank of the Gross Deutschland Division.   The additional armor in this game makes play extremely fun and intense and they include Panzer Regiment 6 (90 MkIII and IV tanks) and 10th Tank Corps 3 Tank Brigades (120 T34 and 60 T70 tanks).  3rd Panzer has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.  The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply.   Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.  Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.  Lots of these casualties are minor in nature and both sides worked hard to get these wounded back to the front quickly.  Air-Ground Attack can have a significant effect on the battle and both sides have a capability in the air to affect the battle.  The Germans were eventually bled white and forced to suspend Citadel.<br/><br/>This 3rd Panzer division game fits into the DRK-GD game framework by being primarily a reinforcement in that game and replacing the 3rd Panzer battalion counters that simply fill the void and help cover the extended left flank of GD.<br/><br/>3rd Panzer - comes with (in Full Color):<br/><br/>        (4) Map Sections of the Pena River Area of Operations (maps A1 to A4)<br/>        Supplemental Rules Specific to 3rd Panzer<br/>        Order of Battle Cards<br/>        Task Organization Charts for Each Major German and Red Army Formation<br/>        Approximately 1800 Unit Counters and Markers<br/><br/><br/>",

Take turns around a table, stacking one block per turn. Blocks may be placed in any direction or orientation, but once played in the tower, the blocks cannot be moved or repositioned.

        "description": "Raiders is a game of surviving and gathering resources in order to gain supremacy within a post apocalyptic world of ruin. Each player takes on the role of a Clan who have been surviving within the wastes for the past four years. When a Death Cult set upon eradicating all remaining life within the wastes descend upon the Clans&rsquo; homeland, they must gather all the resources they can in order to survive.<br/><br/>The aim of Raiders is to be the last player in the game, or have earned the most points by the end of the tenth turn.<br/>Each Player&rsquo;s Clan has their own base that they are trying to protect and grow by gathering more resources. Players develop these bases by sending their Raiders to the 11 different locations that represent the wastes. The locations each player&rsquo;s Raiders are going to that turn are all revealed at the same time, meaning encounters between Raiders are always a surprise. At the end of each phase, those Raiders who survive are able to return to their base with the spoils they have recovered. Players then use the resources they have obtained to build new items upon their base that improve their performance in the rest of the game.<br/><br/>During encounters between Raiders, there are specific rules for Raiders to negotiate rather than simply battling each time. However if players are unable or unwilling to negotiate with one another, a round of combat can quickly break out. Combat rounds are fast paced and easy to follow so as not to overtake the gathering element of the game.<br/><br/>Not simply content with scrounging the wastes for more resources, Raiders can attack enemy bases in an attempt to wipe enemy factions out and gather more resources from their ruins. Each side must therefore be vigilant or risk losing all that they have amassed.<br/><br/>",

So, it's not necessary acquiring the full expansion if only an specific kingdom is wanted.<br/><br/>If you like classic Card Games mechanics but want something really NEW, and a true new strategic component which will make you develop your strategies at a higher level, this is your game.<br/><br/>Both players start with 20 life points, and our goal is reducing opponent's life to 0 or below. But to achieve that we need to cast our troops in our invocation line (first line)and cross with them all the battlefield, fighting enemy troops to reach their lines and &quot;hit&quot; them equal to our troops ATK value. As said, 20 points means victory. The fact troops need to move makes them have an unusual basic value: they have ATTACK/LIFE and SPEED (number of zones -cells- they can run in a turn).<br/><br/>But troops, objects and the rest of cards aren't played for free. It's fundamental to produce mana and gold for that. With this purpose, we will build &quot;Place&quot; cards with a cost and production amount. So, each turn we will add mana and gold equal to 1 plus the production indicated by our place cards. A good curve in resources production means a good match development, and that will make us stronger.<br/><br/>Important: place cards are separated from &quot;battle cards&quot; (the rest: troops, objects, spells...), for us to choose what we want to draw each turn.<br/><br/>In a players' phase, they prepare all &quot;turned&quot; (exhausted) cards, add resources, build places, invoke troops or forge objects, then go to tactical phase, in which they can move troops one by one, cast spells, play hero skills, equip objects, fight against enemy troops or hit enemy player.<br/><br/>Sudden spells can be also played in response to opponent's actions, in order to disable their strategy.<br/><br/>A 1vs1 game which would charm any card+strategy game lover.<br/><br/>We summarize it with a single sentence: <br/>END OF GAME. CHALLENGE BEGINS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Dawn of the Battleship simulates naval warfare from 1890 up to 1904, just before technology began to quickly change in the years leading up to WW I. During this period, there are no all-big-gun battleships, aircraft, gun directors, or radios. In the 1890s, 1,500 yards was considered effective range, and 3,000 yards was long range. If you've played other naval games, you'll have to get in real close if you want to hit.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Battleship gives the player a taste of what it was like to command a ship or formation during a late 19th/early 20th century sea battle. A player with little or no experience in naval combat can quickly learn the basic principles of naval warfare, and use them in the game to fight and win. Tactics that worked in history will work in this game.<br/><br/>It can not only to recreate famous naval engagements such as the battles of Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba, but also the myriad of &ldquo;almost&rdquo; battles between the rapidly growing fleets of Europe, Japan, and America.<br/><br/>If you have played other Admiralty Trilogy games, this one uses the same terms and game system as the others (Harpoon, Command at Sea, and Fear God &amp; Dread Nought). That makes it easy to learn and you know it will be accurate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After having a future sight and still aiming for justice to reign around the world, Bruce Wayne made official the creation of a new international organization founded by Wayne Enterprises: Batman Incorporated. This super-heroes network, chosen by the Dark Knight himself, wages a battle against crime all over the world, shares information and provides help to one another. The vigilante therefore became famous worldwide. This notoriety brought to his cause other vigilantes, like El Gaucho, the Nightrunner, the Knight, Chief Man-of-Bats accompanied by Raven Red, the Dark Ranger, Batman of Japan, Batman of Moscow and many others&hellip; <br/>Through this organization, Batman managed to set up a plan against the mysterious institution called Leviathan.<br/><br/>During a character&rsquo;s creation, our teams think of them as the comics describe them. Once the profile has been set up, our teams check if it fits what we want the character to do and if their role is the one we defined for them. There are several modifications along the playtests to adjust the different characteristics, skills&hellip; Once a hero (in the case of the Batman Inc. Expansion) is validated, they are tried in missions as replacement of heroes of equivalent roles. Numerous playtests of the many possible team composition for the heroes then occur, before making the hero fit without breaking the mission up.<br/><br/>Each miniature from this expansion can be played as another choice of hero in missions of the corebox. Therefore, the heroes will have much more choice than they already had. For example, Dark Ranger will be another possible choice of hero in the mission &laquo; An Icy Welcome &raquo;, and he can also be picked as 2nd hero in &laquo; To Sink a City &raquo;&hellip; The Knight will make a good replacement for the 1st hero in &laquo; Biological Scourge &raquo;. Chief Man-of-Bats as well as Raven Red in &laquo; A Golden Opportunity &raquo;, and so on&hellip;<br/><br/>Each of those heroes owns one or several equipment cards related to them. 5 new bat gadgets are also included to be added and bring more choice to the already consequent amount of bat gadgets, offering new possibilities to players.<br/><br/>Batman of Japan<br/> Batman (the one from Gotham City) maintains a network of correspondents around the world who use crime fighting techniques similar to his own. In Japan, Mister Unknown&mdash;a vigilante of who trained a promising young man named Osamu&mdash;took up the mantle. But tragically, Mr. Unknown was killed before Osamu&rsquo;s training was finished. After Batman and Osamu fought together, Bruce Wayne came to support Osamu as Batman of Japan. Osamu may still be young, but he is an excellent detective and a martial arts expert. Though sometimes duty calls him elsewhere, as member of Batman Inc. his primary responsibility is protecting Japan. <br/>Gameplay<br/> That martial art expert is a great fighter capable of competing with Batman himself. He excels in hacking and is able to move wherever he wants, as heights do not frighten him at all. <br/> In Adventure Mode, he can show up with his teammate, Lolita Canary. This flying small version of Black Canary has got a good breath and is able to neutralize her opponents through ultrasounds. <br/>Versus Power<br/>Lolita Canary: Batman of Japan uses his girlfriend&rsquo;s blast to neutralize his enemies.<br/><br/>Batman of Moscow<br/> Batman Incorporated was Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s attempt to extend the Club of Heroes into major cities around the world. It was his belief that Batman could become a symbol of justice that defied borders. Crime fighters from all over the globe were equipped with their own variations of the iconic Batsuit. As one might expect, these new Batmen were as varied as the nations in which they fought. Ravil, the Batman of Moscow, was no exception. To wage a war on crime in the streets of the Russian capital was no easy task; it called for a brutal fighter&mdash;one whose methods differed from his American counterpart&rsquo;s. Subtlety wasn&rsquo;t going to work. <br/>Gameplay <br/>He's a demolition expert, and therefore knows everything about explosives. Would it be to throw grenades of arm and disarm explosive engines, he is second to none. <br/> In Adventure Mode, he accomplishes his missions with an incendiary grenade, which spreads fire while exploding. This makes him sure no one will stand against him. <br/>Versus power <br/>Demolition expert: Batman of Moscow can clear an area close to him by triggering an explosion (level 2) there that leaves one flame token. Or he can destroy a wall thanks to his explosive devices.<br/><br/>Chief Man-of-bats<br/> Dr. William Great-Eagle, aka Man-of-Bats, understands that being a hero is about more than just beating the bad guys. William is a Chief of the Dakota Sioux and a pillar of his community. He is ceaselessly dedicated to providing social and medical assistance to those in need and a long-time member of the Club of Heroes. During the Infinite Crisis, he helped heal Bl&uuml;dhaven&rsquo;s wounded. With his son and sidekick &ldquo;Raven Red&rdquo;, he joins the Club of Heroes. Wanting to take his philanthropic actions a step further, he also became a member of Batman Inc. <br/>Gameplay<br/> He is a true support character. Helping others or sacrificing himself for them not to be wounded, he can recover, slowly, because of his knowledge in traditional and native American medicine. <br/> Chief Man-of-Bats owns two equipment cards. A tomahawk that can be used during melee fights, or than he can throw (but he then loses it). He also has a medicine man&rsquo;s bag, with which he can go beyond his limits for a time. <br/>Versus power<br/>Duo: Chief Man-of-Bats always works with his sidekick Raven Red, recruited as his lieutenant. They heal themselves (up to 2 lifepoints each) when the event tile is activated, and Raven Red performs his small attacks against opponents in his line of sight.<br/><br/>Dark Ranger<br/> As a member of Batman Inc., Dark Ranger battles crime in the &lsquo;Land Down Under&rsquo;. Originally, Australia had its own heroic duo similar to Batman and Robin known as Ranger and Scout. But when Ranger was killed, Scout (John Riley) took over lead duties and became Dark Ranger. After the death of his mentor, John Riley became violent, but Batman made sure to check the younger man&rsquo;s direct and sometimes extreme methods. Dark Ranger is not only a formidable fighter but also an excellent tracker&mdash;a useful skill to have when investigating crimes. <br/>Gameplay<br/> Always willing to save the widow and the orphan, never would he hesitate to sacrifice himself for others. Good investigator, he is always gifted with explosives. All he lacks he can find in his utility belt that he never gets rid of. <br/> The Dark Ranger is heavily equipped. He can carry a jet pack; therefore, he may move free like air. He also owns an electric gun that can stun his opponents. <br/>Versus power<br/>Stun: Thanks to his weapon that generates electrical pulses, he can put a &ldquo;stun&rdquo; token on a villain&rsquo;s tile. This tile will have a higher cost the next time it is played.<br/><br/>El Gaucho<br/>Santiago Vargas is a man of mystery. He once worked for the covert operations agency known as Spyral, but eventually followed Batman&rsquo;s example and joined the Club of Heroes, an international group of vigilantes. <br/> Though Santiago is without superpowers, he arms himself with knives, bolas and a grim determination. He occasionally teams up with others, but his operations are usually confined to Argentina and other parts of South America. <br/>Gameplay <br/>El Gaucho tends to be Batman&rsquo;s equal. He&rsquo;s a great fighter, would it be in melee or distance fight, he performs combos when fighting, and can counterattack. His past experiences granted him investigation and munition specialist skills. He is a true hero now. <br/> El Gaucho is a bolas master. He can throw them at a long distance and shackle any opponent. <br/>Versus power<br/>Gaucho bolas: El Gaucho uses his favorite weapon and can inflict severe damages. If the target isn&rsquo;t neutralized, they become immobilized.<br/><br/>Nightrunner<br/>In the wake of a deadly riot in the Paris suburbs, a vigilante rose up to defend the weak and vulnerable. To accomplish this mission, Bilal Alsselah employed his mastery of parkour&mdash;a means of traversing urban environments with spontaneous and dynamic acrobatics. The Dark Knight took notice of his exceptional skills and recruited him for Batman Incorporated. Bilal has since expanded his area of operations and has become Nightrunner, the dedicated protector of Paris, France. <br/>Gameplay<br/> The french Batman is the master of parkour. No heights can frighten him, no jump, nothing. He is unstoppable, too agile for anyone to catch him, and also difficult to target from a distance. <br/> The Nightrunner has a taser that grants him a higher power in hand-to-hand fights. <br/>Versus power <br/>Parkour master: The event tile doesn&rsquo;t cost any Activation Potential Disk to activate and the Nightrunner performs a movement.<br/><br/>Raven Red<br/> Charles Great Eagle, aka Raven Red, son of Chief Great Eagle, leader of the Dakota Sioux. Charles is a member of both the Club of Heroes and Batman Inc. Being a young man, he is more impulsive than his father and longs to enter the big league by taking on the serious super-villains rather than assisting his community. He and his father were the targets of the evil organization known as Leviathan. They also helped fight the Black Glove. Regardless of these lofty ambitions, when it comes to trouble on the reservation, Charles passionately solves challenges with his two greatest weapons: his fists. Put a bow in his hands and he is an expert shot to boot. <br/>Gameplay<br/> Raven Red is out of anyone&rsquo;s league when using his bow. But as impetuous as he is, he doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to use his fists when the situation calls for it. <br/> He never goes without his bow and is quick to retaliate when taken by surprise. <br/>Versus power <br/>Duo: Raven Red is never far from his father, so Chief Man-of-Bats is recruited as lieutenant. When the event tile is activated, the Leader and his lieutenant regenerate (up to 1 lifepoint each), then Raven Red shoots the sharpest arrow he owns.<br/><br/>The Knight<br/>Knight and Squire were English crime fighters similar to Batman and Robin. But unlike the Dynamic Duo, these two were inspired by the heraldry of the medieval era. Cyril Sheldrake is the modern version of Knight and a colleague of Batman. Being of a heroic dynasty, Sheldrake sometimes doubts Batman&rsquo;s methods, but the two share a mutual trust. Regardless, he can always count on his trusted Squire to help him. Knight also has a tenacious set of armor for when he must endure the inevitable hard knocks that come with fighting crime.<br/>Gameplay<br/> He is a living swiss army knife, adapting himself to every situation he bumps into. This athlete is capable of astonishing prowess despite his heavy armor that protects him. Just like Batman, he is a seasoned investigator.<br/> Equipped with this gauntlet, lockpicking becomes easy for him, as well as hacking into computers. <br/>Versus power <br/>Squire support: Have you ever seen a knight without a squire? They are never apart. The event gives the hero player a token that grants one of their character the luck skill level 2 for an action, because of the Squire coming to the rescue.<br/><br/>5 new bat gadgets<br/> The 5 bat gadgets you will find in this expansion will offer you new gameplay possibilities: <br/>Artificer Gel: This bat gadget is really helpful when it comes to disarming bombs or any explosives. <br/>Adrenaline Shot: Need to perform more actions, to go further than what you were capable of? Push your limits with this one-use adrenaline shot.<br/>Sharp Batarang: This new batarang will always inflict damages&hellip; as long as you don&rsquo;t aim too far from your target.<br/>Electric Batarang: Another batarang, capable of neutralizing the most enduring opponents.<br/>Strenghtened Armor: A new piece of equipment made of a new alloy, more efficient in melee fights.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quantified is a co-operative board game set in a world in which everyone's behavior is constantly surveilled and analyzed. A player's behavior results in a social credit score, determining their position on the social ladder. Players start from different positions on the social ladder, as refugee, unemployed or employed, with unequal access to human rights. The goal of the game is to make all rights accessible to all players and to fight the implementation of totalitarian policies.<br/><br/>During a typical turn, players can move around the city, add non-player-characters to their network, attempt to solve so-called rally cards (initiatives that support human equality), attempt to prevent so-called threat cards (automatic, constantly approaching negative effects, such as invasive amendments, correction camps or totalitarian laws), or even simply work an official or illegal job. The trick is that not every action can be taken by every player. For example, those without the right to movement take longer to cross the city, while those without the right to free speech can't share their rally cards with others &mdash; and even the actions you can take must be taken with care as all actions leak personal data. If too much data is leaked, the players may have to face behavior analysis cards that negatively impact their collective game state!<br/><br/>Ultimately, by solving enough rally cards or working their way up the social ladder, every player should have access to all four human rights. Once this is done, the players win! But if three totalitarian laws come into effect before then or the threat deck runs out, the players collectively lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two iconic characters join the ranks of the X-Men with this character pack for Marvel: Crisis Protocol! Born with a power that is both blessing and curse, the mutant Rogue can absorb the powers and memories of anyone she touches. This remarkable but devastating power allows her to wield the abilities of her foes but leaves them depleted&mdash; or worse. Prolonged contact with her skin drains the vital energy from those she touches. Afraid to harm those close to her, Rogue fled her past life. A runaway from the American South, she started her career as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants under Mystique before joining the X-Men to fight on the side of good.<br/><br/>Remy LeBeau is Gambit, a dashing scoundrel with the mutant power to accelerate the molecular energy of an object, transforming mundane items into kinetically-charged explosives. Raised by a gang of New Orleans street thieves, Gambit is a master thief and former member of the Thieves&rsquo; Guild. Forced into the employ of the Marauders, Gambit had an unwitting hand in the destruction of the Morlocks. Wracked by guilt, his life of wandering ended when he met Storm and him finding a new family as one of the X-Men. Now fighting to protect others, he dishes out punishment with his bo staff and trademark playing cards. With a little kinetic enhancement, Gambit always has the winning hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
