        "description": "NMBR 9 ++ includes four sets of numbers 0-9, as well as twenty number cards (0-9 twice), so with this box you can play NMBR 9 with only two players. Alternatively, if you already have NMBR 9, you can now play the game with up to six players at once.<br/><br/>NMBR 9 ++ also includes expansion components that you can use with this box or with the original NMBR 9 game or with both combined. You have six different starting tiles, for example, with each player taking one at random before the game begins, which makes it impossible for players to build in the same patterns as one another.<br/><br/>You can give each player two &quot;gap filler&quot; tiles &mdash; one that is a single square and a second that is two squares long. You can use one or both at any point in the game when you're placing a number tile.<br/><br/>You can deal out two of the six &quot;rule breaker&quot; cards, then give each player two cubes in a different color. During the game, if you want to use a &quot;rule breaker&quot; card &mdash; e.g., move a tile previously placed, place the current tile upside down, or reserve the tile for placement later &mdash; place one of your cubes on the card, then use its power. You can use each card only once.<br/><br/>Finally, NMBR 9 ++ includes variant rules that can be used with 1-4 players. In &quot;2 out of 3&quot;, you create a deck of thirty cards (0-9 thrice) and put all of the number tiles on the table. Each round, you reveal three cards one by one. Each player can place the first number tile revealed or refuse it; if they refuse it, they must place the next two number tiles; if they place it, they must refuse one of the next two tiles. In the end, everyone will place twenty number tiles, as in the basic game.<br/><br/>In &quot;Level to Level&quot;, shuffle all forty cards into a deck, place all number tiles on the table, and lay out new tokens numbered 0-4. For the first two turns, draw a card and placed it under 0; each player must place this number tile in front of them following the usual rules. For the third turn, flip a card into both the 0 slot and 1 slot; the tile showing under 0 can be placed only on the ground level and the tile under 1 can be placed only on the first level. You can refuse to place either or both tiles.<br/><br/>Once a player has two tiles on the first level, next turn flip a card under slots 0, 1, and 2, with the latter number tile being placed only on the second level. Continue play until the deck runs out or you can't flip enough cards to start a turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hornet Leader II is based on the original award-winning design published by GMT Games back in 1991.<br/><br/>Like the original game, Hornet Leader II - Marine Air is designed from the ground up as a solitaire game.<br/><br/>The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a modern day squadron of Marine AV-8 Harrier fighters.<br/><br/>It features AV-8s, more pilots, and campaigns.<br/><br/>When you play the game, you will plan and carry-out missions in various campaign settings.  Each campaign takes place in a different era, so your weapon options change with each campaign.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You get to decide how your Hornets are to be armed, and which pilots are best for the mission based on their Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground skills.<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved with the priority placed on speed and realism. Hornet Leader II has retained all the key decision-making aspects of the original game, while greatly streamlining the game mechanics.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices, the more suppression munitions, you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but the less likely you are to destroy the target.<br/><br/>Available in two formats:<br/><br/>- Virtual Tabletop Game using the Vassal Engine<br/>- PDF files to download and print.<br/><br/>Not a complete game, you must own Hornet Leader II.<br/><br/>",

The board is separated into 4 areas each housing 3 randomly drawn extensions for the buildings.<br/><br/>The new action players can take is to go and build those extensions to increase the value of their already build buildings in their Alhambra. Each extension is individual to one building. In order to buy an extension from one of the areas of the new board the player has to pay with money cards depicted above each area. The value of the money card is hereby irrelevant, only the colors have to match. Once purchased the extension is placed on a corresponding building on the Alhambra. Each building can only hold one extension. During scoring each building with an extension counts as two buildings of that kind.<br/><br/>The extensions alter the game play and strategy greatly and make for a whole new experience while playing Alhambra.<br/><br/>Contents: 12 extension tiles and 1 extension board<br/><br/>The New Building Ground, a brand new expansion by Dirk Henn, players are given more choices to build the building they most desire through the construction sites.<br/><br/>At the start of the game 8 construction site tiles are mixed in with the rest of the buildings. They only show a number and the construction symbol. If one of these tiles shows up at the building market, players can buy it with the corresponding money as normal. But instead of placing the construction site in their Alhambra they can choose a building from a display of buildings that is set-up at the start of the game.<br/><br/>The display has 4 columns each holding 3 randomly drawn buildings. From which column the player can choose, depends on the value shown on the construction site purchased. Each column is dedicated to one of the values. This gives the player more freedom and maybe give you that one building you need to win at a scoring.<br/><br/>Contents: 8 building ground tiles, 12 construction tiles, and 4 number chips<br/><br/>",

Most often, they will place both in an empty space on the board, subject only to the restriction that they may not create a connected region of a single color containing two or more tiles showing the same number.  Alternatively, a player may remove one color chip from the game, and place their number tile face down on an empty space, preventing it from being part of any colored region.  At the end of the game, every connected region has at most one number tile correctly describing the number of color chips composing that region:  the owner of each such number tile scores its face value in points.<br/><br/>(description provided by designer)<br/><br/>",

The Ballistic Expansion Pack is an expansion to Rise!<br/><br/>This was an expansion available to Kickstarter Backers of Crash Games' November 2011 Kickstarter Campaign for Rise!<br/><br/>Rise! The Ballistic Expansion Pack adds three new types of pieces with a more &quot;take that&quot; element to Rise!<br/><br/>The Anchor Piece- The Anchor Piece is nearly an immovable object. The Anchor Piece doesn't move except when he meets another one of our special pieces which we'll get to in just a minute. The Anchor Piece can wreak quite a bit of havoc when placed near an opponent's freshly laid foundation of one of their towers.<br/><br/>The Flash Piece -  The Flash Piece moves in quickly and is gone in a flash! When placed The Flash Piece wipes out everything that is on the six tiles that surround it, except towers. Use The Flash Piece wisely though because no one's workers are safe when The Flash Piece arrives!<br/><br/>The Vortex Piece - The Vortex Piece swallows everything in its path! When placed the Vortex Piece begins its timer and your opponent has four turns to disarm The Vortex Piece. If The Vortex Piece isn't disarmed, on the fifth turn after placement, the Vortex Piece wipes everything from the board from the six tiles surrounding as well as the tile it is placed on. This includes The Anchor Piece, Towers as well as land tiles. To disarm The Vortex Piece a player's opponent must sacrifice five of his workers within four turns of the initial placement of The Vortex Piece.<br/><br/>",

The game begins where the most exciting football games end: it is sudden-death overtime, and the first team to score a touchdown or field goal wins. The game is played in drives in which players alternate driving the ball towards opposite ends of the field.<br/><br/>Players are dealt cards with simple patterns on them, and then set up their pieces in formations of their choice on opposite sides of a line of scrimmage. Each player, on their turn, may then choose to move one piece one space, or move several pieces at a time--but only if the pieces on the field match the patterns on the card. The pattern cards may be rotated and combined to set up dramatic breakaway plays, but only if they can outwit the defense.<br/><br/>Playtime is approximately 30 minutes. Ages 10 and up. Solitaire variant also available.<br/><br/>",

A reinforced battalion of the ROK's 2nd Marine Brigade (Blue Dragons) occupied a fortified, oval shaped redoubt that guarded a crucial crossroads in Quang Ngai province. Frustrated with pursuing the elusive Viet Cong in the surrounding jungle, the Korean Marines set a trap by constructing their position in close proximity to the jungles and away from the roads they were charged with protecting, with them as bait. The Korean commander hoped to lure the VC into attacking their position in order to get the enemy into the open for a conventional fight.<br/><br/>The Koreans got their wish in the late night hours of February 14th when two full North Vietnamese battalions attacked with Viet Cong support. It was a savage and bloody fight that lasted to nearly 8:00 AM on the 15th that could have gone either way. In the end the Korean Marines emerged victorious, and would go on to dominate the region, garnering a reputation as fierce warriors to be engaged with caution and respect.<br/><br/>",

Barbarian Migrations &amp; The Fall of Rome is a strategic level wargame set in the mid-5th century AD. the map covers the Western Roman Empire from the Rhine and Danube River lines west to Lutetia (modern-day Paris) and south to Rome. Each chief attempts to win by being the first to lead one of his tribes into the heart of the empire, the fabulous city of Rome. Along the way, each will find his progress slowed by determined Roman legions, plagues, the chicanery of the gods, and perhaps even the backstabbing diplomacy of his comrades. No player is ever eliminated before the end of the game, and even the last-place person can come quickly come from behind to win at the last minute. A game of alliance, betrayal, and maneuver, it&rsquo;s easily played in under an hour by anyone age 10 or older.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To defeat the other mad Scientists  you will create a gang of Grunts using Gamma Juice, a radioactive goo. You&rsquo;ll need to disrupt the actions of the other mad scientists and ultimately Smash your opponent. In this deck builder, your Gamma Grunts Will help you Smash your opponents' forces and decks bringing you closer to world domination.<br/><br/>Everyone starts with the same 15 cards consisting of 4 Discoveries, 5 Brutes, and 6 Gamma Juice cards. The Discoveries help you gain Infamy throughout the game, bringing you closer to winning. They also can help you get extra Gamma Juice. The Brutes are small Gamma Grunts without abilities that will get you started in combat and help you smash other people's decks. Gamma Juice is the resource of the game that is used to create Grunts and play Disruptions to get in the way of other Mad Scientists.<br/><br/>There are also cards players can draft from to build up their decks. The cost varies from 1-4 and there will always be a revealed card of each cost players can draft, in addition to a blind deck of each cost people can draft. Players also get to choose 2 cards to displace, either by removing them from the game, or covering the displayed card. This enables you to create your own destiny with which cards you get to draft.<br/><br/>The most important part of this game is that your deck is your life in this game. So when you damage a player, they are forced to smash cards from their deck and thus reduce their life. Knowing when to build up your deck and knowing when to battle others is a constant struggle. Just be sure you don't find yourself unable to draw because if you do, you lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A deck building game that centers around tribes of squirrels harvesting acorns in preparation for winter.<br/><br/>Theme: The winter is fast approaching and with the cold and snow comes a lack of food. The leaves are beginning to fall from the trees and with them the acorns. All of this means that it is time for the squirrel tribes inhabiting the forest to begin gathering food for the winter. There is just one problem! There is only one oak tree left in the forest making the much coveted acorns a source of warfare. The squirrel tribes have gathered their forces and have even resorted to hiring other forest animals to help them squirrel away as many nuts for the winter as possible. Gathering acorns is easy; protecting them from bands of raiders sent out by the other squirrel tribes is a different story. In Forest Fighters you will hire forest animals to help your tribe of squirrels gather and protect acorns while stealing acorns from your opponents. Once all of the acorns have been gathered, the game ends and the player with the most acorns wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The last days of the Third Age of Middle-earth may have been dominated by the many great battles fought during the climactic War of the Ring, yet the most seismic event of all was the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron. Crucial to this lasting victory over the forces of darkness was the epic journey undertaken by the Nine Walkers &ndash; the Fellowship of the Ring &ndash; for the deeds of its members, both good and ill, were destined to rule the fate of all.<br/><br/>This expansion for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game brings the fateful quest of the Fellowship of the Ring to life. As well as background on where the Fellowship&rsquo;s journey took them and vivid descriptions of the the many trials and tribulations they faced along the way, the book features a wealth of new rules, Scenarios and profiles. There are also rules for a linked, 28-scenario campaign that enables you to refight every key engagement involving the Fellowship and its members &ndash; from the smallest skirmish to the largest battle &ndash; with your collection of Citadel and Forge World miniatures.<br/><br/>Inside this 128-page hardback supplement, you will find:<br/><br/>Scenarios: 28 Narrative Scenarios, from the very start of Frodo's journey in Farmer Maggot's crop in the Shire, right through to the destruction of the One Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.<br/><br/>The Journey of the Ringbearer: Rules for linking the Narrative Scenarios together into a flowing campaign, with each battle having an impact on others. These include rules to represent the length of the journey, your Heroes being injured (or even dying!), and recovering their strength between encounters with the enemy.<br/><br/>Armies: Detailed army focuses, including the strengths, weaknesses and key models for five Armies: The Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Wanderers in The Wild, The Black Riders and Cirith Ungol. Also includes two new profiles for the Rangers of Ithilien list, and two for the Wanders in the Wild list.<br/><br/>Legendary Legions: Rules for six new and updated Legendary Legions: The Breaking of the Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Lurtz's Scouts, Depths of Moria, The Black Riders, and Cirith Ungol.<br/><br/>Fantasy Fellowship: Guidelines for creating your own Fantasy Fellowship by assembling Heroes from across Middle-earth in a similar way to the actual Fellowship of the Ring, but accounting for numerous 'what ifs' that could have reasonably happened throughout Middle-earth's and The One Ring's history. Includes rules for selecting a Ringbearer, their Companion, and the rest of The Fellowship. Also provides a slightly revised Fantasy Fellowship campaign, consisting of 23 linked Scenarios. (Please note that you will need the War in Rohan and Gondor at War supplements to be able to play all the way through the scenarios featured in the Fantasy Fellowship campaign.)<br/><br/>Weathertop Masterclass: An extended masterclass on how to best build and paint the Weathertop scenery piece, available on ForgeWorld.co.uk, which was a key location on Frodo's journey.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

In order to keep up with all the other suitors, you might have to lie about what you&rsquo;ve sent. But lying is half the fun! Will you win by being the sneakiest liar, or by catching others in THEIR lies?<br/><br/>Bah! Humbug! is a bluffing and deduction card game that uses a special card deck based on the traditional &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; carol (12 x Drummers Drumming, 11 x Pipers Piping, etc.) plus a deck of 12 cards that form a circular wreath or calendar in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Each round, players are dealt a hand of Christmas cards. They then take turns secretly mailing 1  Christmas card to their True Love (playing a card face-down on the calendar). These cards are played in descending order, from 12 to 1. As each player boasts about what card they've sent, other players may shout, &ldquo;Bah! Humbug!&rdquo; to catch them in a lie. Lies that go unchallenged are awarded &quot;coal&quot; at the end of the round, while lies that are successfully caught earn the accuser 1 &quot;holly berry&quot; (or take away holly berries, if the accuser is wrong.)<br/><br/>A player can win Bah! Humbug! in either of two ways: by being the most successful liar (collecting the most coal tokens), or by being the best at catching other liars (collecting the most holly berries).<br/><br/>",

Players choose a group action, meaning all players take that action, or choose a solo action, pay a resource, and act alone.<br/><br/>Actions include moving their character standee from one town on the map board to another, trading goods in the town where they are located, recruiting follower cards that give new abilities to the player, buy special weapon tiles that help in defeating monsters, build market tents (wooden tokens) that give more options when trading, build building cards for points and to produce additional goods, fight monsters (tokens of unknown power) and retrieve their plundered goods, and collect goods found in their current location. Strategies to win include managing resources, maximizing trades, building cards before other players, gaining the right combination of followers so each turn can produce the most resources, gold, and points.<br/><br/>The game ends after 8 rounds when the eighth fortnight tile (or round tile) is placed on a special fortnight board. The player with the most points wins.  Points are totaled up from building cards, follower cards, gold, monsters defeated, and certain followers' special abilities.<br/><br/>",

It also includes two decks from the latest KeyForge set: Winds of Exchange. Each deck is uniquely generated from a fixed pool of cards, and no two decks are the same, so once you know the rules, you can open these sets and discover something unique to you.<br/><br/>In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.<br/><br/>Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.<br/><br/>Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War Co. is an expandable card game with a simple objective: be the last person standing. A player must make his or her opponent(s) run out of cards. All players start with 50 cards in their deck. There are three broad ways to win: attack aggressively to make players discard faster, play defensively and wait for the opportune time to make moves, and trick opponents with dangerous traps and combos.<br/><br/>Players can only play five cards at a time. They must discard a card from their hand every turn. All cards consume energy, and players must decide how to allocate energy use since stronger and more versatile cards use more energy. Cards can be played facedown and turned face-up at any time. When turned facedown to face-up, card effects immediately take place, giving the player the element of surprise. Facedown cards do not use energy, allowing players to save energy until needed.<br/><br/>War Co. is a dystopian sci-fi game set in the year 2796. After three hundred years with no war, most weapon manufacturing corporations had been restructured or dissolved. Only one global weapon producer had survived the Era of Peace &ndash; the War Machines Company. Isolated skirmishes evolved into the War of 2620, and the War Machines Company profited by selling dangerous machines and technologies to wounded societies. Both of the multinational governments, in an attempt to preserve their own residents, purchased weapons faster than they could afford to spend money. Eventually, both multinational governments ran out of money and started purchasing the weapons with food, water, land, and sources of energy. Several decades later, small and isolated groups of people must survive at any cost, using the remaining artifacts of a war from the distant past.<br/><br/>",

Using a limited colour palette and  geometric motifs,  these tiles create intricate patterns with symmetry and repetitiveness and are coveted by architects and home-owners alike.<br/><br/>In this game, you play the role of a master artisan who has to lay the floor of a Chettinad Mansion using Athangudi tiles. You compete with other players to lay the most impressive floor &amp; to score the highest to win.<br/><br/>All players progressively lay their own floor of 16 tiles in a 4x4 grid in front of them. The floor is built over four rounds. Each round involves each player picking four tiles from a central supply, keeping one they want &amp; passing the remainder clockwise around the table. By drafting one tile from a progressively depleting pile that's passed by each player around the table, you collect four tiles each round. You can temporarily store these tiles while you wait for a better one, or place them on your floor to score points. Tiles placed in the floor are &quot;set in cement&quot; &amp; cannot be changed for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>You can score points by completing motifs, sequences or goals. Scoring is done at the end of each round, so completing motifs, sequences or goals earlier in the game can help you score higher. At the end of the game, you also score for neatness of the floor, so make sure you're tidy while playing!<br/><br/>The final score is the sum of the scores of the four rounds, plus the end game scoring. The highest score wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wakfu is a French Collectible Card Game, named after the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that reimplements Dofus.<br/><br/>Each player controls a hero, among 12 that have different stats and abilities, and a dimensional bag, in which 4 cards are safe.<br/><br/>A turn consists in playing new cards from hand to put new characters, equipment or zones in play, and performing one single attack against one single target. The defending player may block the attack with his own characters.<br/><br/>Cards, once in play, can be used either as resources to put new cards in play, or to activate their special abilities, or to attack. Either way, when used they are rotated and are not available until next turn. A rotated card may not be used to block the opponent's attack.<br/><br/>After each attack, some experience points may be awarded to either player. The heroes may level up when they reach 6 experience points, and again when they reach 18 experience points. There are two possible ways to win: either kill the opponent's hero, or level up twice with one's own.<br/><br/>Free translation from the back of the starter box:<br/>Chose your hero and his dimensional bag and explore the world of Dofus and Wakfu. Develop your crafting skills, create powerful items, feed your pets and earn XP... create your own ideal game! Tournament play is awaiting you...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the hardest fought Arctic convoy battle of the war, Convoy PQ-17 was largely destroyed by German air and naval forces in July 1942. Arctic Disaster, by designer Mark Stille, simulates the journey of PQ-17 as it transits Arctic waters en route to northern Russia. The 33 merchant ships of the convoy were provided a large escort of anti-submarine ships to ward off U-boat attack, a close covering force of four heavy cruisers and three destroyers, and a distant covering force of battleships HMS Duke of York and USS Washington, carrier HMS Victorious, and another two cruisers and 14 destroyers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, in spite of this protection, only nine ships reached Russia. Arctic Disaster challenges the Allied player to use his assets wisely to run the convoy through and exact painful losses on the Germans. The Germans have assembled a large force of U-boats, torpedo-carrying aircraft and a heavy task force including battleship Tirpitz and heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer, Lutzow, and Hipper to crush the convoy.<br/><br/>Arctic Disaster features individual counters for every ship and submarine, while the Luftwaffe is represented by 9-12 aircraft groups. The game system is built around the uncertainty of task force activation, replicating the weak command and control evident on both sides. Surface to air combat, surface combat, and anti-submarine combat is modeled with a clean system steering the players clear of an elaborate combat resolution process that permits quick play and multiple game iterations. Detection is also handled in a manner so as not to overwhelm other game functions. Special rules include convoy scatter and the reluctance of both sides to commit heavy ships in the area of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Serval is a wargame of the campaign in Mali in West Africa during 2012 and 2013, which saw Islamist forces seize control of the northern part of the country and then threaten the capital at Bamako. A French expeditionary force intervened, counterattacked, and along with various African allies, routed the Islamists in a short and sharp campaign.<br/><br/>This is a two-player game where one player commands the French Coalition and the other player the Islamists. Each side's forces include several contingents of allied forces.<br/><br/>Both sides' objective is to gain control of Mali.<br/><br/>The central game mechanism is Command Control Points (C2P). C2P are a quantification of each side's ability to coordinate operations and conduct intelligence. Players expend C2P to recruit units, activate contingents, and perform logistics. The game has two scenarios: one deals with the entire campaign; the other with the French intervention.<br/><br/>Each hex is about 50 kilometers across. Each turn represents anywhere from one week of intense combat to a month or two of refitting and regrouping. Ground units represent companies, battalions and groups of irregulars (anywhere from 100 to 500 fighters). Airstrikes represent the effect of sorties (from 4 to 16 aircraft). Netwar markers provide cybernetic operations, terrorism, ISR and drone strikes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This allows minors a few turns to build up to be able to upgrade their L to a 2 (typically at a cost of 80).

Many felt it would take a miracle to rejuvenate an army that was barely hanging on in Madrid, and reeling from repeated Nationalists blows elsewhere in Spain. As winter settled in, the need for some sort of victory in the field was increasingly necessary as France and the Soviet Union began wavering in their support, and Great Britain stepped up its &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; that in reality only helped the Nationalists.<br/><br/>One of the most direct threats to Republican survival was the salient to the south of Madrid. Any further Nationalist gains in that sector could cut-off the capital&rsquo;s link to the rest of Republican-controlled Spain. With little to lose and much to win, General Enrique Lister&rsquo;s 11th Division was placed in the vanguard of the Republican counter-attack.

If you've ever wanted to field an entire Space Marine Battle Company or household of Imperial Knights (and more besides), then this is the game for you!<br/><br/>As with Battle-forged armies in Warhammer 40,000, your collections are organised into any of 10 different types of Detachment (and each led by a Commander) that move and fight together on the battlefield. Each Detachment also gains a Faction Ability, enabling you to theme your army by Detachment and include narrative-driven alliances within it.<br/><br/>The innovative rules for Apocalypse enable you to play massive battles to completion in a matter of hours. Alternating Detachment activations ensures that there is minimal downtime for players, maintaining the fast-paced and exciting action throughout. Damage is resolved in the final phase of each game turn, meaning that even units that are destroyed will still have a chance to make their mark on the battle before they succumb.<br/><br/>In each turn, players issue Advance, Aimed Fire or Assault orders in secret to each of their Detachments, giving them a chance to bluff, surprise and outmanoeuvre their opponents with their choices.<br/><br/>Each player constructs a deck of 30 Command Assets (from a choice of 300 included in the set), including a number of faction-specific cards, enabling them to pull off strategic power plays as the battle unfolds. These effects include devastating psychic powers, changes of orders and crucial re-rolls.<br/><br/>There are six Apocalypse missions to choose from, as well as a mission generator with which to create your own.<br/><br/>This set contains:<br/>- 120-page Apocalypse Field Manual (including full game rules)<br/>- 6 punchboard sheets of double-sided Apocalypse gameplay tokens<br/>- 300 Command Asset cards<br/>- 12 six-sided dice<br/>- 12 twelve-sided dice<br/><br/>",

He&rsquo;s quite aware that he&rsquo;s the poorest, lowliest wretch in this god-forsaken village&mdash;and has the ripe, brown stains on his tattered shirt to prove it. But just to make sure he remembers, the villagers laugh and spit in his face every day, reveling in his misery. As if crappy crops weren&rsquo;t enough!<br/><br/>The excitement begins when Gong decides that he&rsquo;s taken enough crap for one lifetime. Even with the Black Plague killing peasants and noblemen at record speed, Gong decides to take the King&rsquo;s justice into his own hands, with nothing but his battered pride, his trusty dung shovel, and a rusty bucket! The King&rsquo;s battalion of armored knights, archers, and soldiers stand ever ready&hellip; an entire army of seasoned warriors. What chance does Gong have against such wealth and might? Nonetheless, a word festers in the back of Gong&rsquo;s mind: revolt!<br/><br/>You and your friends will have a blast recreating medieval life by playing this fast pace, strategic and addicting card game where nothing is as it seems, nor as it should be.  Instead of singing the praises of &quot;Long live the King&quot;, you will joyfully cry out, &quot;Down with the King, and may Gong Fermer reign!&quot;<br/><br/>",

It has been the tool of several men of monstrous evil, finally disappearing in one of the wildest battles of the Mage War.<br/><br/>The potential for an era of unchecked evil abounds, unless you find the Blackstone first and destroy it.<br/><br/>The Dark Vale is a complete fantasy adventure for solitaire or group play.

        "description": "Incredible Courage at Austerlitz - Telnitz is GSI's first offering on Napoleonic warfare. The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805.<br/>The game features variable combat strengths. Turns are 10 minutes of time. &nbsp; The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.&nbsp; Unlike other games at this level the rules will not be massive.&nbsp; Troop replacements are generated by returning stragglers to the battle.&nbsp; A few features are variable combat strengths, elite units, and levels of order.&nbsp; Units start with a certain amount of these and as they lose them their abilities are reduced.<br/>Buxhowden came down off the Pratzen Heights to attack the French right since it was so weak.&nbsp; Little did he know that while this was true at 0700 in the morning the Iron Marshall, Davout, would arrive shortly and provide the bulwark against which the defense would halt and then throw back the Coalition forces.<br/><br/>Similar to the Death Ride series this game is the first of many that wplayers will be able to build into a larger monster of the Austerlitz battle.  Again critical thinking will allow the players to figure out the correct formations and deployment of their troops.  Infantry units are modeled at the company level, cavalry at the squadron level, and artillery at the section level.  The rules for this detailed game will surprise you with their clarity and brevity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was a small village at the base of the Black Forest in Germany.  Life was simple and peaceful in the village until a series of brutal murders.  The horrific nature of the killings left no question that werewolves had infiltrated the village.<br/><br/>The villagers had little time to determine who the beasts were.  The werewolves were cunning, and used the paranoia to help the village tear itself apart.  Which side prevailed?<br/><br/>Black Forest is a cooperative board game for 3 to 5 players.  Players win or lose together as members of the village.  However, one player is secretly a werewolf, trying to defeat the other players.  In order to win, the villagers must ascertain which player is the werewolf, and eliminate all of his or her villager tokens in the Court House.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases.  In the Day Phase, players take turns placing their Villager tokens on village spaces (like the Fields, where they earn gold; the Market, where they can buy market cards; the Seer, where they can hire the Seer to have a vision on another player, and possibly gain clues about the player's role; or the Court House, where players vote to eliminate a Villager token belonging to one of the players).<br/><br/>In the Night Phase, players are dealt a hand of Night cards, and must choose one and pass the rest, until they have a card chosen for each player in the game.  Cards are then assigned and revealed.  The Night Phase is where the werewolf player tries to eliminate Villager tokens from the game, but also when the villagers try to fortify against werewolf attack.<br/><br/>After every other Night Phase, there is a Harvest, where the players must have enough gold to make it through.  If enough Villager tokens have been eliminated that the Harvest cannot be successful, the werewolf player wins.  Villagers can also win by upgrading all 12 Village tiles, but this involves spending gold that may be necessary for the Harvest.<br/><br/>",

Alternately, they could exist as edge-of-the-map raiders.<br/><br/>260 Pages, 280 die-cut counters<br/><br/>",

Of course, there are new maps, counters, and compatible cards that can be retrofitted to Humanity so the design-your-own-scenarios possibilities have been increased exponentially.<br/><br/>Star Borders: Aliens features 7 new scenarios exploring the very unexpected war between the Bugs and the Bots, and the inclusion of a bonus scenario to allow players to bring in the forces from Humanity. The tension between the asymmetrical abilities of these fleets creates a great player tension on the board that you will long enjoy!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>",

For 2 to 4 players, aged 8 years and older (but played from 5-6+ ages). Training of logic, memory, team interaction - all this in a simple, but deep in content, a board game. Play at home with children, in the company, at school and use it in STEM additional education.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Battle of Golems! Algorythmus archmage by Cybertania&rsquo;s king&rsquo;s order created Golems - clay robot warriors using coal as fuel. Due to the magic crystal in its head Golem can follow commands and perform short series of them called Programs. King also ordered to build a special field, which would be used for battles between warrior programmers and their Golems. You will take part in the tournament and prove that you&rsquo;re the best robot engineer of Cybertania.<br/><br/>In 10 rounds each player set up the Program for his Robot-Golem from Action cards and executes it. The Damage tokens and Cards of Fortune will show you how many rounds and lives remain before the victory and whether you can apply Cycles, Conditions or other Bonuses when writing the Program.<br/><br/>You and your opponents in each round usually have four programming slots (depending on the type of Golem), so you need to take care of a short but effective algorithm. You can use both ready-made scenarios (more then 10+ including in Scenario book) and create your own rules, fields, and actions!<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>&bull; 5 two-sided (summer-winter) board pieces: (4 3x3 sizes and 1 4x4 size) (Print&amp;Play includes only 1 4x4 size)<br/>&bull; 4 Golems figures <br/>&bull; 6 two-sided golem cards<br/>&bull; 76 action cards<br/>&bull; 12 Damage tokens for 4 players<br/>&bull; 22 two-sided obstacle (barriers) tokens + 8 logic tokens<br/>&bull; 40 fortune cards<br/>&bull; 3 Bots program cards<br/>&bull; Scenery book.<br/>&bull; Game rules.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 11 pieces (1 Emperor, 8 Guards, 2 Archers).  The center space of the board is the Throne, while on opposite ends of the center row lie the Tower-spaces.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the player who scores the most points by capturing the Tower-spaces (1 point granted per space held at the start of each turn).<br/><br/>The second objective of Sovrano is to be the first player to move their Emperor onto the center space (the Throne-space) and hold it until the start of his or her next turn.  This grants that player 3 points and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

It is slower and less maneuverable than a Viper, but it is capable of short-range FTL jumps and can be armed to fight back Cylons.<br/><br/>The Raptor SAR/ECM is an excellent tactical craft for search-and-rescue operations, as well as for transport of military forces and technicians.

Fighting against the Axis, players use dice to win in battles, answer quiz questions about WW2 and preform various tasks including singing, drawing or even bringing food for the comrades at the table.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a set:<br/><br/>     one partisan figure<br/>     one white guard tower<br/>     one colored guard tower (red, orange, blue, green) <br/><br/><br/>Players start the game by putting their partisan figures on a game board which represents Slovenia occupied by Axis. They choose from 130 towns and places. After they done so, they have to put white guard tower anywhere on the map. When white guard towers are set, players draft their first mission card from general headquarters beginning in 1941. The card tells them where to put their colored guard tower and what is the mission.  Players have to go through 5 years of war (1941-1945). There are 5 stacks of cards - one per year (250 missions).<br/><br/>Now the game begins. Players throw special dice (D3) and move towards their objective. Other players guard towers represent obstacles and can not be attacked. When a player reaches his objective from General Headquarters card, he must fulfil his/her mission. The player takes 5 battle dice. He has 3 throws to hit the best combination (scale goes from: one pair, two pairs, three of a kind,..., five of the same). After throwing his combination, the player on his right takes a role of &quot;enemy&quot; and tries to throw a combination with bigger value. If player fails in achieving his mission, he must wait for another turn and try again. If he wins, he receive a card from Partisan school.<br/><br/>The Partisan School has quiz questions about WW2. These cards bring points. After fulfilling his orders from General Headquarters players, move their white guard tower. After a successful attack (again with battle dice), a player receives a &quot;Special Mission&quot; card. These also bring points. Now, after both guard towers are eliminated, the player is ready to step into the next year. He again places his white guard tower on the map, and than drafts the card from year 1942 which tells him where to put his colored guard tower and what his the mission in 1942.<br/><br/>The player who gathers most points from Partisan School and Special Missions is the winner.<br/>And yes.. you can get a medal!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is at these times that the actions of one unit can make the difference between victory and defeat. Wise kings know this and realize that it is often prudent to hold back their best units until they can make the greatest difference. These elite units, called the &quot;battlesworn&quot;, are more than just powerful combatants, they are symbols of the glory and honor of a kingdom. All young warriors hope to one day join their ranks and add their oathmarks beside those legendary fighters.<br/><br/>This supplement for Oathmark: Battles of the Lost Age contains rules for adding elite units to your armies and charting their progress from battle to battle. Will they grow even more powerful as they gain renown, or be broken in the face of tremendous odds, perhaps someday to be reformed when their kingdom needs them most? Also included are rules for rivers and boats as well as campaigns, featuring all-new scenarios that will give your battlesworn the chance to lead their kingdom to new heights of power and prestige.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of family leaders among the Jomon people, competing through the four seasons&mdash;spring, summer, autumn, and winter&mdash;to earn points by crafting pottery, hunting, and cooking nuts. The region's historical trade value of jade also plays a crucial role, as players must also gather this precious material.<br/><br/>UMATAKA utilizes a worker placement system where players use human and dog pieces as workers, placing between one and four workers in designated spaces. Dogs, which are relatively easier to acquire during the game, must work alongside humans due to several restrictions. After placing workers and taking actions, the number of workers influences the advancement of a piece on the &quot;Exploration Track.&quot; The action located at the space where this explorer piece stops is also executed. This mechanism forces players to think strategically about the number of workers they deploy, and sometimes strategically placing extra workers can provide an advantage in the game.<br/><br/>",

I recently found a publisher, signed a license agreement, the game will be published at some point in 2017. There'll be changes in artworks, rules and layout, so you're not looking at the &quot;final version&quot; here.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/><br/>Grab some friends and compete on an epic quest for glory.<br/>With 108 cards and 6 dice, Barbaria fits in every pocket and provides a wonderful beer and pretzel experience.<br/><br/>It is my take on the dungeon crawler genre: I stripped off all complicated and redundant components, like game boards, miniatures, long rulebooks, hundreds of markers. <br/>It is designed to be a quick, easy and fun game, while still mainstaining the core: you control a hero, get stronger, fight monsters and find treasure, and you roll a lot of dice.<br/><br/>All 100+ illustrations are hand drawn and colored in aquarel.<br/>I'd appreciate feedback! :)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dread began three years ago with the rise of the bone legions in the south. Since then it has spread across the known world, a waking nightmare that takes hundreds of horrible forms. Ghosts howl in the night. Skinchangers lurk in the wilds. Fallen soldiers rise to slaughter the living. Entire cities fall to a Chant that turns all who hear it into mindless killers. We don&rsquo;t know why this is happening. We don&rsquo;t know how to stop it. All that we know with certainty is that we are fighting a war and we are losing. Over a third of the Empire has been lost to the Dread, and each day brings new horrors. In this dark time we have one hope: Phoenixes are returning. Every citizen knows tales of the Phoenixes, champions who can face death and return stronger than before. In the centuries following our brutal civil war the Phoenixes have become legends&hellip; and now you are one of them.<br/><br/>Phoenix: Dawn Command is a card-based roleplaying game with a unique approach to character death. In Phoenix, players assume the role of supernaturally empowered champions bound together to defend a fantasy world under attack by threats that no mortal could withstand. These heroes face harsh odds every mission, and many won&rsquo;t survive. But death isn&rsquo;t the end of your character&rsquo;s story; it&rsquo;s the start of the next chapter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Exodus TCG is an extremely fast-paced card game, designed to play in an average of 5-10 minutes suitable for all ages and skill levels. It's the first trading card game in the world to feature mechanics that affect card rarity! There's no banlist, no rotation, and no reprints from set-to-set. Expansions offer new and interesting mechanics and themes without relying on power-creep.<br/><br/>A mass Exodus to the newborn planet Eeventide is occurring. As you venture from Earth to Eeventide, you become a Drifter, gaining the ability to fly and drift across a new world. Forge a special deck of cards from stardust, and battle other Drifters by summoning massive creatures to fight for you! Your very existence is bound to the planet by a mysterious contraption that glows with an ethereal light. You can join a faction or fight solo as you pave a path.<br/><br/>The first three guilds have risen, Dragonis, Skyborn &amp; the Order, each fighting over a planet that requires constant conflict in order to remain stable.<br/><br/><br/>Players begin the game with 10 Life Points, which represent their will to battle. Each player takes turns playing by following the 5 Phases of a Turn:<br/><br/>         Draw Phase: Draw 3 cards from your Energy Deck and 3 cards from your Main Deck<br/>         Energy Phase: Play your energy onto the field by stacking them into piles in any arrangement you'd like (maximum 3-energy per pile by default)<br/>         Creature Phase: Summon as many creatures from your hand as you'd like by placing them on blank piles of energy<br/>         Attack Phase: Attack your opponent's creatures using your own, or attack their Life Points directly if they have no creatures<br/>         End Phase: Pass the turn to your opponent<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players win the game by using their creatures to attack their opponent's Life Points directly. Each energy behind a creature counts as 1 point of damage in a direct attack. Players can attack with as many creatures as they want during their turn, and use instant-speed Symmetry cards to make their creatures stronger or to drastically change circumstances during a duel. Symmetry cards are like quick-play instants that can be played literally at any time to interrupt gameplay (they can be used on your turn or your opponent's turn, on any phase)!<br/><br/>Energy cards are universal in function, so players can use any combination of cards. Decks can be constructed by following the one simple rule of limiting 2 copies of a card per deck (excluding energy).<br/><br/><br/>(Set 1) Birth of Creation Harmonized Dragonis &amp; Skyborn Starter Decks (Unlimited Edition) are now available, Premiere Edition is sold out,<br/>(Set 2) Galaxy Tides (First Edition) Boosters are now available,<br/>(Set 3) Crystal Forge Treeforge &amp; Shardveil Competitive Decks (First Edition) are now available, released August 2017,<br/><br/>",

But by the 1930s, the Netherlands trusted the League of Nations to defend world peace, and did not begin to rebuild their fleet until it was much too late. Spice Islands presented the fleet the Dutch admirals hoped to build, adding it to the Second World War at Sea series with scenarios taking place in the East Indies.<br/><br/>Orange Waters is a supplement for the Second World War at Sea series, with 15 scenarios looking at how this fleet might have been used in the waters of the North Atlantic.

        "description": "In the year of 1787, Brazil was still a colony of Portugal.<br/><br/>The Portuguese empire imposed high taxes (called &quot;Derrama&quot;) upon the wealthy ones, trying to get as much gold as possible. Under pressure, influential Brazilians gather to organize a liberty movement by writing articles, poems and manifests,  spreading freedom ideas taken from USA's recent act of independence and from the French Revolution.<br/><br/>A group of conspirators, called Inconfidentes, gathered on the state of Minas Gerais, a place that concentrated a lot of gold and valuable gems.<br/><br/>There are six characters on the game, five of them are Inconfidentes: the poet, the farmer, the bachelor, the soldier and the priest, each of them with a unique power. The last one is an imperial guard.<br/><br/>On each round, players choose and move the Inconfidentes, however more than one play may select the same character. Whenever this happens, they must blind bid to decide who will be the leader of that character.<br/><br/>Players vie to spread the ideas through publishing texts (tiles) and hide them around the city, Ouro Preto, formerly named as Vila Rica, and get the population's approval, supporting the struggle to make Minas Gerais free from Portugal. These conspirators also made part of Freemasonry's secret association, and they try to build the first Freemasonry's secret house to support their fight.<br/><br/>When they publish their own texts and get the texts from the others, players make &quot;inconfid&ecirc;ncia&quot; points (victory points). Furthermore, a character may become a Freemason. If a player manages to get to the 33rd. degree of Freemasonry (all five characters become Freemasons), he becomes a Master Freemason. This gives an alternative ending to the game by finishing the game earlier, and changes Brazilian history! setting Minas Gerais free from Portugal.<br/><br/>If no one gets to be a Master Freemason until 1789, the year of the ninth and last round, everyone goes to jail. <br/>The player with more points (tiles) from texts published by other players, gold retrieved and Freemasonry degrees is the &quot;inconfid&ecirc;ncia&quot; martyr and the winner.<br/><br/>Not to forget that the historic martyr, Tiradentes, became widely famous afterwords, although was unfortunately killed, hanged for treason by Portugal.<br/><br/>",

Currently, it is being released in Japan.<br/><br/>Both players choose one main character at the start of the game. All the cards in the game are character cards. Each character has a base attack strenght, as well as support strength (in addition to certain other powers and abilities). Each player has five 'orbs' ('life' represented by cards'), which the other player tries to get down to zero by attacking the main character.<br/><br/>There's five phases in a game.<br/>1) Starting Phase<br/>Untapping tapped characters, and drawing 1 card.<br/>2) The Bond Phase<br/>Playing 1 card into the &acute;bond&acute; area. Each card has a value (top left). The value of cards in the 'bond' area determines the value of the characters you can put into play.<br/>3) The Sortie Phase<br/>Play characters, or level up certain characters. The characters you can play depends on their card value and the value of cards in your &acute;bond&acute; area.<br/>4) The Action Phase<br/>Move your characters into the opponent's area; attack your opponent's characters; or use a skll.<br/>5) The Final Phase<br/>Skills that say 'during this turn' end, and the turn goes to the opposing player.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent's main character by destroying his 'orbs.'<br/><br/>",

His chances aren&rsquo;t improved when he eats the team&rsquo;s assistant coach to prove a point, but news travels fast, and it isn&rsquo;t long before the Skavenblight Scramblers scout him out and offer him a place on their roster. Eventually, after some unpleasantness including a lifetime ban for eating a referee (which was eventually overturned) he became a free agent, bombarded with offers...<br/><br/>Field the gloriously portly Glart Smashrip as a Star Player in your Skaven or Underworld Denizens Blood Bowl teams by picking up this resin kit. The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice about Glart is his size &ndash; there&rsquo;s no hiding that this is a Skaven of impressive girth, who barely fits into the ramshackle armour that has been attached to his bulk with creaking straps. He isn&rsquo;t bothering with head protection as there aren&rsquo;t any helmets that would fit and, honestly, they just get in the way of eating stuff. Luckily, someone has found a swathe of cloth large enough to hide most of his unmentionables, and he features the usual spiky bits on his shoulders and knee pads.<br/><br/>The resin kit comes as 8 components with a 32mm round Blood Bowl base.<br/><br/>",

One of those games is Rights a.k.a. Startups.<br/><br/>This game is Startups made by touching up Rights. Made by Mr. Sasaki as a hobby for events, we took &quot;Startups&quot; and gave it the look and feel of &quot;Rights&quot;. But since the rules for both &quot;Startups&quot; and &quot;Rights&quot; are included, we think it is a nice package for people that like both games.<br/><br/>No rules changes, there are 2 separate instruction manuals, one for each game. Both utilize the same components with only slight variation between them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Plot Thickens is a storytelling game for quick-thinking, imaginative folks just like you and your friends. The object is to take your hand of story cards, (people, places and things) and lay out the tale of your character, and their fate! You&rsquo;ll earn plot points for every card you use to build your story, and every time you interweave with other&rsquo;s narratives.<br/> The storyteller with the most points gets to craft the ending as main character, while the person who connected the most to their cards gets to name the epic as the Author. What will your story be?<br/><br/>In the Sci-Fi edition you'll explore strange place, meet weird aliens and blast your way through asteroids!<br/><br/>The different genres of The Plot Thickens can be combined to increase the player count and give you more story options.<br/><br/>",

No, this won&rsquo;t work. This scene needs to be more snappy. Swap that scrawny grunt for a tougher guy. The hero needs to earn his final show-down!&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Director&rsquo;s Cut Expansion adds a layer of direct player interaction as players alternate in taking the role of a vengeance movie director.  Players can influence the action by playing Director cards during another player&rsquo;s fight phase activating minions and bosses as well as triggering directorial changes that break the fourth wall such as changing extras in the scene or changing the scene altogether!<br/><br/>The Director&rsquo;s Cut Expansion also includes the brutal Immacolati gang and a new hero, Napoleone.  Napoleone is hell-bent on taking down Donna Immacolata, the leader of the Immacolati gang who framed his family for a smuggling operation into a rival gang&rsquo;s territory and had them murdered brutally in a swimming pool outside the city.<br/><br/>Finally, this expansion also pumps the narrative punch of the game, adding Hero Perks, new abilities that are specific to each Hero and fit their back-story; and Story Missions.  Story Missions replace the standard Missions and, similar to the Solo Missions, are Hero-specific Missions that are based on their back-story.<br/><br/>In short, it&rsquo;s one hell of a sequel!!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Allied Market-Garden offensive in September ended in a frustrating loss and the Germans occupying a salient in the Allied lines east of Nijmegen. Seeking to destroy the German threat that was centered on the crucial crossroads town of Overloon, as well as possibly resuming the drive to the Rhine, the British 2nd Army launched a series of offensives that took place throughout the last week of September and the first three weeks of October. The battles that occurred were often fought in torrential rains and marked by heavy casualties on all sides. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Forgotten Battles is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. The game uses the same design as Breaking Into Valhalla/Zhukov's Final Victory and although designed for two players is very solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>One 10 page rulebook<br/>Two 11&rdquo; by 17&rdquo; map sections<br/>One sheet of 220 single-sided, unmounted units (an optional mounted countersheet can be purchased).<br/>Two sets of charts<br/><br/>Players will also need one or two six-sided dice to play the game.<br/><br/>",

Weeks of brutal combat earned them the grudging respect of the vanquished Germans, who called them Teufelhunde - Devil Dogs.<br/><br/>IN THE TRENCHES (ITT) system makes its Tiny Battle debut with three scenarios drawn from this exciting battle. Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>This set includes all the counters you&rsquo;ll need to play these scenarios, PLUS all the status markers and administrative counters you&rsquo;ll need to play any expansion.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    176 counters to manouevre<br/>    Three 8.5x11-inch maps<br/>    1 rulebook to rifle through<br/>    1 Player Aid Card and Scenario Card<br/>    1 Game Turn Track<br/><br/><br/>(source: Tiny Battle Publishing website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Beyond the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere lies the untamed Periphery. Filled with young souls seeking adventure and freedom, the Periphery is a watershed for every stripe of humanity. This diversity has spawned powerful Inner Sphere-like political coalitions, roving pirates, one-world lesser powers and bandit kingdoms striving for legitimacy. Wild, uncivilized and deadly, the Periphery is a turbulent frontier where any warrior who dares can be king. <br/>BattleTech Field Manual: Periphery describes the various factions that make up the Periphery: Magistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat, Marian Hegemony, Outworlds Alliance, Circinus Federation, the Lesser Periphery States, Bandit Kingdoms and the Deep Periphery. This sourcebook describes the history, military doctrine, traditions and tactics of each Periphery faction, plus special rules that reflect the exclusive capabilities of each Periphery regiment, as well as new weapons and 'Mechs unique to the Periphery.<br/><br/>User report:<br/><br/>This sequel to the earlier BattleTech: The Periphery (second edition)  is the final volume in the Field Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA. It was also the last expansion to be published by FASA, before the company ceased trading.<br/><br/>This Field Manual is closer to the ComStar Field Manual than the House-specific Field Manuals, in that it covers a variety of different nations and areas of interest.  It was the first sourcebook to effectively treat the Marian Hegemony and Circinus Federation as states equal to the three long-established major Periphery states.<br/><br/>Whereas the other Field Manuals add new high-tech options to BattleTech, the Periphery Field Manual adds a low-tech option instead - the Rocket Launcher - a fairly primitive but dangerous set of one-shot weapons, and adds a fair number of assorted variants to existing 'Mechs that have been adjusted to carry Rocket Launchers as a part of their weapon arsenal.<br/><br/>This sourcebook was originally published by FASA in 2001, but was re-released with a new cover and new product code by FanPro in 2003. Both versions of this sourcebook are out of print, and it hasn't been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, That makes this one of the harder to find Field Manuals.<br/><br/>",

Containing spies, witches, faeries, magicians and other creatures from all over the world you must select your cabal wisely.<br/><br/>Cabals: The Board Game brings together key deck building mechanics with board control in a new battle that can either be won through board domination or conquering the opponents stronghold. Once the battleground has been constructed the luck of the draw and your deck building skills dictate what creatures you have at your disposal. Units battle one another backed up by spells and lead by a single hero for your deck from one of the four cabals.<br/><br/>The turn sequence comprises of gaining domination points, gaining resources, drawing cards, the main strategic phase (containing combat) and ending your turn. Resources dictate what cards you can use and this combined with loyalty points (depending on the cabals and their allegiances) the player has a deep, strategic game to conquer on many levels. The game is based on the digital Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards and these same key mechanics prevail but this version has more streamlined gameplay suitable to a tabletop game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Without the formality of a declaration of war, in October 1935 Italian armies stormed into Ethiopia from both north and south. Badly outgunned and outnumbered, the Imperial Ethiopian Army resisted for six months before its final collapse. Italian forces deployed tanks, aircraft and poison gas against the Ethiopian levies, who fought back with suicidal courage and little else.<br/><br/>Conquest of Ethiopia is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Lorenzo Striuli and Ottavio Ricchi, authors of our Fronte Russo supplement.<br/><br/>The Italian invaders rely heavily on colonial troops, long-service professionals recruited in Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. They also have Blackshirts, Carabinieri, elite Alpini mountain troops, tanks and a great deal of air power. And the Italian advantages continue: motor transport, much more artillery and armored cars.<br/><br/>Ethiopia&rsquo;s defenders include the elite Imperial Guard, and a number of regular battalions that are fairly good troops armed with modern weapons. Beyond that, things get a pretty bad for the Ethiopians pretty quickly. There are three distinct Ethiopian forces at play: the Imperial Regulars, the Imperial Levies (local forces loyal to the throne) and Provincial Levies (local forces loyal to their own leaders, usually a Ras or Duke). None of the levies are very well-armed.<br/><br/>The game includes eight semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut pieces, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 40 scenarios.<br/><br/>This game is sold only direct from Avalanche Press.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Samurai were the most prominent individuals in Japanese society during Feudal Japan. Proud and respected, their lives were a journey of devotion to the arts of war and dueling, with the warrior's path, Bushido, as their code of conduct. In Bushido, go back in time during the era of shoguns and daimios and assume the role of a samurai warrior who will fight to defend the honor of his clan through the sword, in a game of deduction, tactics and concentration, where a wrong move can cost life. Combine your cards and confuse your opponent so that he is not able to predict your next move, either in attack or defense. Your reputation and your honor as a samurai warrior are in your hands!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early August 1870. The Prussian Chancellor Bismarck has accomplished a diplomatic master stroke thanks to the Ems Dispatch: France has just declared war on Prussia. Prussia was able to gather all of the German states around it while Napoleon IIIs empire remains alone with no nation willing to support the perceived aggressor.<br/><br/>In Paris, the belligerent frenzy has brought the population to the boiling point and they already see themselves at Berlin. France claims to have the better army. Didn&rsquo;t the war minister Marshal Leboeuf declare his unequivocal assurance to Adolphe Thiers, himself lacking in confidence as to the country&rsquo;s preparation : &laquo; We are prepared and extremely prepared. If the war were to last two years, our soldiers would not lack for a single gaiter button&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The mobilisation is launched and the troops rush toward their concentration point on the border. But apathy meets with incompetence : plans that have been prepared for a long time are modified several times, the mess in the stations is indescribable. In addition, this is an incomplete army led by superior officers who do not know their troops well and who position themselves to lead an offensive without a plan but an offensive that has been rendered obligatory by popular demand.<br/><br/>On the other side, the Prussian state has learned from the experience of its two previous campaigns: the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864 and especially the Seven Weeks War against Austria in 1866. The mobilisation then the concentration proceed like clockwork. The long-established plans and orders are followed to the letter. The invasion may begin as planned.<br/><br/><br/>In &quot;La Guerre de 1870&quot;, an evolution of The Marshals series for the campaigns of the 2nd Empire, will you, as Napol&eacute;on III, finally become your uncle&rsquo;s worthy military heir by saving your country from the Prussian enemy?

However this new sub is far larger, more complex and more expensive, and requires much more manpower and scarce resources than previous submarines. Just a few of these new Type XXIs will do nothing. Only a radical transformation in shipbuilding techniques to mass produce the design - and not giving in to setbacks - will enable this &ldquo;wonder weapon&rdquo; to arrive in time....<br/><br/>The advanced Type XXI U-boat has the technology needed to survive and thrive in the Allied-controlled seas, and is a potential game-changer to the war's outcome . . . if it can be supplied in sufficient numbers in time.  (In reality, only two went to war.) This is your challenge as a player, operating functionally as both the Naval Commander-in-Chief and Armaments Minister, working to foster production and work around wartime setbacks.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lucky Dog is a dice game where the dog always wins. There are two ways to play: A free-for-all 2-4 player version, and a 2 player cooperative version.<br/><br/>In the free-for-all version players take turns revealing 5 cards with parameters (such as 3 of a kind, 3 in a row, two pair, etc.) The player rolls 5 six sided dice and then may discard and reveal one new card. The player then gets an opportunity to reroll any of the dice up to twice, trying to fulfill the parameters of as many of the cards as possible. When they are done re-rolling, they take and score any of the revealed cards that the dice fulfill the parameters for. Players take turns in this manner until a player reaches 20 points, then the player with the most points at the end of the round wins.<br/><br/>In the 2 player cooperative version, each player will have 2 hidden cards in their hand. The player who's turn it is rolls all five dice and choose to 'keep' any of the dice, but must choose at least one. The second player takes and rolls any of the un-kept dice, then they can keep any of the dice, but must keep at least one. Players roll dice back and forth like this until all dice are kept. As soon as that happens, both players can score any cards in their hand that the dice meet the parameters for. If the players collectively score at least one card, they may keep playing by drawing up to two cards and starting a new round. If they can't score a card, it's game over with a total score equal to all the cards scored.<br/><br/>",

This is the time that saw dinosaurs first appear, dominate the world, and go extinct (except for some groups of avian dinosaurs, i.e., birds). However, dinosaurs weren&rsquo;t the only animals of the Mesozoic; they shared their habitats with amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and others.<br/><br/>In Lands of the Mesozoic, 1 to 4 players will create and manage their own Mesozoic ecosystems using 3 main types of cards that symbolize the different levels of the food chain.  The game comes with over 120 individual cards, all drawn by award winning Ukranian paleo-artist Sergey Krasovskiy.<br/><br/>Players will first lay down Land cards that represent the habitats that provide shelter and  plant/insect/fish food. Land cards in play are used to pay for the cost of Herbivore cards. These are the animals using the  resources generated in those specific types of lands.<br/><br/>In turn, Herbivore cards in play can generate the resources necessary for playing Carnivore cards. These are the animals at the top of the food chain, and they control the population size of herbivore  species in the ecosystem.<br/><br/>All 3 types of cards need to be in balance for the ecosystem to be sustainable in the long term. However, competition between species and the shifting nature of the surface of the Earth, will trigger  extinction events of animals and habitats that will open niches for new species to appear and  spread.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will score points for played cards, collected Victory Point Tokens, and achieved common and personal goals. The winner is the player with the most points after 3 periods of 7, 6, and 5 rounds respectively.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This may give you a nice bonus or penalty depending on which goods you decided to ship.  There is also a new original rule where the track building costs vary depending on the turn you&rsquo;re playing.   The new action Corruption should give you a break during some tough turns.<br/><br/>Chicago<br/>This expansion will request players to deal with strikes in their railroad network.  They&rsquo;ll have to decide if they want to end a strike peacefully or with the new action Repression.  If a player doesn&rsquo;t end a strike, he&rsquo;ll have to suffer tough consequences during the next turns.  The strikes will be tougher to settle as the game advance so players should make sure they have enough money to meet the demands of the unions.  If you use only a portion of the map, you&rsquo;ll be able to play it with 3 players.<br/><br/>",

Also included are several returning mechanics: modal double-faced cards (originally introduced in Zendikar Rising), changeling (originally introduced in Lorwyn), sagas (originally introduced in Dominaria), snow-covered lands (originally introduced in Ice Age), and snow mana (originally introduced in Coldsnap).<br/><br/>The set is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles, and it contains 285 cards (121 commons, 80 uncommons, 64 rares, 20 mythic rares, and 10 snow-covered basic lands). An additional 15 uncommons and 5 rares are found only in set boosters and theme boosters. The main set is also accompanied by two preconstructed commander decks that tie into its themes.<br/><br/>",

But the path ahead is treacherous and full of peril, for you must first find and activate the elusive homelinks that will guide you back to where you belong. The stakes are high, for failure to find and activate all four homelinks means certain doom in the unforgiving depths of space.<br/><br/>To emerge victorious in Solus: Lost, your objective is to locate all four home links within the deck and activate them using their corresponding artifacts. These artifacts are safeguarded by four overlords that you must confront and defeat.<br/><br/>In this game, you have two vital metrics to monitor: the damage to your ship and your pilot's age. During battles or specific scenarios, your ship may sustain damage, while your pilot's age will increase by increments of 10 years depending on certain situations. If either of these vital indicators reaches the ominous skull icon, you face defeat in the game.<br/><br/>To commence the game, start by shuffling your deck and placing two cards face down. From these two cards, you must select one to reveal and resolve its contents. Afterward, transfer that card to its corresponding discard pile and replace it with another face-down card. Repeat this process, making your choice once more. The card you unveil might present a variety of outcomes, ranging from benevolent beings capable of repairing your pilot's age to asteroid fields, hostile starfighters, or even the menacing time eater.<br/><br/>Engaging in combat involves rolling a twenty-sided die (D20) and following the damage scale to determine whether you, or the enemy sustains damage, or whether you both receive damage.<br/><br/>14 years+ | One Player | 20-30 minutes<br/><br/>Box Contents:<br/><br/>1 deck of cards<br/>20d Die<br/>2 Plastic cubes<br/>Instructions<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Recreate the action and drama of 17th century warfare on your tabletop with The Pikeman's Lament. Start by creating your officer; is he a natural leader raised from the ranks, the youngest son of a noble family, or an old veteran who has seen too many battles?<br/><br/>As you campaign, your officer will win honor and gain promotion, acquiring traits that may help lead his men to victory. Before each skirmish, your officer must raise his company from a wide range of unit options: Should he lean towards hard-hitting heavy cavalry or favor solid, defensively minded infantry? Companies are typically formed from 6-8 units, each made up of either 6 or 12 figures, and quick, decisive, and dramatic games are the order of the day. With core mechanisms based on Daniel Mersey's popular Lion Rampant rules, The Pikeman's Lament captures the military flavor of the 17th century, and allows you to recreate skirmishes and raids from conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War, the English Civil Wars, and the Great Northern War.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War Africa: The Congo 1998-2001 is a wargame simulation of the 2nd war fought over the Congo by two coalitions of African countries during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The consequences of these two wars are still felt today.<br/><br/>In the war of 1996-97, the corrupt regime of Joseph Mobutu was overthrown by a coalition of East African countries led by Rwanda. The country formerly known as Zaire was renamed Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Mobutu was replaced by another Cold War era dinosaur, Laurent Kabila, at the helm of the huge, mineral-rich African country. One year later, however, Kabila&rsquo;s sponsors, particularly Rwanda were not pleased. A number of issues including; the expulsion of Rwandan advisers from the DRC, Kabila recruiting Hutu combatants who had fled Rwanda, and the discrimination suffered by ethnic Tutsi in eastern DRC, moved Rwanda to try to remove Kabila from power. Supported by Uganda, Congolese rebels and the Tutsi minority in DRC, the Rwandans expected to win an easy victory, just as the year before. Kabila, however, was quickly supported by expeditionary forces of Zimbabwe and Angola, among other African countries, so overthrowing him turned out much harder than expected. The resulting conflict would involve about a dozen African countries, and cost the lives of an estimated 5 million people, thus earning the name of &ldquo;World War Africa&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The Great African War&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map represents 100 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents from one to three months, with 13 game turns (GT) covering the period from August 1998 to June 2001. Ground units represent brigade, regiment and battalion sized formations. The combat aircraft units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions over the time-frame of a turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>Published with Modern War #52<br/><br/>",

An empire fueled by an extraordinary discovery. The mineral that has become known as infernium. But all is not well, dark shadows from our deepest nightmares stalk the smog shrouded streets of London. An ancient evil is rising from defeat.<br/><br/>Players choose from 4 starter factions which they can expand and add to from a range of special character models. Each game is played over several turns, each turn consisting of four distinct phases.<br/><br/>During the maintenance phase players check for victory conditions defined by the specific scenario being played and resolves any issues created by the results of the previous turn, for example take dice rolls for wound recovery.<br/><br/>During the initiative phase players roll dice for initiative to determine who will activate its characters first.<br/><br/>During the activation phase the players activate their faction, one model at a time, moving, shooting and assaulting enemy models. Once the first player has activated all his models, the second player does likewise.<br/><br/>Finally, all close combat events is settled during the combat phase.<br/><br/>The easy to follow campaign rules and rich background create endless possibilities for gamers to build faction and achieve their own aims. Factions grow with each battle and may spend their hard-earned coins on new weapons, skills and attribute improvements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduces a new Aerial Commander to Risk 2210 along with a corresponding deck of Command cards.  According to Insurgency Gaming,<br/><br/>&quot;Each of these new commanders, once brought into play, allows the player who owns them to fly a Sortie at the beginning of each of their turns prior to making a standard attack.  <br/>FLYING A SORTIE <br/>Each sortie flight takes part in three of distinct stages:<br/>1. Outbound Flight<br/>2. Bombing<br/>3. Return Flight &quot;<br/><br/>Purchase price includes two Aerial commanders and the 20 card deck.<br/><br/>Card distribution:<br/><br/>3 x Propaganda<br/><br/>3 x Resurrection <br/>3 x phoenix <br/>3 x Storm Troopers<br/><br/>2 x Kamikaze  <br/>2 x Aerial Assault <br/>2 x Air Raid <br/>1 x Dark Angel<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>Aerial Command Token:<br/><br/>     The major change brought with the Aerial Assault command deck is the introduction of the new Aerial Commander. Unlike previous expansion decks, the Aerial Assault deck comes with two neutral colored commanders in order to slot directly into game play as and when required. Each of these new commanders, once brought into play, allows the player who owns then to fly a Sortie at the beginning of each of their turns prior to making a standard attack. At any point where the Aerial commander is not flying a sortie it may be moved like any other commander and also receives the standard d8 defensive dice.<br/><br/><br/>Flying A Sortie:<br/>Each sortie flight takes part in three distinct stages:<br/><br/>1. Outbound Flight - player rolls a d6 dice to establish the maximum amount of territories the Aerial Commander may fly and moves the commander accordingly. The Commander can move between neighboring territories up to the value on the dice - movement may include both land and water territories even if they are controlled by another player. Once the commander has come to the end of its outbound flight the controlling player may choose to commence bombing, this need not be the case if the commander comes to rest in a territory they control.<br/>    * In such a case the controlling player may simply choose to finish the sortie here leaving the commander in place within that territory.<br/><br/>2. Bombing - once the Aerial commander has come to rest above an enemy territory the controlling player should roll a d6 dice and follow the appropriate action dependent upon the number rolled...<br/>    * 1 &amp; 2 Plane is hit by flak. STOP ATTACK. Aerial commander receives half d6 roll on return flight.<br/>    * 3 MISS. Commander may continue bombing.<br/>    * 4, 5 &amp; 6 HIT. Destroy one army in the territory being bombed. Bombing may continue. A maximum of threee armies may be destroyed in this fashion before making the return flight.<br/><br/>3. Return Flight - player rolls a d6 dice to establish the maximum amount of territories the Aerial Commander can move baring in mind any reductions in movement caused by flak damage in the Bombing phase. If the Aerial commander cannot return to a land territory owned by the same player or if it ends its flight above a water territory then it crashes and is destroyed. Once the sortie has ended then that player may continue with the normal run of play.<br/><br/>Additional Aerial Commanders:<br/><br/>     Although only two Aerial Commanders are supplied with the Aerial Assault deck, additional commanders can be obtained from Insurgency Gaming. These additional commanders may be bought by any player during the normal purchase phase of play for the standard price paid for commanders and then placed accordingly. <br/><br/><br/>What if There&rsquo;s More Than Two Players:<br/><br/>      Due to the fact that the Aerial Assault deck is originally only provided with two Aerial commanders instead of the five that would ultimately be needed for all players to use them, this is where the two Aerial Assault cards included within the deck come into play, and where their inclusion or exclusion from the deck become of paramount importance. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the case where only two Aerial commander tokens are available, by playing with standard rules, this would mean that the first two players to obtain the commanders would then have sole use of the Aerial command deck and this have a hugely unfair advantage over the other players. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     In order to rectify this, if only two Aerial commander tokens are available, then the Aerial command deck becomes open to all players from the beginning of the game regardless of whether or not a player controls an Aerial commander. Please note that sorties can and only be carried out through the use of Aerial commanders and, in this case, these can only be brought into play through the respective Aerial Assault cards within the deck. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     If there are enough Aerial commanders for all players then the Aerial Assault cards should be removed from the deck. This means that the purchase of Aerial commanders now falls into line with the standard rules. Please note, in such an instance the Aerial Assault deck is now only open to those players with Aerial commanders in play. <br/><br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>     Risk 2210 A.D.<br/><br/><br/>",

After breaking out of the Normandy Bridgehead in July 1944, the 4th Armored had led the advance across France to the German Westwall fortifications, earning the nickname &ldquo;Patton&rsquo;s Finest.&rdquo; Desperate to stop the American blitzkrieg, and recapture the vital railroad center at Nancy, Hitler placed General Von Rundstedt in command. To support the counterattack, emergency reinforcements were ordered up to the Western Front that included new and improved models of Panther tanks. The armored clash east of Arracourt would confirm that the Americans had learned well the lessons of war, and would foreshadow the desperate fighting in the Ardennes a few months later.<br/><br/>Revanche! The Battle of Dompaire is a simulation of the armored clash between the Free French 2nd Armored Division and counter attacking German forces of the 112th Panzer Brigade. After breaking out of the Normandy Bridgehead in July, the Free French 2nd Armored, led by General Jacques Leclerc, triumphantly entered Paris and advanced across the French countryside intent on liberating the province of Lorraine. Desperate to stop the Allied blitzkrieg, and recapture the vital railroad center at Nancy, Hitler placed General Von Runstedt in command. To support the counter attack, emergency reinforcements were ordered up to the Western Front that included new and improved models of Panther tanks. The armored clash at Dompaire on the 12th and 13th of September confirmed that the French had learned well the lessons of war, and that Allied victory in the West now was now at hand.<br/><br/>Tough Hombres: The Battle of Mairy is a wargame simulation of the clash between the U.S. Third Army&rsquo;s 90th Infantry Division (nicknamed the &ldquo;Tough Hombres&rdquo;) and counterattacking German forces led by the 106th Panzer Brigade and elements of the newly formed 59th Volksgrenadier Regiment. After breaking out of the Normandy Bridgehead in July, Patton&rsquo;s Third Army led the advance across France to Germany&rsquo;s Westwall fortifications. Desperate to stop the American blitzkrieg, and forestall the American&rsquo;s drive on the vital railroad center at Nancy, General Otto von Knobelsdorf ordered an attack by the newly formed 106th Panzer Brigade, equipped with new Panther tanks and commanded by the legendary commander Colonel Franz Bake, against the 90th Infantry Division. Although nicknamed &ldquo;Tough Hombres&rdquo; for their divisional patch letters &ldquo;TO&rdquo; (for Texas and Oklahoma, the two states whose National Guard units comprised the division), its record was far from distinguished. The division had run-up ghastly casualty rates during the Normandy campaign (some battalions suffering a staggering 400% rate of loss!) and the sacking of its commander. The Germans expected this American formation, charged with holding Patton&rsquo;s open left flank, to quickly fold in their early morning night attack of September 8th&hellip;<br/><br/>",

The game is for two or more players and is set in a plausible near-future Earth, but also lets you create a setting with its open-source approach. Polyversal is compatible with all 6mm-15mm miniatures and is fully customizable. Boxed sets of the game can be purchased with or without miniatures. Sets with miniatures feature models from multiple 6mm and 10mm miniatures manufacturers including Brigade Models, Dark Realm, Plasmablast Games, Microworld Games, and Hawk Wargames (Now TT Combat).<br/><br/>Polyversal also allows players to design their own Combatant Tiles using a free web application called Arsenal. The input is a player's miniature and design choices- the output is a playable game tile. All tiles contain stats for units in the game and they are also used to form battlegroups- a visual command structure. A points-based system balances everything out based on the selected options, weaponry, armor, class of unit, etc.<br/><br/>Multiple videos help explain Polyversal's gameplay and how to use Arsenal.<br/><br/>The game is available electronically on Wargame Vault and also directly from Collins Epic Wargames (production release: 11-1-2022).<br/><br/>See the Expansions Tab for pre-designed Miniatures Battlegroups with Tiles released by Collins Epic Wargames.<br/><br/>2023 Origins Award Nominee - Best Miniatures Game<br/><br/>",

Each round has three quick phases that everyone participates in simultaneously: Adventures, Dice, and Actions. In the Adventure Phase you'll draw an Adventure card, which could indicate Smooth Sailing or add a new Adventure to your maps, like Sea Monsters, Storms, Pirates, and more! The Dice Phase consists of rolling two types of dice to determine the wind direction and exploration events. In the Action Phase each player can choose to Sail, Explore, or Visit a Port. As you Sail and Explore you&rsquo;ll add to your Story. When you Visit a Port you&rsquo;ll get to tell your Story to gain Reputation. The player with the most Reputation at the end of 25 rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>",

One year later, a Japanese-American regiment began to form. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, eventually also including the 100th Infantry Battalion formed in Hawai'i, racked up more decorations than any regiment in American military history: 18,143 awards for battlefield valor, including 21 Medals of Honor.<br/><br/>Go for Broke is a book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series, with 20 new scenarios by Mike Perryman depicting the actions of America's toughest fighters in the last years of the Second World War. There are also 77 new die-cut and mounted playing pieces depicting this regiment in its own color scheme.<br/><br/>Go for Broke is not a complete product: ownership of 1940: The Fall of France, Elsenborn Ridge and Battle of the Bulge is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle of the Somme is a solitaire, tactical (individual men) WW1 board wargame simulating some of the events of July 1st, 1916, the first day of the Somme campaign, and the bloodiest day in British army history.  In the game, you (the gamer) take charge of one 45-soldier platoon going over the top against the German trenches and machine guns opposite (played by the game system), in various historical scenarios.  Naturally, the object of the game is for your platoon to take the German trench with as few casualties as possible.<br/><br/>But wait. There is a twist.  Each of your men in the game is represented by a named, individual counter.  Before play, you must choose one man that &quot;represents&quot; you.  To win the scenario, your platoon must take the enemy trench, AND your man must survive.  And your platoon is one from many historical units that attacked that first day.  For instance, the standard scenario (&quot;Red Hand at Thiepval Wood&quot;) represents one platoon from A Company, 14th Royal Irish Rifles (Belfast Young Citizens), which is part of the 109th Brigade, 36th (Ulster) Division, attacking northwest of Thiepval. Other historical scenarios are also provided (seventeen in all, plus campaign games).  Regular, Territorial, and New Army units--soldiers and officers--are represented in the scenarios.<br/><br/>Essentially, Battle of the Somme has been designed to be an experience game, in some ways a mix be-tween a traditional wargame and an historical role-play game. Essentially, you will set up your plan of attack, and then watch the action &ldquo;unfold&rdquo; before your eyes, as your (mainly) Pals formations go over the top toward their destiny.<br/><br/>This PDF version includes a 50-page illustrated, color rule book containing all the rules, tables, advanced game rules, and optional rules necessary for play, a 7&quot; x 10&quot; hexagon mapsheet, 540 individually names color soldier counters, game markers, and a Reference Card, 17 historical scenarios (see below), campaign games, historical commentary, and designer's notes.  After scanning and printing the game components, you will need to separate them before play.  You will also need a six-sided die, and a deck of standard playing cards to play.<br/><br/>From the Designer's Notes:  &quot;Individually named counters remind us that individuals fought and died that summer morning, 60,000 British casualties all told (including 20,000 killed) by the end of the first day. Success was spotty.... To HQ it didn&rsquo;t matter if particular soldiers or units survived or not, as long as objectives were taken and the timetable met. But to each particular soldier involved it did matter, and the game&rsquo;s victory conditions reflect this. And shame on you if you decide to 'go to ground' and let your pals lead the advance on the enemy trench. There&rsquo;s no rule against this sort of behavior, but it says something about your character and courage if you resort to such a tactic, even in a game.&quot;<br/><br/>Battle of the Somme is a new edition of Poor Bloody Infantry: Somme thas was published by Minden Games in 2016.  The basic game is unchanged, but this edition adds 400 new soldiers and counters, triples the size of the rulebook to provide more detail and background information, adds more scenarios, and, importantly, provides advanced game rules for the first time that individually rate soldiers and uses rules that provide more complexity while retaining the high playability of the standard game. <br/><br/>The game rates high in playability and historicity, with scenarios that can be completed in about half an hour.  The rules and scenarios will hold interest for miniature wargamers as well.  The game provides good, old-fashioned historical wargaming fun, as well as solid and sobering historical lessons about WWI trench warfare.<br/><br/>Also provided in this PDF version is the Battle of the Somme Extra Counter Set, which includes two additional soldier counter sheets, two historical platoons (well over 300 new counters overall), and two additional scenarios involving these platoons.  With this module, you will have everything you need to create any number of unique platoons representing units going over the top during the first day of the Big Push.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>1.

        "description": "Ultra Simple Engine for Miniature Engagements. <br/>Simple miniatures skirmish rules designed for fast playing 15mm or 20mm games. Most mechanics are based on the roll of a six-sided die.<br/><br/>More than six settings have been published, including:<br/><br/>    Sci Fi<br/>    Fantasy<br/>    WW2<br/>    Modern <br/>    American Civil War<br/>    Starship Combat<br/><br/><br/>From the publisher's website (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.15mm.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.15mm.co.uk</a>): <br/>The Turn Sequence of the game follows a simple path of firstly the Initiative Phase where all players roll 1D6 and the highest roll wins the initiative for the turn (important later on!). Then the main part of the turn, the In Play Phase where all characters in the game are activated not by the side upon which they fight but by their Elan Rating. This means better troops and vehicles move and fight before poorer quality troops and vehicles and within each Elan banding from 6 to 1 activation begins with the initiative holding player. When activated each character can choose TWO actions, these include move, ranged fire, melee, hunker down, special action, unique action. The character may choose two different actions OR the same one twice with a modifier; very flexible in battle. Ranged fire and melee are based on opposed single D6 rolls with modifiers for troop type and weapon ratings. This super fast system results in targets being Killed, Struck or Winged by attacks. Killed removes them from play while the other two results negatively effect their further performance in the game. The hunker down action allows characters to take cover against attack while special actions cover those things detailed in the USE ME Advanced Rules and unique actions are created when needed for a scenario.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a stand-alone game, not an expansion.<br/><br/>Flashing Steel is a skirmish miniatures game (one figure = one combatant) in the Song of Blades and Heroes family.  The flavour is smack in the middle of The Three Musketeers and pirate action of all kinds. Swing from those chandeliers or ratlines. Kick the chair or skewer the roast chicken.<br/><br/>Flashing Steel was written to address a couple of key changes needed from Song of Blades and Heroes for this genre. One was to reflect the slower rate of fire for matchlock weapons. That was easy enough.<br/><br/>The second was to bring in the flair and 'swashbuckling' aspects of the period into the rules. It is often forgotten that schools of martial arts were as thorough and widespread in Europe as they were in Japan in the 1500's through the 1600's. There were all kinds of flashy moves and clever tricks.<br/><br/>So the rules weave in this kind of option to do more than simply move-attack-resolve-repeat. More than just strict combat options, the Swashbuckling rules allow you to be more interactive with your terrain. It opens up more of the game to narrative, or story-telling wargaming. All of which is part of the great Songs engine, of course. With Flashing Steel we have tried to extend and strengthen that side of the system.  -Andrew Boswell, designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If you are interested in short filler card or board games, or portable boardgames to bring along on travel trips, then the Rainbow Deck is for you! It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system. <br/> The Rainbow Deck (RD) 4.0 is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and total 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by colour and digit. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards are also numbered at one corner from 0 to 119, and another corner having alphabet letters. At the center of the card, there is a picture and word for playing picture or word related games. Surrounding the picture are 4 triangles for playing path-laying games.<br/><br/>The RD can be adapted to play a variety of modern designer games, like what a deck of playing cards does for traditional cardgames. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games!<br/><br/>The RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x2 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games.<br/><br/>Decks that the RD can be mapped into<br/><br/>     Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119<br/>     Letters with values similar to Letter Head<br/>     12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3)<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values<br/>     12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values<br/>     6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values <br/>     6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards<br/>     n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards<br/>     1 copy x value 1,..., 12 copies x value 12(Q), 13 copies x value 13(K+joker)<br/>     Double-Nine domino set x 2 copies<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rainbow Deck - A Deck for Infinite Games!<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Interesting idea.

        "description": "The Nagorno-Karabakh War: Soviet Fallout: 1992-1994 is a simulation of the war between Azerbaijan and the breakaway province (Oblast) of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited by a majority of Armenians. After the first ethnic clashes between Armenians and Azeri, during the death throes of the Soviet Union, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence from Azerbaijan. The Azeri launched an ethnic cleansing campaign. Faced with annihilation, the Armenians resisted and fought back, conquering most of Nagorno-Karabakh and parts of eastern Azerbaijan, a situation which has lasted until today (2019).<br/><br/>The Nagorno-Karabakh War is a two player game: the Armenian (AR) player and the Azeri (AZ) player. The AR player must fight a numerically superior foe but he has the advantage of interior lines and a unified command, whereas the AZ player has a greater supply of former Red Army weapons and ammunition but has to fight not only the Armenians but also political infighting and low morale. In this game, the enemy population it is not the victim of collateral damage: the enemy population is the target, so conquering towns and villages and practicing ethnical cleansing is a key aspect of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first to get the set amount of hooch before your rivals. But that&rsquo;s easier said than done. First you&rsquo;ve got to take control of a location, put up a still, and hire some muscle to defend it. The other syndicates are doing the same, but they&rsquo;re also trying to stop you from becoming the most powerful crime lord in the city. They might go to war, sending their soldiers to take out your operation. Or maybe they&rsquo;ll send a Button Man in to take out all your guys and then they can stroll in and take over the place themselves. Sure you&rsquo;ll have your own Syndicate members to help you, but that won&rsquo;t get you all the way. You&rsquo;re going to need a public face as well. Maybe you should bribe a Judge. He can help you with all those pesky City Politics they might throw at you. Maybe a Mouthpiece to help the law bend your way. But something to keep in mind: you paid them off, maybe someone else might be able to pay more. Hooch is a game of alcohol, greed, backstabbing and violence. It&rsquo;s the American way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea of turning the violence of war into a game seems self-contradictory, yet despite this fundamental contradiction, or perhaps even because of it, games about war continue to grow in popularity. Until now, however, books on the subject have focused either on the recreational side of wargaming or on its military application. Here, Peter Perla presents the first genuine synthesis of both aspects, drawing on his own longtime experiences as a gaming hobbyist and a professional wargamer, in the U.S. defense community. Such a dual, inside perspective is unique among authors and enables him to offer a thorough evaluation of the two arenas, their similarities and differences and their influence on each other.<br/><br/>This book provides the most comprehensive and coherent discussion and analysis of wargaming ever written. Avoiding the sensationalism and superficiality of other works on the subject, it carefully explains the nature of the tool - the wargame - and the process of using it - wargaming. It argues for a better balance between professional realism and hobby playability and for increased cross-fertilization to educate and enlighten users.<br/><br/>Perla looks first at the history of wargaming in both its hobby and professional incarnations, and especially at its use by the Naval War College. He then draws on historical experience to define the fundamental principles of what wargaming is, and what it is not, and describes the subjects that wargaming is most useful for exploring. He also suggests how best to take advantage of its capabilities and downplay its limitiations. Finally, he examines current trends in wargaming in light of those historical perspectives and theoritical principles and projects into the future.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dirty Little Secrets players are detectives with a slightly loose code of ethics. You&rsquo;ve used some tactics you&rsquo;re not proud of, but it&rsquo;s always gotten the job done. Now some of the other detectives are on a case that might reveal your dirty little secret. Can&rsquo;t let that happen, so better you expose their secret first. At least your partner has your back; seems it&rsquo;s hard to find someone you can rely on in this department.<br/><br/>Players will work with their partner to use deduction and rough tactics to uncover your opponents&rsquo; cards, while using misdirection to cover your own tracks. Players must gather evidence, information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and choose the right times to make accusations. Be careful about it, though, as every action you take has a trade-off, and often this gives your opponents knowledge to use against you. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAim of the GameYou (and your partner) are trying to have the most Points at the end of the game. Points are gained by keeping your most valuable card secret until the end of the game, and using collected evidence to remove your opponents&rsquo; cards. During the game you&rsquo;ll use your chosen Action cards to gain information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and tactically position your cards to confound your opponents and open up new Actions for you to use. The game ends immediately after all the Evidence is collected.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay OverviewEach player has the same 8 Action cards. They are each numbered with the Time &ndash; 1 a.m. up to 8 a.m. This Time doubles as the card&rsquo;s value in points if it scores at the end of the game. Players will choose 5 cards to play with each game, keeping their choices secret. <br/>The game begins with a shared Evidence pool and every player with five face-down hidden cards: three forming a Front Line row and two making a Back Office row. In a 3- or 4-player game, there is also a Chief&rsquo;s Badge in the centre of play that is given to a player whenever they lose a card.<br/><br/>In turn, players take up to 2 unique actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect an Evidence<br/>     Accuse an opponent&rsquo;s card<br/>     Use a particular card from your Front Line (Players can use 2 different cards on their turn, just not the same one twice).<br/><br/><br/>Or they can spend BOTH actions to:<br/><br/>     Cover their tracks (rearrange 3 of their cards and flip them upside down again)<br/>     Claim the Chief&rsquo;s badge from another player, or use the Chief&rsquo;s badge as any card action (In 3- 4-player games).<br/><br/><br/>Early in the game, players will primarily collect Evidence and use their Front Line cards to gain information. Later, they&rsquo;ll manipulate setups and try to use Evidence to eliminate cards from play. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Evidence<br/><br/>Collecting Evidence is crucial to victory, because you need it to make accusations. By itself, Evidence is worth 1 point for every 2 you have. But if you successfully use one to accuse an opponent, it goes into your Evidence Locker and is worth a full point. If you accuse incorrectly, however, the Evidence goes to your opponent.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Accusations<br/>To win you&rsquo;ll need to reduce your opponents&rsquo; score by eliminating their high value cards. You can make random guesses, but that wastes both valuable Evidence and actions. Instead, you&rsquo;ll want to spend actions using your cards to get information first. Then just before they cover their tracks to remove what you know, you make an accusation. If you&rsquo;re right the Evidence doubles in value to a full point. But if you&rsquo;re wrong, it&rsquo;s lost to your opponent. Or worse, if you mis-accuse their Red Herring card, they get an additional Evidence from the pool.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using a card<br/><br/>You can use any card that&rsquo;s still hidden in your Front line &ndash; but be careful! Don&rsquo;t point at it, flip it, or do anything that might indicate WHICH card you&rsquo;re using. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re trying to mislead your opponent.<br/><br/>The low value/Time cards are powerful actions, as they will get you solid information like the Time difference between 2 cards of an opponent, or which cards in their Front line have &ldquo;finger-prints&rdquo; on them. This will help you deduce their cards, while other actions like the Frame-up, provide you with tactical moves to reposition some of your &ndash; or an opponent&rsquo;s &ndash; cards. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Bluffing?<br/><br/>In the basic game you are only able to take the actions of cards you legitimately have in your Front Line. This provides a more deduction and tactical game. However, optional bluffing rules allow players to take any action they wish &ndash; legal or not. But be careful that your opponent doesn&rsquo;t call you out that you&rsquo;re lying, or you&rsquo;ll start losing cards! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Covering your tracks<br/><br/>As your valuable cards and actions are revealed by opponents, or as they gain more information, you&rsquo;ll want to get a little breathing room. Covering your tracks may take your whole turn but it lets you choose 3 of your cards (Front line or in your reserved Back Office) to hide again and place wherever you like. It&rsquo;s a great way to get back in the game, or foil an opponent before they have the chance to accuse you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chief&rsquo;s badge<br/>The Chief would prefer that her detectives are focused on other criminal matters, and so in 3- and 4-player games, whenever a player loses a card to an accusation they receive the Chief&rsquo;s badge for protection. A player with the Chief&rsquo;s badge cannot be accused, and can use both their actions to activate the badge as any card &ndash; in play or not.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the GameOnce the last Evidence token is claimed, the game ends. It&rsquo;s a timer, as once collected, Evidence never re-enters the central pool. <br/>Players score most of their points from the highest card they managed to keep hidden in their Front Line at the end of the game. Note that the Dirty Secret card is valued at 4 a.m., but if IT is the scoring card (highest one hidden), it scores an extra 7 points. The trick, of course, is making sure it&rsquo;s both hidden AND the highest Time in the front at game-end.<br/><br/>Each Players also score points for their collected Evidence<br/><br/><br/>     1 per 2 unused Evidence<br/>     1 per Evidence in locker (used to successfully accuse)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Dirty Little Secrets is a game of &lsquo;playing the player&rsquo; as much as it is a game about your card-play. Good players are highly responsive to their opponents, and learn to push and prod player behaviours to their favour. With only 8 cards, it&rsquo;s not about having the right card &ndash; it&rsquo;s about knowing when and how to use it.<br/><br/>For rookies, there is a suggested set of cards to use that have more straight-forward actions that let these players be effective until they learn some of their own tricks and strategies.<br/><br/>",

And if that is not enough to beat your neighbors&hellip; steal their garden gnomes and steam roll over their flower beds!<br/><br/>Over 50 unique  illustrations and over 60 cards that all are functionally different! Lawnarchy is a turn-taking riddle game with lots of tactical thinking, changing objectives and interactive back and forth.<br/><br/>Each player owns a garden of 4 starting cards, only a fence separates you to your neighbor's garden. The rules are simple: Each turn you have three options and pick one card, but the possibilities are complex. 1) You convince the jury and pick a jury card from the examination board - these objectives constantly change! 2) You do some gardening, and replace a card with a garden card from the common &quot;garden center&quot; - same as the jury, all garden cards have different requirements! 3) You squabble with your neighbor by picking a squabble card. You can destroy their garden, steal their gnomes, or rearrange their garden. You have to figure out the best move - a wrong one and your neighbor will get ahead!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Rules cover air and ground operations, photo-reconnaissance, convoys, accidents, world opinion and nuclear warfare.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The 17 x 22&quot; map (with 3/4&quot; hexes) covers the island of Cuba. The 448 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show US, Soviet and Cuban ground troops, air forces, convoys and more. The 40 playing cards reflect the political and strategic options open to the national leaders.&quot;<br/><br/>An innovative approach to simulator the Cuban Missile Crisis in which players use cards denoted specific alert statuses and actions that allow players to win the game without ever actually going to war (which was historically the case).  The American player must use his recon resources to uncover all the Soviet assets in Cuba while building up his forces for a possible invasion.  The problem is ending the threat to the US posed by the Soviet weapons in Cuba without provoking World War III.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Furoticon is an adults-only anthro novelty card game, focusing on strategy and artwork. The cards are available for purchase online, or at furry conventions, such as Anthrocon and Further Confusion.<br/><br/>In Furoticon, you play as an Owner of your harem, pitting your Furres (characters) against theirs, where they will use their wit and sexual prowess to break through the opposing harems and bring their owners to orgasm. The last Owner to remain without climax is the winner!<br/><br/>Each player in the game typically uses a 40-card deck, known as a Black Book. There is a shorter variant of the game where a 20-card deck is used, and each player starts with half Stamina Points (life).<br/><br/>The cards are meant to be traded amongst players and collectors. Decks can be customized and improved with cards that the player owns. Cards from any of the five sets can be used interchangeably.<br/><br/>One of the main purposes of Furoticon is to introduce players and collectors to artists that they may not have known about before. Artist credit, as well as a URL to their site, is found at the bottom of every card to encourage people to explore the artists of Furoticon.<br/><br/>Harem members move from the Owners' Haven to the Scene, where the players can then enter Bed with their furres, and attempt to climax the other furres. Each card has a number of traits that affect gameplay, including Gender, Species, Pleasure Experience, Skills, and more. In addition to Furre cards, there are also Treats and Actions, which act as items and instant effects in the game to add a bit more depth and strategy.<br/><br/>There are five sets so far, each with its own theme:<br/><br/><br/>     Vanilla: Also known as &quot;1st Vanilla&quot;, the Vanilla set was the original Furoticon set to be produced. With 179 playable cards, it provided the foundation upon which the rest of the game was built. There was no overall theme with this set, focusing instead on developing strategies and gender characteristics, as well as providing appealing artwork. 1st Vanilla boosters are no longer available on the Furoticon store, but the original Herm and Otherkin starters are still available for purchase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Triskelion: Triskelion is Furoticon's premier BDSM set, focusing on masters and slaves, and bondage and pain play. Gameplay heavily focuses on adding &quot;pain counters&quot; to furres, which alter the Pleasure Experience (attack) values in either a positive or negative manner. Additionally, Alteration treats are prominant in this set, providing boosts to the Furres they're attached to, symbolizing bondage gear. Triskelion boosters are no longer available for purchase, but the two Starters (Male/Herm and Female/Otherkin) still are available on their website.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Second Vanilla: Second Vanilla focuses on college life, and showing the life and sexual adventures of such characters as Boy Toy and Lily Tyla. The set has no real gimmick, instead focusing on expanding the underlying foundation of the game. Second Vanilla boosters are running very low (as of December 8, 2013), and will soon be out of stock. There were no Second Vanilla starter decks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Tribes of Tanglebrook: Tribes of Tanglebrook focused on a Tribal setting, with transformation and tribal markings being the prominent theme. Each Tribe in the set has a specific gameplay focus, from Wolves and their ability to intimidate furres from entering bed, to Dragons and their slow, but extremely powerful abilities. Tribes of Tanglebrook is still available in the Furoticon store, both with Boosters and with the three Starter Decks (Otters, Wolves, and Dragons).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Third Vanilla: Strawberry:  Third Vanilla: Strawberry (Or just &quot;Strawberry&quot;) continues the college setting introduced in Second Vanilla. This set introduced Owners with special stats that alter the core rules of the game. The set did not introduce many new mechanics, instead focusing on developing the group play dynamic of the game further, and making the game easier for beginners to get into. Boosters for this set include 15 cards instead of the previous 10, and while there are no starter decks, there are two &quot;starter boxes&quot;, which come with four &quot;mini-decks&quot;, made up of 20 cards each, and designed to be used out of the box with up to 3 other players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Di'Ahla's Awakening: Di'Ahla's Awakening is the second BDSM themed set in the Furoticon lineup. Apparently taking place before and after the events of &quot;Triskelion&quot;, It serves as an addition to the gameplay elements introduced there. Pain counters and the &quot;Masochist&quot; and &quot;Sadist&quot; abilities reign dominant in this edition just as in &quot;Triskelion&quot;. Overall simply an expansion to the overall theme and gameplay alterations made by &quot;Triskelion&quot;. There is also a BDSM Starter Set for sale which includes both of the two-player deckboxes from the &quot;Di'Ahla's Awakening&quot; edition as well as two starter decks from the &quot;Triskelion&quot; edition.<br/><br/><br/>There is another set planned to be released by July 2014:Fortune at Vell's End.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to XXXenophile.<br/><br/>",

Building is done in secret behind a barn wood divider that crosses the center of the barn wood (or bamboo) playing board.  Many strategies are used in building a solid structure as to withstand attack from your opponent.  Once both players finish building a structure that is taller than the center divider, the divider is removed before the battle begins.  Cylindrical foam weapons are fired by flicking them at each others' structure.  Alternate shots and the first player to completely clear the blocks off of their opponent's side of the board wins.  It is customary to shake hands with your opponent after every game of #KdB. Remember, You can always build again!&copy;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is somewhat reminiscent of $25,000 Pyramid. A circular card with a visible category and 10 hidden items is placed into a viewer. A chart that is placed into the lower part of the viewer indicates which 2 players will play this round, and which will be giving the clues as opposed to guessing. The clue-giver presses a button to reveal each of the 10 items in turn and gives clues to the other player until the word is either guessed, or the clue-giver decides to pass. Passed words may not be revisited later. Once all 10 words have been gone through, or time runs out, each of those two players receive a point for each word that was guessed correctly. The next pair of players are then designated, a new category card is placed into the viewer, and the process is repeated until all of the pairings on the player chart have been completed. This tends to be a balancing factor, since all players get a round where they are paired with the better players, as well as the not-so-good players.<br/><br/>",

As such, you will maneuver your company representatives (factors) into prosperous regions.  You will leverage your influence with the established commonwealths.  You will weigh the need for a merchant navy.  But above all you must navigate changing economic conditions...<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The board is divided into five continental regions.  Associated with these is a deck of prosperity cards that match the regions.  Each player is dealt a couple cards; in addition some cards are dealt face up in common.  As play proceeds, players try to acquire locations they think will be prosperous.  They deduce this based on the cards they can see, plus the actions of other players.  At the end of a number of turns, all prosperity cards are revealed and regions are ranked based on number of matching cards.  Factors within those regions are then increased or decreased based on this ranking.  This sequence is repeated several times, after which the game ends.<br/><br/>Player actions include drawing influence cards, expanding factors, building ports and fleets, and movement.  At times, open locations will be taken over by a player.  At other times a hostile takeover will be necessary, in which case the right influence and a nearby fleet will make all the difference.<br/><br/>The goal is simple: to have the most factors on the board at game end.<br/><br/>",

Morale is simpler and easier.<br/>     Vehicles no longer become Bogged Down if they fail a Cross Check, they now simply stop moving until their next turn. They can still shoot in the Shooting Step.<br/>     The mission section has been updated, adding extra missions and the Battle Plans Mission Selector.<br/>     No army books will become invalidated in the transition.<br/>     No Unit Cards or Unit entries in current books will be invalidated. <br/>     Each new book from now on will also be released with its own Unit Card pack.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description (extract) from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both armies were surprised, but MacDonald struck first. His attack lost impetus in the rain and confusion, allowing Bl&uuml;cher to strike back. The Allies inflicted heavy losses on the French, weakening Napoleon&rsquo;s position in Germany. The French defeats here, at Kulm (four days later), and Dennewitz (on 6 September) negated Napoleon&rsquo;s victory at Dresden.<br/><br/>This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).<br/><br/>",

Well, some of them anyway as you want to get the sheep that you tend home before the other player does.<br/><br/>In Hello, Dolly!, each player owns nine sheep which each start the game on one of the 18 mountains that surround the valley. Albert the shepherd starts the game on a green clover space on the path that circles the valley.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player moves one of his sheep in a straight line until it hits either the edge of the board or another sheep; this movement cannot block another sheep from moving on a subsequent turn. The player then moves Albert clockwise on the path as many spaces as the number of spaces moved by the sheep that turn. (For example, if the sheep moved four intersections, then Albert moves four spaces.) If after moving, the triangle where Albert is located has sheep on all three vertices, then Albert collects those sheep, removing them from the board and placing them on the path back to his barn.<br/><br/>The player who first gets five of his sheep on the path to the barn wins!<br/><br/>",

Zombis are mutating and hordes of the undead are being driven by powerful new masters. Heroes fight valiantly to save the Isle, but the virus-fueled undead seem impossible to overcome. The Virus has infected the Heroes as well, empowering them to perform amazing feats. Rather than using their newfound abilities to save the Isle, however, they have begun to work against each other in a desperate struggle for self preservation. The Creator will soon reign triumphant as the Isle swiftly falls into the hands of the Dead...<br/><br/>Rise of The Creator is a 30 card Player Interactive Enhancement for Chaos Isle: Zombi Deck. Now players can use the new Feat Deck to perform amazing actions to bolster their own Characters or to wreak havoc with the other players. Each hand plays different using the new Virus Deck. Attack each other with the 'Homicidal Characters' Virus or succumb to the Virus with 'The Virus Unleashed'. With 200 possibilities no hand will feel the same! Mutation cards inhabit the Enemy Deck, making Zombis more powerful than ever and Tasks more treacherous. Also infesting the Enemy Deck are 2 new Boss Zombis.<br/><br/>",

In this alternate-reality, 1950&rsquo;s era setting &ndash; we are not alone! Aliens from the planet Mars have secretly descended upon Earth. As a member of an elite multi-national squad, you must defend our home against the vicious, little green men as they try to abduct our wives, mutilate our cows and boil our oceans!<br/><br/>To complicate matters (as if inside-out cows weren't bad enough), the aliens can replicate our DNA and clone human beings. They know our agency is the last line of defense and they have infiltrated our ranks. That trusted partner of yours may actually be an alien spy! Hey, I don&rsquo;t remember you holding your hand over your heart during the National Anthem &ndash; when was the last time your DNA was screened?<br/><br/>About the game:<br/><br/>Mars vs. Earth is a simple card game, playable by 3 to 10 players in 30 to 60 minutes, that employs a modified &quot;hidden loyalty&quot; system.  Mars vs. Earth introduces new mechanics, such as scaled martian powers and an accusation/trial system, that sit atop a wacky theme to increase play value and enjoyment.<br/><br/>Think your neighbor is secretly working against the agency?  Keep him from leading missions, or better yet make a formal accusation and bring him to trial for his evil deeds!  Of course you need to be careful - if you accidentally oust a true human from the agency they will become a lowly citizen with far fewer powers to help combat the martian threats!<br/><br/>The game is over when either the humans have foiled enough of the martians' plans or the martians have destroyed every last human resource, be it military defenses, tech, people or food.  In either case, Mars vs. Earth is guaranteed to create some of the greatest play experiences imaginable!<br/><br/>",

During the weeks leading up to the operation, the Red Army has amassed a massive army. However, the Germans have not been idle&mdash;they have spent months preparing for the attack. It is here that we meet the forces of the Soviet Union and Germany in Stalin&rsquo;s Onslaught.<br/><br/>The Soviet war machine is well prepared to assault the German lines. In Stalin&rsquo;s Onslaught, you can command the prisoners of the fearless 8th Independent Penal Battalion as they test the German defences, or be the cutting edge of Operation Bagration with your regiment of IS-2 heavy tanks! Then, follow up your breakthrough with an assault group from the elite 8th Guards Rifle Corps, specially designed to smash the German fortified line.<br/><br/>On the other side of the line is the German 78. Sturmdivision. Each soldier is a seasoned veteran of the Battle of Kursk and they know their enemy well. They are well supplied and armed to the teeth with 7.5cm PaK40 anti-tank guns, Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck anti-tank launchers. A StuG assault gun battery accompanies your Sturm grenadiers with its tank riders armed with assault rifles!<br/><br/>",

The first edition was in 1975 by Ashburn Industries and offered cards based on the 1974 season and projected 1975 rookies.  The second edition was in 1977 by Skor-Mor, and offered individual cards to represent each major league player's stats. The third was in 1979 by Ashburn Industries, which consolidated the player stats into 13 double-sided Team Roster cards.<br/><br/>The 1979 edition of Longball offers two levels of game play: the &quot;Master&quot; Game, an Advanced &quot;Master&quot; Game, and the Basic Game. Curiously, Ashburn gives the rules for the Basic Game last, reasoning, &quot;Since the majority of the people who buy LONGBALL buy it for the ultimate in baseball accuracy, we will begin with the explanation of the Advanced 'Master' version.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Explore new planets, campaign for political dominance, form binding covenants, and use the might of your fleet, all while searching the cosmos for Gaia, the homeworld of an ancient creator race that will tip the balance of power.<br/><br/>Quest for Gaia offers limitless gameplay through technologies, discovery, player made agreements, and racial abilities!  Every game is guaranteed to offer unique and fresh challenges.<br/><br/>During a game of Quest for Gaia, players will undergo multi-phased rounds.  They will start by allocating the resources available to them from technology, planets, and government.  Next, players will draw 7 cards from a communal deck, voting for who will be the galactic Chancellor (first player).  Finally, starting with the first player, they will choose major actions - Explore, Campaign, Market, Covenant, Revolt, Research, Espionage, and War.  The chancellor position is valuable as each of these major actions can only be taken once per round.<br/><br/>Players will also have a variety of smaller, &quot;Minor Actions&quot; to take - Move, Build, Upgrade, and Attack. These actions are very quick and players can upgrade planets to give themselves more actions or discover leaders to give themselves various Minor action options.<br/><br/>Points are earned throughout this process and the first player to reach 24 is the winner!<br/><br/>",

From bumper-pummeling barrages, to trunk-twisting reverse smashes -- you NAME it, you'll EXPERIENCE it in Demo Derby Smash-Down ! Just like in the real derby, cars can be damaged internally and externally. Get too much of either, and you're DONE. Avoid the big hits, deal out the damage, and be the last car running--YOU'RE the Demo Derby KING!<br/><br/>Like the real demo derby, the action in Demo Derby Smash-Down  is fast and furious! A typical derby event with a dozen or so cars can be finished in about twenty minutes, complete with smash-ups, engine failures, stray wheels, jacked-up trannies and steaming radiators! And it's not difficult to play. The game uses a simple &quot;crash code&quot; of a half dozen or so symbols which tells you what's happening, and damage is recorded in a straightforward manner that allows you to visually see which cars are in danger, and which ones are practically BEGGING to be bashed! &quot;This ain't brain surgery!&quot; -- It's Demo Derby Smash-Down ! Proving that sports simulation board games don't HAVE to be complicated to be FUN!<br/><br/>",

A special die rolled at the same time determines the minimum word length for that round; at the same time, special &quot;shake-it-up&quot; cards add restrictions, e.g., forbidding the use of an &quot;s&quot; to make words plural, removing two letter cubes from the current roll, or playing a round with your opposite hand. Each word that you alone create out of the rolled letters is worth one point if it's exactly as long as the minimum word length; longer words are worth more points.<br/><br/>The player who first passes a point threshold &mdash; or alternatively, the player with the highest score after a predetermined number of rounds &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>",

The figure scale is 1:20.<br/><br/>Over the years I have used various sets of Napoleonic wargames rules &ndash; some good, others too complicated or simply not &quot;Napoleonic&quot;. Most however, were split into two very separate camps - those aimed at battalion level and those aimed at army level with little or no middle ground between the two. General de Brigade was designed to combine the appeal of battalion based games with the most important aspects of command and control from army level games. It was important therefore to base the game at the correct level within the military structure in order to achieve this. The division seemed the most suitable level.<br/><br/>When players field a division they are in command of a number of brigades and it is to this level that most wargamers are suited. This is because after spending hours researching and painting our armies we want to maneuver each and every unit, overseeing their every volley, melee and morale test, At brigade level this is exactly what is expected of the commander &ndash; he would be concerned with deployment, formation and when to fire &ndash; here formations such as column or line do matter! However the use of brigades and brigade orders introduces a command and control factor that limits the 'nippy little battalion' syndrome and restricts the wargamer from doing whatever he wants with any unit whenever it suits him.<br/><br/>General de Brigade allows wargamers the freedom to command and maneuver each battalion or squadron but also includes higher command decisions such as brigade objectives, the timing of assaults and the deployment of reserves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In September 1944, American troops rolled up to the German border having driven the fleeing Wehrmacht across France and Belgium. With the German Army crumbling, it appeared that the war might soon be over. But with a line of well-built fortifications and rapidly-deployed if raw reinforcements, the Germans stabilized their positions and would extend the war for another nine months.<br/><br/>Just south of the city of Aachen and just north of what would become the Elsenborn Ridge battlefield, the U.S. VII Corps attacked the German fortified line. Tanks of the 3rd Armored &quot;Spearhead&quot; Division steadily fought their way forward, backed by the veteran foot soldiers of the 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions. But fierce counterattacks finally blunted the advance; a full-scale invasion of German territory would have to wait until spring.<br/><br/>North of Elsenborn is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series. There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on the battles of September 1944 between VII Corps and the German Seventh Army.<br/><br/>North of Elsenborn is sold BOTH via .pdf download and as a printed booklet; you only need one. The scenario book comes as a .pdf file that you'll need to print (or read off the screen) in order to play the scenarios, or you can order it as a booklet.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Great Garuda Builder Set is a good all-around set of cards. It has an interesting variety of new monsters, items, and obstacles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set of Kickstarter exclusive additions for Milito, which were given out with every Kickstarter copy of the game. It includes:<br/><br/><br/>     A reproduction coin of antiquity.<br/>     One additional Imperial Roman army (31 cards). This means that both players can command a Roman army in a civil war battle.<br/>     Two sets of four mercenary cards:<br/>         Cretan Archers<br/>         Gallic Medium Infantry<br/>         Hoplite Spears<br/>         Numidian Light Cavalry<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Employing mercenaries offers you the chance to use troops that are not normally part of your army&rsquo;s composition. Different troop types have different uses on the battlefield, so mercenaries offer you tactical options not usually available to your army (or give you additional units of a troop type you want more of in your army).<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;d like to use a mercenary unit in your army, here&rsquo;s how to do so:<br/><br/><br/>     Before flipping a coin to decide the game&rsquo;s first player, choose one of your four mercenary cards to hire for your army. Add it to your army without showing your opponent the card you have chosen.<br/>     Remove one other unit card of your choice from your army; this card is not used in the game. Note that the removed card cannot be a Leader.<br/>     The mercenary card counts as a standard unit card in your army.<br/>     That&rsquo;s it!<br/><br/><br/>Each player may choose up to one mercenary unit to add to their army.<br/><br/>The downside of using mercenaries is that everyone knows they are there &ndash; that&rsquo;s the price you pay for their added flexibility! The card backs say &lsquo;Mercenary&rsquo; on them, so your opponent will always know if you hold a mercenary card in your hand or if it is the next card in the draw deck. However, they will not know which mercenary unit you have chosen until you use it for the first time.<br/><br/>",

Gloire is swashbuckling adventure, like the stories of the Three Musketeers, Dr. Syn and the Scarecrow, and Scaramouche. Players can control master swordsmen, nobles of the court, highwaymen, military heroes, spies... in all more than two dozen character profiles are included in the rules. <br/>The game takes care to capture the elegant artistry of the sword fight, while retaining fast play that keeps players involved. But the game is more than combat! The emphasis on scenarios and encounters found in .45 Adventure is retained in Gloire, making games stories of their own rather than mere brawls. Special rules for dueling provide players with an opportunity to satisfy their honor with worthy foes during the course of a game.<br/><br/>The Gloire scenario The Waylaid Messenger won a coveted Battle Streamer at Historicon 2006, and is included in the rulebook, along with two other scenarios designed to get players involved in the game right away.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://rattrap-productions.com/Gloire/Index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://rattrap-productions.com/Gloire/Index.html</a><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Under the Black Flag: Swashbuckling Action on the High Seas<br/>    Thrilling Expeditions: Valley of the Thunder Lizard<br/>    Among the War Parties: Adventures in the Early Americas<br/><br/><br/>",

See FILES below for a recommended designer variant!<br/><br/>This expansion is compatible with both the Enchanted Edition and the Rucksack Edition of Fantastiqa. You must have one of these versions in order to play.<br/><br/>I. CLOUD CRYSTALS and GEM BAGS<br/>You&rsquo;ve overheard a secret at a tea party of talkative fairies! If you combine three Gems of identical color, they will magically transform into a valuable Cloud Crystal!<br/><br/><br/>     A Gem Bag is used to keep Gem colors secret when drawing them at random. (Your Dog is smart: he will dig up a Gem in any color you request!)<br/>     Trade in 3 identically colored Gems to collect a Cloud Crystal. Cloud Crystals are large bluish crystals worth 5 Gems (!) in purchasing power -- but they only count as one single Gem in the eyes of the Mischievous Raven! Cloud Crystals are thus a great way to increase your wealth.... safely.<br/>     Cloud Crystals are also the only way to gain admission to the illustrious Castle in the Air.....!<br/><br/><br/>II. THE CASTLE IN THE AIR<br/>The Castle in the Air is an exotic, exclusive, and largely inaccessible Region of Fantastiqa, filled with all conceivable Artifacts, Beasts and works of fine art. A special Flying Carpet service is eager to convey you to its cloudy abode.... if you have the Cloud Crystals to pay for admission!<br/><br/><br/>     The Castle in the Air is a beautiful new Region tile eagerly awaiting your visiting, deep-pocketed Adventurers. <br/>     The admission fee is 2 Cloud Crystals (or only one if you bring your own Flying Carpet or broomstick as transportation!)<br/>     At the Castle in the Air, instead of only drawing three Artifact or Beast cards at a time, you gain full access to these decks! <br/>     At the Castle in the Air you can also fulfill a valuable Epic Quest to exhibit prestigious landscape paintings created by your very own Dragon Artistes! <br/><br/><br/>III. DRAGON ARTISTES and FANTASTIQAL LANDSCAPES<br/>Four of Fantastiqa&rsquo;s Peaceful Dragons have just returned from Art School at Academie Fantastiqa, eager to paint the landscapes of Fantastiqa and exhibit their work at the Castle in the Air! (In exchange for a nominal payment from their patron, of course.) Begin your new Quest as Fantastiqa&rsquo;s patron of the arts!<br/><br/><br/>     Whenever your Dragon Artiste appears in your hand, you may pay him 1 Gem to paint your current landscape. Collect the beautiful Fantastiqal Landscape card for this Region. <br/>     Exhibit paintings of all six Regions at the Castle in the Air to fulfill the Exhibit Quest and earn 6 points!<br/><br/><br/>",

Demand quickly waned and underground fight clubs of excess dinosaurs became popular and began producing huge dividends. Larger and larger dinosaurs were pitted against each other until today we have Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting. With millions of dollars involved, special training schools appeared, and soon Dinosaur Pit Fighting was the most popular sport in the world.<br/><br/>Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting is a Tactical Battle board game. Players win by wounding other dinosaurs to attain victory points and staying alive. When the first dinosaur in the pit dies the game ends on the following turn.<br/><br/>Players choose between 8 different dinosaurs to fight with and place their miniature on the board. Each dinosaur has a different number of life points and different custom abilities and tactics needed to win. Each turn is a combination of movement based on speed and simultaneous action declarations.<br/><br/>You can play one-off fights or use the campaign rules to control a pen of dinosaurs and give them Training, Mutations and Tech upgrades to improve your dinosaurs and make them unique in the world of Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting.<br/><br/>Brought to you by Dark Cult Games<br/><br/>",

In Avichrom, you cleverly play colourful feather cards to attract the magnificent birds.<br/><br/>A player may play one to two feather cards per turn. Matching feather colours are placed under each other to form rows. As an alternative to playing cards, a player may also attract birds. A bird flies into the row with the most feathers of its colour. Some of the birds have effects that can be used immediately.<br/><br/>When the &quot;End of the Day&quot; card is turned over, each player has one more turn with two actions. After that, the scoring will take place. Points are awarded for the number of feathers of the same colour in each row and for the birds attracted. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

On a team's turn, one player gives clues for the words in a puzzle (e.g. &quot;What you do when you're sore -- ache&quot;). That player's partners guess the words, and then try to figure out the puzzle. If the timer runs out before they've solved it, then the other team(s) can steal the card. Each card is worth from 3 to 7 points.<br/><br/>When one team is in the middle, they can play for double points on their turn; however, if they lose the card, they're sent back a few squares, and the team that gets the puzzle gets the double points.<br/><br/>The game ends when all teams are in the middle. Whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Fleets of ships may be built one minute, and possibly destroyed the next. The goal of every Supreme Commander is having control over all of the planetary systems.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Time Tunnels is an unusual game involving the use of black holes, space mines, and time tunnels. Energy crystal production is also an important asset to this game. Time tunnels are created, invisible gateways between planetary systems.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Time Tunnels uses a unique hidden movement system. With this system, a player's opponents can not actually see the movement strategy taking place. It is a 2-4 player tactical game. Each player is the Supreme Commander of his own alien race.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The advance game classifies ships into 11 types. It also introduces the usage of the main bridge and the specialist bridge, and the robots and men that operate them.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A chess-like science fiction themed game. The game board represents the planet Elkos and is broken up into a series of hexes with four different types of terrain: Flatlands, Rough, High plateaus, and bunkers.<br/><br/>There are four different types of pieces corresponding to the four Elkosian &quot;races&quot; of the planet. The Etons move in a straight line and are blocked by anything but flat terrain. The Artilla Squads also move in a straight line, but may traverse flatlands and rocky terrain. The winged Ariel Bombers may traverse any terrain, but fly short distances - they also carry bombs to bombard the opponents. Finally, the Dominator Lord (one per side) moves up to three hexes but may not ascend plateaus. Its special ability however is to convert any opposing piece to its side by moving next to it.<br/><br/>An interesting twist to the game is that the game board may be altered through the use of bombs. When a bomb is dropped, the owning player may use one of 14 &quot;tri-hexes&quot; to alter the landscape, thereby making previously impassable terrain passable.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the opposing Dominator Lord is killed, one side no longer has pieces other than the Dominator Lord to move, or a stalemate is reached.<br/><br/>Game components are mostly card stock, three color printing on the board.<br/><br/>",

The reigning party (most seats?) earns points if they cast their votes on the winning side of a vote.  Other parties earn points for successfully opposing the government.  There are two catches; firstly, voting against the interest of your supporters will cause you to lose seats, and secondly, you have a limited number of vote cards (yes/no/abstain), so you may be forced to vote contrary to your interests!<br/><br/>",

This represents the fact that Harold's forced march across England so surprised the Vikings that many of them had left their armor behind at their base.

        "description": "The second (and last) of Fractal Dimensions' line of &quot;Gamelets&quot; - comic-book sized games inspired by the microgames of the 1980s. Escape From Dinosaur Island! involves U.S. Marines in the South Pacific, circa 1944, who find themselves on an island filled with prehistoric beasts.<br/><br/>The game uses two mapsheets. One is a hex-grid encounter map showing an overview of the island. This is used to track the movement of the Marines. The other mapsheet is a square-grid tactical map where the Marines fight battles against the deadly creatures inhabiting the island.<br/><br/>This is primarily a solitaire game, although it includes one cooperative two-player scenario. In the standard scenario, the Marines attempt to escape the island alive. Other scenarios include a mission to rescue a general and a &quot;sole survivor&quot; challenge played entirely on the tactical map.<br/><br/>The basic situation is spiced up by a variety of &quot;events&quot; that may occur during a game. Some of the events involve potential allies who will fight alongside the Marines (such as &quot;friendly&quot; dinosaurs, a &quot;missing link&quot; neanderthal, and a samurai sword wielding Japanese officer). Additional events involve the Marines finding abandoned Japanese weapons and other items that may prove useful.<br/><br/>The health, equipment, and ammo for each Marine is tracked individually using a sheet of status charts. Counters represent Marines, equipment, dinosaurs, and other encounters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>As the title indicates, Charlie's Year covers the events of the last real threat to the Georgian regime of Great Britain and to the social, economic, and philosophical gains of the Glorious Revolution. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.<br/><br/>Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.<br/><br/>Expanded by: The Highland Quorum<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Data Boxing is based on decades of study and research. It began as a research project in 1967 by Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010), a Florida A&amp;M humanities professor and boxing authority. The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game was first produced by Gamecraft in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.<br/><br/>Data Boxing features yesterdays legends and hall of famers reflecting the glory days of years gone by. You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more. To quote the designer of the game, Dr. Julian Compton, from a Data Boxing Newsletter (in 1977), &quot;One of the real thrills for this game player is to see the stars of the past come alive in a game structure. Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing is &quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below). To quote Dr. Compton, &quot;The game was popular with boxing writers, due to its obvious awareness of information below the headlines of boxing history, and its mathematical structure, which allowed for the matchup of boxing greats from different time periods.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing allows you to choose the level of complexity with which you are most comfortable. To quote from the 1980 edition of Data Boxing produced by Big League Game Company, &quot;Data Boxing is one of the most detailed and accurate sports games you can play. It is hoped you can find the level which will give you all the enjoyment that others have had, whether you are 6 or 96. It is a game you can play for a lifetime.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, the May 1977 and December 1977 editions of Boxing Illustrated, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Matchups [1981], the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat and the BoxRec Wiki Encyclopedia. Dr. Compton co-authored The World Champion Boxing Quiz and Computer Sports Matchups. He was also a contributor to Boxing Illustrated magazine, Table Top Sports and All Sports Digest.<br/><br/>",

The chain has a handcuff at the end that easily slips on and off a person's wrist. To play, you slip the handcuff onto your wrist and push the Policeman down into the ball to start the timer. The clock starts ticking away as the Policeman slowly rises out of the ball. You then roll the dice until &quot;two&quot; keys are tossed. If only one die shows a key, re-roll the second die until a key comes up. When two keys are rolled, you are free to remove the cuff and pass it to the next player who must put it on and roll the dice and so on around the table. When the timer stops, the Policeman pops up and the player wearing the cuff is eliminated. The last player left in the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Winner's Eye View is an auto racing game designed and published by a British race car driver and instructor.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly similar to those of the Avalon Hill version of Speed Circuit.  Cars are built by choosing levels of gearing, amount of fuel, type of tires, etc.  Speeds are chosen simultaneously on dashboards (which are also used to track fuel, tire wear, oil pressure, etc.) with maximum acceleration and braking amounts being observed (although you can exceed them if you roll for penalties).  Corners have maximum speeds posted in each space, although they can be exceeded for more penalty chart rolls or by staying on the racing line.  There are rules for slipstreaming and pitting.<br/><br/>The game elaborates somewhat on the basic Speed Circuit model.  It tracks wear separately for front and rear tires, has a few extra cornering rules, and has optional weather rules (this is where the different tire types come into play).  The movement is also more fine-grained than in Speed Circuit - here cars move one space for every 10 mph instead of for every 20 mph.<br/><br/>One track (Monaco) is provided on 10 A4 sheets which need to be taped together, and possibly trimmed.  Metal F1 cars are provided, as are metal arrows for the dashboard panels.<br/><br/>",

Usually these territorial skirmishes led to a lot of ill-mannered screeching, which was very impressive but rarely decisive.<br/><br/>All of this changed when one enterprising monkey learned that a pulled-back tree branch could launch a breadfruit some distance through the forest. This discovery set off a chain reaction of intensified development into offensive and defensive forest technologies. The monkeys quickly learned that catapults worked better than pulled-back tree branches. Research into fortifications became necessary, as a means of defense against the constant rain of deadly breadfruit launched from catapults. All monkeys were issued saws in order to aid them in procuring the raw materials necessary for the war effort.<br/><br/>Today, as the sun rises over the Great Wood, a feeling of determination accompanies it. All the monkeys feel certain that when the sun sets in the evening, the ultimate ruler of the trees will have been determined, once and for all...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taken from the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt&quot; - Hudson<br/><br/>These rules are inspired by the films Aliens (tm). They can be played solo as the Aliens are all generated by dice rolls. Two possible games can be played:<br/><br/>(1) The players are Colonial Marines who are exploring a base where a group of colonists have settled. Earth has lost all contact with the colonists. The marines are sent to check the base out.<br/><br/>(2) The Colonial Marines are planet side defending a group of settlements where contact has been made with the bugs.<br/><br/>Further scenarios may be created too if preferred, use the films for ideas. Any scale of figure will do from 10mm to 25mm, a collection of D6 are required. Measurements used are by squares if using floor plans otherwise substitute inches for squares.<br/><br/>System makes use of standard action point allowance.  Players control colonial marines in a randomly generated hulk.  Aliens are either game master controlled or on auto-pilot (they are after all perfect killing machines).  Lots of room for back story and role-playing aspects, in fact the game probably plays better in this fashion.<br/><br/>",

Every player chooses a race, which affects how well they fight in different types of terrain.  Players can annex land by decree in addition to conquering it.  Old Empire units can appear and attack the players, but their cities conceal treasures (and a dragon, and a plague).

Typical unit sizes are infantry companies, cavalry squadrons, machine gun platoons, and artillery batteries. A player would generally command either a regiment or a brigade of soldiers.<br/><br/>The World War One portion of the rules covers the following: African, Balkan, Egypt &amp; Palestine, Eastern, Italian, Mesopotamian, and Western fronts. The Tables of Organization &amp; Equipment have detailed information for 16 different nations. The rules are designed to re-fight the open warfare of the early part of the WWI along with the more static trench battles later in the war.

Could Saddam have held out against the United States, inflicting unexpected loss of life that would send weak-kneed diplomats to sue for peace?

        "description": "Piquet is a style of wargame. As GURPS is to role play, Piquet is to wargaming. A system of play for ANY period you wish, the basic gameplay will fit within any period with some basic fundamental differences required by the period.<br/><br/>This game uses specific generic piquet cards to depict when certain event occur on the battlefield. As the author states, &quot;the future is not perfectly known&quot;. With Point of Attack WWII, compare the turn sequence of Advanced Squad Leader, where you know when each phase and subphase is going to occur, and you can plan your attack to take advantage of the rules. Imagine this sequence: I know this unit cannot move to get behind me in time to avoid me shooting 3 times at his other tank before I withdraw. In Piquet, this does not happen as you do not know when the unit will withdraw (nor the real commander on the ground)  for the unit may withdraw now when this card is drawn, or you may wait and bet that your opponent does not get those 3 move cards before you get another withdraw card. Timing is varied, thus your tactics must be sound fundamentally for you to get the results you want.(Think...What are the odds of THAT happening?) Your plan of attack must have enough concentration to avoid the &quot;nothing gets done&quot; effect.<br/><br/>Game includes base Piquet Master Rules, and Piquet cards. Also Point of Attack rulebook and Point of Attack specific cards. Piquet uses a unique play on the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 dice in that you change the die you roll for each type of effect. It is not a roll of a d6 add 1, it is instead of a d6 you roll a d8 as a higher die roll is better (more good things happen).<br/><br/>Also the use of Impetus for maintaining whose turn adds some mystery on how the game plays out. Seemingly &quot;up to chance&quot;, if you properly plan and support your troops, the tactics will be rewarded as the greater force maintains (or quality of troops, or quality of leadership also factors in) the &quot;advantage&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Seven half-map scenarios, six full-map scenarios, game scale is 350 yards, per 5/8&quot; hexagon, with each Game Turn representing 30 minutes. The Basic Rules were added for younger players.<br/> Very accurate and comprehensive, the game includes rules and counters for Federal Naval Vessels,  Confederate Trains,  Federal Engineers,  Leaders,  Ammunition Depletion,  Damaged and Destroyed Bridges, and  Captured Cannon.<br/>  <br/>The Basic Game is a fast playing simulation of advancing along the narrow roads and through the thick coastal forests and swamps of southwestern South Carolina.  The Confederate player must choose the right times to fall back, or risk being overwhelmed by the Yankee aggressor.<br/>  <br/>The Advanced Rules include Skirmishers,  Hidden Movement,  Breastworks and Fortifications, Tides and Naval Grounding, and  Alternative Federal Landing Sites.  Individual cannon types are represented in both field and naval artillery units.  Ammunition usage is an important aspect of command decisions.  This is a very well-researched wargame.<br/>  <br/>The Sequence of Play is a variation of the Original GBOCW System, with Fire Combat, including any Defensive and Return Fire, taking place before Charge Combat.<br/>     This game is an excellent simulation, and an enjoyable game as well, and was the best gaming effort by the leading historian of these particular engagements.<br/><br/>",

There's a nifty wooden board with a grid of 3X4 shallow depressions. The game is simplicity itself - take turns placing a Clicket.

Despite intense public speculation, the exclusive 'high-roller' guest list always remains a closely-guarded secret until play is just about to start.<br/><br/>However, just an hour before this year's game is due to begin, and shortly after Frank's own entrance into the saloon causes no small commotion amongst the eager spectators, four loud shots ring out from Jesse's room on the first floor.<br/><br/>Amidst the ensuing chaos, the murderer quickly escapes unnoticed from the bedroom window and leaves few clues as to their identity.<br/><br/>However, once the initial confusion subsides, Frank, soon realizes that his brother's killer must be amongst the other players due to take part in that night's game, as they were the only ones who knew that Jesse was in town at the time of the murder.<br/><br/>In a desperate attempt to discover the killer's identity before the trail goes cold, Frank quickly devises a high-risk game of 'truth-and-dare', carefully designed to lure the unknown murderer into taking the biggest gamble of their whole life.<br/><br/>If Frank is right, his 'winner-takes-all' challenge may well just tempt Jesse's killer into staking everything they've got to lose, in a daring attempt to seize all they could wish to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Anchor is a game of claiming territory by surrounding it with your stones. In that, it is similar to the classic game of Go. However, it is played on a hex grid and the life/death of a group is decided differently - in Go, a group is alive by having eyes; here, a group is alive by connecting to three edges (or in certain cases, two).<br/><br/>More specifically, the six corners are marked alternately with black and white anchors. Corners with anchors of a player's own color are his home corners, and corners with anchors of his opponent's color are away corners. A group is an anchor if it touches three or more sides of the board. If a group touches just two sides, it is an anchor only if these two sides do not meet at an away corner. When both players pass consecutively, any group that is not an anchor is ruled dead and is removed from the board. Each player then figures his score, which is the sum of his territory (vacant surrounded points) plus dead stones of his opponent.<br/><br/>",

A player scores points by moving his marble to his goal and by capturing opponents marbles. Some of the rings have half circles. When two appropriate rings are lined up, a marble can be dropped into the formed pit and captured. A capture is also created by dropping an opponents marble into the wrong goal. The game is over when a player's marbles are all out of play. Each player scores 50 points for a goal marble and 30 points for a captured marble. High score wins. Tournament Stadium Checkers can be made more challenging by rotating the center goal indicator to a different orientation. Thus, making it harder to move a player's marble into the correct goal. Tournament Stadium Checkers is a more challenging game than the original game.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in a typical year during the wost disturbances sparked by the annual Drumcree Orange Parade along the Garvaghy Road (1995-2000).<br/><br/>The game requires 3 players: The Loyalist player represents certain members of the Protestant community in Northern Ireland, such as the Orange Order, and various paramilitaries (e.g. UVF, LVF, UFF, RHC). The Republican player represents certain members of the Catholic community in the Occupied Six Counties, such as Residents' Groups, and various paramilitaries (e.g. pIRA, cIRA, rIRA, INLA). The final player represents the Royal Ulster Constabulary police force (RUC). The Republican and Loyalist players use cards to influence regions on a map of Northern Ireland, reacting to one another and actions of the RUC player whose objective, in this game, is to reduce the influence of both the Loyalists and the Republicans.<br/><br/>The crux of the game is in judicious playing of the cards: The Loyalists play a March card in Armagh - will you, as the RUC player, allow it to go ahead and risk a Republican Riot; or do you Re-Route that March and risk a Loyalist reaction that may itself provoke a worse Republican reaction?<br/>Should have kept that Tear-Gas card...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ka-Nexus is a fast-paced, easy to learn card game for two to four players.  It contains a mix of skill, strategy, and chance.  The goal of the game is to score 21 points over the course of two or more hands, each hand taking about 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 61 cards, fifteen cards (numbered 1-12, Queen, Pharoah, Camel) each in four suits (Scarabs, Fortune, Markets, Thieves) plus the Royal Camel (a Joker of sorts).  The game board has locations for each player to store cards, an area to build the card pyramids central to game play, a draw pile area (the Oasis) and a discard pile area (the Sphinx).<br/><br/>The game begins by taking 25 cards and using them to build two overlapping pyramids in the center of the game board.  The remaining 36 cards are placed in the Oasis.  Each player's turn consists of drawing a card from the Oasis and then making as many &quot;tricks&quot; as possible, where a &quot;trick&quot; is defined as a combination of two cards that add up to 15 or a lone Camel (similar to the classic Pyramid Solitaire game).  Cards for &quot;tricks&quot; may come from the player's personal storage area (which may hold up to 3 cards), the top of the Sphinx pile, or uncovered cards in the pyramid structure.  A player's turn ends when he takes the drawn card and either makes a trick with it, places it in storage, discards it to the Sphinx, or exchanges it with a card already in storage and discards that card to the Sphinx.<br/><br/>When all of the cards from the Oasis have been drawn and played, the hand ends and players score points for: the Last Royal Trick (last trick played that contains a Queen, Pharaoh, or Camel) for 1 point, Pyramids (clearing the last card from the pyramids) for i point, Majority (most tricks captured) for 2 points, Scarabs (most Scarab suit cards captured) for 2 points, and Camels at 1 point per captured Camel.  Players are penalized for cards remaining in their storage area at the end of a hand.  Maximum score per hand is 11 points.<br/><br/>",

Some will make you blush, others are down-right X-rated. The Zoch team at Essen chuckle at this game and say that is a favorite gift for wedding showers.<br/><br/>",

From 2-6 players each take one of the kingdoms on the map, are given a king, a prince, a castle, and points to build units, and try to conquer as much territory as possible.

Players then plot the movement of their forces for the 15 turns constituting the year.  Orders can be changed under certain circumstances (e.g., if your kingdom is invaded).<br/><br/>Combat is conducted using a deck of cards, with the number drawn for each side being determined by their strengths.<br/><br/>There are some optional rules, including rules for ambushes, capturing enemy leaders, a 7th and 8th player taking the roles  of pirates or bandits, and wizards, a new type of unit who can cast a variety of spells and create magical creatures such as dragons.<br/><br/>The game components are:<br/>26-page rulebook<br/>17&quot; x 21.75&quot; color map<br/>50 combat resolution cards<br/>112 very small cardboard chits (16 each in 7 colors, lettered A-P)<br/>2 small black and white copies of the map<br/>2 movement programming sheets<br/>2 dice<br/><br/>",

The counters are on paper and must be mounted and cut out<br/><br/>",

The decks provide a hidden heads up display allowing players to view and select cards from their hand and also animate their avatars, so spectators see the players fighting each other as they play.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are based on Rock-Paper-Scissors, with cards attacking and/or defending high, low or mid locations, but sequences of cards can be played to build up powerful combos. Skillful players work out which combos their opponent has available to them and anticipate and block combos as they see them build. Anticipating the block allows bluffs and double bluffs to be played.<br/><br/>",

Players must give a great deal of attention to development of their kingdoms - in addition to raising military units and building forts, they can build new plantations and villages, improve roads, and exploit timber and mineral resources. Politically, they must track the relations their kingdom has with each of the other 15 kingdoms on the map (a record sheet is provided for this purpose) - there are six possible relations two kingdoms can have with each other, following the description of Kautilya, a great Indian political theorist. The military sphere is not neglected, as there are fairly elaborate rules for invasion of other kingdoms, battles, and sieges.<br/><br/>Additional rules include those for monarch abilities, monarch death, and the famous Indian horse sacrifice.<br/><br/>The winner at the end of the game is the player with the greatest percentage increase in their resource levels.<br/><br/>Crows &amp; Owls was produced by the author in a fairly small edition - an article in Simulacrum magazine put the total at 95 copies.<br/><br/>",

Along your road to recovery, you may have to reveal personal information about yourself, sing your favorite television theme song or even dance with a lampshade on your head. You may have a drunken hookup, develop cirrhosis of the liver or even get thrown in jail for drunk and disorderly conduct.

It is not just a supplement, though, but a complete rule system in its own right. As the title suggests, it enables the players to expand their hunting activities into the Age of Mammals, and to take on a wide range of quarry - living, extinct or simply mysterious - from prehistoric saber-tooths to modern African big game.<br/><br/>Each player may choose to control either a human hunter character, or an animal. The hunters move, shoot etc. in a fairly conventional &quot;skirmish wargame&quot;  sort of way, by means of dice, while for the animal players we have introduced a card driven system, using an ordinary pack of playing cards. The intention is to bring out the difference between human intelligence - as represented, however unlikely it may sound, by the wargamer - and that of the quarry, who should combine a limited range of tactical options with an element of unpredictability. To compensate for this, the animals will usually be able to move faster than the hunters, and will have a decisive advantage if they manage to get to close range.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Then the other players take turns attempting to guess the target phrase correctly.  First they push the Play button which plays the target phrase backwards.  They can do this a few time then they must push the Mimic button and attempt to speak the backwards phrase as close as they can.  The Babble game then immediately speaks the mimicked phrase backwards which, if the player did a good job, should sound like the original target phrase.  The player then guesses the target.  If they are wrong the next player takes a turn.  If they are correct the round is over and the next player records a new target phrase.<br/><br/>",

The Dreux campaign of 1562-1563 has been included as a scenario and as such, the rules will use examples from that campaign.<br/><br/>Scale: Each turn represents one week of real time. Note that although an army could march further in the allotted time than the game may allow, most armies were not able to uniformly march about to their heart&rsquo;s content. Bogged down by the wounded and sick, the need to secure supplies, broken artillery carriages and a rest periods caused most armies to move only when they could, not when they wanted to. Each strength point of troops represents roughly 200-300 men.<br/><br/>The Key: Every game system has a key element that is critical to successful play. It in the 16th supply was the main concern of a commander who had any hope of success. In &ldquo;Campaign!&rdquo; supply has been portrayed in Action points. The more action points, the more an army can do. Action points are tallied at the beginning of each turn, and the closer an army is to supply lines and friendly towns, the more it will achieve. Treasury points may be expended to buy action points. Excess action points can under certain circumstances be converted to treasury points.<br/><br/>Components included<br/>Campaign! rules (.doc)<br/>Scenario for the First War of Religion (.doc)<br/>Map for Scenario (.pdf)<br/>Counters (.pdf)<br/>Order of Battle Sheets (.pdf)<br/>Conversion Charts (.pdf)<br/>Component Explanation Chart (.pdf)<br/>The Complete Spanish Fury Miniatures Interface (.doc)<br/><br/>Game FREE to download: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://perfectcaptain.50megs.com/Campaign_Playtest.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://perfectcaptain.50megs.com/Campaign_Playtest.html</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Admiral is an abstract, hex-based strategy game with a rock-paper-scissors mechanism.<br/><br/>The theme hinges around a French/British conflict about the South African colonies shortly before World War I. In reality the conflict was averted by the French need of British support against German aggression, but in Admiral it blooms out with a major naval engagement around southern Africa.<br/><br/>Each player controls three ship fleets, consisting of submarines, destroyers and cruisers. Each fleet has a command ship and a command base. If the command ship is sunk or the base is invaded the entire fleet is destroyed and its ships removed. Each player also controls a battleship which commands the entire fleet, and a corresponding fleet base. Sinking the opponents battleship or invading his fleet base wins the game.<br/><br/>On his turn a player may move one ship from each fleet or forgo moving one fleet in order to move the battleship instead. Ships move along the corners of the hexes, submarines in the hexes. Subs can sink cruisers and battleships, destroyers can sink subs, cruisers can sink destroyers and battleships can sink both cruisers and destroyers.<br/><br/>Admiral plays out similar to chess, a chess with four kings, an action point allowance system and a rock-paper-scissors capture mechanism.<br/><br/>The publisher claims Admiral to be playable by 2-6 players but in reality it is a pure two player game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eat Electric Death! is the exciting board game of tactical starship combat set in the wild and wacky Weird Worlds universe (made famous in the award-winning computer game Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space) for two carbon-based life forms.<br/><br/>Players will command an array of starships from such intergalactic species as the calculating mechanical Tan Ru, the bloodthirsty savage reptilian Garthans, and the noble Zorg, masters of time and space. Annihilation is only a chit pull away as energy weapons, missiles, and even old fashioned projectiles hurdle across the map while ships maneuver for the optimum firing spot. When found shields collapse, bulkheads shatter, and sometimes even a reactor blows. For some, crews will work to repair the damage, while for others salvation is only possible through victory.<br/><br/>Eat Electric Death! plays like a rocket to the stars &ndash; fast &ndash; with easily understood rules that will have you battling within minutes of opening the box and punching counters. Varied scenario types provide plenty of adventure, and the game lends itself well for telling your own tales. Intuitive playing aids create a minimum of bookkeeping chores while allowing plenty of sci-fi chrome. Starship combat this sleek is rarely seen on your kitchen table.<br/><br/>If you like your aliens ugly, your starships shiny, and your ship on ship action frenzied and fun, then look no further than Eat Electric Death!, your space opera in a box!<br/><br/>",

By discarding power cards (instead of playing the effect written into them) players can develop their muscles so that they can drive their rivals away from the fertile forests or generous jungles. Or alternatively they can develop their food diet and outbreed their rivals and beat them by sheer numbers. At least that way they can better afford the occasional bestial attack or an epidemic disease. However, player's can't hold on to their good locations forever because every time they want to evolve to the next level only a small fraction of their population can make the leap while the rest continue to populate the area.<br/><br/>",

These cards may provide extra leaps, or perhaps some bad luck for you. But more important they can make a change of the weather. The weather guids the amound of leaps every frog may take in each turn until there is another change in the weather. Bad weather such as rain and mist will give you a slower pace.

Mule and sailing vessel (for $100), bicycle and tramp steamer ($400), train and cruise ship ($700), and airplane and zeppelin ($1000).  Note that trans-continental zeppelin travel was a real possibility when the game was designed, just before the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.  Each mode gives you a multiplier on your die roll (times 1 through times 4) for movement.  Two decks of cards (blue ones for random benefits and red ones for random penalties) correspond to blue and red spaces on the board.  Don't just go to jail, go to Devil's Island or the fortification of Tokio (sp).  Numbered spaces offer the chance to answer trivia questions in two books (one for Globe Trotters, one for Young People) to win or lose $100.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with 6 plain ceramic hexagonal pieces, including 5 hexmen and 1 (taller) hexcellency which starts on his hexdom space.  The winner is the player who either first moves his hexcellency to the hexdom on the opposite side of the board or whose hexcellency is the last hexcellency remaining on the board.  A piece must move in a straight line not blocked by other pieces.  A piece may be immobilized (&quot;hexed&quot;) or released from a hex by certain configurations of other pieces.  On a later move, a hexed piece may be removed (&quot;captured&quot;) from the game.  A player is eliminated from the game if his hexcellency is captured.<br/><br/>From the game box top: &quot;the Cerulean Hexman moved swiftly into position and engaged his hexray.  The Citronian was instantly hexed.  Powerless and immobile, he unwillingly released the Alizarian Hexman form his certain fate.  He again activated his hexray.  The Citronian Hexcellence was paralyzed, ensnared hopelessly, just as victory was within his reach.  His Hexdom had been conquered&hellip;&quot;<br/><br/>Hex was published in 1994 as a &quot;limited First Edition&quot; of one thousand copies.  It did not include actual hexrays.<br/><br/>",

They might meet the friendly Weenie Beanies and Carrotons, or the hostile Gravel arm, the Purple Ops, Mechanico, or the vicious, giant K-9s.&quot;<br/><br/>Simple game mechanics: movement options are determined by either adding or subtracting the numbers rolled on two dice, and matching the result to a number printed in the spaces on the board. Landing on certain spaces on the board triggers drawing a card, which could be good (move forward X spaces, rescue cards which cancel penalties drawn later) or bad (go back X spaces, loose a turn). A math cheat-sheet is included for children who haven't yet mastered addition and subtraction, and the directions on the cards are printed in all caps to distinguish from the flavor text.<br/><br/>",

The setting is also generic enough that the campaign could easily be transplanted to any geographical locale with no more adjustment than changing a few place names.

These tribe-stones have two sides: one side with a tribe-symbol, and one without. All stones start the game with the tribe-symbol face-up, but every time that a stone is jumped over, it flips over, either hiding the tribe-symbol, or revealing it again. A stone that jumps over another stone always ends its move with the tribe-symbol revealed.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must get at least 7 own stones into a single grouping. This can be anywhere on the board, with the catch that only stones that show the own tribe-symbol count, and all of them must touch.<br/><br/>Movement rules are simple. A stone either moves to a free hexagon immediately next to the field it occupies, ending its movement with the same side face-up. Or it hops over a neighbouring stone, regardless of who it belongs to, flipping every stone it jumps over, and ending its movement with its own tribe-symbol face-up. Like Halma, hopping is only possible if the field directly behind the jumped stone is unoccupied, and you are allowed to keep hopping over other stones if the board allows it, as long as you never pass the same hexagon twice. You are not forced to jump over a piece if you don't want to, and you can stop jumping at any point that suits you.<br/><br/>The board is made out of felt, the tribe-stones come in 2 colours and are made out of wood.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral.

        "description": "Die Kriegskunst is a Seven Years War miniatures wargaming rules set based on the General de Brigade system.  From the designer's website:<br/><br/>One of the biggest differences is the figure scale (1=40 rather than 1=20). Then there's the way you move your units around. In GdeB the orders system means that you can't always do what you'd like and when you would like it. In Die Kriegskunst this is even more apparent, as we've made it a little harder to change orders. We've also introduced a new type - the &quot;Approach&quot; order - used to recreate those great Frederickean flank marches. Is &quot;Frederickean a word? Well, it is now! Even more restricting is the way units manoeuvre. there are no columns (well, only in really limited situations like storming breaches), and in the age of linear warfare, moving a brigade from column of march into line was a complicated business.<br/><br/>We think we've found a way to simulate this fairly simply, but even so you really have to figure out where your troops are going and where they'll deploy well in advance. For example, a battalion in column of march (one stand behind the other) has to wheel to the right, then halt. the next turn it moves all the stands through 90 degrees, so that they no face the enemy - thereby forming a line.  Now, if you imagine doing this for a whole brigade, then for a division-sized force with one or more brigades forming a second line, and you've got some idea of how tricky the whole thing is. Of course, you can start your games in line, facing the enemy and raring to go, but we needed to produce a system to get the guys there in the first place!<br/><br/>Other differences include modifications to the firing mechanics, a new system for firing at chargers (charging cavalry into formed infantry is rarely a smart move), and a downgrading of skirmishers. While these may sound like little more than little tweaks, they actually represent a lot of work and experimentation - trying to keep the basics of the existing system while adapting it to reflect the linear tactics of the period.<br/><br/>Basing is the same as for other General de Brigade sets (although we use slightly larger bases ourselves - four 28mm infantry figures on a 40x40mm base). A full strength Prussian battalion is 20 figures, an Austrian one is 24, and a Russian one is 16. Heavy cavalry ride around in 20 man units, although the Russians should really be smaller due to their chronic cavalry resupply problems - 12 man for Cuirassier units and 16 for others. I just have to have more Russians to make up for the small units - and of course there's my pretty but less than effective Cossack horde...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A manqala game.<br/><br/>From Wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Um_dyar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Um_dyar</a><br/><br/>Um dyar (enmediar, manddiar&eacute;, umdiyar, um ed-dyar) is played by the Hassaniya-speaking population in western Mauritania, for instance in Boutilimit (Trarza province) and in Moudj&eacute;ria (Tagant). Hassaniya is an Arab dialect heavily influenced by Tamazigh, a Berber language, that originated in the 15th century. At this time the Yemenite Beni Hassan tribe migrated to north-western Africa and subdued the indigenous Berber tribes over a period of 300 years. Hassaniya is today spoken in the western Sahara, from Niger to Mauritania. They constitute the majority of the population in Mauritania and southern Morocco. The Hassaniya call this region Trab el Bidan, i.e. '&quot;Land of White People&quot;, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or &quot;Land of Black People&quot;. <br/>Um dyar is mostly played by young women, sometimes also by men. However, they do never play among themselves, just with women, for instance as a means of courtship. <br/>The game is played all the year, but especially on Ramadan and during the hot hours at noon time. <br/>Usually the holes are dug in the sand, but there are also traditional wooden boards. Some of them are made of one piece, while others consist of two halves. <br/>The holes are called dyar (sing.: dar, i.e. &quot;houses, inhabited places&quot;). The seeds are called ky&eacute;tan (sing.: kyit), probably related to kyit, Hassaniya for &quot;odd&quot;.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board is made of two rows of an even number of holes, between 2 and 12. <br/>The number of seeds which are initially in each hole depends on the size of the board. A board which numbers just four holes has four seeds in each hole. Board that have eight or twelve holes have as many seeds as the whole board numbers holes or, alternatively, just as many as one row numbers holes. Large boards which have 16 or 24 holes have initially in each hole as many seeds as a row counts holes.<br/><br/>Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. <br/>At his turn, a player takes the contents of any hole of his side of the board and sows them counterclocwise, one by one, starting in the very same hole from where he took them. <br/>     If you move a singleton, it is put into the next hole counterclockwise. <br/>If the last seed ends in a hole making a total of an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole, these seeds are captured and removed from the board. <br/>If you have captured, you also get the contents of the preceding holes (in an unbroken sequence) that contain an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole. <br/>If a player has no seeds to play with, he passes and his opponent plays again. <br/>The game ends when all seeds are captured. <br/>The player who has captured most seeds, wins the game. <br/>If at the end of the game a single seed remains (i.e. there has been some mistake or cheating), the players who has an odd number of captured seeds loses one seed. These two seeds (the lost one and the seed remaining on the board) are not counted.<br/><br/>Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. <br/>In the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. <br/>The winner fills all his holes with the standard initial number of seeds. <br/>The loser fills all the holes he can with the standard number of seeds. If he some seeds remain, he puts them in another hole. <br/>     The empty holes on the loser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game you don't play in them. <br/>     If the loser has not enough holes for his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. <br/>     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are openend from left to right. However, it is not important. <br/>The winner of the match is who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side. <br/>If there was a couple of seeds out of game (as seen above) they are given to the first player who makes a capture in the next game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Later, the game has been spread by mine workers to Gauteng. It is closely related to games described in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game was first researched in 1917 by the British ethnograph P. A. Wagner.<br/><br/>Moruba is traditionally played by men in the late afternoon in the shade of a tree. The game was used during war and was a social activity where men strategised about a variety of activities and events related to them, also shared advise and ideas. Language, expressions and terminology of the game signify what happens when war takes place. As women weren't allowed to go to war, they didn't play the game. In recent days, however, both genders began to play.<br/><br/>Starting in 2003, Moruba is promoted as an indigenous sport by the CSIR's National Product Development Centre and the South African Sports Commission (SASC). There were team and individual tournaments at the Indigenous Games Festival in Polokwane and the Indigenous Games Competition in Tzaneen. The game is also supported by the Mpumalanga Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture of the Province Gauteng, because it forms an important expression of indigenous identity and, as it was said, of a &quot;healthy life style&quot;. The best players, among them D. Shikwambam and Petrus Shibambu, are organized in Mindsports South Africa (MMSA).<br/><br/>This renaissance of African games is a response to Thabo Mbeki's call &quot;to rediscover what was lost by indigenous people (of Africa through colonialism)&quot;.<br/><br/>Today the towns of Sasekani and Bolobedu are centers of the game. Strong clubs are also in Ka-Phalaborwa, Letaba, and Selwane. The newspaper Mopani News reports reguarly on Moruba competitions. The game which is already taught in the Bolobedu High School, will soon be introduced in all schools of Limpopo Province. Dickson Mpofu, the indigenous games co-ordinator in Mpumalanga, even wants to register Moruba with the Olympic committee.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The size of the game board often depends on the number of players. Most common are boards which have four rows of 12 holes (mekoti) each, but the number of holes can vary from four to 36 holes per row. The holes are dug into the earth. Each hole has two counters, usually pebbles or morula pips, which are called mathlapa (&quot;cattle&quot;) or tinkhomo (&quot;cow&quot;).<br/><br/>The game is played by two persons and sometimes by teams of up to six.<br/><br/>Each player (or team) only uses his side of the board.<br/><br/>On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two stones, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction.<br/><br/>The move ends (kulala; literally &quot;to sleep&quot;) when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of his opponent contains stones, these enemy stones are &quot;killed&quot; (tlaba) or &quot;hit&quot;. Additionally, the stones in the hole of the same file in the outer row are &quot;captured&quot; (tlola). The killed or captured stones are removed from the board. The player is then entitled to capture the contents of any two other enemy holes.<br/><br/>When a player has only singletons, he is permitted to move them, but only in empty holes.<br/><br/>The player who has still stones at the end of the game is declared the winner. It is a draw, when the board position repeats without anything being captured. &quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This was the first ASL scenario pack published by Lone Canuck.  It includes 10 scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  Unlike other Lone Canuck scenario packs, Winpak #1 did not have a common theme and even included one scenario from the Pacific Theater, a real rarity for Lone Canuck.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>Pachino Airfield, Sicily 10 July 1943: Operation &quot;Husky&quot;, the Allied Invasion of Sicily, had the Canadian invasion forces landing on the Sicilian shores in a wide, curving bay known as Costa dell'Ambra, Code-named &quot;Bark West&quot;. Bark West was divided into two sandy beaches, &quot;Roger&quot; on the right and &quot;Sugar&quot; on the left. The Hasting and Prince Edward Regiment and the Royal Canadian Regiment of the First Brigade were assigned to Roger Beach, while Sugar was given to the Second Brigade's Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and Seaforth Highlanders. Three miles inland lay the main Canadian objective, the Pachino airfield, near the town of the same name.<br/><br/><br/>Daliki, Russia, 26 June 1943: Partisan attacks on moving trains and extensive demolition of tracks, bridges, and tunnels at times almost halted traffic on the railway routes Warsaw-Gomel-Bryansk and Minsk-Borisov-Smolensk. German anti-partisan operations had developed a definite pattern. As soon as the location of a partisan force became known it would be attacked simultaneously from several sides. Dawn was the preferred time for such raids. However these tactics were successful only if the partisans did not learn beforehand of the Germans' intentions.<br/><br/><br/>South of Casa Barardi, Italy 13 December 1943: In an attempt to gain a port to speed the Commonwealth Forces assault on Rome, the First Canadian Division was assigned to capture the ancient Adriatic port city of Ortona. To gain the approaches to the city the Royal 22nd Regiment was assigned to capture the hamlet of Casa Barardi and the crossroads on the Ortona-Orsogna road beyond. To carry out this task the Royal 22nd&rsquo;s C-Company under the command of Captain Paul Triquet and C Squadron of the Ontario Regiment with seven Shermans under command of Major H.A. &quot;Snuffy&quot; Smith.<br/><br/><br/>Schweigen, Germany, 9 September 1939: On 7 September French units advanced out of the Sarre Gap between the Region Fortifee of Metz and La Lauter of the Maginot Line, moving towards the German industrial centre at Saarbr&uuml;cken. The French units lumbered forward into one of the most heavily defended sectors of the still incomplete Siegfried Line.<br/><br/><br/>Near Eisholz Germany: 1 May 1945: On the 21April the spearheads of the 1st Ukraine Front and the 1st White Russian Fronts met near K&uuml;nigswusterhausen, encircling the three Army Corps of General de Infanterie Busses&rsquo;s German Ninth Army in the Frankfurt-F&uuml;rstenwalde-K&ouml;nigswunsterhausen area. The Ninth Army was now being attacked on three sides. On the morning of 23 April, Hitler had given authorization to pull back the Oder Front. The surrounded Ninth Army formed up for the breakout.<br/><br/><br/>Casa Berardi, Italy 13 December 1943: The Canadian 3rd Brigade committed their reserves, the Royal 22nd Regiment to a hard blow across the &quot;Gully&quot; immediately south of Casa Berardi. In an attempt to pinch out the position in front of the crossroads by driving up from the south. At 0730 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire crossing the &quot;Gully&quot;, at a point deemed to be its least formidable point. &quot;C&quot; Company under Captain Paul Triquet which fought its way over the &quot;Gully&quot; doing terrible damage to enemy tanks with the company&rsquo;s PIATs, was to perform a left flanking movement which was would enable the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from in front.<br/><br/><br/>Southern Edge of Scheidiswald, Russia 17 January 1943: Without pause, the second and third phase of this second battle of Lake Ladoga began. The two old corner-posts of the German defence continued to play their former part. The strongpoint of Gorodok with its hospital and power station on the Neva, at the other end, the fortified positions known as the &quot;Wrengler Barrier&quot;. Time and again throughout the Soviet tank attacks, the guns of the 1st Battalion, 240th Artillery Regiment relieved the grenadiers and engineers by timely defensive fire or concentrated bombardment of the focal points of the attack. Late in the afternoon of the 17th the First Troop guns went silent.<br/><br/><br/>Pontaubault, France 1 August 1944: Patton drove his VII Corps down and through the narrow corridor between the German flanking position and the Atlantic Coast. The 4th U.S. Armoured Division reached Avranches in the evening of 30 July. On the following day it took Pontaubault and established a bridgehead over the Selune River. Patton had burst open the door for the breakout into unconfined expanses of France. That is if he could keep the door open. Patton's VII Corps depended on one road over one bridge, for only one single road with one single bridge led from Avranches over the Selune into Brittany.<br/>  <br/>Near Toungoo, Burma 18 March 1942: Late in the afternoon, three British officers were riding along a jungle track towards Toungoo, 250 km from Rangoon, with 100 soldiers of the Burmese Frontier Forces (F.F.2). They had been on the move for weeks, making their way from the distant Chinese frontier. The riders and their small but sturdy Burmese horses were at the limit of their endurance. The 2nd Frontier Forces column was attached to the Chinese formation under General Stilwell, and given reconnaissance duties.<br/><br/><br/>Ozereyka Bay, Russia, 4 February 1943: A Russian Seaborne Invasion landed and moving inland.

        "description": "The 2nd of Lone Canuck's trilogy of ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own several modules of Advanced Squad Leader to utilize these 12 scenarios.<br/><br/>Here is a description of these scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>4 September 1943... The Canadians splashed ashore at 0430 hours 3rd September, the fourth anniversary of Britain's declaration of war. The Canadians had landed in continental Europe- Hitler's celebrated Festung Europa, without being shot at or suffering a single causality. It was ideal countryside for delaying tactics, executed with excellence by German demolition teams. Steady, if slow progress was made by the Canadian division. The first clash was in Gambarie, a ski resort in a pine forest, was defended not by Germans, but Italians- Fascist militia known as &quot;Black Shirts&quot;...<br/> 7 September 1943... The Second Brigade now moved into the lead, striving to reach Cittanova, a large town on Route 111, one of the lateral highways which crosses the Aspromonte from coast to coast. When the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry were slowed by demolitions along Route 112, Brigadier Chris Vokes sent the Loyal Edmonton Regiment cross-country along a doubtful track which might lead to Cittanova. The Eddies also ran into Italians troops, a hundred German-trained paratroopers of the elite 184th (Nembo) Division, who surprised the Canadians by putting up a spirited fight...<br/><br/><br/>1 October 1943... Campobasso a picturesque city nestled in the eastern foothills of the Apennines was the Canadian objective. Twelve miles from Lucera, Route 17 climbed rapidly. The Princess Louise's Dragoon Guards armoured cars came under heavy machine-gun and shellfire shortly after 0800 hours and the Canadians deployed for a tank-infantry assault. The tank broke into Motta but the infantry were soon pinned down by German artillery and machine-guns...<br/><br/><br/>6 December 1943... The First Canadian Division commander, Chris Vokes after studying patrol reports decided to establish a bridgehead and chose to cross the Moro at three points. The bridgeheads; on Route 16 near the mouth of the Moro, at San Leonardo and at Villa Rogattia village two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The Hasty Ps were to cross the Moro on the right, while the Seaforth of Canada took San Leonardo in the centre and the PPCLI on the left were to capture the village of Villa Rogatti, two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The only clear-cut success was gained by the PPCLI who had slipped across the Moro at an unguarded ford and by dawn had captured the village in a short but savaged battle. When morning came, the Germans launched their first counter attacks along the Moro producing mixed results, and still unable to dislodge Major W.D. &quot;Bucko&quot; Watson and his company as they stood firm on the north bank...<br/><br/><br/>8 December 1943... By nightfall on 6 December, the Canadian division was across the Moro in two places. The only practicable site was the demolished bridge on the road to San Leonardo. The afternoon of 8 December the First Brigade launched a two-prong assault on San Leonardo with the RCR right hooking out of the Hasty Ps bridgehead while the 48th Highlanders of Canada would cross the Moro and attack La Torre midway between Villa Rogatti and San Leonardo. Attacking southwestwards along a long winding lane soon to be dubbed &quot;Royal Canadian Avenue&quot; the RCR would attack across the front of the 361st Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The Germans retreated and San Leonardo was at last secured, but counter-attack were the order of the day and on Thursday 9 December the German counter-attacked. Again and again the Germans swarmed around Sterlin Castle...<br/><br/><br/>23 December 1943... While the Second Brigade slogged its way yard by heartbreaking yard through Ortona's streets and alleys, General Vokes had launched an outflanking attack two miles west of the battered town. The First Brigade was to commit its three-infantry battalions supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment in succession. The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, the Hasty P's would lead the attack, but the two-lead assault companies soon became bogged down in the face of heavy fire. Seeing the difficulties newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Bert Kennedy, charged forward running a gauntlet of bullets and shellfire without so much as hunching his shoulders. Kennedy quickly organized a new assault, moving up one of his reserve companies and putting out a call for the Ontario Shermans, churning in the mud somewhere to the rear....<br/><br/><br/>4 January 1944... The Canadian Army's first action of 1944 on the Adriatic front was fought by the Carleton and York Regiment exacting sweet revenge for its New Year's setback at the hands of those tough paratroopers. At Point 59, overlooking Torre Mucchia on the coast, the Germans had established two strongpoints, defended by a half-dozen machine-guns and linked by trenches, protected by barbed wire and minefields. After a daylong bombardment, a single company of Carletons attacked from two directions...<br/><br/><br/>17 January 1944... The Eleventh Canadian Infantry Brigade of the Fifth Armoured Division moved up on 12 January to relieve the weary Third Brigade and with that the First Canadian Corps had become fully operational in the Italian theatre. The brigade patrol program was barely under way when a dramatic change of plan took place. This operation to be supported by all artillery available. The Perths Regiment went in first, at 0545 hours. C-Company remained pinned down, except for a party under Lieutenant Robert Chamberlain. After fording the Ricco, Chamberlain's platoon had wiped out a three-man machine-gun post and moved up the ridge....<br/><br/>23 May 1944... The western Canadians of the Second Infantry Brigade walked into disaster. For Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry on the right, supported by the Loyal Edmonton Regiment with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada on their left. Major Watson's company reported that it was past the barbed wire entanglements that marked the leading edge of the Hitler Line. Unable to move forward, the tanks present wonderful targets to the Panzerturms mounting 75mm guns. As tank after tank brewed, the survivors were forced to fall back to the dubious protection of the woods. At every step men fell; some were victims of Nebelwerfer fire, many were dropped by machine-gun bullets and others trod on mines scattered about the barbed wire entanglements...<br/><br/><br/>24 May 1944... By the evening of 23 May the Anzio beachhead suddenly coming to life and posing a threat to the German Tenth Army's line of communications. As the German defences crumbled, there was only one possibility of stabilizing the situation in the Liri valley. Six miles northwest of the ruptured Hitler Line, a little river meandered across the floor of the valley. Its name was the Melfa, and if the Germans could hold it, the German Tenth Army might yet be saved. Vokes Force, commanding by Lt-Colonel Vokes and consisting of his British Columbia Dragoons and the Irish Regiment of Canada would go about halfway to the Melfa and then allow Griffin Force to pass through. Vokes Force plunged into action 0757 hours on 24 May. The B-Squadron, BC Dragoons became the first Allied force to engage Mark V Panther tank. Lieutenant Taylor never forgot his shock at seeing the Panther, but fortunately he spotted the Panther before the German saw him...<br/><br/>30 May 1944... The Perths entered undefended Arnara, two miles northwest of Pofi. Beyond lay three hills code-named &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot;. The first two were taken with little difficulty by the Cape Breton Highlanders of Canada and the Irish Regiment of Canada respectively, and the 8th Hussars reached Ceccano. German forces were reported retreating along Route 6 and the Strathconas were ordered to cut them off. They were greeted at the crossroads near the village of Torrice by tanks, self-propelled guns and mounted infantry of the 26th Panzer Division, desperately trying to keep open this vital link....<br/><br/><br/>23 May 1944... Canadian soldiers were among the first to enter Rome. The Black Devils of the Canadian-American First Special S ervice Force (FSSF), who arrived in the embattled Anzio beachhead on 1 February, were the first liberators to enter the city. At 0630, half an hour after the start of the Canadian assault on the Hitler Line , the US VI Corps burst out its trap and launched a drive towards Valmontone. That morning the First Special Service Force with its right flank resting on the Canale Mussolini, punched towards Route 7, the fabled Via Appia, one of the two highways to Rome from the south. The Force reached the road, but a counter attack by a half dozen tanks checked any further advance that day. The tanks included a new and unbelievable monstrosity, Tiger...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 2nd Lone Canuck ASL scenario module for the famed German Grossdeutschland unit.   These 8 scenarios cover actions on the eastern front.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules required.<br/><br/>1 July 1942... 0630-hrs Panzer Battalion Grossdeutschland had already successfully repulsed the early morning Soviet tank attack. When the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron reached the high ground to the north of the small village of Kulewka. There it observed a force of seven Russian light tanks laden with infantry moving into and occupying the village. The German halftracks loaded with infantry roared into the opposite end of the village...<br/><br/><br/>2 July 1942... Infantry Regiment GD 2 of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland reported no significant combat operations along the southern flank. This was soon too change. A divisional order, which was issued during the night of 1-2 July, ordered Infantry Regiment GD 2 to eliminate a dangerous flanking threat to the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and Panzer Division 24 prior to them proceeding with the advance. Early on the sunny morning of 2 July, the infantry moved towards Gorschetschnoje from the north...<br/><br/><br/>22 September 1942... The Operation was named &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; and was undertaken by the 2nd and 3rd Companies of the Sturm-Pioniere Battalions GD and supported by the Artillery Regiment GD. The artillery observers were directly assigned to accompany the pioneers on the assault and would then be able to call in fire in support immediately, meanwhile the Sturm-pionieres, armed with satchel charges, hand grenades, flamethrowers, spades and knives would clear out the bunkers..<br/><br/><br/>30 September 1942... This would be last day Infantry Division 72 and the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland would carried out offensive operations, albeit with limited objectives. On the right was Kampfgruppe Grosser consisting of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of Infantry Regiment 2 GD supported by the Panzer Battalion GD. The infantry moved forward as the artillery opened fire. Despite heavy defensive fire from the other side, the attack made good progress. Oberst Garski personally directed the infantry's assault on the position from the turret of a command tank, using it's radio to direct the artillery on the dug-in Soviet positions...<br/><br/><br/>27 November 1942... The Soviet offensive began on 24 November 1942 as expected without immediately revealing its points of main effort, however. Instead, the Soviets applied pressure all along the German Ninth Army's front, hoping to find the weakest spots in the German main line of resistance. These were revealed in the afternoon, when alarming reports of significant breakthroughs came in from the area south of Bely, in the Luchesa Valley. The result of the large number of reports coming in from all sectors of the XXIII Army Corps was the hasty alerting of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and an order to send individual Kampfgruppe as Fire Brigades to the threatened points...<br/><br/><br/>1 December 1942... Saw the heaviest fighting for the Grossdeutschland Division in the Luchesa Valley. Three Soviet Divisions began attacking at dawn. Following very thorough artillery preparation the tanks and infantry began their advance against the German strongpoints. Numerous Soviet tanks, some with mounted infantry streamed out of the woods. The way to main road, the lifeline not only of the Grossdeutschland Division, but the entire German Ninth Army again appeared to be open before the Russian advance...<br/><br/><br/>10 February 1943... On 14 January 1943, the Soviet launched their third attack across the Don towards the Donets, the full weight of which mainly struck the Hungarian Second Army. The desired breakthrough was achieved quickly simultaneously roll up the Hungarian divisions along the Don north of the breakthrough point from the south. The Soviets spearheads veered north and Northwest on a broad front, placing the German Second Army in extreme danger...<br/><br/><br/>14 March 1943... The Red Army's assault which came in during the bitterly cold night of 18 February struck and rolled over the remnants of a Grenadier company of the Grossdeutschland. The Soviet juggernaut continued to advance along a string of victories towards the Dnieper. Victory had beckoned to them across that great river...<br/><br/><br/>",

Most of the crews succeeded, and the enraged Allied Powers soon stripped Germany of her remaining modern warships as well.<br/><br/>The mass sinking at Scapa Flow did clear up one diplomatic flashpoint: Some American naval staff officers feared they would be incorporated into the Royal Navy and used in an Anglo-American conflict. As punishment for the German act of defiance, the Allies seized all remaining German dreadnought battleships and modern cruisers, plus 400,000 tons of floating cranes and drydocks and other equipment and all submarines. Germany's new Wiemar Republic would have to build its new Reichsmarine around a core of aging ships already docked as obsolete by the old Imperial Navy.<br/><br/>Reichsmarine is a Great War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the High Seas Fleet not been scuttled. Just like Second World War at Sea: Imperial &amp; Royal Navy, it comes as a .pdf download: You get everything right away, but you will have to assemble the playing pieces yourself. It has everything you expect in a naval game supplement: scenarios, ship data sheets, and playing pieces.<br/><br/>The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Navy or Weimar Germany. The ships lost at Scapa Flow are all present in British colors; those surrendered afterwards are in the colors of Weimar Germany. Plus, one-inch &quot;long&quot; pieces are provided for Royal Navy destroyer leaders. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Jutland, Mediterranean, U.S. Navy Plan Gold and Sea of Troubles to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>Reichsmarine is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut-and-mounted, nor are the scenario book or the ship data printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.<br/><br/>",

The holes have a grid overlay indicating the center shot and yards varying from off center. Illustrations and cartoons often accompany the holes on the course.<br/><br/>Players take turns choosing which club they will use, and rolling 2 normal 6-sided dice. Results of their roll are compared to the game chart- a 7 is an ideal shot. The farther away from the center of the bell curve the die roll indicates, the worse the shank or hook on the ball.<br/><br/>Once all players are on the fairway, as in normal golf, player order is determined by distance to the green.<br/><br/>",

Using similar rules to the mass combat system, Warband allows new players to get a taste of the system without committing to purchasing an army.<br/><br/>The objective in Warband is to maintain control of a strategic point on the battlefield for a set number of turns (usually 5) or destroy all of your enemies.<br/><br/>In Warband, each individual miniature is a unit, each unit may receive only one command each turn, unless modified by a spell or special ability.  Possible commands are<br/><br/>1. Non-combat Movement<br/>2. Charge into Melee Combat<br/>3. Melee Combat<br/>4. Missile Combat<br/>5. Rally<br/>6. Disengage<br/>7. Sorcery<br/><br/>In addition to these commands, you may have to deal with the mandatory command Retreat.  Each player in turn issues all commands to his forces, resolves all effects, then play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Warbands are built using a point based system, before play begins players choose their Kingdom, and may only marshal forces from that Kingdom.  Full rules, army lists, and point costs are downloadable for free at the company website. While Black Orc would of course prefer you bought your minis from them, the game can be tried out with the miniatures you have on hand, and the downloaded information.<br/><br/>Boxed sets contained everything to get started, including<br/><br/>The rule book<br/>Testors acrylic paints and paint brush<br/>Miniatures painting guide<br/>Flexible ruler<br/>Two 20 sided dice<br/><br/>A Bushido Clan Strike Force consisting of<br/>a.

It means that the first player places a single stone and every subsequent move players places two stones per turn.<br/><br/>Placing two stones per turn makes game more dynamic and hexagonal shape of the board makes strategies and tactics different from the Go (i.e. in TriGo two &quot;eyes&quot; are not enough for protecting a group of stones).<br/><br/>",

All major ships of the participating powers are included, including dreadnoughts, pre-dreadnoughts, and squads of lighter ships. Historically, the German fleet only challenged the British once, culminating in the Battle of Jutland. This game allows players to explore what might have happened had the Germans been more aggressive and persistent.<br/><br/>The rules of High Seas Fleet are based on the rules system of the classic games of the 1970s, War At Sea and Victory in the Pacific. However, High Seas Fleet introduces a number of innovations to keep the system fresh. The combat system has been modified to mitigate the extremes of luck and Command Cards introduce a degree of both flexibility and uncertainty. Allies can enter based on your efforts to recruit them and stay or go based on your success on the high seas. The game system remains clean and simple, perfect for introducing youngsters or novices to historical gaming, yet substantial enough to reward the veteran gamer.<br/><br/>Played on a map that includes the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterranean regions, High Seas Fleet includes both introductory and standard rules, plus several scenarios including a single-turn, introductory scenario of the Battle of Jutland, and even some alternative history scenarios, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire war. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Tactical Assault: Combat Cards&trade; is an elegant card-driven rule set for bringing all of the challenges of combined arms warfare - including command &amp; control and the fog of war - to the tabletop battlefield in a very playable fashion. The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more problematic aspects of modern operations such as air support, artillery barrages, fortifications, smoke screens, engineering operations and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.<br/><br/>Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Combat Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.<br/><br/>In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.<br/><br/>And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Combat Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Combat Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Combat Card decks!<br/><br/>All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FIGHTING THE TALIBAN: Pakistan's Operation Sherdil, Aug. 2008<br/><br/>The threat was and remains real.The Taliban and al-Qaeada are slowing taking over this country with nuclear weapons. Not a good thing. Operation Sherdil (Lion Heart) began in August 2008 and was initially aimed at preventing the imminent fall of Khar, headquarters of Bajaur District, to the Taliban. The military operation was intended to reclaim all of Bajaur from the Taliban and al Qaeda, which amounted to around 3000 terrorists. On August 3rd, a 200-strong force from the paramilitary Frontier Corps were surrounded by 300-400 Taliban fighters, heavy fighting erupted as they tried to break out. After a three-day battle, the Pakistani troops routed back to Khar, and the Taliban seemed victorious. They quickly followed the Pakistani force and began to threaten Khar. Operation Sherdil was later expanded to recapturing all of Bajaur district from the Taliban. This proved to be a tall order and led to a protracted series of battles over two months. Pakistan's resolve came into question (as it still does). By late October, many of the objectives had been reached but not all. Loysam was not retaken until Oct. 25th. Over 2700 terrorists had been killed, yet, Bajaur Agency remained unsettled when the army left. It remains so to this day.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Each turn is six days, with half mile hexes. Units are battalion and company for Pakistani forces, and platoon size for al-<br/>Qaeda and Taliban. The game is a true conventional military force taking on the terrorist groups in Bajaur Agency from August through October, 2008. The terrorists were well armed and had fortified many of the small towns outside of the city of Khar. They had been slowly taking over the area. Sherdil was prompted when a small force of paramilitary found themselves surrounded and under siege at Loysam from 300 Taliban. This Pakistani force managed to breakout and fled to Khar, which was under Taliban pressure. It was at this time the Pakistani military unleashed its forces in what many claim ended in a draw. Some 8000 soldiers, 20 Cobra gunships and F16 jets pounded the enemy, which numbered 3000. Pakistan's resolve came into question with this early offensive.<br/>In the game, the Pakistani army does not have unlimited resources to conduct a long offensive as each attack will cost. How well the Pakistani player orchestrates his attack will dictate who the winner is. The Taliban can literally appear and disappear in certain types of terrain making any attack questionable. Their unique movement and evasion will cause any Pakistani player frustration.<br/><br/>",

Each man standing with his lord watched as the orcs gathered into an unruly mob, threats and swords rose in fury. With a howl, the orc warlord Grom ordered his warriors to battle, the mob surging forward, each orc slobbering for the blood of the humans before them, each trying to be the first to draw blood and reap death among their foes. Lord John ordered his men-at-arms to hold their line, for each man to gather his courage.  As the mob of green orcs reached the armored line of men, the sounds of battle <br/>and the screams of the dying could be heard across the field. <br/> This is Steel and Glory, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions.  A fast paced skirmish game of battle, skill and guts, Steel and Glory allows players to field small bands of warriors, who will then fight bloody engagements.  Each set within the system will cover two different forces, and also offer new battle tiles, new abilities and new excitement.  So don&rsquo;t wait, gather your warriors to you and fight for the glory of your chosen lord.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's information:<br/>Manoeuvre Group is designed to fight all arms actions in the period from 1941 to at least 2010, using forces up to a Company Group (Battle Group in US terminology). That is, up to 8 tanks, 1 or 2 platoons of supporting infantry and their supporting close reconnaissance, engineering and artillery assets, in an evening. The innovative rule system means no book keeping. At this scale the battles are fought at close quarters, in relatively dense terrain, be it urban or rural, from England to Iraq and all points in between. Manoeuvre Group&rsquo;s emphasis is just that, the command of manoeuvre units to eliminate the enemy. The reading of the ground, timing and employment of all arms assets are the key to winning a battle. The player will spend more time moving units about to exploit weaknesses in the enemy&rsquo;s plan than calculation of hit factors and dice rolling. The rules capture the ebb and flow of a battle often missing in other rules. With practise, experts (in tactics) can achieve 10 to 15 bounds in an evening even with a full Company Group.<br/><br/>",

After advancing several dozen miles they stopped to secure their supply lines, only to meet a devastating British counter-attack that soon had them reeling back halfway across Libya. For the next two and a half years, Axis and Allied armies surged back and forth across the North African desert until finally Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery's British Eighth Army wrecked Erwin Rommel's vaunted Panzer Army Africa.<br/><br/>Western Desert Force: The Desert Campaign 1940-1942 is a quick-playing game from the same designer as our Defiant Russia, following the same philosophy: a game you can play in just an hour or two, with the emphasis on tense action and lots of fun.<br/><br/>The map portrays the North Africa from El Agheila to Alexandria. It's divided into hexagons, at a scale of 15 miles across each.<br/><br/>Players control the actual units that fought in this campaign. Units are divisions, brigades and regiments with some battalions. The Axis player controls German, Italian and Italian Colonial (Libyan) units; the Allied player leads British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Indian, Polish, Jewish, Free French and Greek units in the fight against fascism.<br/><br/>The objectives for each side are simple: kick the enemy out of North Africa. The strategy is not so easy: the Allies must hold on to protect the Suez Canal; the Axis must choke off this vital waterway. Neither can afford to be ejected from the otherwise worthless desert.<br/><br/>The game design is by William Sariego, and development is by industry veteran Paul Dangel in his Avalanche Press debut.<br/><br/>Western Desert Force includes:<br/><br/>     One 33&quot;x17&quot; map<br/>     Full-color play aids<br/>     140 game pieces<br/>     16-page rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 15 miles / 24 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Three 11 x 17&quot; full color maps<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (140 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Western Desert Force rulebook<br/>Three single-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>One dual-side printed Random Events Card<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

These are an 'upscaled' version of Chris Peers' earlier In the Heart of Africa rules, now using figures mounted on multiple figure bases rather than individually mounted. This means that larger scale actions can be fought, such as the Zulu War and the Sudan campaigns.<br/><br/>The rules are pretty straightforward, and include variable movement rates, alternate moves by unit, disorder markers, and straightforward shooting and melee rules.<br/><br/>Five scenarios are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War Game Rules for Conducting Eighteenth Century Battles<br/><br/>From Wikipedia<br/>The rules in Grosstaktik govern weapon fire and melee. The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries.<br/><br/>When enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.<br/><br/>Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence. The booklet includes short descriptions of each of these conflicts.<br/><br/>Note:  Publisher not list.  Game is listed on back page along with other games from Guidon Games. Red Cover.<br/><br/>",

From the ironclads of the late 1800s to the super-dreadnoughts of World War II, players can take command of the ships that altered the course of history.<br/><br/>Great pains have been taken to accommodate a wide range of preferences: hexes or no hexes; any miniatures scale; simultaneous or sequential play. The choices are up to you!<br/><br/>In addition to the basic rules for surface actions between 1890 and 1940, Grand Fleets includes advanced rules for things like time of day, smokescreens, crew quality, and destroyer flotillas. Best of all, you'll never have to wait for &quot;official&quot; publication of your favorite ships: comprehensive, step-by-step guidelines are provided to generate data cards for any vessel that put to sea during the battleship era.<br/><br/>So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes! your destiny awaits!<br/><br/>",

Playing a game with SuperSystem requires the following: a copy of these rules, painted miniatures, around 20 six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), copies of the SuperSheets printed in the appendix of this book, pencils, and a roughly 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; playing area.<br/><br/>SuperSystem is an ideal game for two players, but more participants can get involved for longer, multi-player games. Battles in SuperSystem can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as ten to thirty models per side. There are two basic types of models in SuperSystem: characters and henchmen. Characters are the heroes and villains that make up the superhuman population of Four-Color Earth, the fictional setting of the game. Henchmen are their underlings, goons, mooks, or cannon fodder.

        "description": "In the years before the Civil War, Ohio exploded with railroad fever. At the crossroads between the East Coast and the newly opened lands to the west, Ohio was a magnet for speculators and promoters. Between 1832, when the first railroad was chartered in Ohio, and the Civil War, hundreds of companies were chartered in the state. The 25 companies in the game represent but a small portion of those companies.<br/><br/>While many giants imprinted their name on the period, the early railroad era was beset with recessions, panics, and bursting bubbles. 18OH puts players in the role of railroad entrepreneurs trying to amass fortunes during those heady times. As a budding mogul you open new companies, buy and sell stock in your own and other players&rsquo; companies, and operate your company for--hopefully!--immense profits. The winner is the player with the highest net worth (cash and stock) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>18OH is a member of the 18xx family of railroad-related economic games.<br/><br/>During its development the game was named 18io.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seeds of War is a tabletop miniatures wargame which allows you to play out battles between massive sci-fi armies.  The rules cover the movement, morale, and combat of infantry, armor, artillery, aircraft, as well as giant warmachines.  The rules can be used with any 6mm sci-fi miniatures but are designed to be used with Dark Realm Miniatures which feature several armies each possessing a unique play-style based on the force's strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The Seeds of War rule-set as well as army lists for the various armies can be downloaded for free at Dark Realm Miniatures website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From publisher's website:<br/><br/>First Contact is a supplement to 5150, the original set of sci-fi rules from Two Hour Wargames. First Contact revolves around a rebellion on a small planet where the colonists have decided to break away from their home world. It documents the war between Earth and her first colony, Mars. <br/>But what starts out as a local conflict erupts into something larger as the rebels, known as the Sahadeen, receive help from an unexpected source, the ever-expanding empire of Gaea Prime.<br/><br/>First Contact incorporates the Earth Force and Sahadeen into 5150. We've documented the three stages of the conflict and have provided six linked scenarios into a mini-campaign. First Contact can be played solo against the game mechanics (or against the machine as we like to call it), cooperatively where all players are on the same side against the machine or competitively against your friends. And it can be played from either side.<br/>Ideal for use with the 15mm range of Sci Fi figures from Rebel Minis, First Contact can be used with any figures you may already have.<br/><br/>5150: First Contact is not a stand alone game. You must have 5150 to play.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of alien species competing to abduct and control Earthlings. Cards represent Earthlings (human and otherwise). Cards in a player's hand are Earthlings that have been previously abducted, and can now be activated by their alien overlords to do nefarious tasks - most frequently abducting more Earthlings. Cards face-down at various locations on the table represent Earthlings to be abducted. The face-down stacks at each location are built up by players during the course of the game; thus each player potentially has some knowledge about what types of Earthlings are at each location, which is where memory becomes involved.<br/><br/>Players move their spaceship tokens from location to location, abducting Earthlings (moving some of the face-down cards away from the location), and then fly back to their homeworlds to score them. Some Earthlings cause trouble when they are abducted (damaging the spaceship), while other may offer benefits while they are aboard. Players can also directly and indirectly attack other players' spaceships, to either prevent them from completing their abduction goals or sometimes to steal dangerous Earthlings without suffering the consequences.<br/><br/>Players win by successfully abducting 10 Earthlings and returning them to their homeworld. Each player also has a secret objective which allows them to win with a smaller number of Earthlings, such as six of the same species or 7 of the same gender.<br/><br/>Earthling Abductor: Deluxe Edition contains 68 Earthling cards, 7 Alien races, and 6 plastic space-ships. It supports 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Earthling Abductor also comes in a non-Deluxe edition, in a smaller box containing 44 Earthling cards, 4 Alien races, and 4 plastic space-ships. It supports 2 players. The two versions are otherwise identical.<br/><br/>",

Everybody starts the game with 10 cards and the objective to achieve the victory is to discard all your cards, but to do this you have to keep an eye on the sequence: It has to be logical.<br/>Each turn every player spin the wheel and do whats it's written.<br/>It could be to drop a card, drop a closed card, give two of your cards to another opponent, challenge another player if the sequence makes sense, without the risk of taking all cards to you, change two cards, put a card between others that are already on a sentence, or the most excite option, put a card on any blank space, but when the sentence gets there it has to be logical. And if you don't agree with your opponent you can challenge him to explain the sentence. You can conjugate the verb in diferent ways to make sense, but if the other players don't agree you take all the cards from the board, but if you can explain to them and they accept the opponent that challenges you take all the cards. The first one to discard the last card wins the game.<br/><br/>",

From Napoleonic France populated by burrowing mammals, to an Ottoman Empire founded by reptilian nomads, Brushfire continues to follow our Legendary Realms roleplaying mentality with an indepth hero and army development system, as well as a complex Campaign design. (Publisher Blurb)<br/><br/>The game features a unique and interesting system using 10 sided dice instead of the classic 6 sided.  This creates new dynamics as well as new odds to master.  In addition, the game has three different kinds of points by which to buy your army.  This creates a very different feel than most war games, as an army feels like an army, not all heroes or all infantry.  Finally, the game uses and RPG-like style of hero creation, where a player is given so many hero levels, which can be used to buy skills on a skill tree.  Overall this makes for an original and fascinating game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quarterback King is a board game which unites the sport of football and the game of chess into a fun, strategic game for two players. The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.<br/><br/>Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.<br/><br/>Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.<br/><br/>Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.<br/><br/>Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.<br/><br/>This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.<br/><br/>",

Trials entail a battle of wits that will require bluffing, deduction, and careful timing to win.  Players earn trial tokens by having animal &quot;morph&quot; cards in play with attributes that best match the requirements of the current trial.  Players will also cast a variety of spell and obstacle cards to hinder their competitors or propel themselves to victory.  But be careful! Cards are selected in a hidden fashion with all players revealing their moves simultaneously.  When shape-shifting is involved, you will need to be cunning to stay ahead.

In HopperDame with promotion rule you win by capturing all the opponent's pieces. Pieces move forwards and sideways, orthogonally or diagonally, by shifting to an adjacent square, or by jumping over an adjacent friendly piece (also termed 'hopper'). Jumps must only occur over a piece of the same colour. It's not allowable to step or jump backwards. The exception to this is the &quot;king&quot;, which can jump over any piece, and step in all directions.<br/><br/>To promote to king one must conquer the &quot;castles&quot;, that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece, so called &quot;double-promotion&quot;. If a piece steps or jumps into the enemy corner then it is promoted to king only if the other enemy corner is already occupied by a friendly piece. Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece. The promotion is then done by dropping the piece on the same square. But this costs a move.<br/><br/>HopperDame employs the rule of exchange-capture: the counter jumps over a friendly counter. If the square where it lands is occupied by an enemy counter, then this is captured. It is only when leaping that the counter can make captures. A leaping counter may continue to leap over friendly counters until there are no more to leap over or the player decides to stop. It's not allowable to jump back to the square you just came from.<br/><br/>Note that capture is only made when jumping. Thus, a single piece cannot make a capture by itself. The exception to this is the king, which has an additional capture method: it can capture an adjacent enemy piece directly, like a king in chess.<br/><br/>",

With one shared deck the two players will be able to make their dragons grow and fight in the quest for the title &quot;Dragon's Lord&quot;. Every turn you can put in play from your hand one dragon, attach one energy card to a dragon, play one tactic card, and/or attack; then the next player draws one card and repeats the process. Once you have in play a basic dragon you can put in play a level one dragon, then a level 2, and so on; or you can level up the basic dragon and get a bonus ability. Game play and style is similar to Pokémon TCG but much simpler, yet very strategic.<br/><br/>Dragon's Lord es un juego gratuito de cartas no coleccionable sobre duelos entre entrenadores de dragones. Con un &uacute;nico mazo compartido los dos jugadores ser&aacute;n capaces de hacer crecer sus dragones y luchar en busca del t&iacute;tulo de &quot;Se&ntilde;or de los Dragones&quot;. Cada turno puedes poner en juego desde tu mano un drag&oacute;n, adosar una carta de energ&iacute;a a un drag&oacute;n, jugar una carta de t&aacute;ctica y/o atacar; luego el siguiente jugador roba una carta y repite el proceso. Una vez que tienes en juego un drag&oacute;n b&aacute;sico puedes poner en juego un drag&oacute;n de nvl 1, luego uno de nvl 2 y as&iacute; sucesivamente.

The Great Father Aleksandr Kerensky led our forefathers, the remnants of the noble Star League army, away from that empty conflict. In turn, his son Nicholas forged us into the Clans: a society founded on unity, strength and skill. With each generation we evolved, awaiting the day when we would return to the Inner Sphere to save it from itself.<br/><br/>Now is the time of the Return. Some among the Clans insist that conquest of the Inner Sphere is the only Way, but we know that this path will only lead us into the chaos of the past. Our true mission is far more noble: we must act as the Wardens of the Inner Sphere until the time is right and humanity is truly reunited. Only then will the true Star League have returned to the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>-- Ulric Kerensky, ilKhan of the Clans<br/><br/>The second of two volumes on the Clans, Field Manual: Warden Clans describes the Defenders of Kerensky's Vision: Clans Cloud Cobra, Coyote, Diamond Shark, Ghost Bear, Goliath Scorpion, Snow Raven and Steel Viper. This book describes the tactics, military doctrines and battle histories of each Clan, plus special rules that reflect the unique capabilities of each Galaxy, new weapons, equipment, exclusive Warden BattleMechs and more.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Following up on earlier sourcebooks devoted to the Clans, this gives detail on all of those Clans identified as Warden Clans at the time of printing. Some of the Clans receive more attention than others, depending on how much detail was already in print via previous books. Along with the background detail on the Clans, the expansion also details new Battle Armour variants, a new OmniMech, a new weapon system and new Warships are all introduced in this expansion, although these items have largely been reprinted in later sourcebooks.<br/><br/>This book is a companion volume to the BattleTech Field Manual: Crusader Clans, and is currently out of print. The current license holder hasn't published this book as an electronic download as yet.<br/><br/>",

Rolling doubles explodes the dice (roll the doubles again and add to the previous roll). Any rolls of 6 automatically cause 1 point of damage to their opponent's Stamina.<br/><br/><br/>     If a round was won using Strength, any character reduced to zero or less Stamina loses and is out; if all characters have no Stamina, the match is a draw.<br/>     If a round was won using Agility, the winning character has pinned the losing character. Pinning a character for three consecutive rounds will cause that character to lose.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of each match, players can increase their character's stats using Glory Points (1 GP is gained for each point scored in their rolls, and an additional 100 GP goes to the winner of a match). Buying an additional Strength or Agility die costs the current number of dice x 100 GP (each additional die bought also adds 5 Stamina).<br/><br/>There are additional rules for using teams, weapons, and stunning.

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>A perfect complement to Second Season Football for solo replay projects.  FastScore Football allows the Replayer to quickly play out a whole day's schedule of games, including realistic scores, in just minutes!<br/><br/>It's a quick play game that generates the score of a football game with a few rolls of the dice. It incorporates ease of play, a simple ratings system and simple charts. Hundreds of simulated seasons are run, ensuring the accuracy of each Fastscore season while factoring in each team&rsquo;s strength of schedule.<br/><br/>Although the ratings seem simple, there is a great deal of background information packed into each rating. This game uniquely takes into account the offensive and defensive styles of each team by separating scoring frequency and scoring ability. For example, some teams may score frequently, but fail to execute in the red zone- thus adding points to the board with field goals more frequently than touchdowns. Others may rarely score but efficiently march into the endzone- thus scoring more touchdowns than field goals.   Additionally, offensive and defensive strengths in the running and passing game are reflected in the ratings and will influence the score of the game.  For example, teams with strong defenses against the run will more effectively shut down teams that rely on the running game.  And in close games, give your team a fighting chance by going for a 2-pt conversion!<br/><br/>With Fastscore football, teams will perform similarly to their real-life stats in points for and against, touchdowns for and against, field goals for and against, and most importantly, their win-loss record.  These stats are fine-tuned to a 250-season average typically within 10 points of actual, and within 2 TDs and FGs of actual.  Strength of schedule is factored into the ratings to ensure the utmost in accuracy.<br/><br/>And the best part: we&rsquo;ve included the as-played schedule for each season! And we didn&rsquo;t stop there- we know that your time is valuable, so we&rsquo;ve calculated the final team ratings for each game on the schedule- taking into account home field advantage and the run/pass ratings- so you don&rsquo;t have to do the calculations yourself.  Just sit back, roll the dice and mark down the score of the game.<br/><br/>Fastscore Football is played using two differently colored 6-sided dice. Each team has seven ratings representing offensive and defensive abilities and a clutch rating. Better ratings are color coded in green while worse ratings are color coded in red. Higher offense ratings represent teams with punishing offenses. Lower defense ratings represent teams that effectively shut down their opponents.<br/><br/>If you play Fastscore as a stand-alone game, you can finish a season replay in a few hours! You can also use Fastscore Football as a complement to detailed, play by play games like Second Season Football. If you are enjoying a single team replay, play your favorite team&rsquo;s games with your favorite football game while playing out the other games on the schedule with Fastscore, and see how your team is doing in the standings! A week&rsquo;s worth of games can be completed in less than 15 minutes!<br/><br/>Fastscore offers great value for the gamer. Each Fastscore set includes multiple seasons for one low price! We intend to rate every season from current day to the seasons of yesteryear.<br/><br/>Each season includes: <br/><br/>    Rules of the game<br/>    Scoring Charts<br/>    Team Ratings Chart<br/>    As-Played Schedule with pre-calculated game ratings for each team<br/><br/><br/>",

For example: the slime, which is the weakest creature (Power:1) has a value of 6 points when placed on its appropriate place in the crypt, while the lich (Power: 6) gives you only 1 point!<br/><br/>Join the clash of bones!

They vie with each other to build the best museum in the world by collecting artefacts: prehistoric, art, jewellery, statues, sarcophagi, inscriptions, weapons and pottery. These are collected in the Regional exhibition rooms of the museums and organised on the basis of the continent of origin.<br/><br/>In the course of the game you will also host Special Exhibitions such as 'The Relics of Peking Man' or 'the Lost Glory of Carthage' which will require collecting specific sets of exhibits. You also will be on the lookout for clues that will enable you to collect one or two main attractions for your museum &ndash; an artefact of global significance such as the Complete Works of Shakespeare or the Sword of Julius Caesar. (Clues can also help with expeditions.)<br/><br/>All of these activities bring your museum value to set it above the rest. In an effort to achieve victory you will fund expeditions around the world, competing with the other players as to which to support and to what extent. You will buy and sell artefacts on the world market, auction them off and you may be tempted to risk the black market. (Just don't get caught or it will look bad for your museum.) You will also invest in action cards which can give you the edge in various aspects of the game.<br/><br/>Four times in the game there is an Exhibition Phase. During this phase you calculate the score of your museum, which is gained from the stars on each tile you own in Regional Halls with bonuses for larger collections. Completed Special exhibitions (active and old) also contribute to your score as do some action cards and the Main Attractions. A museum score is used to calculate how much prestige your Museum gained from that Exhibition Phase as well as how much income it receives for the next turn.<br/><br/>The best managed museum will gain the most Prestige and will win the game. Will yours be the great museum?<br/><br/>",

Curtis is unaware that a numerically superior Confederate army lead by General Earl Von Dorn is converging on his position.<br/><br/>The Confederates make a dawn strike from the north around Pea Ridge having spent two days outflanking the entrenchments of the Union army.<br/><br/>Pea Ridge initially has a time limit of 12 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their objective. The game can be extended into a second day of conflict. Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2-3 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>",

The rules are designed to allow players to fight large battles with battalion sized units in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/>Command and control, orders and morale for large formations are combined with easy to learn tactical game mechanics so that battles of a Corps or more a side <br/>can easily be fought by a few players during an evening. Each unit on the table represents a battalion of infantry, regiment of cavalry or battery of artillery.<br/><br/>A ground scale of 1&quot; to 60 yards, one turn representing 20 minutes and fast paced strategic movement rules mean that battles play out at a realistic rate. Combat is dealt with in a manner that allows large numbers of units to be fielded and the interaction between strategic movement and tactical combat allows for a fast paced game that keeps a good level of detail.<br/><br/>Seven different training and morale levels combined with the historical strength of a unit introduces the concept of &lsquo;Combat Value&rsquo;. This ties together all of the tactical rules and ensures that troop quality, more than just luck or buckets of dice, plays an important part in every battle.<br/><br/>",

Hannut was the largest tank battle to yet occur during the Second World War. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain. The first large scale encounter occurred at Hannut, not far from the famous battlefields of Ramillies and Waterloo. Here the 1st and 2nd French Light Mechanized Divisions, heavily armed with tanks, ran into the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions.<br/><br/>The players, taking on the roles of the commander of the 1st French Army and German Army Group B during the Battle for Belgium.  The French, thinking that this was the main German effort, committed their most modern divisions to this battle.  For the Germans, this was a feint to tie down the French (and destroy their best units) while Army Group A raced through the Ardennes to the English Channel, to encircle the best Allied Armies. Tactically, the French were successful at Hannut.  Strategically, the Germans accomplished their goal of &quot;soaking off&quot; the French armor away from the main effort through the Ardennes, however the French 1st Army survived the campaign and was later instrumental in protecting the Dunkirk pocket, allowing hundreds of thousands of English and French troops to evacuate to England.<br/><br/>This is the sixth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1.5 hours<br/>Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 11x17&quot; full color map (in 2 parts)<br/>One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)<br/>One 8-page rulebook<br/>One Player aid Charts (TEC/CRT)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours<br/><br/>",

Each player takes the role of a group of soldiers who are fighting in a arena for victory.<br/><br/>Deathmatch uses only cards and some markers for the characters. The different card types are:<br/><br/>- Character Cards:<br/>Every character in the game is represented by a Character Card, which contains all necessary information (e.g. Attack-, Defense-Value, Action Points, Portage Capacity and their Special Abilities). Each Character Card has a normal and a wounded side.<br/><br/>- Equipment Cards:<br/>Equipment Cards represented the different equipment in the game, like a M16, a PSG-1 or a Bulletproof Vest. Characters can be equipped with Equipment Cards, to increase their fight or defense ability. The equipment cards also serve as dice rolls. Each card has a Fate Number printed on it, which is between 0 and 5. In Combat you can play an Equipment Card from your hand to boost your Attack- or Defense-Value and then you always adds the Fate Number from top card of your Equipment Deck to determine the outcome of this action. Equipped Cards are no longer in your Equipment Deck and so their Fate Numbers are no longer in the dice pool. If your characters have good equipment, than the player will have fewer good Fate Numbers in his Deck. So each player has to find the right balance between right equipment and the remaining Fate Numbers in his deck.<br/><br/>- Terrain Cards:<br/>A Terrain Card represents a part of the arena, where the characters compete against each other. Every card is divided in 6 (3x2) squares and has a different setup of covers and obstacles, like Metal Walls and Mud Pits.<br/><br/>- Scenario Cards:<br/>Each Scenario Card represents a game mode, like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag or Domination. All necessary information is given on these cards. This includes information such as the special rules, the way to lay out the Terrain Cards to create the arena or the Winning Conditions.<br/><br/>- Marker Cards:<br/>The Marker Cards represent the characters, special markers or items for the different scenarios. Before the first play, the players have to cut out the markers to use them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shakespeare CARDUTA is a simple card game based on the traditional Japanese card game Hyakunin Isshu      (100 Poems by 100 Poets), which uses one hundred ancient Japanese short poems. &quot;CARDUTA&quot; is a made-up word from &quot;card&quot; and the Japanese word &quot;uta&quot;, which means &quot;songs&quot;.<br/><br/>The full set includes 48 word cards and 48 word-and-picture cards, with the cards containing quotations (and half-quotations) from Shakespeare's plays. For example, a word card might read &quot;No profit grows where is no pleasure taken.&quot;, while the corresponding word-and-picture card reads only &quot;where is no pleasure taken&quot;, with the picture giving a clue to the first half of the quote.<br/><br/>To play, lay out all the picture cards face-up on the table. One person draws a word card and reads the first half of it; everyone else looks for the matching picture card, with the first player to pick up the correct card claiming it. The next player then draws a word card, etc. The player who claims the most picture cards wins.<br/><br/>Shakespeare CARDUTA is also available in two half-game versions: a Tragedy Set and a Comedy Set, each with 24 word cards and 24 picture cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract strategy game played on a special board. Two players, X and O, take turns placing a bridge between any two of their adjacent pegs not blocked by an existing bridge. The first player to complete a connected chain of bridges between their sides wins. Ties are not possible.<br/><br/>Visavis is a Shannon switching game on the edges and belongs to the same class of connection games as Bridg-It and TwixT (and to some extend Trellis). Even though a trivial winning strategy has been found for Bridg-It (called Connexxions on the server) Visavis consists of a more complex system of overlaid triangular grids that allows richer variety of play, and no winning strategy is known.<br/><br/>Michail Antonow points out that different tactics must be applied when blocking an opponent's rightward path as opposed to a leftward path. The path can be abruptly cut by a single piece in one direction only; in the opposite direction a single bridge will only divert the path and two bridges are needed for a successful block.<br/><br/>The rules state that a bridge can be placed between any two adjacent pegs of the same colour. However since it can never help to place a bridge between the opponent's pegs, then it is assumed that all moves are made between the current player's pegs. This also simplifies the board notation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2164. Mankind has self-actualized enough to realize that we are creatures of violence. Centuries of denying one of our base instincts has not led to a more civilized society. Technological advances have given unprecedented scales of damage potential to our conflicts. In 2153, the Council of Restraint was formed in response to the particularly devastating aftermath of a conflict between the United African Republic and Pacific Rim Conglomerate. Three years later the Conflict Resolution Accords were ratified. Now when conflicts arise, the involved states or ideological groups can settle the dispute in a manner that mitigates widespread destruction. Large, mechanized military machines meet to do battle of epic proportion. These battles are waged in controlled arenas to contain the violence and damage. Armored Terran Systems Corporation manufactures base machines called Mechs and combatants configure their Mech with armaments and options in preparation for combat.<br/><br/>The Earth Shook is a game where each player assumes the role of a large mechanized military class robot. Where man once waged war across the globe on epic proportions, machines now resolve the conflict in controlled arenas. Build your machine, defend your ideology, and destroy the others. Be the last machine standing on the field of battle; to the victor go the spoils of war.<br/><br/>Players each receive a basic identical Mech from the factory. They have a set amount of points that they can use to buy modules for the Mech. These modules adjust the ratings for Evasion, Shields, Armor, Speed, Maneuverability, Weapon Damage, Rate of Fire, and more. Once the modules have been purchased, the Mech stats are adjusted to reflect the module choices and teh game can commence.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to RoboRally or Wings of War in that each player will select 6 Move/Maneuver actions for their Mech each turn. In this manner, a turn is played out in six rounds as the Mechs execute their programmed moves. Can you out-maneuver your opponent? Do you risk an all out frontal attack. Each player will approach the battle differently, hoping to draw upon the strengths of their configured Mech.<br/><br/>Build &amp; Battle. The game is on...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rulebook Designer's note:<br/><br/>&quot;The original version of SC3600 was developed and published by Mariner Games back in 1997. The original launch was accompanied by a small range of miniatures developed by Brigade Models. However the original designers, Patrick Doyle, Mike Tastsides and Doug Glover were serving members of the US armed forces and as such had more pressing demands on their time than playing games, so development of the rules understandably stalled.<br/>[...] We've avoided unnecessary changes to the core rules, being content to tinker around the edges with minor changes to the design system and the inclusion of a hex-less movement system. Our main goal has been to streamline the rules a little without drastically altering the flavour. Probably the one major change has been to do away with the 12-point movement system that allowed movement along hex edges - we abandoned this in our own games very early on. We've also removed the distinction between the Basic and Advanced versions of the game in favour of a single unified set of rules.&quot;<br/><br/>The game uses miniatures of starfighters, it is played on a hex map but a set of rules to use hexless maps is also included. The main dice roll used is the 2d6 roll, this is modified by another kinf of dice (ranging from a d4 to a d12) based on the pilot skill. These dice rolls are used to resolve fights and control rolls when your fighter is going spinning around due to damages or wrong manouvers. The damage system is very interesting, being it not the &quot;classic&quot; set of boxes that have to be crossed out but a system that takes in account a series of debilitating damages that during the game, imposing each a number of malus and penalties, can render your fighter inoperative or totally destroyed. Statistics for the official fighter models are in the end of the book.<br/><br/>These are introductory free rules, Brigade Models is going to publish in a near future more complete rules (this time you are going to buy them) that will also include campaign games rules, pilots' skill progression and others more convoluted situations not presented here.<br/><br/>",

We begin bombing in five minutes.&rdquo; &ndash; Ronald Reagan, 1984. With these words, spoken as a sound check to a radio broadcast, President Reagan came dangerously close to igniting the long-simmering Cold War. Although Soviet forces were placed on alert following reports of this comment, the full-scale conflict between the West and the Soviet Bloc did not break out. Cold War Gone Hot, the latest companion volume for Force on Force, looks at the 44-year history of the Cold War and asks: &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; With the orders of battle, vehicle stats and missions included in this volume, Force on Force players can simulate the advance of Soviet tanks across Western Europe, a thrust into Alaska, or any number of other plausible scenarios where history took a slightly different path.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The western kingdoms are in danger! Their only hope is the &quot;Sturmklinge&quot;, a powerful sword that has been kept in the stronghold of the &quot;Fishers&quot; since the last war. The Fishers are a group of scholars that collect knowledge and secrets to safeguard them in their fortress. The &quot;Council of the Nine&quot; is getting together to decide who shall take the &quot;Sturmklinge&quot; into the battle against Nemetor. But at night a body is found, and one of the Fishers has disappeared. Have Nemetor's henchmen already reached the Fishers' stronghold? Do the want to stop the Council? Or is there a traitor among the Council members? This is what the players have to find out.<br/><br/>In &quot;Die Legende der Sturmklinge&quot; there are 8 obligatory roles (can't be played with less than 8): 4 male, 4 female. One optional role, the scholar and host (a Fisher), can be either male or female. The roles include typical fantasy characters: an elf, a barbarian, a merchant, a knight, a priestess, a mage, an amazon and a dwarf.<br/><br/>",

Of course, the set-up, board and gameplay are markedly different than Camelot.<br/><br/>The game is played in partnerships with partners sitting next to each other. The goal is for one set of partners to get any two pieces to te opponents' goal spaces-- either each partner getting one piece into one of the two the goal spaces opposite him or one partner getting two pieces into those spaces.<br/><br/>Each player has two types of pieces which mostly move similarly. Draughts-like jumps occur in all directions, or one can jump one's own pieces without capturing. Each player focuses on trying to get his pieces past the player opposite him BUT defense also has to protect the opponent from pieces moving laterally.<br/><br/>Note that Grand Camelot is distinctly different from the other 4-player games in the Series: Camelot (Abstract games) family, Four-handed Chivalry and Grand Cam.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Title Chase Basketball is a fast-paced game nominally about professional basketball. The game focuses on team building, getting into the playoffs and winning it all. Title Chase Basketball should not be confused with a simulation. It is a game meant to pit players against each other and as such can be completed from the start of the season to game seven of the finals in about an hour.<br/><br/>The first half of the game is a card-driven game where you build up your team by improving positions, winning key games and gain ground in the standings. You will need to decide what teams surge ahead and which ones will fall by the wayside. Do you build a team of all-stars quickly and have a giant bulls-eye placed on their back for the other players to shoot at. Do you turn your team of journeymen into a solid-all around squad. Or maybe you want those one or two superstars that can guarantee you a deep run into the playoffs. The way that you build your team is up to you.<br/><br/>At the end of the regular season, the game switches to a full-on dice game using the teams you created during the regular season. Teams match up in best of 7 series where your dice are the ones you labored to improve earlier. As your dice are expended in each series, the games get closer and closer and often it comes down to one final toss of the die.<br/><br/>Although the game does not use hard and fast statistics and has no built in way to produce them, I find that it really scratches that sports itch that I used to spend hours on back in the day with Statis-Pro Basketball. With Title Chase Basketball Carla &amp; I can play it together even though she has only a passing knowledge of the sport. The game is meant to be played by players of all levels of sporting knowledge and still be fun. You don&rsquo;t have to understand the triangle offense or why you take out your 44% free-throw shooter when you have the ball with 30 seconds left and are up by 3.<br/><br/>",

Each unit is represented by a stack of step counters that modifies attack strength.  Each army plays differently-- the French have a more traditional sequence of play, their allies the British are activated by chit pull, and the outnumbered Russians must contend with morale checks while dealing with phases that are scattered throughout allied phases.  The Russians have a terrain advantage which they historically squandered; the allies possessed a technological advantage in the Minie Rifle, but due to poor communication, it was not used by the British until late in the battle, when it turned the tide decisively.  Combat is resolved by comparing modifiers to defense rolls, and the type of attacking unit determines the available outcomes.  A number of factors, including victory for each side, are tied to and fluctuate with a single track, creating a sense of momentum and narrative.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dollar Bill Poker - An inset on the box lid shows Tony Randall and Jack Klugman endorsing the game.<br/><br/>Dollar Bill Poker (a game of bluff and challenge) is similar to &quot;Liar's Dice&quot; using a special deck of numbered cards instead of dice.  There are six cards of each number 1 through 6 and six &quot;Wild Cards&quot;.   Everyone (from two to six players) starts with a handful of dime-sized cardboard discs, each of their own color.  A special green playing mat is placed in the center of the playing area.  It contains places for cards and a grid for the betting discs.  The dealer deals out a predetermined number of cards depending on the number of players, and each player lays three cards in the &quot;Down&quot; space in front of him on the game mat.<br/><br/>The first player will add a card to their &quot;Down&quot; stack and place a bid of at least two of any number one through six by putting a disc on the grid  in the proper row and column to indicate their bid.  In turn around the board, each player must make a higher bid or challenge the bid just made.  The bids reflect the combined total number of cards in everyone's &quot;Down&quot;  stack having the same number on the card as the bid  (including &quot;Wild Cards&quot;).   For example: a bid of 4 fives, means that a player thinks there are at least 4 cards containing the number five (or &quot;wild&quot;) in the collective total of everyone's &quot;Down&quot; stack.  Players may bluff in their bidding in an effort to outwit the other players.<br/><br/>When a challenge occurs, the other players (in turn) get to place a higher bid or allow the challenging player go through with the challenge.  If no higher bids are placed, the cards from everyone's &quot;Down&quot; stack are revealed to see if the bid was successful or not.  Standard poker chips are used to keep score.  The winner is the player with the most chips after the predetermined number of rounds have been played or some other end-game condition occurs.  (The rules are inconclusive on how to end the game, but a predetermined number of rounds seems to be the direction intended by the game designers.)<br/><br/>",

Players maneuver their ships on the tabletop (or floor) and try and defeat the enemy through combat. The standard game covers the Battle of Denmark Strait in May, 1941, pitting Hood and Prince of Wales against the German Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. Another scenario covers the Battle of Mers-el-Kebir in July 1940, when British forces led by Hood neutralized the Vichy French fleet along the coast of North Africa.<br/><br/>The game is a heavily-revised version of The Mighty Hood, which appeared in Panzerschreck magazine #14. The new game provides new ship ratings, introduces new rules and modifications congruent with the Battleship Captain standard game system, and adds ships allowing gamers to recreate the Mers-el-Kebir scenario.<br/><br/>Battleship Captain is a &quot;miniatures&quot; game system with scenarios played on the tabletop or floor, using the rules and ship counters provided. Scale is 1&quot;=1000 yards. The game emphasizes playability, as players maneuver their ships and try and defeat the enemy fleet.<br/><br/>The game also requires a tape measure or ruler in inches, paper and pencil, and a six-sided die.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game brings the set, Incredible Courage at Austerlitz, to its completion.  This third game contains the French and Coalition forces that fought in the northern part of the battlefield.  General Bagration, given orders to move toward Brunn to the west, dutifully moves out around 10am and is given a nasty surprise.  While his forces, and the forces of Prince Lichtenstein (5,000+ cavalry!), are well equipped, they are outnumbered by the French Vth Corps under Marshall Lannes and the Cavalry Reserve under the trusted leadership of Marshall Murat.  Murat's forces contain a mix of heavy and light cavalry to the total of around 7,000.<br/>Needless to say the action is hot and intense.<br/><br/>This game is an expansion and requires Telnitz to be played.  It contains a great added value feature not originally planned, but included at the same proposed release price, of a counter sheet with battalion counters.  These battalion counters can be used in lieu of the company counters and will speed up game play.  Rules for using them are fairly simple and short, allowing for fighting the battle, not the rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cactus Air Force is an exciting new Solitaire Air Combat game from Terry Simo.  It has its roots in Downtown/Elusive Victory Raid style air combat but provides that experience at a whole new level for the Solitaire Gamer.  You will be placed in charge of the &ldquo;Cactus Air Force&rdquo; defending Henderson Field from furious Japanese attacks by Air, Land and Sea.<br/><br/>Cactus Air Force covers the period from 7 Aug -15 Nov 1942 and has a card-driven mission system based on two decks of 55 cards which will drive the weather, reinforcement schedule, events and Japanese attacks.  Two campaigns each covering 45 days of real-time action will be provided.  Player can follow the historical schedule of events to see how they fare or play a random sequence of cards that will test your mettle in defending Guadalcanal. You can also game out a sequence of missions over a smaller number of days if desired.<br/><br/>Player will have to manage their resources and pilot rosters to get the maximum effort under difficult circumstances.  Pilots will have different ratings for combat and navigation skill and diseases and fatigue will have a major effect on their capabilities.  Aircraft maintenance will be a key factor on how many serviceable aircraft you have available.  While flight maneuvering and air combat will be very similar to Downtown/Elusive Victory, the player will now have some tactical decisions such as High Side Pass and other tactics to choose from when attacking enemy formations.  Coastwatchers and Radar are your means of detection and you will rely on them to allow you to get in position in time to meet the enemy raids.<br/><br/>The Map: The 34&rdquo;x22&rdquo; Map encompasses a major portion of Guadalcanal, Savo Island, Florida Island, parts of Santa Isabel Island, Russel Island and New Georgia Island. (An area roughly 98nmx135nm)<br/><br/>Order of Battle: The American OoB will include the rosters of the following units - USN VF-5/VF-6 F4F-4; VS-71,E-300,VS-3,VB-6 SBD-3;  VT-8 TBF; USMC VMF-223/224/121 F4F-4;  VMSB-232,231,141 SBD-3; USAAF 67th FS P400 and 339FS P39.   A What-if Variant will have P38s available earlier than they were historically.  Japanese forces include: Zero 21/32s, Rufes, Bettys, Petes, Mavis, Vals and Kates.<br/><br/>Missions and Targets: As leader of the Cactus Air Force, you will assign your pilots and aircraft to missions. Many will be Air Combat Missions to defend Henderson Field and the Marines on Guadalcanal from Japanese bombers, but those will not be the only taskings.  Like your historical counterpart, you will also be tasking your aircraft and aircrews to stop the infamous Tokyo Express coming down the &ldquo;Slot&rdquo; to bring reinforcements and shell your forces.  You will also target enemy ground forces as they close in on the hard pressed Marines on the ground.<br/>Ship Targets include DD, CL, CA, TR, AVL, BB, Barges.<br/><br/>Ground Targets include Supply Dumps, Troops, Seaplane Bases.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>22x34 Map<br/>3-4 Sheets of Aircraft and Misc Counters<br/>Two 55 card decks<br/>Rulebook<br/>Playbook<br/>Roster Sheets<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/>Aircraft Data Cards<br/>Dice<br/><br/>The Stars and Stripes have been hoisted over Henderson Field, Guadalcanal.  Your job is to keep it there!<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft story 'The Whisperer in Darkness'. It introduces several new game concepts to the Arkham Horror Series, including a Prequel stage of the game.<br/><br/>Vermont is home to the Mi-go, a race of aliens from Yuggoth intent on plundering the earth of its natural resources, extracting valuable minerals from parallel planes underneath the earth. Whilst digging down to these inter-dimensional portals the Mi-go are inadvertently disturbing ancient seals buried deep in the ground. These eons old seals are holding the Ancient Ones at bay and as they become disturbed it increases the chances of the Old One stirring from its slumber.<br/><br/>Vermont Horror also adds one new Herald, a unique deck of Prequel events, over 30 new monster markers, plenty of new encounters from Townshend to the Dark Mountains, a deck of unique Mi-go technology to be harnessed and an expansion board featuring the locality of Vermont.<br/><br/>",

Some of the trail squares have further instructions like &quot;miss a turn&quot; or &quot;lose a token.&quot;  Each player also begins with &quot;life&quot; tokens which can be lost along the way.

Whether campaigning, attempting assassinations, or drumming up protesters to the Maidan, the many varied options will ensure each game is different &mdash; and with five total turns, the game is playable in 90-120 minutes.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the series, Orange Revolution is played on a game board depicting the many oblasts or regions that comprise Ukraine. Each region can have 1-11 influence points placed there. Cards are used to move blocks and leaders from region to region, add influence points, exploit events, and bring protestors and militia to the Maidan. Blocks &mdash; representing political forces such as Pora, avid supporters and government forces &mdash; battle for the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. Blocks need to be present in a region to add influence points or for a leader to hold a rally in a region.<br/><br/>The Maidan may be activated during the game, leading to a sub game of amassing supporters and militia. The blue forces will have to choose to crackdown on the orange forces or allow the dangerous, but historical peaceful protests to swell. Will you bring Tulia Tymoshenko or Yushchenko to the Maidan to draw more crowds? Or use them to rally across the nation?<br/><br/>Orange Revolution will immerse you in the events of its namesake with thematic mechanisms, events and graphics.

The Verus Republic, a vast and sprawling nation with many different worlds, races and cultures has a long history of conflict. External foes both many and varied have assailed and been assaulted by the Republic, and internal conflicts with the Nomad Cotaries and various Pirate fleets have kept the legions hard at work.<br/><br/>Nothing quite compares, though, to the sudden appearance of the displaced Sathrican Empire appearing on and within their borders, making claim to larger portions of their space in a bid to reestablish themselves. Petty differences will need to be set aside, and less pressing matters put on hold, while this new and grave threat is dealt with.<br/><br/>",

As the Confederate player, you must try to crush Hooker&rsquo;s unsuspecting army. As the Union player, you must regroup from the initial shock of the blow, hold onto the Chancellor House, and counter-attack against Lee&rsquo;s outnumbered forces.<br/><br/>Following the debacle at Fredericksburg in December of 1862, President Lincoln replaced Burnside as commander of the Army of the Potomac with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Hooker came up with one of the most audacious flanking maneuvers of the war. Leaving two corps at Fredericksburg to pin Lee, he would march the rest of his army north and west, cross the Rapidan River, and place himself at Chancellorsville. The move, if successful, would place the Army of Northern Virginia between two Union armies, ready to be crushed as if in a vise. The opening move worked, but then Hooker sat still as if waiting (or daring) for Lee to attack him. Lee did indeed attack. But the move was so unconventional as to catch Hooker completely by surprise. Lee divided his forces in the face of the enemy&mdash;a textbook no-no&mdash;not once, but twice! First, he left a group at Fredericksburg to delay any Union crossing in that area. Then, with his remaining forces, he left only two divisions in front of Hooker, while the remainder of his army under Jackson (28,000 strong) marched around the Union right and attacked them in the rear at sunset on May 2, 1863.<br/><br/>CBM is an old-fashioned beer and pretzels game that is not burdened with cumbersome command &amp; control or supply rules.<br/><br/>Paul Koenig's Bloody Civil War Series is based upon the intermediate system of Avalon Hill's Gettysburg 1977.<br/><br/>",

Eight or nine different plant species compete for soil and sun, adapting to natural circumstances and to each other, while trying to survive a rampaging herd of grazing animals destroying everything in its path.<br/><br/>Players try to give the plant species under their control the right advantages to win the competition with the opponents&rsquo; species, and to spread as much as possible. Every turn, after the herd wipes out most of the plants from a small part of the map, the players secretly choose which of their species acquires a new adaptation (or loses one, or spawns onto the map), after which species spread and compete. These adaptations give advantages in specific parts of the map, or in combination with other advantages, or with other species with other advantages, or ...<br/><br/>Adaptations are grouped into seven kinds, giving a total of more than 140 thousand different combinations, ranging from poisonous swamp trees, to shade-loving herbs with berries, and many more. There are no dice or other randomization devices in the game (aside from starting order), but the interaction of species with various combinations of adaptations adds a level of complexity that can seem as unpredictable as a die roll.<br/><br/>",

You may even encounter hostile or friendly aliens. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game claims the planet and victory!<br/>SETUP: Separate all Base Station cards from deck. One per player. This is your starting point. Set aside any unused Base Station cards and out of play in a Discard Pile. Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player. Place the rest of the deck face down. This is the Draw Pile. Each player will need a total playing space of approximately 14&rdquo; across and 16&rdquo; down to create a grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. Place your Base Station at the top center.<br/>STARTING THE GAME: The player who had their birthday most recently goes first, then play continues around clockwise.<br/>FIRST ROUND: During your turn, draw a card from the Draw Pile.<br/>Lay any card in your hand with a Level of 1, or an Alien Visit, next to or above your Base Station.If you cannot play a card, place one face up in the discard pile. This ends of your turn. Cards can only be played side to side, or top to bottom, but not<br/>diagonally. Play continues until each player has placed a card next to their Base. This completes the first round.<br/>SECOND ROUND and BEYOND: On the second round, each player has the option of playing any card in their hand with a Level of 2<br/>or less, Alien Visit, Alien Attack or Meteor Strike. Third round can play Level 3 or less. Fourth round Level 4 or less. Fifth round Level 5 or less. Each rounds afterwards you can play any card, but you cannot repeat identical cards you have already<br/>placed in your colony, unless detroyed by meteor.<br/>OPTIONS OF PLAY:<br/>&bull;Lay down a Defense Laser/Force Field card to your colony to protect it and any card next to it from Meteor Strikes and/or Alien Attacks.<br/>&bull;Lay down an Alien Attack card on an unoccupied space in an    opponents colony. They wait 1 turn.<br/>&bull;Lay down an Alien Visit card on an unoccupied space in your colony. You take 1 turn.<br/>&bull;Lay down a Meteor Strike card on top of a card in your opponent&rsquo;s colony (except Base, Force Field, Defense Battery or Alien Visit). It is destroyed and cannot be rebuilt upon, except with a Meteor Cap. Any Level of that card is lost.<br/>&bull;Lay down a Meteor Cap card on top of a Meteor Strike.<br/>WINNING THE GAME: The final round is determined when one player has filled a full grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. All other players have one final turn and the play ends. Add the Level of all cards in your colony,except those destoyed by Meteor Strikes. Subtract from that the Level of all remaining<br/>cards in your hand. <br/>Highest total claims the planet and victory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Snozzle is a 4-player card game that utilizes a Pinochle deck, bidding, trump suits, taking tricks, and teams (two people per team, the person across the table from you is your teammate). The goal of the game is to be the team that reaches 52 points. In the even that both teams reach 52 tricks during the same hand, the team that won the bid during the final hand is the winner.<br/><br/>Using a Pinochle deck (with no Jokers), the dealer deals 3 cards face down to each person, clockwise starting with the player to the left, until all cards have been dealt. Each player then picks up their hand and sorts the cards by suit and value. Jacks in the Trump Suit (known as &quot;Right&quot; Jacks) are the highest value, Jacks in the same color but different suit as Trump (known as &quot;Left&quot; Jacks, or &quot;Bowers&quot;) are second highest value cards, and opposite colored Jacks (no special name) are valued as normal. In all other suits, the Ace is the highest value with 9 being the lowest.<br/><br/>Each person bids only once, starting with the player to the left of the dealer, as an estimate of how many tricks they think they can take as a team (do not declare a suit, only a number). If the person bidding is the first person of the team, they may bid a &quot;signal bid&quot; to help their teammate bid higher (see below for signal bids). You may only bid if you bid higher than the person who bid before you. Otherwise you must say &quot;pass.&quot; After all 4 players have bid or passed, the highest bidder wins the power to pick the suit of trump (which affects the value of Jacks and of the trump suit). The bidder then starts by playing a card. If &quot;no trump&quot; is chosen, aces are the highest value of card, but the person to the right of the winning bidder starts. Unlike other games, such as Bridge, all suits are considered equal, except for that of trump, and the &quot;left&quot; Jacks.<br/><br/>As the first card is played, each player must follow suit if able (note: &quot;Left&quot; Jacks become the suit of trump and no longer qualify as being of their original suit. These Jacks are called &quot;Bowers&quot;). After each player has played a card, the highest card in the suit wins the trick. If you are unable to follow suit, you may play trump, which automatically becomes the winning suit. A higher trump card can win, but all players must follow the suit that was lead.<br/><br/>After the trick is taken, the player who took the trick may lead the next trick with the card of his/her choice. If you win the number of tricks you bid (or more), you team is awarded a point for each trick taken. The team that did not win the bid also receives a point for each trick taken. If the team that won the bid does not take enough tricks equal to or greater than the number bid, they are &quot;set.&quot; They receive a negative score equal to their bid. The other team is scored as normal.<br/><br/>Signal Bids:<br/>1-4 (I have X number of aces in my hand. If you have more than 4 aces, you should either bid 4 to signal aces or bid 6+ to win the bid and possibly choose &quot;no trump&quot; as the suit of power.)<br/>5 (I have at least 1 black and at least 1 red jack in my hand. This shows trump power/support to your partner if they are to win the bid and choose the suit of trump.)<br/>6-12 (I can take X number of tricks, but can only do so in my suit of choice. This is a bid that attempts to win the bid rather than signal your teammate. However, a bid of 6 shows your partner that you may have some Jacks, but they are of one color and you don't have much supporting power)<br/><br/>A winning bid is usually a 7 or 8 or an occasional 9 or 10 bid. 6 bids rarely win, and 11/12 bid hands are difficult to come by, though entirely possible.<br/><br/>Historical note: I have never found the name or rules for this game to be published in any book or website, and I have only ever found players of this game in the state of Minnesota, usually by elderly people in rural areas. It may be of Scandinavian or German heritage.<br/><br/>",

It allows players to compete against each other in any of the world&rsquo;s greatest bike races; including ones they&rsquo;ve just made up.<br/><br/>The board is made up of interchangeable terrain mats which, when fitted together, form the profile of a stage.  The stage can be flat, hilly or mountainous &ndash; whatever the players choose.<br/><br/>Each player is in a charge of star rider.  They move their rider along the board by playing action cards, whose values vary according to the kind of terrain they are played on.  The majority of the action cards show other riders in the race (team mates of the star riders) who can be slipstreamed, but there are also &lsquo;attack&rsquo; and &lsquo;block!&rsquo; cards.   Players need energy tokens to move forward when they play attack cards and these are fought over during the race.  Block! cards allow players to sabotage the moves of their competitors.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to cross the finish line first.  If just one stage is played, the winner of the stage is the winner of the game.  If more than one stage is played, the winner of the game is the player with the best overall score when all the stage results have been added together.<br/><br/>",

Games take place in one of the four major WW2 theatres of combat: West Front, East Front, Pacific or Mediterranean. One player commands any soldiers of any Allied country that fought in WW2, the other player commands a historically correct Axis force. One player will be the attacker and the other player will be the defender. Players verbally state a structured narrative statement (&ldquo;argument&rdquo;) on each turn that describes what happens during the battle, and gain Victory Points based on how well they tell their story.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player who has won at least 4 more Victory Points (&ldquo;VPs&rdquo;) than his opponent will win the game.

As it stands at the moment either Mortimer or Sebastian activate and either use (0) Zombie Companion or (0) Here Boy!. Where this gets fun is that each dog then activates in sequence and only has to be within 6&quot; of the Canine that activated before it, so it is possible to setup a whole lot of different approach angles and not have to be clustered all in one place.<br/><br/>",

Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed experience. You start with a set of 9 cards (6 of them are money, which give you 1 gold coin each and 3 cards to get 1 experience points (PXs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers (adventurers marks). The workers go to the different building places in the Village to buy new cards for you (go and solve adventure), get experience or different other actions. Each turn there is one more space, where you can place your workers.<br/><br/>Also there is a Line of Events with 6 cards (quest and events representing), which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 3 different &quot;Ages&quot; (the last two ages cost more gold coins).<br/><br/>The game ends in different ways: when a player reaches 100 px, or one player kills two dragons, or when no cards sufficient to fill the Line of Events.<br/><br/>",

The Cold War is fast thawing and only one organization can prevent it: COBRA. These terrorists have launched a massed attack aimed at crippling both the USA and USSR and making sure the Cold War continues. To achieve this, they have attacked Washington D.C. and captured Reagan. Gobachev would have been captured, but G. I. Joe, having received a last minute warning, has deployed. Now in the streets of America&rsquo;s capital the Joes must save the day.<br/><br/>G.I. Joe: Battle for DC combines aspects of Battle Line and Batman: Poker gegen Joker. Players battle over locations in Washington DC by laying down cards representing various characters from the G.I. Joe universe. Each has a numerical rating from one to 12 and a color suit, allowing for card combinations that will aid you in the battle for DC. In addition, the Joes must protect Gorbachev and rescue Reagan. There are also special cards which can alter the battle and a naval control aspect that allows players to draw an extra card if they control the Potomac River.<br/><br/>",

The American War of Revolution 1775-1783 is a war of battles bearing colourful names, most of them ideally suited for re-fighting on table-top battlefields. The skilful general can triumphantly turn historical defeats into victories. This book tells the wargamer how to don the mantle of Washington and lead American Armies against British regulars to display greater tactical genius than Burgoyne and Cornwallis. After outlining the historical course of the war, the soldiers of both sides and their styles of fighting are described and commanders evaluated. This means re-fighting the major battles as wargames are explained, with maps of the battlefields transformed into table-top terrains. Hints on formulating rules include two complete sets that authentically simulate warfare of the period. A new chapter, with a previously unpublished set of rules by Donald Featherstone, is included in this edition.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>In the late 1920s, naval analyst and former spy Hector C. Bywater wrote what today would be called a &quot;techno-thriller.&quot; His novel described a hypothetical conflict between Japan and the USA, set in his near future, 1931. His background in naval tactics, ship design, and history made him the perfect choice to write the story, and it proved to be wildly popular. In addition to being well-written and exciting, he described many advances in naval technology, such as the rise of naval aviation. But his story was also rooted in the past (including the use of poison gas), and concluded with a Jutland-style clash between the two great fleets.<br/><br/>Designer Bob Eldridge has transformed Bywater's novel into a gaming supplement of 30 scenarios for Command at Sea. Ship statistics include not only real-world units like the pre-war US and Japanese battleships, but also the ships that Mr. Bywater created for his story - the Alaska-class aircraft carriers and the Nagasaki-class supersubmarine. In addition he has included scenarios for another three campaigns, each determined by different historical events in 1926, 1932, and 1939. These also feature a mix of real-world and hypothetical units, like the US Lexington class, which were planned as battlecruisers until the Washington Naval Treaty.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>- 128-page booklet including 30 scenarios and stats, grouped in four separate campaigns. <br/>- Two counter sheets of historical, hypothetical, and fictional units.<br/><br/><br/>     Not included but needed for play: Command at Sea 4th Edition Rules.<br/><br/><br/>",

You are an explorer of this labyrinthine realm, trying on roles and pioneering foreign terrain, aiding friends and outsmarting rivals. To shape the world and find your place in it means drawing on powers you never knew you had in the hopes of one day reaching your goal, the one prize that can't be found around any of the labyrinth's dizzying twists and bends: the real you.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>     An Awesome Game<br/><br/><br/>Labyrinth Life is a tabletop strategy card game for 2-6 players, ages 12 and up. It's fast to learn, and fun to master.<br/><br/>In Labyrinth Life, you play an explorer who braves an ever-changing maze in search of your future self. Will you be the first to reach bliss as perhaps the Richest Woman in New Mazonia or perhaps the Hallball Team Captain? It's all up to you!<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, players build a maze of hexagonal cards and they move their maze explorers through it.<br/><br/>Every round, you move more maze explorer forward 5 spaces, draw a card, and play a card. You play a card by placing it in the maze and using one of the two powers listed on it.<br/><br/>The sixteen powers allow you to affect the maze and the explorers within it. It's possible to chain multiple powers and plan elaborate strategies over multiple turns.<br/><br/>Strategies center around moving your explorer into cards related to your goal card, and keeping other players from moving their explorers into cards related to theirs. You gain two points for moving your explorer into cards that share a power with your goal card and you lose one point for every card you move into that isn't related. Goals can change.<br/><br/>You win the game by reaching the target point total.<br/><br/><br/>     A Work of Art<br/><br/><br/>Each deck of Labyrinth Life is different. The cast of characters, constellations of maze paths, and the solitaire maze that spans the back of your 120-card deck are absolutely unique, and offer an entirely different play experience from every other deck out there.<br/><br/><br/>     The Ultimate Collaboration<br/><br/><br/>Early supporters of Labyrinth Life suggest and vote on the characters that will populate the maze. Each deck is a unique culture built from the the pool the fans create.<br/><br/>",

Eight distinct regions emerge, each with its own ideals, but all predicated on peace. No one wants to repeat the mistakes of the past. Almost no one&hellip;<br/><br/>Over time, four Overlords emerge. Vying for wealth and power, each establishes his own ragtag army. Slowly, their minions spread throughout the eight habitable regions. Death and destruction follow in their wake as each faction battles the other for land, fuel, wealth, and power. Which will triumph over the others, bringing a final, lasting peace to the land? Only time and Thompson machine guns will tell.<br/><br/>The boardgame Ameritrash, like its namesake gaming genre, is an exciting, tension-filled game, rich in theme, filled with player conflict, and possessing a large amount of dice! Two to four players assume the role of an Overlord of a military faction intent on securing as much plunder and power as possible.  During the span of five turns, players move their ramshackle units across the gameboard, attempting to capture objectives, pillage wealth, and weaken enemy factions.<br/><br/>Quick to learn and fun to play, Ameritrash is game of low to moderate complexity, and heavy firepower.<br/><br/>",

After an initial go-round players  match the initial value with a card from their hand if possible, if not they resume the drawing process. First player out of cards wins.<br/><br/>-- A variant of this game where after all the cards are drawn, players form &quot; melds' of a whole note's value ( 4 beats) and these are  ( two variants) then scored Rummy-style or game is played until someone has eight melds.<br/><br/>--A forerunner of climbing-to-X-number sorts of games ( O No 99, Zeus on the Loose, et al.)  where players play cards of rests and notes to get up to a whole note's value of 4 beats.<br/><br/>--A children's game with a pre-Knizia type of interesting scoring.. all cards are given out to all players-- them the players with the most of each value get to score the amount they have. ( E.G.   Person with 5 16th-note/rest values has more than everyone else, therefore they get 25 points, each of the cards counting for as many points as cards held.)<br/><br/>",

Over three ages they created magical objects and potions, translated arcane cantrips, and discovered lost artifacts of four ancient mages: Arden, Balor, Canna and Dynin. In time their powers grew to the point where they, and their allies, fought each other with spells and wards across the Seven Cities for the title of Master Mage!<br/><br/>Mage Clash is a game for 2 players, lasting about 30 to 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Players will need the tiles and cards for the game, 5 six-sided dice, a set of traditional D&amp;D dice and 80 eurocubes in 2 colors.<br/><br/>The game is played in two phases.<br/><br/>During the first phase - Learning Majick - players will play tiles (Magic Items, Mystic Objects, Magic Spells, Casting Wards, Potions and Cantrips) from their hands by paying Elemental Resource costs. Each type of tile has a different power associated with it and the collection of sets allows a player to gain victory points or have the choice of Special Artifacts to be used in the second phase. Discard tiles boost a players army and mana abilities.<br/><br/>The first phase lasts eight rounds and mid-game victory points scored<br/><br/>In the second phase of the game - Combat in the Cities - players use their Magic Spells, Casting Wards and Special Artifacts to combat each other in seven cities. Some cities have special powers of their own that affect the combat; each city is also worth victory points.<br/><br/>Each Magic Spell has a certain number of dice associated with it. Players roll five dice, taking a subset of these, augmented by their Casting Wards. Armies act as hit points in each of the cities and players combat each other until one player wins 4 of the 7 cities.<br/><br/>Phase Two victory points are added to those of Phase One to determine a winner.<br/><br/>Best Fantasy-Themed Game category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!<br/><br/>3rd Place - Best Art/Graphic Design category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!<br/><br/>3rd Place - Most Colorblind-Friendly Game category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!<br/><br/>",

At the end of their movement phase, the piece moved progresses to a pyramid of the next color in a sequence and is optionally changed to a different sized piece, each of which have a distinct strategic value.

        "description": "From the publisher's webpage:<br/><br/>North of BORISOV, RUSSIA, 4 April 1943: Operation Lenz Sud had commenced in hopes of finally reducing or eliminating the growing Partisan force near Borisov. As the German forces began the push the partisans were ready and awaiting for an ambush. The Partisans were not trained soldiers and the tactics of the partisans were simple and the challenges put on them by their leaders were less than would be expected from a military unit. Surprise and ambush were their best tactic. Their spot chosen lay on both sides of the Narotch stream. Having capturing a German field gun earlier and using their long hidden anti tank gun&mdash;a leftover from the retreating Russians in 1941&mdash;the ambush was prepared. Mines were placed, demolition charges were planted by explosive teams smuggled behind German lines and now the wait began. One Partisan survivor remembered: &ldquo;We would ambush the Germans on the Narotch stream bank. We knew the Germans planned to come to the aid of the guard from the other side of the stream. Our commander, Sagalchik, was also a guide, as he had lived in Miadel for many years and was familiar with the area. When we arrived everything was quiet. Suddenly shots were heard. We lay down and awaited the Germans. When we received the sign to attack we ran to the houses where the Germans and Lithuanian sharpshooters were. The battle lasted a few hours and the Germans dispersed.&rdquo; Within an hour the fight was over leaving the battlefield in partisans hands. The Germans suffered 40 dead and over 50 wounded. &ldquo;Lenz-Sud&rsquo; was off to a bloody start.<br/><br/>Here at CH we're into firsts. We like to delve into esoteric fronts and combatants. We don't base our creative decisions on the bottom line. We live to provide our fellow gamers opportunities to explore their labors of love, pet topics, to read-up, research ... literally 'disappear into the stacks' of their private libraries and public archives. In Bandenkrieg: HELL BEHIND THE EASTERN FRONT each and every one of those touch-points are struck like a chord. A map by Larry Winslow ... a design that has been augmented, added to ... since inception. Actions that have never seen the light of day on a historical map. It's all 'in there' and then some.<br/><br/>If you love new color die-cut counters with a purpose ... i.e., scenarios that use them ... you'll get Polizei infantry. You'll also get Schuma soldiers, new AFVs in black with German designations including the LKW ZIS (with Russian LMG), PzKw T26B 738(r), PSW 42 ADGZ, PSW BAF 203(r), Pzkw T-70 743(r) ... and more! And this motley crew of polyglot squads with their under-powered AFV collection has to take on the OOB of Russian Partisan counters ... all new, color die-cut beauties ... on their home turf. Besides home field advantage, the Partisans are armed with captured weapons, guile, and livestock. Yes, counters for all of the above (including Battlefield Gleaning counters via a variant rule .... for guile) are provided.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subterfuge is a 2-player, luck-free, abstract strategy game played on a standard chess /checkers board using 12 standard dice (6 each in 2 separate colours).<br/><br/>The game has many similarities to chess but uses d6 dice as the pieces.  Each player starts with their 6 dice in their home territory and they advance into the field to play.  Players alternate moving one of their pieces with the winner being the first player to capture 4 of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces.<br/><br/>The value of each die face determines the movement and capability of the piece &ndash; smaller values move lesser distances but can Capture larger dice &ndash; higher value dice move greater distances but Expose smaller dice - equal value dice Influence the value of neighbouring dice, including your own.   Pieces may move forward or backward according to the movement rules defined for each die facing.<br/><br/>Stuterfuge includes many layers of strategic play and brain-burning tactical play, as the dice values change throughout the game.   Game length can vary between 15 to 60 mins, depending on the time permitted for each move.  Multiple variants are also included in the rules, allowing wildly different tactics and play for each game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jelly Bean Farmers is a light-hearted game in which you build your farm in a tableau in front of you. You gain food by growing it on your farm or by plundering your opponents as a warlord. Struggle through drought, pestilence, and aggressive neighbors to become the greatest farmer of all time!<br/><br/>The game can be played with 2 to 4 players, but is best with 4.  The game content is appropriate for any age, but the complexity would be a reasonable challenge for a bright seven year old.  Game play is about 45 minutes to an hour, and you will have eaten (usually) 16 of the edible counters when you are done.  (... so don't use large cookies or shots of tequila, but animal crackers or small, disposable cups of beer work fine).<br/><br/>The game lasts for 8 'years,' where each year is split into two seasons.  Each year the players draw cards and choose (in advance) one to play each in the spring and summer seasons.  The players choose whether or not to plant their fields for the spring season, then the spring weather is revealed and players resolve their actions.  There is some flexibility in how a player chooses to resolve the action, especially if he did not plant, but he must use the card that he previously selected for the season.  Crops are calculated and each player must eat one 'food.'  Hopefully he is not eating the last of his seed crop!  Then the planting, weather, action resolution, and crop resolution are repeated for the summer season.  Finally, any warlord tribute is paid before the next year starts.<br/><br/>The game is about 60% luck and 40% skill -- the best players tend to win more often but not every game.  It is silly and fun, with unexpected turnarounds due to odd weather or unexpected cards.  There is also a mechanic where a player who has been wiped out can cash in 'food stamps' and keep playing.<br/><br/>",

It pits between two and six characters per side against each other in perhaps a minute of frantic, close-quarters combat action. Do not be distracted by the name. The game is set in Normandy (during the close-quarters hedgerow fighting between American and German soldiers), but these rules can be used and played anywhere during WWII.<br/><br/>The main rules deal with the Normandy fighting and the equipment used there, but the Appendices include profiles for other weapons, including those used in other theaters (such as Russia) and at other times during the war.<br/><br/>The game is d100-based, and uses 54mm figures, with conversion rules for 28mm and 20mm scales.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Bitcoin Harvest&quot; is a paper-and-pencil game for 2 or more players that was published on issue 16 of Bitcoin Magazine. It is a derivative of Hippos & Crocodiles by the same designer.<br/><br/>It uses a type of puzzle piece that has been around for more than a century: the pentomino, and also the concept of harvesting (picking items already placed on the board).<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Start by drawing a rectangular grid of any size. 10x10 is recommended for beginners, but for more than 2 players you might need a bigger grid.<br/><br/>Secondly, and by turn, each player chooses a different pentomino shape. This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.<br/><br/>The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.<br/><br/>Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:<br/><br/>1. Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or symmetrized, as long as it fits with the grid.<br/>2. Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered<br/>3. Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).<br/>4. Pass your turn to the next player.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succesion the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>As a variant, before the game starts players can agree on the number of coins drawn each turn.<br/><br/>",
