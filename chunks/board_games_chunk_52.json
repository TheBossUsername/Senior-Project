But wait, there are other settlers that have also landed and want to try to claim the land for their own. Time to roll the dice, collect the essential supplies, gather resources, and gain more settlers.<br/><br/>In this 2-4 player roll and write game, players take the role of settler planning to start their own empire on an island. You roll the 6 dice and choose one to place your resources on a plot of land. You can choose to place either Food, Wood, or Stone. Unlike the majority of roll and writes, each player takes turns to choose one dice and utilize the value on the chosen die.<br/><br/>You score points by connecting 3 resources of the same type. Any unused resources go to the Waste area and you lose points for those. The player with the highest points wins. So carefully plan your island empire and beat the others.<br/><br/>",

The other balls will be distributed normally.  This is only possible if the natural wood marble is not in this hole.   It is not mandatory.<br/><br/>Concerning this natural wood marble, the 1st player who puts a marble in the centre has the possibility to put the colourless marble in the hole he has just emptied.   This marble then travels like the other balls during the game.   The natural wooden ball is therefore a double-edged sword: it allows to block the opponent and forces him to redistribute his balls, but keeping it in his camp implies sacrificing one of his holes.   Knowing when to keep the natural ball or when to send it to the opponent's side is therefore a determining factor in winning the game.<br/><br/>",

Form packs on the table with a hierarchy of determining which card is best when. The dogs form their packs with dogs of the same size, or dogs of neighboring sizes in the same color. Cats are unique, befriending the smallest and the largest dogs in their color, as well as other cats.<br/><br/>Pack o&rsquo; Dogs has two included versions in the rules: the Base Game and the Complex Game.<br/><br/>The Base Game has a little less strategy than the Complex Game so it is perfect for first time players, younger kids, or when you simply just want a faster more relaxed game. The scoring is based on the number of cards you have in your score pile and the game ends when you reach the bottom of the deck (no reshuffling the discard pile). The score pad is not used for this version.<br/><br/>The Complex Game requires more strategy than the Base Game. It involves planning out your moves, remembering what cards you know your opponent has, and which cards have already gone past to determine the best card to play. The game consists of a best of 7 rounds (i.e. first player to win 4 rounds ends the game, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily win the game). The score pad is used to write down your points for each round and tells you which rounds give you bonus points. You get bonus points for winning streaks and for winning the later rounds, so winning that final round could turn the whole game around!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>Deck of 45 Cards - 4 colors (white, red, black, yellow) of various sizes (numbers 1-10 and a cat, for each color), and 1 treat card<br/>6 Reference Cards - 3 for each player for quick rule reminders<br/>1 Score Pad - 20 sheets with 3 games per sheet (60 games total)<br/>1 Rule Sheet<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Split Second is a card-based wargame where the player controls a team of soldiers referred to as Operators in special operations and SWAT-style missions involving violent resolutions. <br/>The game is played using cards to represent the physical components of the battlespace, dice to resolve actions with uncertain outcomes, tokens for recording some effects, and a timer to apply pressure to the player's decision-making process.<br/><br/>The player chooses a Mission from the Mission Dossier, which will include a roster of cards that represent the environment with pieces of cover, doors, and other elements referred to as Props as well as cards representing the opposition referred to as Hostiles. These cards are combined into small decks in a manner that uses randomization and fixed elements to form an Encounter. The same Encounter can play out differently each time it is played because of the randomization of the cards, forcing the player to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances. This also makes each scenario highly replayable.<br/><br/>Unlike most games that use a board with spaces or miniatures on a playing surface, in Split Second the playing area is abstracted using cards to represent the battlefield. <br/>Ranges aren't measured in physical distance, but instead cards are placed into Areas that are split up by Area Divider cards. <br/>Movement between objects isn't made in any linear measurement, but in movement points as the combatants anchor themselves to and then move away from objects in the battlezone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MEGAcquire GOLD is my next step in continuing the quest to expand Sid Sackson's magnificent ideas and get them onto as many gaming tables as possible. You can secure a new challenge based on an old, favorite, and familiar game for the price of $80 plus shipping to your location after production is complete in May 2022. Not a cheap cardboard rendition of an icon, on which the pieces slide across the board, but a tough durable plastic edition with an expanded board and hexagon shaped tiles. Double the possibilities, double the fun, and an outcome undecided until the end.<br/><br/>We have made a few minor changes from the production run of MEGAcquire and this next production run of MEGAcquire GOLD. The money has been changed to prepaid debit cards and the denominations have been raised to 1, 5, 10, &amp; 50 million. Who will become the first billionaire in MEGAcquire GOLD? The rule booklet has a new cover and included in the booklet is a sample game narration to help first time players and a Stock Price Extension Chart that is used to help calculate payouts when companies are bought out and at the end of the game. We have also enlarged the tile holders and redesigned the box insert for better storage. The company markers are being made in three different shapes to better designate the difference in their starting price value and to give them a 3D effect. The playing tiles will be gold. So as the board fills up during game play, it turns to gold!<br/><br/>MEGAcquire GOLD is an exciting journey of strategy and luck, for three to six players, through the corporate world of building empires and wealth. Live in the world of fun and fortune as you maneuver to outwit your opponents. Build and merge companies while shrewdly buying, trading, and selling stocks to become the wealthiest player. Each player builds companies by adding tiles, and they increase their wealth by purchasing stocks in these companies. Cash flow is obtained by selling majority and minority shares through mergers. It is not always prudent to have the most stock in the biggest company if you can build and sell enough smaller companies to generate a large income. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of the corporate world, but you will always need the &ldquo;luck of the draw&rdquo;.<br/><br/>MEGAcquire GOLD will appeal to players of any age who like the feeling of power that is acquired through achievement. It is recommended for ages 13 and up, but cannot be limited in age because of the early possession of business savvy that can be found in younger players. Average playing time is two to three hours, but shorter time limits can easily be set.<br/><br/>MEGAcquire GOLD is a perfect learning tool to teach younger people a sense of how the world of investing works. It illustrates how investing in stocks can be very strategic, but at the same time requires some luck. They learn how their wealth can grow as they build their companies, and how their cash flow can increase by selling companies, while subsequently using the profit to make more investments.<br/><br/>MEGAcquire GOLD is played on a 15&quot; x 13&quot; plastic board that contains 182 hexagon spaces with 182 corresponding hexagon tiles. The hexagon shape allows six different ways to connect. For MEGAcquire GOLD, the board will be colored silver and the tiles will be colored gold. Therefore, as the game progresses, it turns to gold. Each hexagon is labeled with a designation A-1 through N-13 and each tile has a corresponding designation for its place on the board. Each player draws 12 tiles to start the game and then draws a replacement tile after each turn. The tiles are used to create and grow companies. While creating and growing these companies, the players buy, trade, and sell stocks in an attempt to become the wealthiest player.<br/><br/>There are 14 different companies to choose from when building an empire -- seven hotels and seven corporations. Each company has a colored Company Marker that represents that company's designation. The companies have different starting values that include low, medium, &amp; high-priced companies.<br/><br/>The seven hotels are:<br/>Luster - Red - 2 million starting price per share<br/>Teton - Yellow - 2 million starting price per share<br/>Arcadia - Dark Blue - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Global - Brown - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Fanfare - Green - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Krause - Teal - 4 million starting price per share<br/>Regal - Pink - 4 million starting price per share<br/><br/>The seven corporations are:<br/>Unity - Beige - 2 million starting price per share<br/>Solon - Gray - 2 million starting price per share<br/>Watts - Purple - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Helix - Orange - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Digital - Baby Blue - 3 million starting price per share<br/>Quasar - Charcoal - 4 million starting price per share<br/>Physics - Burgundy - 4 million starting price per share<br/><br/>The markers for the hotels and corporations are &quot;buildings.&quot; The &quot;small buildings&quot; are used to designate the lower priced companies. The &quot;medium buildings&quot; are used to designate the medium priced companies. The &quot;large buildings&quot; are used to designate the high priced companies. Each marker is colored to match the company it represents.<br/><br/>There are 25 stock certificates for each company. When the supply has been purchased, there are no more stocks available unless a player trades some back to the bank when they are out of money or the stocks are returned through mergers.<br/><br/>How To Play MEGAcquire GOLD:<br/><br/>Players can play one tile per turn. When two hexagons are placed together, they form a company. The player who places the tile that starts the company gets to chose what company they want from those that are available. The player then receives a free share of stock in that company as a founding bonus.<br/><br/>Players are allowed to purchase six stock certificates of any company on the board during their turns. By receiving the free share of stock, the player who starts the company always has control of keeping majority shareholder status in that company unless they decide to purchase something else before they hold a &quot;true majority&quot;. Since there are 25 stock certificates for each company, a true majority is attained when a player owns 13 shares. No other player can purchase more shares than the player who holds 13 shares.<br/><br/>Stock values increase as tiles are played that grow companies. The Information Cards are used to keep track of stock prices and shareholder bonuses as the companies grow and merge. As the companies grow, smaller companies will be merged into larger companies. This is accomplished when a tile is played that connects two companies together. The larger company always takes out the smaller company. If the companies are of equal size, before the merging tile is played, the player who plays this tile gets to decide which company will survive.<br/><br/>At the time of the merger, the players who hold first and second majority in the smaller company receive bonuses, and all players who hold stock in the smaller company have the option to sell their stock for the current market value. A player can choose to keep their stock if they expect the company to open again. When a tile is played that merges more than one company, the companies are cashed out starting with the smallest company first.<br/><br/>Companies are considered &quot;safe&quot; when they reach 21 tiles. A &quot;safe&quot; company means that they can't be taken over by a larger company and will remain on the board until the end of the game. Tiles that would connect two safe companies cannot be played. Instead, those tiles are turned over on their designated spaces on the board and new tiles are drawn. Companies can increase in value up to the level of 101 tiles.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 120 million. Investing this money is based on the tiles in a player's hand and the companies they can grow. When a player runs out of money and it is their turn, they can trade stocks they have purchased for other stocks that are more beneficial to their portfolio. Yet they can only trade the amount of stocks it takes to raise money for the stocks they are purchasing. Players cannot trade stocks for cash.<br/><br/>A large amount of money can be generated by opening and selling small companies, which creates cash flow to reinvest. But conversely, a large wealth can be accumulated by holding majority in the larger companies. The winner needs the ideal mix of investing, and a little bit of luck, that provides the greatest wealth.<br/><br/>It takes approximately two to three hours to fill the entire board of MEGAcquire GOLD, but shorter time limits can be set. If you only want to play for an hour and a half, just be sure to let all players have equal turns and end the game at the designated time. At that time, all companies are cashed out at the current market value, which is based on the number of tiles in the company. All players count their earnings and the player with the most money is the MEGAcquire GOLD Master.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you&rsquo;ve ever been that friend who asks your friends if they would do something really wild or crazy for say, a million dollars, then you&rsquo;re likely the type of person who would get a kick out of this party game.<br/><br/>The rules are pretty simple. During each round of the game, one player challenges the other players with a hypothetical scenario by playing a card from their hand. If the other players would never do it, then whoever played the card gets the point. If somebody (or multiple people) would do it, then they need to explain to the group how on Earth they could justify doing something that ridiculous. Whoever&rsquo;s answer is deemed the best wins the point in that instance.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player scores 10 points...or after everyone erupts into everlasting laughter and judgement of their friends.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Necrons are a deathless race of alien androids, rulers of the galaxy in a long-forgotten era. Now, having slumbered in stasis for millennia, they are rising up to conquer it again. Clad in self-repairing bodies of living metal and wielding weapons that harness the most devastating energies of the cosmos, the Necrons are a terrifying enemy. Fearless, relentless, and utterly without mercy, they advance in serried ranks and lay down withering storms of fire fit to annihilate even the mightiest of foes. The hyper-resilient Necron soldiery are supported by murderous specialist units, techno-sorcerous war machines, mindless Canoptek constructs, and shards of shattered star gods. They are led to war by undying nobles wielding weapons of devastating power, driven by the absolute conviction that they are the rightful rulers of the stars. And if the long sleep has reduced many Necrons to mindless monsters, or ravaged their sanity and transformed them into murderous demigods? Such madness only makes them an even greater and more terrible threat.<br/><br/>Codex: Necrons is your essential guide to one of the 41st Millennium's greatest threats &ndash; a millennia-old alliance of ancient androids who long ago sacrificed their very essence for greater power. In this book, you'll discover the history of the Necrons, from the very earliest days of the universe, to the War in Heaven, and their awakening, all illustrated with stunning art. Once you've read the lore, you can build your army using a vast suite of rules that bring the Necrons to life, with rules for the dynasties (including ones of your own creation!), datasheets, Stratagems, and much, much more.<br/><br/>This 120-page hardback book contains:<br/><br/>     The history of the Necrons &ndash; from their ancient origins to the Era Indomitus<br/>     Stunning art that brings the lore to life<br/>     A showcase of incredibly painted miniatures to inspire your own collection and colour schemes<br/>     Crusade rules that let you develop your Necron army in thrilling narrative campaigns<br/>     Special abilities and bonuses like Command Protocols for your Necron forces<br/>     Datasheets for Necrons units for your reference<br/>     Stratagems, Powers of the C'tan, and more!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is going to take the Federal government to restore a city's ability to govern itself. Newly elected President Herbert Hoover wants to clean up the city and that means bringing down the most notorious gangster of the time, Al Capone. It would take two years, but Hoover got his wish. In June 1931, federal prosecutors indicted Capone on 22 counts of income-tax evasion.<br/><br/>Scarface: The Al Capone Trial, puts you in the hands of the prosecution or defense to bring this gangster to justice or remind the justice system that a kind word and a gun...is still king.<br/><br/>As the defense, your efforts are asymmetrical focused on using cards and dice drafting to bribe and intimidate, jury tamper and cut deals to keep Capone from being convicted.<br/><br/>As the prosecution, you maintain the straight and narrow using cards and dice drafting to argue that Capone is guilty of a majority of tax evasion counts.<br/><br/>To win, the defense must build up enough corruption to make it to the end of trial simulating winning over public opinion, whereas the prosecution must win the game before the trial comes to a close by stringing together key evidence, convincing a majority of the jurors or prove witness tampering.<br/><br/>This is a standalone game.

In the basic version each player gets a hand of six cards and two rows of nine cards each are placed on the table to start the players' columns. Two cards are discarded and the rest form a draw pile.<br/><br/>On a turn a player plays to one of their nine columns, claims columns if possible, and draws a card. The three-card column sets are ranked from straight flush down. A column can be claimed even if the opponent's set is incomplete if you can prove there is no way they can beat your set. If a column is completed on both sides and is tied, the player who played last loses it.<br/><br/>The object is to claim five columns.<br/><br/>Some variants are given:<br/><br/><br/>     Ignore straights and straight flushes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each player gets 15 cards at the start and never draws any more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Don't place any cards in the columns initially, as in the later game.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Myth: Dawn of Heroes is a cooperative tabletop game for 2 to 5 players. Each player takes on the role of a hero and must work together to overcome the Darkness. Using a deck of cards unique to each hero, players explore the realm, battle evil monsters, manage critical tasks, and avoid dangerous traps in order to complete quests and acquire powerful new items and abilities.<br/><br/>Players' avatars are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.<br/><br/>Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic.

Each time a player defeats their opponent's robot, they become the attacker on the next round. The defender has the advantage of choosing how to respond to the attacker's card, and may choose to sacrifice both robots to attempt to capture the robots in their opponent's hand. When one player runs out of cards, they are defeated and their opponent is the Robot Master of the World!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally laid down as an Amagi-class battlecruiser, the stipulations of the Washington Treaty resulted in her conversion to an aircraft carrier. As a result, Akagi (赤城, &quot;Red Castle&quot;) was one of Japan&rsquo;s first large aircraft carriers. Akagi and her near-sister Kaga straddled the line between carrier and dreadnought. To keep both options open, the ships were designed to be quickly converted to capital ships. They carried turret barbettes, magazines and other equipment to support big gun turrets, and the wooden flight deck and hangar deck were designed to be quickly stripped off, making room for turrets to be mounted. However, by the mid-1930s, the admirals believed the aircraft carrier to be the equal of the capital ship and Akagi was extensively rebuilt to improve aircraft handling capacity, ending any possibility of later converting it to a capital ship.<br/><br/>Her aircraft served in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. With the formation of the First Air Fleet in 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so until her sinking. Notable actions include the attack on Pearl Harbor, the invasion of Rabaul, bombing Darwin, Australia and the Indian Ocean Raid.<br/><br/>In June 1942, she participated in the Battle of Midway, her aircraft bombarding the American-held atoll. However, US aircraft originating from Midway, and the US carriers Enterprise, Hornet and Yorktown attacked Akagi and three other Japanese fleet carriers. Dive bombers from USS Enterprise severely damaged Akagi, forcing friendly escorting destroyers to scuttle her to avoid her falling into US hands. The loss of four Japanese carriers at this engagement, including Akagi, was a key defeat for Japan, decisively shifting the balance of power in the Pacific theatre.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Yorktown-class of aircraft carrier were built in a series of three. Of those, only the USS Enterprise survived the war, with the USS Yorktown sunk during the Battle of Midway, and the USS Hornet during the Battle of Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>USS Yorktown was commissioned in 1937, and named for the battle of 1781. After Pearl Harbor, USS Yorktown transferred to the Pacific and took part in some of the first American offences of the war around the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. She also fought at the Battle of the Coral Sea where her aircraft (along with the carrier Lexington's) sank enemy light carrier Shōhō prior to engaging the main Japanese carrier force the following day (May 8th 1942). During this latter stage of the engagement, the US carriers' aircraft inflicted damage to the IJN carrier Shōkaku, but in turn USS Yorktown suffered heavy damage. Lexington suffered worse, and was later scuttled as a result.<br/><br/>Returning to Hawaii, repairs were estimated to take two weeks, but she was put back to sea a mere 48 hours after entering drydock, in time to play a crucial part in the decisive Battle of Midway. Her aircraft were instrumental in the sinking of two Japanese fleet carriers. Her presence also drew the attention of Japanese aerial attacks away from USS Entreprise and Hornet. Though crippled by Japanese aircraft, there was optimism that she could be salvaged in part. These hopes were dashed on June 6th when torpedoes from the Japanese submarine I-168 struck her twice. Further hopes of repair were abandoned, and she sank the following day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Necromancer coaches often try to convince their counterpart to begin playing just as daylight fades, hoping the chill of the night saps the other players&rsquo; strength and invigorates their own.<br/><br/>This double-sided board depicts a dusky, barren cemetery pitch on one side, replete with tombs and flagstone walkways, and littered with pumpkins, skulls, and freshly-dug open graves &ndash; ready for the next victim. On the other side, the same scene but after the sun has set, with eerie witchfire in the eyes of the pumpkins (and skulls!) and the Necromantic Horror icon in the center of the field.<br/><br/>The package includes two redesigned dugouts for the new edition of the game. They match the creepy dusk to dawn aesthetics of the pitch &ndash; each dugout featuring Score, Turn, and Re-roll trackers, plus Reserves, Knocked-out, and Casualty boxes. You'll also find rules to represent the particular features of both sides of the pitch.<br/><br/>Necromantic Horror teams are compatible with the 2016 Edition of Blood Bowl using the &quot;Teams of Legend&quot; optional rules published by Games-Workshop.<br/><br/>",

Liege, a city protected by a ring of twelve forts, blocked the passage of the German First and Second Armies. It contained the railway bridges crossing the Meuse river that would be needed by the advancing armies. Winning a quick victory over the Belgians was critical to the success of the German plan so a surprise attack of six brigades was launched ahead of the heavy artillery that ultimately destroyed the forts.<br/><br/>Liege 1914 is a regimental-level simulation of this opening battle of the Great War. Players assume the roles of the commanders of the German and Belgian troops as they desperately fight for this valuable position in the line.<br/><br/>The 17 x 22&quot; map shows the western portion of Belgium from the German border to Liege. The 240 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show German and Belgian forces involved in the battle.<br/><br/>Liege 1914 is now the second installment in the Great War Battles series. Based on the Ypres 1914 game system (the first in the series), the Great War Battles is a series of games devoted to simulating battles of the First World War. Battles are covered at the brigade/regiment level using a common set of rules. Games in the series will cover a variety of situations ranging from trench warfare to open fighting.<br/><br/>",

The advanced game is for 1-2 players - the player leading Mihailovich can play solo.<br/><br/>The main goal of both guerrillas is to fight the Axis and the opposing guerrillas, retain the support of the people and Allies, and control Yugoslavia after the war.<br/><br/>If you are Mihailovich in the advanced game, your additional (extremely difficult) goal is also to minimize Serb civilian casualties.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neptune operated during her World War II service with a crew predominantly composed from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, but also a large proportion of South African personnel. In late 1939 she was in pursuit of the German pocket battleship, Admiral Graf Spee. In the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate she was sent to Uruguay, however, Graf Spee was scuttled before she could arrive.<br/><br/>She participated in the battle of Calabria in July 1940 against the Italian fleet, suffering damage and losing her floatplane in the process, but inflicting heavy damage to the heavy cruiser Bolzano. Subsequently she participated in operations to disrupt convoys attempting to reach Libya with supplies bound for the efforts of Rommel&rsquo;s Afrika Korps. She met her end on 18 December 1941, in which Force K wandered into an Italian minefield. A total of four mines were struck, leaving only one survivor, Norman Walton, who spent 15 months as a prisoner of war in Italy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Cavalry in general cannot take on steady infantry frontally and artillery is not yet powerful enough to be a battle-winning arm.<br/><br/>A typical game has about a dozen units per side. A game like this should take under four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete.<br/><br/>The rules work best with units of 24 infantry models, 12 cavalry models and batteries of 2-4 gun models but this is not a strict requirement.<br/><br/>Game setup usually involves two opposing forces facing one another across a table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc.<br/><br/>The usual table size is 4-6 feet deep by 6-8 feet across.<br/><br/>Figure and Ground Scales:<br/>&bull; One infantry model = 20 actual men.<br/>&bull; One cavalry model = 20 actual men.<br/>&bull; One cannon model = two actual guns.<br/>&bull; One gunner model = 5 actual crewmen.<br/>&bull; One inch = 20 actual paces (50 feet).<br/><br/>Turn Sequence<br/><br/>     Rally &amp; Command<br/>     Move<br/>     Shoot<br/>     Close combat &amp; Recovery<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Fast-forward to today, and Consim Press is collaborating with Jack Greene on an all-new game to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Battle of Jutland. This game will represent a major step forward in WWI naval warfare, along with high production value (without breaking the bank like the ebay collector's item).<br/><br/>Jack Greene was approached three times between 1990 and 2010 on producing the game professionally with a full print run. Now it is to be published by Consim Press. It is occurring now because over the past two years, Jack had an epiphany in approaching the game design. This is an example where historical research led Jack to eliminate player actions that hampered play and to change various values in the ship roster sheets and combat tables (used for resolving combat) to better reflect this deeper understanding of naval combat between Great Britain and Germany in the 1914-16 period.<br/><br/>This game project has roots going back to the mid-80&rsquo;s with Quarterdeck Games publishing about 135 amateur production FLEET ADMIRAL games (1987) and would result in the spin-offs of TSUSHIMA (S&amp;T #130 &ndash; 1989) &amp; TOGO: Dawn of the Dreadnoughts (2018).<br/><br/>Heavily modified since these earlier games, JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral results in a tight view of naval combat between the British and German fleets in 1914-1916. It represents years of research and years of playtesting. This is truly a simulation, and not a &ldquo;game&rdquo;, yet remains very PLAYABLE. Players may make this simulation as complex and accurate as they wish, or, alternatively, they can be playing a large action in just a couple of turns of watching the game being played. The 18 scenarios allow players to spend 30 minutes to many hours of play. The large fleet actions are best played with several players on both sides.<br/><br/>JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral is the ultimate battleship simulation. This game has consumed hundreds of hours of design effort spread over years; and decades of research and study. JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral was conceived as a game that allows for realistic yet playable surface combat in the Battle of Jutland era. The concept was to design a big game that would give one the sense of the grandeur and scope of the largest surface battle ever fought on this planet and yet not load one down with needless detail. Certain liberties and abstractions have been taken to achieve the overall design goal, but I believe you will find that any sacrifices in the name of playability have been the correct ones.<br/><br/>One of the greatest arms races in history was a primary cause of war in August of 1914. Ships would see action in every corner of the world. It was a war fought by two of the most highly trained navies in history. The Officers and Sailors of these two fleets had worked for years at honing their skills to an unimaginable extent. Both would offer up surprises to the other in the course of the war. But it also must be placed in a context where the vast majority of sailors of both nations, when they came onboard a warship, would find them working with tools and equipment that were new to them, and new to the modern world of 1914. The turbine, the radio, the telephone, powerful long-range &ldquo;heater&rdquo; torpedoes &ndash; all equipment that had been recently invented and perfected and was not to be found back on the farm or often not in the part of the cities where many of these men grew up.<br/><br/>But JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral does not stop there.

Game play is character-driven and the exploits of a handful of a few, key citizens will determine the fate of the galaxy for the next several centuries.<br/><br/>Your goal is to bring the majority of planetary governments under the control of your power bloc.  Your tools include recruitment, local elections, diplomacy, and the occasional coup d'&eacute;tat and assassination.<br/><br/>Players take turns activating one of their bloc&rsquo;s citizens.  When activated, a citizen may take 2 different actions; draw a new planet, replace an unpopular government, draw or play opportunity cards, recruit a population or new citizen, and travel.<br/><br/>Dice are rolled to determine the degree of success (if any) of each action.  The number of dice rolled depends on your citizen&rsquo;s requisite skill level.  Skills are guile, intelligence, negotiation, opportunity, rank, and wealth.<br/><br/>You can push your luck by re-rolling some of the dice, but failure on a re-roll can lead to failure and injury.<br/><br/>Certain dramatic events, such as an assassination or successful no-confidence vote, ratchet up the tension.  This is indicated by removing a clock token from a pool.<br/><br/>Once the pool is empty the game ends and the power bloc that controls the most planetary governments wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The group will then take turns guessing which fact corresponds to which person. She decides to make things even more exciting by having everyone type out their fact on an antique typewriter that was owned by a murderer named Nicholas Hundley. Things get weird, however, when there are more messages than participants and one of the notes reads, &quot;I killed a person once. Tonight, I&rsquo;ll kill another.&rdquo; No one admits to writing the note, and everyone goes home thinking it was nothing more than a bad joke. It doesn't seem funny the next day when Jodie is found murdered in her home. Was Jodie Wong killed by one of those closest to her who attended the party? Or was the typewriter a conduit through which something sinister entered this world? Enter The Circle and find out.<br/><br/>",

Valley Falls&rsquo; resident group of ghost hunters, S.T.A.L.K., purchased the museum in hopes of turning a profit and boosting their profile within the paranormal community. Father Richter Casey agrees to spend the night inside the museum and perform a series of blessings on the place before it reopens. Things go awry, however, when the priest is found dead the following morning. Given the frightful nature of the place, the list of potential culprits includes both human and supernatural suspects. Your job is to investigate The Hall of Murderers, The Hall of Cursed Toys, and The Hall of Haunted Items in order to determine what really happened to Father Casey.<br/><br/>",

Players then choose two Hero Cards from their hand to defend their fortress with. These cards are placed face down in front of their fortress and the game begins. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they take one of three actions; recruit, defend, or attack.<br/><br/>To recruit, a player picks a card from the draw pile. If they draw a Hero Card, it is added to their hand. If they draw a Chaos Card, the scenario described on the card takes effect.<br/><br/>To defend, a player takes a Hero Card from their hand and bolsters their defence by placing it next to their existing defenders.<br/><br/>To attack, a player takes up to three Hero Cards from their hand and lays siege to another player&rsquo;s fortress. They roll the Dice of The Fates to see if their heroes receive a boon or a penalty. The total score of all attacking and defending cards is then calculated and it is determined whether the attack failed or succeeded.<br/><br/>On a failed attack, the defending player wins the Hero Cards that unsuccessfully attacked them. On a successful attack, the attacking player wins the defeated defending Hero Cards. The defending player then attempts to rebuild their defence with any Hero Cards from their hand.<br/><br/>When a player no longer has any Hero Cards to defend their fortress with, their Fortress is conquered and they are out of the game.<br/><br/>The last player left standing wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.<br/><br/>T34 Leader features various historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Include one, two, or all three in your Runes of Zun deck to spice up your game. You can even add multiple copies of the three cards &ndash; play your way!<br/><br/>&ldquo;Wild Magic&rdquo; is unpredictable<br/><br/>Use it as an Action, Reaction, or Modifier &ndash; your choice. Draw until you reach the type of card you want and play it. Be careful, though! You have to declare your target first, so you might get unexpected results. You might help an opponent or do harm to yourself.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Decree&rdquo; forces all players to do as you do<br/><br/>Raise or lower everyone's HP. Force everyone to draw or discard a card. By the way, this card can be boosted. So imagine making everyone lose 3 HP instead of just 1!<br/><br/>&ldquo;Anarchy&rdquo; lets you bend the rules<br/><br/>All players may ignore modifier restrictions on all cards! This card stays on the table until the next time the discards are shuffled into a new deck. Anarchy opens the door for some creative and insane card interactions and combos.<br/><br/>Note: The Kickstarter version has a star on the cards that identify them as from the Kickstarter. Second printing doesn&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>",

But hey, we got you covered! 8-bit Splatch is a game of luck and strategy. 2 players (or teams) control shooters in two different colours, as they attempt to steal each other's flags. You use your action points to move around the board, grab the flag, and send enemy shooters straight to the hospital. Beware though, as you'll have to deal with the VIP, a super-shooter who is on both teams at once. If you can dodge the hail of paintballs from the other team and the VIP, you can claim the flag back to the base, and see if it is real. If it is, congratulations, you won! If not, then its back into the battlefield you go...<br/><br/>",

At the start of their turn, players can ask other players for any ingredient card they may need, depending on what want to build. If the other player has one or more of that ingredient, they must hand one over. If not, the player whose turn it is draws 2 cards from the deck instead. They can then use the cards they have in their hand to create as many items off the Burger Builder menu as possible.<br/><br/>Each ingredient card can be used in a variety of meals, allowing players to be strategic in what they build and when. You could play something small, like onion rings or potato cakes, or save up your cards to build something big, like an epic burger!<br/><br/>A variety of power cards let you play more strategically in your race to accumulate the most points. Swap out cards from your hand, force other players to throw away their ingredient cards or even steal finished menu items. But be careful, your opponents are out to do the same to you in return. Power cards can be used at any time on your turn.<br/><br/>If a player uses up all the cards in their hand they get to draw another 7 cards from the deck. However, this ends their turn and they cannot play any more cards.<br/><br/>Play ends in one of two ways. In sprint mode, play ends when the first player reaches 30 points. In marathon mode, play continues until the entire deck has been used up and players can no longer create any food combos. The winning player is the one who has played the most ingredient cards.<br/><br/>And that's all there is to it!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bargo is a Go-like territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board). Each player must have access to a sufficient number of hexagonal pieces of their own color.<br/><br/>Each piece has one of its six edge segments covered with a wall. The outer edges of the board are also covered with walls.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo adjacent cells, and any pieces on them, are linked if their shared edge segment does not contain a wall.<br/><br/>A group is a piece along with all other like-colored pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked pieces of its color.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty cell linked to at least one piece in that group.<br/><br/>Similarly, a territory is an empty cell along with all other empty cells one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked empty cells. You own a territory if all pieces linked to cells in that territory are of your color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must pass or place a piece of your color on an empty cell without causing any edge segment on the board to contain more than one wall, not even momentarily during the move.<br/><br/>After a placement, remove all enemy pieces in groups without liberties. After all removals, the following conditions must be met:<br/><br/><br/>     Your newly placed piece must be part of a group with at least one liberty.<br/>     The cell on the other side of the wall of your newly placed piece must not contain an enemy piece.<br/>     The current board position, ignoring walls, must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns.<br/><br/><br/>Otherwise, your placement is illegal.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. A player's score is the number of pieces of their color on the board, plus the number of cells in their territories, plus a komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomi and buttonThe komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.<br/><br/>The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesLike its companion game Keil, Bargo aims to preserve crosscuts and ko from Go by reducing the natural connectivity of the hexagonal grid.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Fight this war fair and square, or use covert operations and unorthodox tactics to gain the upper hand over your foes! You can also use diplomacy and trade to further your goals! Whatever playstyle you and your friends may choose, the Peace Treaty has it covered! But only one faction can win in the end!<br/><br/>The game takes 60 to 90 minutes. It can be played with 2-5 people. the game ends after 10 turns, or after 12 peace treaty bills have been drawn onto the table and 1 climax bill has been drawn onto the table.<br/><br/>Every turn players go though a number of phases. The First phase is the Allocate war budget phase where players will allow money to show how much they will spend on war this turn.<br/><br/>The Second phase is the peace treaty phase, where players will vote on bills that will change the value of tiles on the map and add or remove rules, players vote on bills by reaching their hand into a cotton bag, and at the same time drawing out coins to place on 1 of three sides.. Pass, Ban or Veto, Each side does a different thing depending on the card and the side with the most money gets put into play.<br/><br/>The third phase is the war phase, where players look at a list of actions which include, moving their armies, attacking other players, sending out airstrikes or even committing unethical actions~. Unethical actions are actions which in all senses are better than normal war actions but force the player to collect unethical cubes, which do nothing at the start of the game but may punish players harshly if certain cards have been put into play.<br/><br/>Lastly, is the income phase, where everyone collects income from owning land, 1 coin per 3 tiles + whatever card rulings after collecting income, players draw the next peace treaty card and do it all again until they reach the end of turn 10 where they will count up victory points and whoever has the most wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This abstract, chess-style, two-player strategy game tells the story of one Path&rsquo;s conquest of another, using Anachrony components and a print-and-play game board.<br/><br/>Just like in chess, your goal is to capture your opponent&rsquo;s &ldquo;King,&rdquo; which in this game is represented by the Player banner&mdash;in other words, the Path&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flag.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In this chess variant, the playing pieces will be your Exosuits, and the Workers you use to operate them will determine how they behave. What do you need for the next move? A Knight, a Rook, a Bishop, or maybe a Queen? Recruit the respective Worker from the Market for your chosen Exosuit with a bonus resource (like a Water or Energy core), and make your move!<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Workers are removed from used Exosuits after they move, so you&rsquo;ll have to recruit new ones to operate them&mdash;unless, of course, you pay a Water to motivate the Worker to stay. If you have an empty Exosuit in danger or would like to move an Exosuit like a Pawn, you&rsquo;ll find Energy cores are quite useful as well.<br/><br/>The print-and-play Anachrony Chess game board and the Rulebook are available for download at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mindclashgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.mindclashgames.com</a> and the Files section of this BGG page.<br/><br/>",

The iron god awoken. The iron law unbound.<br/><br/>Iron Mountain is a bleak and unforgiving game about fragile hopes better left behind. Players take on the roles of outcasts condemned to slave away their existence in an underground mine. Time and toil have reduced them to mere shadows flickering through winding tunnels and empty caves. But now the iron law that binds them has begun to loosen its grip. As they set out to reclaim their past lives and escape the mountain, hope quickly turns to despair. For what does it mean to be free in a world of shackles? And what becomes of a shadow once it steps outside and into the light?<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of turns until all shadows have either escaped the iron mountain or become lost. Players control multiple shadows, exploring the mountain by placing cave tiles, discovering items, and crafting iron artefacts. Every action causes tremors, and shadows are constantly trying to avoid triggering collapses and other disastrous events along the tremor track. The shadows must hurry to craft their artefacts and find the shaft of light before the mountain comes crashing down upon them. As they enter the shaft of light, players burn the shadow standees in a candle, hoping against hope that something better awaits them on the other side.<br/><br/>Iron Mountain is the second installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope. The trilogy began with Tower of Silence and will end with Pesta.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Roleplaying as the mangers of a civilization, players make progress across an advancement track split into four eras of time, with each era requiring a player to construct four unique buildings which either produce resources, create an engine to produce new resources, or effect the way in which those resources are managed.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is given eight terrain tiles, two of which are placed at the start of the game. As each player advances to the next era, they place two new terrain tiles creating a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot;. Over the course of gameplay each player will place 16 buildings before constructing the final monument, winning the game for that player.<br/><br/>In addition to the placement of buildings, each turn players draw either a &quot;rise&quot; or a &quot;ruin&quot; card depending on their leaderboard position. These cards have random effects which balance gameplay for those who are lagging behind or have snowballed ahead, which can be omitted for purely strategic gameplay. As well, players move up to two merchant pieces with the ability to duplicate the production of the building or resource triangle they are standing on, including the buildings of their opponents.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players collectively take part in open trade where they are able to trade: resources, constructed buildings, rise cards, their status tokens, and can make promissory agreements for future payment which they are not required to fulfil. The game is played until the first player constructs their monument, which determines the winner of that game. The game can be continued to determined second, third, place players if desired.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your goal as the Kids is to keep the house in good shape and keep the pets from wrecking the place. The Pets attempt to destroy as much stuff as they can and make a huge mess. Players only have 10 turns to accomplish their goals as best as possible.<br/><br/>The Pets will consist of four dogs and four cats. The dogs and cats can eat food, then poo and pee in the house, or leave muddy footprints, which all earn points at the end if not cleaned up by the kids. Dogs can break things and chew stuff up, cats can shred stuff and knock things over. Cuz Cats.<br/><br/>The Kids have a Babysitter, Brother, Sister, and a baby. Each kids has a special power. The biggest dog will always protect the baby, and follow the baby around. The sister likes to chase the cats, and can drive them away. The brother and babysitter can fix and clean stuff, and wrangle the dogs.<br/><br/>At the end of 10 turns, the parents get home. The side that scores the most points at the end wins. That's the general gist of it, there is a floorplan of the house, standees, counters and player mats to keep track of your side's abilities.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Every card in the game is multiple use; play, resource payment or special discard ability. Cards are played from hand by discarding payment but each card a player controls will also generate a resource token during their turn which may be used for playing cards. The more a player controls the more powerful they become thus making it easier to play more cards.<br/><br/>This game is about choices and sacrifice. And with many circumstantial abilities and effects the replay value is very great. There is also a planned expansion in the works.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge is the second in the Card Conquest game series in which players recreate epic military contests of history in short, comparatively simple, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master games. As with the first game in the series, Hitler's Reich, Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge  sets up in minutes and plays to a conclusion in one sitting of two hours (or less). These are not simulations but games, albeit ones packed with enough historical flavor and decision-making to give players the feeling that &ldquo;you are there&rdquo; at the highest levels of command.<br/><br/>In Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge, the 23 uneasy years of peace between the arch-rival republics of Rome and Carthage come to an end by Hannibal Barca. Son of the Carthaginian hero in their earlier conflict, he vowed since childhood to take revenge for his country's humiliating defeat in that war. Now the time has come to redeem that pledge, and he laid siege to the city of Saguntum in Spain. Rome, incensed over this attack on their ally, mobilizes for war in response.<br/><br/>It is now 219 B.C. (or in the Roman calendar 534 Ab Urbe Condita -that many years since the founding of the city). As the Senate and People of Rome, will you succeed in making Carthage pay for this insult and once again force upon them a humiliating peace? Or as the elders of Carthage, will you restore your city&rsquo;s rightful place in the Mediterranean world to bring honor and glory to your people through victories gained in Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge?<br/><br/>Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge mixes deck building mechanisms with area control on a map of the Western Mediterranean. There are several ways players can win: by capturing the enemy capital (without losing their own), reducing your opponent's hand size to zero, or (as Carthage) holding out until the game ends. To accomplish all this, players can capture cities and/or play event cards that help them strengthen their hand&mdash;or weaken that of their opponent.<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s hand is composed of conflict cards ranging in strength from 1 to 13. Some of these cards have special powers, such as the ability to re-roll one or more dice. In conflict, the strength of these cards is complimented with the roll of the dice (standard 3, but up to 5 with events and leaders). Rome&rsquo;s deck is divided into two &ldquo;suits&rdquo;: one for the Republic of Rome itself (e.g. &ldquo;The Legions&rdquo;) and another for its Latin Allies. Cathage&rsquo;s conflict cards are similarly divided: one suit representing the core Carthaginian army and another for their Gallic, Spanish, and other Allies/Mercenaries.<br/><br/>Conflict cards can also be used to move leaders (e.g. Hannibal or his brother Hasdruble and a pool of Roman leaders of varying quality whom a Senate game mechanism assigns to command Rome&rsquo;s field armies). These leaders represent their armies which move upon the game map&mdash;a map divided into sea and land areas (yes, Hannibal can again perform his legendary march across the Alps!) with some land areas identified as Roman, Carthaginian, or Neutral, some of which contain Fortified Walled Cities. Such Cities may be besieged&hellip;a sometime perilous and time-consuming enterprise.<br/><br/>Players may also use one or more Event cards to influence the outcome of the conflict. Conflict arises when a player tries to capture a territory or when he tries to acquire a new Event card from one of three available decks: Roman, Carthaginian, or mixed (available for both parties).<br/><br/>Hannibal's Revenge includes a built-in solitaire bot system to enhance solo play. For those who want to play with more than two, it also includes optional rules for 3-4 players.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>One 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; Mounted Map<br/>54 Conflict Cards (four suits of 13 cards plus 2 Prodotis - i.e. &ldquo;Traitor&rdquo;- cards)<br/>72 Hannibal's Revenge Event Cards<br/>16 Leader Cards<br/>Ten six-sided dice (five white, five black)<br/>140+ Assorted Wooden pieces, Cubes, and Cylinders<br/>2 Player Aid Sheets<br/>1 Solitaire Player Aid Sheet<br/>Rules of Play manual (this booklet) -<br/>Playbook (which includes Rules for Solitaire Play)<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: When both players' Conflict Card decks get shuffled, a sexennium (6 years) is complete. The game can end at any moment, but will last no more than three such sexennia.<br/><br/>MAP SCALE: Land Areas, Major Cities, and Sea Zones (some of which can be hazardous to traverse).<br/><br/>UNIT SCALE: Combat strengths are determined for each combat by card play and dice rolls.<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1 &ndash; 2 (with optional rules for 3-4)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Death Dome is an action strategy game where you control a team of four units inside the Death Dome battleground. The objective of each match is to use your team to capture as many control points and gather as many credits as possible. Between matches, you must equip your team with the best equipment that you can afford.<br/><br/>Play a quick match or a whole campaign series. Try different combinations of characters and equipment. Capture control points, collect beetle shells for defeating enemy units, and free your teammates from jail if they are captured.<br/><br/>Players start with 4 units in a base and get to move 2 units each turn. The match lasts for 6 turns. Each unit phase a unit can move and do 1 action, usually either capture a control point or attack an enemy unit. Players get points for each captured control point or defeated enemy at the end of the match. The player with the most points wins. Points turn into credits and can be used to buy new equipment for the next match. Players can compete in a series of matches.<br/><br/>Players draw cards each turn, with bonus cards for each 5 control points they control. Cards can be used to attack or defend or other abilities. Cards are only redrawn at the start of each turn so players must decide how to manage their hand of attacks and save some for defense.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The future is built on countless layers of existence. The virtual and physical entwine. The human mind is no longer able to determine which layer is the &quot;original&quot; one. The concept of &quot;real&quot; is way in the past.<br/><br/>The Grid is a dark-web of layers. Filled with millions of ongoing cyber deals and bloody confrontations. The Grid's unique encryption makes it a free-for-all for both the biggest corporations and exclusive cliques of criminals.<br/><br/>In no-mans-land you can be the man. One big score can change your fate forever. But it can get real messy, real fast. So carefully pick your squad, recon the objective, and shift the paradigm in your favor today!<br/><br/>And remember, once you get on the grid you also get on the radar...<br/><br/>GRIDWARS offers a new take on the hex-based skirmish game. Except for a smooth and satisfying combat system, you get a lot of possibilities to interact with the environment, hack your way through the battle, throw enemy and allied units, and even engineer and deploy powerful combat mechs to aid you!<br/><br/>In a single game, you get the experience of wargaming, RGP, board game, and strategy game. Here are a few aspects that contribute to GRIDWARS unique gameplay:<br/><br/><br/>     RPG Scenarios. The game is scenario-based. Every time you will face a different challenge that will allow different characters to excel.<br/>     Squad Building. Before the game, you will pick your squad. Every unit has a cost and each scenario a limit of how many you can use per player. It is up to you to decide if you want to focus on brute force, hacking, or engineering!<br/>     Quick-Paced Skirmish. Players activate one of their units alternately. Each time a unit can execute actions. Move, Charge, Attack, Shoot, Use Abilities, Hack, Build, or even Throw a smaller enemy across the battlefield! Order in which you activate your units and execute actions will be the key to the winning strategy.<br/>     Custom Dice. There are custom attack and defense dice. After the roll, you will be able to improve your results depending on your unit's statistics. The combat mechanics are very intuitive. No math, just choices. You will see everything there is to know on your rolled dice!<br/>     Strategy-Affecting Terrain. The terrain creates a unique setting for each encounter on the grid. You can hide inside the buildings, lock the door, or shoot through the windows, all of which will affect the mechanics.<br/>     Powerful Hacking. The semi-virtual nature of the grid makes hacking a reality-bending feat. By using the terminals located on the battlefield, the hackers can activate the sentry guns, detonate mines, and manipulate electronic objects. By directly hacking the enemy operating systems, they can instantly inflict damage and status effects. <br/>     Versatile Engineering. Combat engineers can repair or deactivate obstacles. But what's more important, they can learn blueprints and collect materials to deploy just the right combat mechs to change the tide of the battle! <br/>     Energy System. It's up to you to decide which of your units will be reinforced each turn. At the beginning of a round, you will distribute the Energy. You can spend it to make your attacks and defense more effective or to activate powerful abilities in critical situations. Make sure to impact the battle in places where it is needed the most!<br/>     High Replayability. In every game, you will face different enemies, choose different squads and compete in different scenarios. You can find new synergies between characters in every game!<br/><br/><br/>",

Thanks to easy access to mortgage loans, the success of these deals primarily depends on the appeal of the placement of each building.<br/><br/>Animo City is a small card game that uses cards to delimit an imaginary board where a city will be developed.<br/><br/>Building cards can be played face down as building lots, or face up to raise a building on a lot you already own.

        "description": "For centuries, Samoan warriors have spun and tossed their weapons in dazzling demonstrations of courage and skill. The traditional wooden war clubs were later replaced with hooked steel machetes. In 1946, a young knife dancer, &ldquo;Freddie&rdquo; Letuli, was performing in San Francisco at an event that also featured a Hindu fire eater and a girl who twirled a baton with light bulbs on the ends. Letuli wrapped some towels around the ends of his knife, dipped them in fuel, set them alight, and invented fireknife dancing.<br/><br/>The fireknife dance (siva afi) is now a major feature of Samoan culture and the pinnacle of any luau.<br/><br/>In this game, 2-6 players are fireknife dancers. The game alternates between a practicing phase (where players improve their hands) and a performing phase (where players dance by playing cards). In each dance, the best performer earns points. The first player to score a certain number of points wins the game.<br/><br/>This reimplementation of Fireknife! was developed and tested with the help of professional fireknife dancers. All card text is bilingual (Samoan and English). The cards feature gorgeous art by Samoan artist Troy Safotu.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Like with other Envyra expansions, it is easy to implement with only a few seconds needed to understand the rules.<br/>Envyra remains the same fast and clever simultaneous action game, but now with even more options and infinite fun.<br/><br/>Infinity expansion is compatible with all other Envyra expansions. Not playable in ANDRENALINE MODE.<br/><br/>- - - - - - -<br/><br/>CONTENT:<br/>1 Infinity Tile<br/>2 Wild Tiles<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>After the tiles are sorted during the setup (step 1), mix 2 Wild Tiles with other 'S' marked Tiles and mix 1 Infinity Tile with other (Basic) Tiles.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>RULES (Infinity Tile):<br/>Infinity Tile is very special. Cubes placed on this tile are never to be returned to their owners during the game (except the situation when all player's cubes are removed from the Grid).<br/>The player can target the Infinity Tile during Phase I only if this player is targeting another eligible tile with their second cube as well. That means the player cannot target the Infinity Tile with a single cube placement in Phase I.<br/>Be careful not to place your cubes on this tile too early as you may have very limited capturing options for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>The player with the most cubes on Infinity Tile at the end of the game adds 8 points to their total. If more players have the most cubes (same number) placed on the Infinity Tile, they each gain 8 points divided by the number of tied players rounded down (i.e. each of two tied players gets 4 points, each of three tied players gets 2 points, etc.).<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>RULES (Wild Tiles):<br/>Wild Tiles belong to all three themes (Green/Blue/Orange). The solar system symbol is unique to all three themes (the Fifth Symbol). Wild Tile could be captured by the player like any other tile.<br/>The owner of the tile can choose which theme this tile belongs to and they can change this theme/color affiliation each round. That means Wild Tile can help the player acquire restricted tiles with different theme icons each round. Note that the Wild Tile could represent only one theme/color each round.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>There are two restricted tiles in the Playing Grid. The first restricted tile displays 1 green and 2 orange icons on the right side and the second tile displays 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 orange icon. A player owns 1 green tile and 2 Wild Tiles thus this player is eligible to move their cube on any of these restricted tiles, but it can't move their cube on both during the same round.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>During the scoring, a player can choose again which theme their Wild Tile would belong to and add a unique solar system symbol to the set of that theme/color.  <br/>The Black Star symbol with the '-2' VP mark means that the player owning the tile must deduct 2 VP points from their total during scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like 18WE/72, 18EE/82 is an operational strategy game based on Mike Hutton&rsquo;s popular 1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties system covering Easter Europe.  It features a larger board, 21 major companies, and more offboard areas than either 18EA/62 or 18WE/72.  Any player familiar with 18WE/72 will very easily be able to enjoy 18EE/82, because the rules are almost completely identical aside from setup.<br/><br/>18EE/82 features five regions instead of three, in which only three of four corporations are typically startable, as well as 3 minor companies in Hungary.  The four non-Hungarian regions feature randomly selected subsidies at setup, out of a pool of five.  These simple differences in setup present the players with major strategic decisions in what railroads to found, as well as how their companies will best be developed and operated.<br/><br/>18EE/82 has extremely high replayability, due to its random setup at the beginning of the game.  Every non shell company is assigned a license type randomly (from expresses, freights, and regionals).<br/><br/>18EE/82 has a larger board than 18WE/72, covering much of Eastern Europe.  The map also has more offboard areas, including the premier zones of Berlin and Constantinople.  Like in 18WE/72, there is no plain yellow track.  All track tiles are unlimited. Each company gets at least three track actions to determine tile placements and upgrades.  The map size supports more stations which can be acquired during the life of each corporation.  Each corporation may lay TWO additional tokens each operating round, instead of just one.<br/><br/>The financial aspects of 18EA/62 you will find almost fully intact. There are parliament rounds, mergers, and refinancing, all as players know them from its predecessor game. Similarly both chartered and non-chartered corporations function in exactly the same ways.  This allows players to focus on the operational aspects of the game, without having to learn a new financial framework if they are familiar with either game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

For hundreds of years it defied the course of history and provided a holy retreat for a small group of nuns. But time does not stop at the venerable convent, and it is hard to find young nuns willing to move into such solitude. There is not even Internet! Despite great protests on the part of the abbess, the convent is now to be sold and for the first time in years there are guests within the sacred walls. The prospective buyers, who have traveled a long way, have their own plans for the monastery, but when the real estate agent G&uuml;nther H&uuml;bsch is found dead in the monastery garden on the second day, the blood freezes in the veins of those present: Because the perpetrator is among them. The police are alerted and the abbess invites all the guests and nuns to the dining room to convict the murderer and then hand him over to the police.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this two-player hidden movement deck-building hand management game, each player will assume the actions of one dangerous predator that exists to achieve one objective: reign as the Alpha.<br/><br/>How do they do this? Players will choose seven action cards, each of which represents the passage of one hour of time, from their available deck to play that round. Players then take actions simultaneously, resolve them, and repeat the process until each player has one card remaining (*), which gets upgraded based on the player's current location on the board.<br/><br/>Player's creatures can Move around the map, Hunt the piddling local wildlife to avoid Howl penalties, and Track their opponent to ascertain their location. Players must also navigate un-upgradable Sleep and Scat actions that make it harder for them to stay undetected. Players who perform the final available action, Sneak Attack!, lay it all on the line. They either win the game, or let their opponent know exactly where to find them.<br/><br/>(*) Unless their opponent has located them, in which case, game over.

The key to expanding Wilderness Dice is making sure to include the proper number of dice. For the first two players, add 12 dice. Each additional player should add 3 dice to the total. Players will still only complete three rounds of dice rolls. This does mean that more players will have leftover cards at the end of each round.<br/><br/>The Domestic expansion includes both Farm animals and Pets. This collection is meant for players who want to use their favorite pets, or for families with farming roots.

The player operates the German forces and has three possible victory conditions based on army strength and unit location on the playing area at the end of the sixth turn.<br/><br/>German army corps move across rows of rectangles overlaid on a partial map of France (Arras to the outskirts of Paris). When German and Entente units occupy the same row of rectangles combat occurs. The player rolls 1d6 for every 2 German corps in the rectangle and adds the total result to the strength of the corps, then does the same for the Entente player. There are modifiers based on map location. Loser must retreat one row or reduce the strength of one corps. Random events may send German corps off to East Prussia or to sieges of Channel ports or Low Country towns. Other events may bring reinforcements to either side, advance the Germans&rsquo; Schlieffen Plan, result in Entente confusion or German exhaustion, etc.<br/><br/>This game originally appeared in World War One Illustrated magazine No. 3 and does not include the six-sided dice necessary for play.

Both races contribute a set of unique cards (used for actions and conflict resolution) and their Fleet (represented by a miniature with a functional tray to put your armies on).<br/><br/>From the first turn of the game, you partake in a &ldquo;Fistfight in a space elevator&rdquo; of a kind.

This task requires getting Void Particles (VP for short), either by extracting them, colonizing locations, or dominating your opponents. While at it players strategically buy new technologies for their decks, gain Traits, and man their fleets to prepare for massive space battles.<br/><br/>Beware!

It had a long overhanging bowsprit, an aftset mizzen mast and lateen sails.<br/><br/>Favoured by Barbary Corsairs (Muslim pirates operating off the coast of North Africa) and Algerian Berber corsairs, early xebecs had two masts, whilst later examples had three.

These hardened veterans can move rapidly despite medium armor, and attack exposed elements, even at long distances across the battlefield. As with all Stormcrows, a little extra coins goes a long way, and these veterans didn't get where they are by taking coin without delivering added performance. They can engage swiftly from surprising distances, strike hard, then fade back to the relative safety of their own lines. If pinned, they can hold their own against even heavy troops, though not for long. Staying mobile is their best defense.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The attack over the Jarama river was to be coordinated with the Italian&rsquo;s offensive to the north and east of the city along the Guadalajara river. However, the Italians were taking longer than anticipated to get their forces into positions, hindered by poor weather and abysmal planning. With growing impatience General Franco ordered his forces to attack, supported by the German Condor Legion as well as masses of new German tanks, artillery pieces and ample supplies of ordinance.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

        "description": "In the game, you get 144 cards, split into 2 decks of Chances (really good scoring chances), and Half-Chances (long shot scoring chances). Teams are rated simply for goals scored and goals allowed, home and away. Each team is rated further for who scores the team's goals when a goal is scored.<br/><br/>Depending on the goals scored rating of the team and the goals allowed rating of the opponent, each team will get a certain number of possible chances per game. The trick is that not all those chances will come up in a game and, despite having more possible total chances in a match than the opposition, a streak of bad luck could lead to the big upset. Players roll two six sided dice, one to see if anything happens in that period of time (1 out of six times you get a Chance, 1 out of six you get a Half Chance, 4 out of six you get nothing ).  You roll each half of the match until you run out of possible chances.<br/><br/>Example: one team has 7 chances, the other team has 3. There will be a total of 10 dice rolls to make up a single half of play. If you roll a 5 or 6, flip a FAC and a further roll of the dice will happen to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The Chance and Half-Chance cards have descriptive play calls on them so you really get the feel of watching the highlights reel of a match. You will have high scoring shootouts and defensive stalemates.<br/><br/>Included are:<br/><br/>    124 Team Indicator cards which are used to identify and rate the *128 competing teams;<br/>    16 dice of various colors which are used to determine the shots missed and the goals scored during the game. A team rating determines the number of dice rolled - a five might be a goal while a 6 is always a goal;<br/>    a Match Die Chart to cross-reference against the ratings for each team;<br/>    a Goal Misses Chart, which adds imagery;<br/>    a Goal Description Chart, which also adds to the imagery;<br/>    a Rule Book; and a description of how to convert the F. A. Cup system to various sized leagues.<br/><br/><br/>The game also requires a deck of regular playing cards which you can order with the game or supply yourself.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

With this game, players will be able to recreate the famous assaults on the farms of La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont during the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815. It hopes to demonstrate how ferocious the fighting was around these iconic locations that even today bear the scars of that famous day.<br/><br/>Indeed, the capture of these two farms became an obsession for the French, and thousands of Napoleon&rsquo;s men would become casualties trying to wrest control of them from the smaller Anglo-Allied garrisons. The fighting was intense, often involving hand-to-hand combat, and raged for hours through woods, orchards, and finally into the farms. Both the attackers and defenders demonstrated incredible bravery and their efforts helped in no small way to determine the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 16th century was a time of strife for Japan. Its many clans were autonomous, headstrong and resistant to unification. The emperor thus began a competition for shogun between his two greatest samurai. You and an opponent will vie for the title as you coerce one village after another, searching for the three resources vital to the creation of the fighting infantry called Ashigaru &ndash; men, food and gold. Will you be able to unite the major clans, better your opponent and become shogun? Find out by playing all three games of Ashigaru:1567 &ndash; making wise decisions, using clever card management, and playing winning 3-Card Poker hands! (Note: This is the first in a series of low-cost games using the 3CP Game Engine&trade;, which employs custom cards plus a user-supplied 52-card deck of standard playing cards.)<br/><br/>During the game, players try to win Ashigaru cards by playing 3-card poker hands from a standard deck. However, it's not as simple as it first appears. Since you get a new card every round, will you hold onto a pair of jacks, for example, hoping for a third -- making three-of-a-kind? Or break up two Aces to use one in a straight? A simple, easily memorized chart determines what Ashigaru cards you get -- and the better your winning hand, the better the cards you win.<br/><br/>There are three related games included, of easy to moderate complexity. All are simple to learn, fun to play and balanced, with a fairly high tension level.<br/><br/><br/>     Print &amp; Play cards available in Files section.<br/>     Professionally produced card deck available at thegamecrafter.com.<br/><br/><br/>",

Since that time, new research has been made available, and the game has been played countless times by many players around the world who have provided a wealth of feedback. The game system remains basically the same, allowing players to focus on planning and strategy and not an overbearing rules system. Based on that new research and feedback, many units have been adjusted, all of the maps have minor changes, and some whole rules sections have been revamped to better represent the historical reality, while minimizing further complexity.

Fierce fighting will take place in and out of the trenches. Advancing out of your trench will make you an easy target, but will make your fire power more deadly. Watch out for gas attacks and bombardments, which can cause much damage to your troops. If you can break the stalemate and wipe out the enemy, you win!

Each player has an allocated colour (White or Black). Place the 40 pieces within both player&rsquo;s reach, but leaving room for the game on the playing surface.<br/><br/>Starting with White, players alternate turns placing one piece from the supply in any position (even standing vertically) following these placement rules:<br/><br/>a) The piece must align with the cubic grid.<br/>       <br/>    b) It must be adjacent (two faces touching) to at least one already played piece, if any.<br/>       <br/>    c) It must be fully supported by either the table or pieces below it; i.e. no overhangs are allowed.<br/><br/>The first player creating a line of 4 cubes of her colour wins the game. Lines can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal and any two consecutive cubes from that line must be touching each other by at least one edge (not only a vertex). Also all 4 cubes must have at least one exposed (visible) face.<br/><br/>If, at any moment, you knock a piece over, you immediately lose the game.<br/><br/>It is recommended to play on a surface that can be rotated, and you&rsquo;re allowed to rotate it on your turn.<br/><br/>On your first plays, you&rsquo;ll notice how black wins almost all the time. As you play more, then white will win most of the time (find the best opening for white). But once you gain more experience, games might last more than 30 turns and wins will balance out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Feline Felonies you take charge of a neighbourhood cat whose goal is to be the greatest thief around. You&rsquo;ll steal toys and other items cats believe to be toys from around the board as well as from other cats. Get the most highly valued toys home to win and be crowned most felonious of the felines.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to determine their 'Purr Points' for each turn. Using these they traverse the board, pick up and drop off toys, steal toys from other cats and even increase the value of their toys. Whenever a cat tries to steal from another, dice are rolled to determine the 'reflexes' and 'stealth' for each to determine whether the theft was successful or not.<br/><br/>Special Actions linked to each number on the die allow players to move toys on the board, add new toys to the board, increase or decrease the value of toys by flipping the token or take a cat nap to save Purr Points for use later in the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>A group is a set of mutually adjacent stones of the same color. A cut of a group is a set of mutually adjacent cells (empty or occupied by either color) including no stones in that group.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty cell.<br/><br/>You win by making a group of your color such that none of its cuts include more than half of the cells on the board.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomi and pie ruleKomi or the pie rule (or both) can be used in order to make the game fair.<br/><br/>The pie rule gives White the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>Komi is either a whole number or a whole number plus 0.5. When komi is used, Black wins by making a black group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the cells on the board minus komi, and White wins by making a white group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the cells on the board plus komi.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games. When komi and the pie rule are used together, Black on their first turn chooses komi and places a black stone on the board, and then White has the option to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesSunder is a particular case of Omny.<br/><br/>",

You must use strategy and cunning to lead your armies to victory and overtake your opponent&rsquo;s castle!<br/><br/>To begin, you and your opponent must setup the board and choose a random means to determine who will move first. Players then alternate moves. When it is your turn to move, you must move exactly one of your pieces. You can&rsquo;t move to a space occupied by one of your other pieces, and you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;jump&rdquo; over any pieces unless otherwise specified. If you move to a space occupied by one of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces, his or her piece is destroyed. Once you move, your turn is over. The first player to destroy his or her opponent&rsquo;s Castle wins the game.<br/><br/>Players can choose to play with the standard gameboard setup or customize the board with new and unique game pieces from expansion packs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bowline is played on a hexhex board with stones of two colors, one color belonging to each player. The winner of the game is the player to first make a loop consisting entirely of stones of their color.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>On your turn, you must either (i) place a stone of your color on an empty hex, or (ii) flip an eligible arc of enemy stones. You may not do both.<br/><br/>Definitions:<br/>To flip an enemy stone is to replace it with a stone of your own, from your (preferably endless) supply.<br/><br/>An arc is a possibly bent line of stones with no acute angles and no turns going in opposite directions (no S-like swingyness). (Se below for a more precise definition of an arc.)<br/><br/>You are said to flank an arc of enemy pieces if two of your pieces  are the endpoints of an arc otherwise completely made up of said enemy pieces.<br/><br/>You may flip an arc of enemy pieces if you are the only one flanking it.<br/><br/>A loop is a group of stones causing one or more cells not contained in that group to be severed from the edges of the board in this sense: There is no chain of adjacent cells going from any of those severed cells to any edge cell that does not contain at least one stone from the loop group. (It's a curve of stones biting itself in the ass, around at least one enemy stone or at least one empty cell.)<br/><br/>More precise definition of an arc:<br/>A chain of adjacent pieces make up an arc if it is possible to order them from first to last in a sequence where a walk from the first to the last member of the chain, visiting all members in order, will (i) at no point require a turn of more than 60 degrees, and (ii) either require no clockwise turns or no counter-clockwise turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Aquabats! Super Showdown! card game, two to four players are villains competing to capture all five members of The Aquabats, the world's greatest superhero rock band.<br/><br/>The game consists of three types of cards: Monster cards, Action cards, and Aquabats cards. Monster cards have colors and power levels. Each turn, a player plays a Monster card and draws a new  Monster card. If the card played is of the same color and a higher power level than the card previously played, that player may draw both a Monster card and an Action card. At the start of a player's turn, a Battle card or Epic Battle card may be played, challenging one player or all players respectively to a showdown. Each player in the battle must play a Monster card, and the winner may take an Aquabat card from the table or, if none remain, steal one from the defeated player.<br/><br/>Shrink Ray cards enable a challenged player to diminish the power of an aggressor; X-Ray cards allow one to peak at another player's hand; Antibats cards foil the winner of a battle from taking a loser's Aquabat card; and Steal cards can be used to acquire another player's Aquabat card without a battle.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player acquires all five Aquabat cards or until War is mutually declared, in which case the winner of a single round Epic Battle is declared the game's victor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vacu is a Go-like territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stones of its color.<br/><br/>Similarly, a territory is an empty point along with all other empty points one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent empty cells. You own a territory if all stones adjacent to points in that territory are of your color.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point adjacent to at least one stone in that group.<br/><br/>To flip a group is to replace all its stones with stones of the opposite color.<br/><br/>To suppress a group is to remove all its stones from the board.<br/><br/>Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of points in your territories, plus komi (see below) if you play White.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, pass or place a stone of your color on an empty point. If this stone is part of a group with liberties, suppress all enemy groups without liberties. Otherwise, suppress your group without liberties and flip all enemy groups that had no liberties before the suppression. In the latter case, at least one group must be flipped for the move to be legal.<br/><br/>The game ends when either both players pass in succession or a player flips or suppresses the last enemy group on the board. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>If, after a board play, the same board position appears for the third time with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. A pass is not a board play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.<br/><br/>The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsConvacu: The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. If you have no other moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. If, at the end of a turn, there is a group touching the two opposite board edges of its color, the owner of that group wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These are the Topside Miniature Naval Warfare Rules accompany our naval miniature sets, and are offered as a basic framework for using and enjoying the miniatures. We tried for the emphasis on playability while giving the player a healthy does of realism.  If you are reading this sentence right now, you are probably reading it on paper or in electronic form, rather than written on stone. So read these rules, take the miniatures for a spin, and adjust the battle table to your liking. Season to taste, as the cookbooks say. And enjoy!<br/><br/>Our system allows for a complete interplay between air, naval and submarine combat without bogging down and killing the fun factor. The movement and combat rules are simple but they do add a level of complexity that will require some critical decision making throughout the game. Our goal was to have you focus on the critical decision tree the rules will present you with - and not fight the rules!<br/><br/>A scenario book covering 17 WWII naval battles is available for pdf download.<br/><br/>",

Signs of this corruption manifest across the land in the form of black splotches. Could this be the work of Tulo Tulodon banished so long ago? Can he be stopped before it&rsquo;s too late?<br/><br/>Grit is played over a series of games. There's no set path you absolutely need to take to reach the end, so your campaign length will vary. Will you try to explore every inch of the world or crash the end game? Save your progress after each game or a series of games and pick it up at a later time.<br/><br/>Travel around a modular, hidden map as you meet the townsfolk and battle the evil of the land. You must end your game at a checkpoint or you will lose your progress and need to reset to your previous checkpoint.<br/><br/>Locations and events are depicted by QR codes.  QR codes will link to 277 websites with interactions with townsfolk, enemies and the environment. There are standard codes you can access whenever, immediate codes that are forced interactions when they are revealed and dig sites where you spend a stamina to uncover hidden items.<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo stones, or a stone and an empty square, see each other if they lie on the same straight line of orthogonally or diagonally adjacent squares and there are no other stones between them along that line.<br/><br/>You control a square in any of the following situations:<br/><br/><br/>     The square sees stones of your color in three orthogonal directions.<br/>     The square sees stones of your color in two adjacent orthogonal directions and two opposite diagonal directions, provided that each one of the latter directions is adjacent to exactly one of the former.<br/>     The square is on the perimeter of the board and sees stones of your color in two orthogonal directions.<br/><br/><br/>To flip a stone is to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square not controlled by your opponent or flip an enemy stone on a square you control.

A villain with his own moral code and twisted sense of justice, Nero doled out punishment on those he deemed guilty, mimicking his namesake, the Roman Emperor Nero, who was known for his cruel and unusual methods of torturing those who crossed him. No one had seen or heard from him until earlier today when you received a curious box from Nero, threatening the city of Hampstead with the release of a highly communicable airborne toxin that will likely kill thousands of innocent people if not contained. Nero, however, enjoys the thrill of the chase and the challenge of a worthy opponent. He has provided a series of puzzles that will allow you to pinpoint the location of the  toxin as well as the means to disable the bomb that will disseminate the chemical compound into the atmosphere. He  has allowed you and the other members of the Will Street Detective Agency 72 hours before the population of  Hampstead is wiped off of the map. Oh, and one more thing. Nero has given specific instructions not to contact the  police, the CDC, Homeland Security, or any formal law enforcement agency, threatening to detonate the bomb early if  his instructions aren&rsquo;t followed. This means your wits and detective skills are the only thing that stands between the  town of Hampstead and a bloody, brutal demise. Discover the secret behind Nero&rsquo;s wrath and do whatever it takes to save the citizens of Hampstead. <br/>Difficulty Rating &ndash; 7/10<br/><br/>",

You don&rsquo;t know who trust, but cooperation is going to be essential in order to tie the events down and crystallize a coherence for this spreading caos. And of course you are the only person who knows the truth behind the &quot;SCP - db&quot;, the Standbeelden.<br/><br/>The SCP Foundation is a fictional international organization that contains and classificates anomalities outside bounds of natural law to prevent mass panic. But, what happens before these events are classified and somehow enprisoned? What if those were free?<br/><br/>This is a game based on the contemporary era and involves suburb investigation on paranormal events along a fractional surrealism. The players get bits and pieces of what&rsquo;s going on and tie them together, giving different endings to it depending on the interpretations of their character's point of view. The objective is to propose the most coherent scenario in a convincing storyline.<br/><br/>The game starts by dealing Character and Object cards that remain hidden. Then a keyframe card is revealed, this one contains a mysterious image and narrative fragment. All the players pose their questions around it and then take turns to answer them with a small story in order do build coherence. A vote round will determine which storyline wins, staying as the real version of the occurred events. The corresponding player's character then becomes the protagonist who will then explain what the &quot;SCP - db (Standbeelden)&quot; turns out to be. The losers will give an outcome to their character taking into account what the protagonist, the antagonist, the narration, the secondary characters and the items are.<br/><br/>It is better consider this game not as a zero sum game but as a narrative game-tool. An open ended game in which players can also write their own keyframes and subsequently play as many keyframes as they want. Any doubt about the game is to be determined by the people involved.<br/><br/>This game's setting underlines the human ability to cooperate and piece together non-linear narratives in search of further, more rhythmic patterns. Through overinterpretation, eldritchness and speculation. It puts into consideration the next questions: &ldquo;What is that which we do not acknowledge as a whole?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Why does it necessarily and so often have to do with streams of massive delusion?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Take turns to build a word by using at least 1 alphabet letter from 1 of your own cards and using letters from the other cards in the Centre play area. Once a player has created a word, place the card separately from the other cards in the Centre play area and then reveal/confirm the word to the other players to avoid picking up an additional card from the deck. Then place that card on top of any card in the Centre play area.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of their cards outright wins that level.

        "description": "March 4th, 1861. In his inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln promises not to invade the south or curtail slavery as long as tariffs are collected there and forwarded to the federal government. The south secedes from the Union nonetheless. Lincoln won&rsquo;t let it go, however, and attempts to reinforce Fort Sumter (in his view still federal property) in Confederate South Carolina, provoking the south into firing the first shots. Its cannons level the fort, albeit without loss of life. War fever in the north is at its zenith, and the stage is set &ndash; for the U.S. Civil War.<br/><br/>During this game you&rsquo;ll compete for cards representing Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry and Generals &ndash; by playing hands of 3-card poker. (Hence, &ldquo;3CP&rdquo; in the game&rsquo;s title.) However, since this is more or less a friendly competition, the &ldquo;pots&rdquo; are not winner-take-all. Instead, the winner of a round will gain two components, while his/her opponent will gain one &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the winner&rsquo;s decision. Close attention to your needs and those of your opponent is required. Your goal is, ideally, to build four Brigades, each with a General and Supplies, and perhaps one additional Brigade if you&rsquo;re lucky. Card management in the form of &ldquo;what poker hand to play now and what to save for later&rdquo; is also an important factor toward winning the game.<br/><br/>This is the third game in a series using the 3CP Game Engine&trade;, which employs custom cards and a deck of standard playing cards.<br/><br/>",

Soldiers move by rotating on a corner that is touching an adjacent card; either rotating 90 degrees to touch another card, or if it is on a corner, rotating 180 degrees to align to the new edge. Each player makes two moves on their turn, which can be to move two soldiers, or the same soldier twice.<br/><br/>Soldiers have three possible effects when aligned against an enemy card in certain orientations:<br/><br/><br/>    Attack: remove the enemy from play<br/>    Defend: block an Attack<br/>    Capture: flip an enemy card over so that it joins your side<br/><br/><br/>By attacking and removing soldiers from play, and capturing enemy cards, you can gain a dominant position and isolate your opponent&rsquo;s cards so that they are unable to move. When they have no possible moves to make, you have won the battle!<br/><br/>",

There a total of 72 points in stake for each hand, but only the difference with respect to 36 is scored. These points can be sometimes doubled, quadrupled, etc. according to the initial bid. The game is usually played for 101 points or more, which generally requires several hands.<br/><br/>The game is closely related to the French card game Manille, from which it takes the mechanics, but its rules induce deduction and minimise the effects of luck.<br/><br/>When playing Botifarra you must bear in mind that it is forbidden to speak, show your cards or make signs or comments that may reveal your cards or your opinion as to whether game decisions are good or bad. Despite this, it is quite normal to make some comments during the game, which adds to a more entertaining atmosphere.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PMC 2670 is hard sci-fi platoon-sized ruleset intended for 15mm and it's second edition of PMC 2640 released in 2013.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>In 2013, we have boldly released PMC 2640, which successfully found its place on crowded 15mm sci-fi wargames market. Now, it's high time to leap forward! In the last 3 years, we have worked hard on PMC 2670, which is much more than just a new edition of the game! As you can probably guess, the action takes place 30 years later in the same dirty, gloomy PMC-verse &ndash; but it's also indirectly connected to Shadows in the Void, which takes place much later in the same timeline. The story was moved forward: humanity developed new technologies and improved older ones, encountered an alien threat (or rather the aliens encountered a human threat...) and made the galaxy an even more turbulent place.<br/><br/>So, what are the gameplay changes?<br/>There is no revolution in the core mechanics, as better is often the enemy of good... Still, the basic rules were polished and perfected, making the game even faster, more flexible and more uncompromising &ndash; but it's still the old, fine PMC! Special rules were revisited and all known question-causing or unclear elements were re-edited. But the main advantage of the 2670 edition are the added extras! Now you can lead not only merc forces, but also space bugs and rebels, which became fully playable factions. What is more, there is a fourth faction &ndash; the aforementioned aliens! Forces of your PMCs were bolstered with lots of additional unit entries, offering many new tactics and army compositions. We listened to the players and added a lot of elements they asked for (e.g. power armours, medics, drop pods, and many exotic sci-fi troops). Existing units were carefully examined and rebalanced to adjust them to the new lists. But don't worry, if you already have a collection of minis for PMC 2640, it will be fully playable in PMC 2670 &ndash; you'll simply get even more possibilities! We see no point in making existing armies useless or weaker &ndash; we're players ourselves and know how irritating this can be! In addition to new armies and PMC units, we have updated the scenarios based on the experience from previous years &ndash; but no major changes in this chapter.<br/><br/>Anything else?<br/>Of course! All factions received their own campaign rules, allowing for even more interesting club gaming! Campaign is as important, as it was aspect of the ruleset. Whether you wish to create your own PMC, start a revolt, make bugs the dominant species on the planet or conquer new territories for your Xenotripod tribe, you will have the means to do it. Campaigns became even more challenging thanks to improvements such as quicker progress at the beginning and reduced snowball effect.<br/><br/>...and?<br/>The whole solitaire/coop section was redone. Thanks to universal scenarios you can use any force against any other force on any tier. Additionally, the Special Commando composition allows you to start playing with just a few finished minis &ndash; perfect for people who like to collect different armies without expanding them too much.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now, overwhelmed by the last Znorg&rsquo;s invasion, humans are desperately looking for cadets up to the task. That is why you are here: a group of  uncoordinated and undisciplined new recruits, yet committed with a selfless willingness to serve with enthusiasm and loyalty   to &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; left for humanity. Will it be enough?<br/><br/>A cooperative game from 2 to 4 players in a 30 minutes match on which you should manage &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; spaceship while getting ready for the final battle against the Znorgs. Coordination, organization and teamwork are pivotal in order to survive in the ship. Will you be able to coordinate the numerous logistic tasks? Such as managing inventories, storing and keeping your food or even cleaning the bathrooms. Will you be able to do it while the occasional Znorgs&rsquo; inconvenient shenanigans disrupt the ship?<br/><br/>The game takes place during 3 stages where players will coordinate, upgrade ship modules and strengthen the team to defeat the Znorg in the Final battle.<br/><br/>The players will choose their dice simultaneously behind their screen. They will take turns declaring the number of the dice they are going to play, but not its color nor on which mission they will put them on to play. When everyone but the captain have declared their dice, the captain will say Lets, Go, Cadets! at which point everyone will simultaneously place their dice on a mission trying to fulfill the color and sum requirements, while trying not to damage the ship.<br/><br/>If players make it through the battle against the Znorg without destroying 4 ship modules, congratulations! You have saved humanity.<br/><br/>This game was the winner in the Party Games category at the recent Game Jam Latam Creativa 2021.<br/><br/>",

For this they must choose carefully which ornament they place each turn and in which position of the tree they place it.<br/><br/>The active turn player will throw 3 dice, and select the result of one die for drawing their ornament. The passive players will cross out the selected ornament, and choose one of the remaining corresponding to one of the other two dice.<br/><br/>At the end of the 15th or 16th turn (depending on the number of players), you will add up the scores. Whoever gets the highest result will be the winner and will have managed to decorate the most festive tree!<br/><br/>",

During the voting phase, all players vote on players to represent them in the capitol during the policy phase. During the policy phase, players discard policy cards based in a reverse draft (players discard instead of keeping cards.)<br/><br/>Players win when their role card's objectives are complete. This is variable across four groups. Generally speaking, players want to score five policies for their faction or score five points for a district (most likely the one where they are located. Play continues until either a victory condition is met or 11 policies are in play.<br/><br/>With two routes to victory, players face interesting tradeoffs: help their agenda or help their district?  All the while, players are moving from district to district, realigned to their new homes, new colleagues, and new alliances to build.<br/><br/>",

Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.<br/><br/>King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.<br/><br/>For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.<br/><br/>Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and out think them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.<br/><br/>With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone else's. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Flee we did, but they come behind us! Won&rsquo;t you take us in? Nearby villages you say? Hmm, you provide us much grain. Our city council perchance might let you in. But you must show us your papers. Queue up! Our glorious knights can fend off the giants.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Flee Fi Fo From, players take on the role of competing clans attempting to protect villagers from rampaging giants by bringing them to safety within the city walls. Clans are not saving people out of pure altruism though - they have their own agenda to gain influence in the city council. The clan with the most influence points at the end wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of Action and Reset turns. First the player with the action marker performs up to 2 actions (Authorize, Riot, Swap or Escort). These typically involve selecting villagers to be admitted to the city and moving them forward. Following this, the reset player is responsible for maintaining the flow of villagers towards the city, but may also choose to abandon the rescue efforts by retreating the defending knights instead.<br/><br/>The game ends when either all villagers have been saved or too many knights have retreated from the battlefield.<br/><br/>Scores are a total of villagers rescued, hidden objectives, end game bonuses and rating. The player with the most influence points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player receives 3 dice of the same colour.<br/><br/>During their turn player 1 places one of their dice (while keeping the result) in one area and then may activate the special bonus of that area.  After that it's other player's turn - and it continues until both players have placed all their dice on the gameboard. No area may have two dice from the same player or with the same result.<br/><br/>After a round ends players receive victory points for controlling the areas (in addition to the victory points received from the area bonuses, if any). Area is controlled by the owner of the die with the highest number. Those points are recorded on the paper and then new round starts.<br/><br/>Game ends after round three and all victory points are added together.<br/><br/>Full English language rules are available on the web site.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Tombola was a British SAS-led mission to carry out a series of harrassing raids behind enemy lines in the Reggio Emilia region, at the top of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;. The operation was put together by Major Roy Farrar, who was not allowed to go on the actual mission, although he was allowed to accompany the SAS on the aircraft as they were airdropped. During the airdrop, he &quot;accidentally&quot; fell out of the aircraft, although he happened to have a parachute on, and was able to lead his troops in the field.<br/><br/>The attacks included an assault on the German Gebirgs (mountain corps) headquarters in an attempt to decapitate their regional high command. Notably, a Scottish piper was part of the assaulting force, so that the friendlies could identify which side they were fighting on, as well as to confuse the Germans into thinking that a main Allied force was attacking rather than a raiding party.<br/><br/>This battlepack adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Mediterranean game, including new Airborne SAS Soldiers, German Alpine Hostiles, Missions, Objectives, Location, Landing Zone, and Enemy Lines cards.

There is a Tombola Location card &quot;Villa Calvi&quot; in the set, which is a requisite for one of the Objective cards &quot;Villa Rossi&quot;, and can be omitted for the other Tombola Objectives. <br/><br/>If you are playing the &quot;Villa Rossi&quot; Objective, add the &quot;Villa Calvi&quot; card into the Location card deck and draw Locations as normal. Although the Tombola Location card back is a giveaway, treat this as the effect that the squad has a pathway to the Villa Calvi, as a prelude to attacking the Villa Rossi.<br/><br/>",

A planning phase where players will move their characters around the ship collecting action points in the cannons, sails, spyglass, among others, that they will have to collect and then use in the exploration phase.<br/><br/>In the exploration phase, players will take turns drawing cards from the exploration decks trying to get treasures, avoid the weather and defeat the pirates, while they are running out of supplies and the ship suffers damage that will have to be repaired if they do not want to sink. All this using their action points in the best possible way.<br/><br/>The objective is to find in the depths of each deck the three map fragments that will take them back home.<br/>You will win the game if you succeed, and if you have the required amount of treasure in your coffers. But if a crew member drowns, they run out of supplies, or the ship sinks, they will have failed, and their ship will be one more lost in the depths of the sea.<br/><br/>It will not be an easy task. Only cooperation, coordination and teamwork will bring you back.<br/><br/>Beware of Pirates!<br/><br/>The prototype of this game was awarded the &quot;Best New Latin Game&quot; award in the Quarantine Challenge 2020 organized by the game makers community in Mexico.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the early 19th century. The Industrial Revolution is underway, and the demand for cotton is soaring. As a British entrepreneur, you see an opportunity to profit from this booming market. You will send your ships all over the world in search of the best prices for cotton. Will you keep up with the expanding market and become the most successful merchant?<br/><br/>The game is played over 9 rounds in 3 stages. At the start of each round, players compare the wealth of their companies to determine turn order. Then, they rent ships, send ships to regions where cotton is harvested, buy cotton, and return to the United Kingdom to sell cotton at a profit. At the end of each round, players pay a ship maintenance cost and clear the board for the next round. Players can also benefit from transporting passengers and exporting small amounts of goods from the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>The game uses a deck of 24 ship cards with different properties, including maximum capacity. Cotton can be purchased from contract cards of different quantities and prices in four historical regions where cotton was harvested. Droughts and local wars can interrupt players' plans and, along with the order of cards being drawn from the decks, are the main random factor of the game.<br/><br/>Ships are rented when only limited information about cotton harvests is available, adding to the difficulty of managing trading companies. Players can sell shares of their company to obtain additional funding, but they are required to repurchase all of their assets at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are no victory points in this game. The player who owns the wealthiest company at the end wins.<br/><br/>Relative cotton prices and amounts of cotton harvested in different regions were based on real-world economic data. In order to simulate the exponential growth of the market, the game rescales itself between stages. This allows players to keep up with the cotton boom without having to handle large amounts of coins and tokens.<br/><br/>Advanced game rules introduce the possibility of buying other players' shares, among other options. This way, players can invest in and profit from their competitors' success.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players are expert naturalists whose mission is to discover a solution for each of the four environmental problems before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>On each turn, the active player can use up to four actions to travel from one point to another, mitigate environmental problems, discover a solution, or build control centers. A deck of cards will provide players with these abilities, but they will have to be careful with the catastrophe cards, which will accelerate and intensify environmental problems. A second deck of cards will control the inevitable expansion of environmental problems within the National Park.<br/><br/>Assuming a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to combine the strengths of their specialties to conquer the solution to environmental problems. But if one or more of those problems extends beyond the point of no return or if too much time passes, all players will lose.

The Khan of Clan Goliath Scorpion knew a simple punitive expedition would be a waste of resources. This would not be a war of reprisal. It would be an all-out crusade for control of Hansa territory. Superior Clan technology pitted against superior numbers of Hansa troops. In such a war, can there truly be a victor? Would two nations be shattered in the conflict, or would a single, new power rise from the ruins?<br/><br/>Operational Turning Points: Hanseatic Crusade opens up the battle for players to join in the fight using the successful Turning Points PDF-exclusive format. This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual Missions and Touchpoints, following a campaign arc, and inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF includes detailed information on several of the worlds affected by the Scorpion Empire assault, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, an overview of the historical campaign, and several tools and tracks that players can use to run characters and battles from this time period.

The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham.  1848LT is set in the western part of the US.<br/>Two to six players represent investors in railroad corporations, spending their initial capital to buy wholly-owned Private and Subsidiary Companies and shares in Public Corporations and the Credit Mobilier.<br/><br/>The Public Corporations, each controlled by the largest shareholder (its President), build track and run trains in order to earn revenues.  These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock. <br/>A key feature of 1848LT, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of the President and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent Corporation is the sole responsibility of its President.<br/><br/>&mdash; user description<br/><br/>",

As in any battle, strength in numbers always helps you come out on top. When attacking or defending from rivals, you get additional D20 roll or defense bonuses by positionally linking your characters together.<br/><br/>Securing the key to immortality first requires crafting it at the crafting table in the center of the battlefield using both the philosopher's stone and antimatter which are spawned throughout the game. The race is then on for a civilization to secure the key and activate it at the battlefield's exit point. The player that successfully activates the key at the exit point is the winner.

        "description": "Firebase Inferno is a 2 player wargame that takes around 1 hour to play, and is an area control, simultaneous card play, jungle combat wargame set in a near-future dystopian world.  Players control one of two factions (the Cyto-Command or the Shadow-Force) who they will use to traverse treacherous jungle terrain, collect strategic resources, and construct powerful upgrades to their base that will deliver devastating blows to their opponent.<br/><br/>At the center of the jungle is a key village location that starts the game in control of the Shadow-Force, and is used to obtain powerful advantages and fund a rebellion against the Cyto-Command.  During the game, players will fight for control of the village, along with the other 4 unique locations around the board.<br/>  <br/>Over the course of 6 rounds, players will simultaneously play commander cards from their hand to move units on and around the board, and engage their opponents in combat.  At the end of six rounds, players will total their victory points to determine a winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Establishing a portal to another world is a major milestone by any yardstick. The Constellars are often tasked with the conveyance of armies across realms during wars and this ability is crucial to their role.<br/><br/>Setting up and preparing for the ritual is the easy part, the real challenge comes in maintaining a delicate balance of the cosmic forces as one disrupts the fabric of space and time so that others may arrive at their intended destination safely.<br/><br/>TKG ARENA: A Rift of Portals is a game for 1 player.<br/><br/>Components required for this game:<br/><br/>WORLD TILES:    48<br/>OINKS:    15 from each element for each player (Default)<br/><br/>Winning Conditions<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to stabilize the portal once it is set up and this is represented by fulfilling a number of conditions.<br/><br/>1.    The number of Oinks in the Inner Gate must be equal or more than the Oinks placed in the Outer Void.<br/>2.    The number of elemental insignias placed on any linear sides of the Boundary must be equal.<br/>3.    The elemental insignias on each tile must be matched by a placed Oink representing the same element.<br/><br/>Ending Condition<br/><br/>The game ends when all tiles are played and all unmatched Oinks on any tile on the Boundary are moved to the Outer Void. The player loses when the winning conditions are not achieved when the game ends.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>A player starts the game by drawing randomly from a stack of world tiles to be placed in a 3 x 3 grid manner as below.<br/><br/>X        A    B    C        O<br/>        D    I    E        <br/>        F    G    H<br/><br/>1.    Shuffle the 48 world tiles into a stack. World tiles are referred to as tiles.<br/><br/>2.    Draw 3 tiles from the stack. From these 3 tiles, flip 1 over to the grid side to form the Outer Void (This is represented by the faced down tile O in the diagram), 1 to form the Inner Gate (This is represented by the faced down tile I in the diagram).<br/><br/>3.    Gain the Oinks matched by the elemental insignias of the last remaining tile and discard it, an area such as X can be designated for discarded tiles in the diagram.<br/><br/>All world tiles built are placed faced up with their elemental insignias visible. Tiles A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H surrounding tile I forms the Boundary. To fulfill winning condition 2,  the sum of the number of elemental insignias on the Tiles A, B, C; Tiles C,E, H; Tiles F,G, H and Tiles A, D, F are equal.<br/><br/>On each turn<br/><br/>Draw 3 tiles from the stack and the player must perform ONE of each of the following actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1.    Gain - Play a tile, gain the Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias and discard it. Put the Oinks gained in the Inner Gate.<br/><br/>2.    Build - Build a tile, if it is the first tile, place it adjacent to the Inner Gate, if it is not, it must be placed adjacent to another tile that has been built that bears at least one of its own elemental insignias. If the intended location is adjacent to two or more world tiles, then all adjacent world tiles must bear at least one matching elemental insignia between them.<br/><br/>If you are unable to or do not wish to build for any reason, gain the Oinks indicated on any one of the remaining tiles that has not been played and put them into the Outer Void. You can also replace any tile built with any tile in your hand but all Oinks placed on the built tile will be placed in the Outer Void.<br/><br/>3.    Move - Play a tile, you can move Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias of this tile from the Inner Gate to any built tile, or to move any Oink from a built tile to an adjacent built tile. If you are unable to or do not wish to move any of the Oinks indicated for any reason, gain the Oinks instead and put them into the Outer Void.<br/><br/>The player cannot skip any action and each action must be fulfilled in totality. E.g.  During a Move action, a tile with 3 Fire Insignias has been chosen but the player has only 1 Fire Oink in the Inner Gate. You may NOT move the existing 1 Fire Oink to any other tile, gain 2 Fire Oinks and then placed them in the Outer Void. 3 Fire Oinks should be gained and placed in the Outer Void.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>For each Oink placed in a tile that bears the same insignia, gain 1 Victory Point. The player with the most Victory Points wins the final victory if multiple players are competing. Ties are broken by the difference in Oinks between their Outer Void and Inner Gate. The player with the greater difference wins. If the differences are the same, the players shared a joint victory.<br/><br/>Variant<br/><br/>The game can be scaled up with a BOUNDARY with sides featuring more tiles. (E.g 4 or 5). The rest of the rules remain unchanged. In this case, players can choose to leave the space representing the Inner Gate empty instead of a faced down tile I. Players can choose to use other appropriate counters to represent Oinks during play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An expedition, composed of subjects of various backgrounds (there are distinguished Egyptologists, valiant officers of Her Majesty, archaeologists in search of notoriety with their daughters, treasures hunters of every ream etc., and their respective carriers), runs through the corridors and rooms of an ancient Egyptian Temple miraculously remained intact in the sands of the desert,  in search of treasures and precious finds. But there are those who make good guard. And, above all, the Eternal Sleep of the Queen's Spirit is very heavy, but not entirely bombproof.<br/><br/>Do Not Wake Up Netiqrys! is a three-dimensional tabletop game, which is played with miniatures and on a map containing three-dimensional elements. It is a quite traditional dungeon crawler, so your characters (miniatures) move on rooms and corridors in order to reach the Hall of the Sarcophagus of the Mummy and to collect treasures. What makes the game a bit particular is the random generation of the path and of the enemies every time the characters turn a corner or open a door.<br/><br/>The rules are very simple but immersive, in order to satisfy both old friends of colonial or exotic miniature games and casual players or children. A game can involve a number of players ranging from one to six.<br/><br/>To play DNWN! it is necessary to have about twenty miniatures, normally in 28 or 20mm, including the Mummy, some of her Followers, some &quot;Undead&quot;, as well as members of the archaeological expedition and their local carriers. You also need a 12-sided dice, a pair of 6-sided dice, some furniture to be disseminated on the path and a play area of about 90 cm - 36&quot; per side, which will represent the perimeter of the Temple, within which the path will have to wind.<br/><br/>Everything else you will need is present in this issue that, in addition to the rules of the game and two sides of very complete &ldquo;fast reference&rdquo; tables (to play you will only need those), provides you with the &quot;Character Cards&quot;, containing the characteristics of each of the protagonists, and also with the tiles for the construction of the path (including corridors, rooms, doors and so on) as you see it in the photos,  to print, paste and crop. In fact, DNWN! involves the random construction of the path during the game, an element that makes each match deeply different from any other and that allows the game to be particularly enjoyable even in &ldquo;solo mode&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Abominations loom several man heights over the head of even the tallest mortal. Their gore slicked limbs spider out from its bulbous, distended abdomen and thorax. They are instruments of pure mayhem on the battlefield, scuttling forwards and reaping a bloody toll with their scythe like appendages, leaving only bloody ruin behind them. Survivors speak of a keening whine, just on the verge of hearing that pervades their memories, a sound that registers deeper than the cries of their fallen comrades. This is the only sound an Abomination can make, the only sound it is allowed to make: a keening howl to convey the depth of their misery and torment.<br/><br/>Abominations were not originally intended to serve as organic war engines. They were an advanced and cruel form of punishment, devised on a whim by the Sovereign. Ensconced deep within an Abomination lies the body of an Exile who has betrayed his trust or breached the most sacrosanct of Spire laws. Despite significant effort, even the Sovereign's most ardent opponents have not been able to come up with a more cruel punishment and have adopted this cruel torture for their worst enemies.<br/><br/>Invasive cerebral procedures impairs the cognitive function of the condemned, as chemical and hormonal treatments are applied to make them lose control of their Life-Binding gifts and forcibly bond them to a lower organism. Multiple organisms were proposed and tried but the humble ant was ultimately preferred. While more gruesome examples could be made, it was found that those Abominations bonded to other species were too intractable or self-destructive. The ant's instinctive hierarchical physiology somehow makes it more susceptible to Pheromonic command, forcing the body to respond to orders while allowing compromised psyche trapped within the hellish amalgam only enough control to wail its anguish even while enacting the will of its tormentors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War II began when German tanks rolled across the border of Poland on September 1st, 1939. The Poles fought back courageously, blunting several attacks, but the force of numbers and superior weapons drove them back toward Warsaw. Once the Soviet Union launched its own treacherous attack, the Polish state was doomed.<br/><br/>The Deluge is a Panzer Grenadier expansion book focused on the battles of September 1939 between Poland's defenders and the German and Soviet invaders. There are 40 new scenarios featuring battles of cavalry against cavalry, a couple of tank battles, and best of all World War Two&rsquo;s only fight between opposing armored trains. Plus of course background articles on the armies and weapons involved.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need Fire in the Steppe and 1940: The Fall of France to play all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The statues must convey this weakness to the Hero, before Medusa identifies it first.<br/><br/>The Statues know what the Medusa's vulnerability is, and they choose to freeze in poses in order to suggest what it is. The hero must try and work out what this is and declare it before the Medusa does. If so, the Hero and Statues win. But if the Medusa has also worked it out, the Hero and Statues lose.<br/><br/>Medusa's weakness could be a variety of things, and a deck of cards suggests the types of things it could be. For example, it might be 'a certain dish', 'a creature', 'a character', 'a certain occupation', 'a certain color'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not just another pirate game, &quot;Blue Coats - Black Flags&quot; is a historical deck-building board game that has 4 unique factions (2 more added in the upcoming &quot;Yankees and Frogs&quot; expansion).<br/><br/>The British faction is based on the historically proud navy of the British empire.  Its crews and fighting prowess is unmatched in the game.  When the British tasked its navy to get something done in the late 1700s and early 1800s, there was none better than the blue coats of Britain.<br/><br/>The Spanish faction is past its prime, but still has plenty of teeth to compete with the British. However, its main focus is to get treasure ships back to Spain while avoiding pirates and other navies who also have a hunger for gold.<br/><br/>The pirate faction is a disjointed conglomeration of characters like Blackbeard, Jack Rackham, Mary Read, Black Bart Roberts, and others, each trying to capture victory points by looting, pillaging, or capturing prize ships.  If they can pull together and establish a Pirate Republic and add a little whimsy, the black flags of the pirate faction may even have enough swagger to take on the navy factions in the game.<br/><br/>The merchant faction produces exports and seeks to get them back to Europe.  They establish plantations, produce crops and get them to port, then ship them off for export.  Of course, with pirates lurking everywhere and navy captains stopping your ships for inspection, it'll take everything the faction has to produce enough VP for a win.<br/><br/>So, pick your side and customize your deck (or play with the suggested decks) to give yourself the best chance to win.<br/><br/>The game is packed with historically accurate people and ships of the Age of Sail and Age of Piracy.  They made history.  Can you rewrite it?<br/><br/><br/>    Note: 2 more factions have been added in preparation for our Kickstarter event in late summer of 2023.  The &quot;Yankees and Frogs&quot; expansion adds the American and French factions to the game for even more historical shenanigans and cooperation.  <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Asteroid Field X, you play as one of four factions mining an inhospitable asteroid belt.  The object of the game is to build and upgrade mining infrastructure to both keep your colony alive and protected and to mine and sell as much precious ore as possible.  The faction that accumulates the most Creschins (money) from their sales will win the game.  However, there is an &ldquo;X-factor&rdquo; in play: buried somewhere in the uncharted regions of this asteroid field is a mysterious alien artifact that emits terrifying forms of energy.  It is of great value in this hyper-capitalist world, and of equally great danger.  If you unearth it and manage to transport it back to your base dome, you can sell it to the ore transport ships for an enormous profit.  But given the difficulty of handling it, someone else might steal it before you can accomplish this!<br/><br/>Asteroid Field X is a limited edition game by Zach Horton.  It is based upon a prototype he designed in 1992.  It functions as a prequel to Supernova, an origin story about a civilization&rsquo;s extractavist excesses, when mining colonies supplied the raw materials to fuel a powerful but fragile empire&mdash;before Object X caused their home star to become unstable, leading to the desperate conditions of Supernova.<br/><br/>Players build and upgrade mining infrastructure in order to extract base metals (not very valuable, but needed to manufacture equipment), premium metals (the chief export of the mining colony, but also used to manufacture some items), and volatile compounds (substances needed to maintain your colony such as water and minerals).  Beyond strategizing between the payoffs of these substances, you need to maintain transportation networks to return your ore safely to your base dome.  You may build various other units to be used for sabotage, protection, or direct attacks.  Asteroid Field X makes extensive use of hidden movement, and ships can be equipped with cloaking devices to render their locations invisible to other players.  Many cargo cards offer special capabilities to players who develop and play them.  Some of these are played covertly and revealed anonymously, to often unpredictable results.  Combined, these mechanisms allow players to pursue secret campaigns of sabotage, openly hostile actions, and peaceful diplomacy, often all at once!<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turn, each round ends with a &ldquo;diplomatic phase&rdquo; in which players simultaneously manufacture new units, deploy covert cards that will be revealed in the next round, and decide how much ore to sell to the waiting merchant ships.  The base prices of metal ore fluctuate during the game, as they are tied to a semi-randomized timeline of market cards.  The final price that each player receives for their ore, however, is determined by how much total ore is dumped on the market that round by all players.  Thus betting and bluffing play a significant role, as players attempt to manipulate the market to favor their own interests. After 12 rounds (each represented by a Market card), the game ends, with the player who has received the most money declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Both of Robert&rsquo;s brothers, Stannis and Renly, have each decided it is their turn to rule. This has torn House Baratheon in two as half has thrown in with Stannis while the other half backs Renly. With House Baratheon&rsquo;s great resources, each still has a chance to be the next to rule from King&rsquo;s Landing.<br/><br/>The Baratheon Attachments #1 box set for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon players a host of new options when they&rsquo;re building their armies, whether it&rsquo;s for Stannis or Renly. Some of the Unit Attachments will work for both brothers, while others can only be added to particular forces. Either way, these new options will bolster House Baratheon&rsquo;s already well-equipped troops, making their armor tougher, their speed faster, or letting them last even longer on the battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Reapers wade into battle with their scythes, dealing massive amounts of damage as they go. But as they reap, so too do they sew. Sew chaos among the enemy ranks, anyway. Foes do not like standing against these gruesome soldiers.

        "description": "Devil's Choice is a fast-paced shedding card game which challenges players to be first to play out their hands of number cards in sequences called queues. One queue is open to begin the game, others open randomly and as many as 4 can be open at once.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 8-10 number cards and a devil card which they can use to create havoc by stealing a card from another player or by blocking an open queue. Any player who doesn't have a number card to play in a sequence during their turn must lay down their cards for all to see and draw at least one card from the bank. That's when the skullduggery and the scheming begins.<br/><br/>Any player who plays a rare red number card into a queue earns a blind draw from a treasure trove of wild cards, devil cards and Q-cards which they can use to open new queues. First out wins and cards held by losing players count against them.<br/><br/>One more thing. In poker a player with a bad hand can fold. In Devil's Choice a player dealt a poor hand is the underdog who can earn double points for winning. With much to gain and little to lose the pesky underdog can take risks and torment fellow players. The game has provisions for partnership play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players bid using cards from their hand, playing a number of cards equal to the lot, alternating, one card at a time&ndash;where a diamond=0, spades=1, hearts=2 and clubs=3.

        "description": "Subsistence is a compact resource management game that imagines the world behind the standing stones of Neolithic Britain.<br/><br/>Over nine turns, players select idol cards to gain benefits from. These benefits will be additional cards to add to their tableau, or development tokens to place on their land cards- which may trigger additional benefits. After these nine turns, the game ends. Points are scored based on their idols' unique criteria and the placement of their developments. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Subsistence plays quickly but offers a growing depth of strategic decision-making. It will appeal to players who enjoy careful planning and progression rather than direct conflict.<br/><br/>",

This card determines the capacity of each area for placing meeples, based on the number of players and shows the events of the beginning of the year and the end of the year, based on the rainfall amount. <br/>Each game may be played in several years so be prepared for any upcoming events!<br/><br/>Blue meeples can only be placed in Planting and Floriculture areas and the Green ones can only be placed in Extracting and Technology Areas. Pink meeples are the most valuable meeples; You can place them in any area (even ignoring that area&rsquo;s capacity) and use them to obtain Event cards so take care of them!<br/><br/>After all players placed their meeples on the board, you should do the actions of the different areas by removing the meeples from the board and placing them in Resting Space.<br/><br/>Expand your farm and obtain the needed resources (Water, Light and Fertilizer) to have the best harvest. The Lands with special powers need more resources but help your achieve the products sooner.<br/><br/>Cultivate Saplings and harvest your lands and produce the best Damask-Rose products. You can develop your technology and gain new facilities, paying its price!<br/><br/>After all actions were resolved, take the meeples from the Resting Area as you wish and depending on your strategy, in clockwise order, starting with the First Player. Your choices would affect the others&rsquo; play!<br/><br/>As a beginner, you can play Varda without the Event cards which give you combinatory actions and special abilities and add them to the game only when you got enough experiences!<br/><br/>The winner is the player who can produce the best and more precious Golab and Essences before the rivals, develop their technology more than the rivals and reach their goals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "デキタ! (DEKITA!) is a tile game from Japan. The theme is apprentice wizards learning how to form spells. But the gameplay is more abstract and somewhat language free.<br/><br/>The 'spells' are formed by placing tiles to construct shapes. Each tiles has four triangles, which match to neighbouring tiles to make squares. The triangles are coloured red, green and blue, or rainbow as jokers. Coloured sides must match up.<br/><br/>The spells are shown on theme cards, and have simple patterns of squares, such as an L shape, or a V shape. When a player has built a pattern of squares that match the shape and colour of a them card they hold, they can reveal the card as a competed spell. The first player to get to three completed spells wins the game.<br/><br/>A player can swap theme cards in hand for a public pool, or draw from the deck.<br/><br/>Players also have item cards, which allow the tiles to be changed. So a quill lets a player rotate a tile. A pocket lens lets a play change a square's colour. By careful use or tiles and items, a player can complete their spells faster.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 2017, and a second edition was published in 2018 with revised card design.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

These rules are compatible with the modern game setting and both the core Rulebook and Seasons Supplements. Keep an eye out for new miniatures available via Temple of the West.<br/><br/>BRUTL! Tank Arena<br/>Standalone Game<br/>BRUTL! Tank Arena is a beer and pretzels style game of insanely fun tank battles. Your humble author wanted a ruleset to use all those cool tanks he had lying around, but something simple and required minimal effort.  With only a bit of terrain and a single tank per player, BRUTL! Is both easy to start and plays quick, getting to the best parts of miniature wargaming, blowing up your opponent.<br/><br/>Sludge Nations<br/>Expansion for Sludge War, core rules available in BLASTER: Games Anthology 03.<br/>The world of sludge is vast and each player&rsquo;s interpretation of the setting is a valid iteration in the decaying multiverse. The Nation Factions described here will represent both existing nations and archetypes found across the dying world. For what it&rsquo;s worth, these factions are primarily focused on the western branchways inhabited by mankind and don&rsquo;t represent the full breadth of the sludge world.<br/><br/>Gaslands: Legacy (Part II)<br/>Official Campaign Expansion for Gaslands: Refuelled, part I available in BLASTER: Games Anthology 03.<br/>Earth gets an eviction notice from Mars, and becomes dismantled and reassembled into a progressively more chaotic post-post-apocalyptic world. Randomly generate an illegal build and get out of the factory fast before you become dismantled yourself. Unique LEGACY Gaslands rules, and the remaining narrative scenarios. (The first five scenarios in the story are b in Vol. 3, but you don't need them to play these four, as the Legacy Rules are recapped in Vol.4.)<br/><br/>Deathship One<br/>Solo/Co-op Standalone Game<br/>Deathship One is a solo or co-operative miniatures game in which the player controls a small squad of warriors attempting to fight their way through an alien death trap. It&rsquo;s designed to be fast and fun and to use a minimum of miniatures and terrain. It&rsquo;s also designed to be limited. The whole game consists of 5 scenarios or &lsquo;rooms&rsquo;. The order of those rooms can change from game-to-game, but you always play all five, assuming you live that long<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The cards are arranged in the following order: adjective, noun, verb, noun, adverb. On the first card, more are placed, changing the sentence. The meaning of the sentence does not matter, what counts is the markings (numbers) on the cards. The resulting sentences are fun, but just an extra dose. Some cards also have additional functions that make the game easier for their owner or make it difficult for opponents. When someone dominates the sentence with his sign, he wins and the game is over.<br/><br/>",

Fatal Knockout comes with six fighters with completely unique decks. Player's play cards which allow them to move, change orientation, and attack on the board. On top of that, each fighter has one-of-a-kind abilities that are triggered by playing cards.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they draw to their hand up to three cards. The leader of the round places one card face down, the second player follows. At this point the leader can choose to play another card, or reveal. This continues until either the leader reveals all cards or players run out of cards.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will be dealing damage to each other with fighter specific cards. The game ends when there is only one fighter left standing, the player left standing is the winner.<br/><br/>Fatal Knockout can be played with just two players, but can also be played in a tournament style where players advance through brackets with the aim of being crowned the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Post Mortem LA: Death in La La Land is a narrative mystery game inspired by the game Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.<br/><br/>Set in 1940&rsquo;s Los Angeles, you will take on the role of probationary cautionary auxiliary investigator at the Global Detective Agency and assist them on the case. All the files you need will be sent to your door, including a map of your jurisdiction and pertinent evidence. It will be yours to investigate, follow leads, interrogate suspects, study the clues, and solve the murder. Once you think you have the answers, you can write them on the Final Report included in the box, then break the seal to read the resolution and find out if you were successful in your investigation.<br/><br/>This case centers around the unveiling of a new rollercoaster in La-La Land that goes tragically wrong when mayoral candidate Bradley Rideout flies right out of his seat and into Pirate Poppy&rsquo;s Popcorn Stand. Is this a tragic fairground mishap or carefully planned foul play? It is up to you to figure out who is behind it is all - before you yourself become La-La Land&rsquo;s next high-flying victim.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Chinese climbing game for five players is said to have originated in Shandong province, and in the early 21st century it has become popular across a wide area of northern China and online. Băo hu&aacute;ng (保皇) means 'protect the emperor', and the game is also often known as d&igrave;w&aacute;ng (帝王) meaning 'emperor'. In each deal two players, the emperor and his protector the eunuch (xiao baozi: 小孢子), play against a team of three, the farmers or people (ping min: 平民). The emperor and the eunuch are the holders of particular cards. While the emperor is known from the start, his protector remains hidden until the card is played.<br/><br/>As in all climbing games the object is to get rid of one's cards (and help one's partners to do so) by playing them singly or in combinations, where each play must beat the previous play.<br/><br/>There are five players and a pack of 168 cards is used. This can be constructed from four standard 52-card packs from which the 3's, 4's and 5's are removed plus four red jokers and four black jokers. Suits are irrelevant in this game, and the cards rank from high to low:<br/><br/>Red joker, Black joker, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.<br/><br/>One red joker and one black joker are marked on the front, and the holders of these two cards will be the emperor and the eunuch respectively. Although standard Anglo-American cards can be used, the game is sufficiently popular that special 168-card packs can be obtained for this game with the emperor and eunuch cards ready printed.<br/><br/>",

We must succeed or die.&rdquo; &ndash;General Israel Tal&rsquo;s admonition to his officers before crossing the boundary into the Sinai.<br/><br/>Succeed or Die is a low complexity Operational level wargame simulation of the battles of Rafah and El Arish, fought in the Sinai between the Egyptian Palestinian forces and elements of General Israel Tal&rsquo;s and Avraham Yoffi&rsquo;s armored Ugdahs (divisions) during the Six Day War.  General Tal&rsquo;s Ugdah was tasked with attacking the dug in Palestinian 7th Infantry Division in and around Rafah to secure the crucial road intersection near the Sinai/Israel border. Once secured, General Yoffi&rsquo;s Ugdah would become the breakthrough force that would then drive deep into the Sinai to either take the Mitla Pass if General Sharon&rsquo;s Ugdah was unable to defeat the Egyptians at Abu Ageila, or El Arish. General Tal would support General Yoffi by preventing any enemy attacks out of Gaza as well as taking El Arish if General Yoffi&rsquo;s goal became the Mitla Pass. The Egyptian&rsquo;s had powerful forces in the area, including their 4th Armored Division and a combined arms formation that combined outnumbered the attacking Israeli formations. The Israeli&rsquo;s enjoyed total air supremacy, but numbers were against them, and it would take all of the skill, daring and luck they could muster if the Israeli&rsquo;s were to succeed.<br/><br/>Players are cast in the roles of the local commanders on this battlefield.  Both will be challenged to do as well, or better than their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Each hex is about a quarter of a mile across.  A turn represents four hours of time.

All monsters and tactical cards (neutralizers) have unique powers from the other cycles. This third set adds a neutral area called the Dead Zone, which represents a parallel dimension, dream realm, or comatose hallucination. The Dreamstalker can trigger a card in the dead zone, the chainsaw-wielding Butcher or the machete-wielding Slasher can send monsters there, and Reanimation Serum can bring back a monster.<br/><br/>Each monster has an ability such as triggering the top card of your discard pile. You don't play cards from your hand; you take cards from a 4-card pool and trigger the card as you take it. At the end of the game players discard down to their best 2 cards. Then, tactical cards (neutralizers) destroy their corresponding monsters, and the player with the best surviving combination of cards wins.<br/><br/>Draw a card from the Pool, say its name and number aloud, and trigger/resolve its primary ability. (If another card gets triggered, reveal it and resolve it.) Fill the Pool back to 4 from the face-down deck. At the end of your turn, if you exceed your hand limit (3 cards), discard excess cards face-down to your discard pile. When the draw deck is empty, continue taking turns until everyone has had an equal number. Then Resolution begins.<br/><br/>RESOLUTION (combine / score your 2 cards)<br/>All players discard down to just 2 cards. In turn order, each player dramatically reveals their highest-number card. Then they reveal their other card. Resolve all Neutralizers. The player with the highest total score wins the game.

        "description": "Petrify is a finite territory game for two players: Blue and Orange. It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square grid (board). The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.<br/><br/>Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a disk along with all other like-colored disks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent disks of its color.<br/><br/>Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.<br/><br/>The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.<br/><br/>A mound is a set of four blocks occupying a 2x2 area of the board.<br/><br/>A barricade is a set of three adjoining blocks in a straight diagonal line.<br/><br/>Mounds and barricades are illegal formations. For the purpose of spotting them, the edges of the board count as lines of blocks. In other words, the real board is considered to be the middle section of an imaginary board with sides two squares longer, and all edge squares on this larger board are considered to be occupied by blocks.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:<br/><br/><br/>     Place a disk of your color on an empty square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Move a disk of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy disks, to a square occupied by an enemy disk. Then, remove this enemy disk and place a block on the square from which you just moved your disk, without forming a mound or a barricade. Note a disk can jump over friendly disks.<br/><br/><br/>If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.<br/><br/>The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Orange will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Blue instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

Plans don't usually survive contact with the enemy, and a number of mishap tables help to create a narrative experience that goes beyond your average &quot;move and shoot&quot; wargame.<br/><br/>Boocoo Fire Mission is aimed at 6mm or 15mm miniatures, and can be played on a 4' x 4' or 6' x 4' table.<br/><br/>This game is company scaled, and the smallest maneuver unit is the squad, with players generally controlling 2 - 4 platoons, each with a number of squads and an HQ. Players will direct their forces on the ground, as well as coordinating support such as air strikes, artillery, and taking advantage of special assets such as VC spider holes or booby traps, or the NVA's stubborn resistance and uncanny ability to recover casualties, preventing US a body count...<br/><br/>Rules are provided for infantry, from the lowest quality ARVN troops, to the most elite ANZAC SAS and US Recon squads, and their various weapon attachments such as RPGs, LMGs, Recoilless rifles, and mortars, as well as helicopters such as the UH-1, AH-1 Cobra, OH-6 Loach and CH-47 Chinook. Vehicles such as the M113, M48 Patton, M551 Sheridan, various marine &quot;amtracs&quot;, the M42 Duster, and M50 Ontos are also covered.<br/><br/>Boocoo Fire Mission is has a descending level of detail, with infantry as the most detailed unit in the game, followed by helicopters, and finally vehicles. Infantry can hide, dig in, crawl to avoid opportunity fire, and conduct suppression. Helicopters have detailed damage tables to provide for many interesting results from fire, and can drop off and pick up infantry on the table. Vehicles can disembark their crew, leaving sentries behind to man a single weapon, and can also transport infantry.<br/><br/>Army lists are provided for ANZACs, ARVN, US army, Armored Cavalry, Mechanized companies, and US marines. VC and NVA are of course included, and some factions are split into different time periods depending on if their equipment evolved over the course of the war. Boocoo Fire Mission covers the entire Vietnam War, from early ARVN vs VC skirmishes in the early 1960s, through to 1975. Specific city fight lists are also included for both the Allied and Communist forces, to allow players to play battles such as those in Hue or Saigon.<br/><br/>The game provides printable markers, and a printer-friendly version of the rules is also provided.

        "description": "Zombomination is an intense, post-apocalyptic, real-time or turn-based dice-rolling game that pits hardened Humans vs hungry Zombies. Asymmetrical roll options create  intense action and unique strategies for each end-of-the-world faction. Zombies and Humans also have multiple, and different, winning conditions to make each game an exciting experience that feels new. Do you have what it takes to win?<br/><br/>Humans attempt to destroy the laboratory or find enough supplies to win. Zombies either attempt to kill all humans or overwhelm the safehouse to win. Depending on preference, players can engage in hectic real-time action or more strategic turn-based action. Both zombies and Humans take actions when 7's or doubles show on two rolled D6. Most real-time games play in less than 5 minutes. Turn-based games take about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The remaining cards not dealt are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile.<br/><br/>How to play<br/>1) The person to the left of the dealer starts play. Players take turn in clockwise direction.<br/>2) You choose a card from your hand and play it faceup on the table.<br/>3) You calculate the sum (or difference) shown on the card and go that many spaces forward.<br/>4) If you land on a space with a gem, you take the gem, and replenish the space with a new gem.<br/>5) If you land on a &quot;miss a turn&quot; space, you will be skipped on your next turn.<br/>6) If you land on a &quot;chest symbol&quot; space, take a chest card and follow the instruction on the card.<br/>7) Keep playing and go around the board until a player collects 5 gems.<br/>8) When you have played all of your cards in your hand, you draw 5 new cards from the draw pile.<br/>9) If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and use it as the new draw pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It all started in a chance encounter with old Captain Sargasso. He was going down the street alone, lurching to port and starboard and bumping into everything that got in his way. When he crossed paths with me, he took my arm tightly and showed me a worn and half-torn map, with drawings and nonsensical phrases that filled each sheet.<br/><br/>Then, out of the blue, he burst out laughing, left me the map and said goodbye shouting into the wind: &quot;And that's how I ended up with a sardine on my head!&quot; Since then I have had time to look at that old nautical chart many times, and I have always been curious to know what they meant, and what meaning those phrases and drawings had and, of course, what relationship they had with a sardine on the head of a man.<br/><br/>Maybe you are able to make sense of this story... Or not.<br/><br/>In addition to this witty story, the game brings a series of images and texts that will make sense when you put your imagination to work. There is only one question: What is a man doing with a sardine on his head? but countless possible answers. From the cards and their combination, you will be able to create a new story every time. Perhaps it will be a long story; maybe small or even a single scene. But you will take the helm, in the way you want on each occasion.<br/><br/>The proposal of this game arose as a search. The original idea was to make a book album as open as possible: that each person, when reading it, would create their own meanings, make their own plot. This is how this book-game was born that proposes you to establish the reading rules, play with visual and written language to shape the narrative, create connections that only you will know and enjoy a different way of reading.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The American victory at Saratoga in 1777 and their Treaty with France in 1778 transformed the war in America. The potential influx of fresh French troops to swell the ranks of General Washington&rsquo;s Army drove the British to rethink their colonial strategy. As a result the British moved their efforts from the middle colonies to the southern colonies where it was believed sentiment for the crown&rsquo;s cause ran strong. Having secured Savannah in 1779 the British turned their eyes on Charleston and South Carolina. When the British crossed the Savannah River South Carolina became the focal point of the revolution.<br/><br/>The years, 1780-1781, in South Carolina saw some of the most intense fighting that occurred in the revolution as both Loyalists and Patriots both rose up in numbers to fight for or against the crown. The struggle for independence during those two years saw over 200+ actions, skirmishes, and battles fought in South Carolina resulting in the names of Marion, Morgan, and Tarleton and places such as Kings Mountain and Cowpens entering American lore.<br/><br/>Crown and Crescent models the two years of intense, fierce fighting in South Carolina adopting and modifying the unique and innovative command and control mechanics created by the Ragnar Brothers for ANGOLA!  These mechanics keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution as you guide your forces towards independence or crushing the revolting colonists. The map is divided into seven districts, encompassing 6 to 7 key locations each, used to show control of the district. Control enough key locations and you&rsquo;ll then control the district and therefore advance on the victory point track towards winning the game.<br/><br/>The counters represent military units and auxiliaries such as artillery, rifled and light troops, grenadiers, dragoons, and cavalry. A unique command and activation system has players planning in secret the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is a tense game, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.<br/><br/>Crown and Crescent can be played with between two to four players (Continental and Whigs vs British and Tories).<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>        One 22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; full-color map<br/>        Two full sheets of counters (352 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>        One full color rule book<br/>        One deck of 55 cards<br/>        4 player aid cards<br/>        20 dice<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Espers made manifest only through esoteric quiet whispers shared amongst the elite.<br/><br/>Such coveted creatures are called upon for far more than combat. Yet, their true names and seals are clutched closely to the hearts of those who covet them most. Jealousy worms its way into the heart, and rots at the very soul of those who know these secret combinations.<br/><br/>Those lucky few able to overhear their betters slip such forbidden knowledge during inebriated tales of past forays find themselves more than excited to let their soul wear away at the chance to even behold such monstrosities.<br/><br/>Just like our Cross Promotion Pack, our Resin Lupercalia Kits from last year are now available in plastic. The Lupercalia 2021 Pack includes a plastic set of all seven of the miniatures we made in Resin from our last Kickstarter. This also includes their Item Cards, Combatant Cards, and Adventurer Cards.<br/><br/>Profane Occultists Made Immortal<br/><br/>&ldquo;Toxie scrubbed the blood from her hands, noting idly that she had nailed the color when choosing her crimson fingernail polish. In the far corner of the abandoned warehouse, a half dozen corpses, all still bound hand and foot, lay in a heap as testament to her night&rsquo;s labors. Her final victim lay sprawled on the concrete floor behind her, still breathing shallowly through his broken, twisted mouth. She hadn&rsquo;t actually been planning to pull out his teeth when she started questioning him, but then Luperci and Tixie had radioed in that they cleared the enemy&rsquo;s hideout, and that Mena was one of the captives they had freed. Threatening the Faun was one thing; dragging an innocent child into it was something else altogether.<br/><br/>Toxie dried her hands gingerly, then turned around to consider her captive. He was definitely dying; even if someone found him now, there weren&rsquo;t enough surgeons or drugs on Earth to save him. But Toxie had to meet up with her pack to run down the last of the heathens who had escaped with the Faun, and she didn&rsquo;t like leaving jobs unfinished.<br/><br/>She hunkered down next to him and saw with satisfaction that his eyes were still open, though only just through the swollen wreckage of his face. She blew him a kiss.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You get a little mercy now,&rdquo; she crooned as she gently stroked a blood-free patch of skin on his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late for an orgy, so I can&rsquo;t really wait around for you to die. You know how it is. . .&rdquo; <br/>She turned to her gear bag and considered her options. She wanted to use her favorite, but, of course, it had to be the messiest of the lot and she had just finished cleaning up. Eh, what the hell, she thought. Grinning, Toxie grabbed the pink handle and turned back to finish the job.<br/><br/>Outside the warehouse, an early morning train rumbled past, just loud enough to mask the roar of a chainsaw.&rdquo;<br/><br/>This product contains 7 miniatures, Adventurers, Espers, and new Items.<br/><br/>These new Espers spice your game with unknown variety by adding new Espers that can be summoned by both Adventurers<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s aim is to fill a gap in the genre to provide 2-player experience of the same feel and depth as found in traditional games, yet with its own personality and strategies. Like all tarock, Esculenta is distinguished by a super-long trump suit with the other cards being where one score most of the points: in this case half the deck, 20 cards, are trump! Players bid to win the most card points but often gain even more points from declaring to achieve certain bonus feats in tricks, such as taking the last trick with the lowest trump. <br/>In addition to the fact it&rsquo;s played with a regular deck, distinctions include declarer going against a defender who plays two cards to the three card trick with the help of a mini-dummy, and an idiosyncratic trick-playing order. The dummy is played by defender (so it's 2:1) but this is offset by the fact the declarer can often maintain the lead by forcing dummy to win.<br/><br/>Esculenta is part of the &quot;Twisted Dummy&quot; series: 2 player adaptations of traditional games using dummy third hand used in innovative ways.<br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It features intriguing game mechanics, ever changing scenarios, a detailed Rulebook and tables. Plus, it's endless and ever changing!<br/><br/>The game starts soon after the Chief Inspector ends writing the premises of the case on the Case File by rolling dice several times and writing down the results took from the rulebook's tables.<br/><br/>At this point, all the players try to solve the case, building up a story which should include and bring to light all the elements, especially the missing ones, of the crimes scene, getting to a final solution, in order to close the case.<br/><br/>Detectives discuss their ideas and perceptions of the crime scene in its whole and try to figure out a possible solution, finding a meeting point that could explain the murder.<br/><br/>Investigation can vary in duration, based on the ability of the detectives to deal with the fundamental six questions every detective is asked to answer to close any case: How? What? When? Where? Why? Who?<br/><br/>While the investigation goes on, detectives should try to enrich their reconstruction of the case with more and more detailed elements.<br/><br/>Discussion and interpretation are fundamental, during this part of the game. Only with discussion, deduction and compromises they'll be able to meet a point where everyone is satisfied with the story.<br/><br/>When all involved players are pleased with the reconstruction they inform the Chief Inspector which writes down the story, closing the investigation, solving the case and, ultimately, ending the game.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that if players can&lsquo;t build up a story encasing all the elements of the crimes scene and get to a final solution, they can agree to archive the case. In this case players might want to try and solve the case another time, considering it a cold case.<br/><br/>To play this game no investigation knowledge or improvisation skills are necessary. Players debate the case, evidences and dice results by combining all the elements to create the most convincing and entertaining solution for the case.<br/><br/>Also, the crime scene is the main attraction of microCrime and the game gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in it. After players select an area to play in (it might be the bedroom, the kitchen or any other space they want, like the courtyard, the garage or anything else) they can consider that space like a real crime scene by exploring it and simply by walking and looking around.<br/><br/>Moving through the crime scene and looking carefully at its peculiarities could prove to be really useful and interesting.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is played with miniatures or counters on a table top or board consisting of squares to regulate movement and distances and to speed up play by avoiding interaction and measurement issues. The system places less emphasis on weapons and more on training, quality and morale. Several historical battle scenarios are provided but, as usual in table top gaming players can also select their own armies and play 'random' battles such as Sumerian v 100 Years War French. The game is intended for experienced players and assumes that they know how to collect, paint and base figures and provide their own playing equipment such as dice, terrain and so on.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Select one of five thematic and asymmetric factions consisting of multiple tiered units including: common, elite, specialist, general, and a mighty avatar unit class. Throughout the game, players will destroy each others&rsquo; units and accumulate their &ldquo;essence&rdquo; as well as fight over control points, known as Essence Wells. Harnessed essence is used to activate unique, faction-specific abilities. <br/>With enough essence, your god will be able to manifest in the physical realm in the form of a massive avatar. Empowered avatars gain access to once-per-game Act of God abilities to swing the tide of battle in your favor. If you destroy the enemy&rsquo;s avatar, you are victorious!<br/><br/>Gameplay is turn-based and consists of several phases. First, each player rolls an Essence Storm die to determine which way the Essence Storm will blow and which variable effect it will take on during that game round. Next, player one will take their turn. During a player turn consists of two phases, the movement phase and the activation phase. The movement phase allows your entire army to move up to their maximum speed stat. The activation phase allows up to two units to attack and use the active special abilities of those units. Thus, interesting situations arise where some units get into position for future turns, contest Essence Wells from opponents, or keep your options open on the fly.<br/><br/>However, because only two of your units can attack each turn, you must carefully plan not only your current turn, but think about how future turns might play out. Players roll unique-faced dice to simplify gameplay and avoid having to memorize combat tables. Additionally, most powerful units have access to faction-specific Divine Dice, providing a boost to damage, defense or annoying tricks. Additionally, players have the option to complete their turn phases in either order they wish, opening up further tactical options as needed! After players have taken their turns, a new game round begins, repeating this process until one side defeats the enemy avatar!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Unlike in our timeline, the fighting continues as German resistance fighters engage in a prolonged guerrilla war. With the Manhattan Project still incomplete, Japan fighting on and the Allied invasion of Europe losing millions of men, the Allies are war-weary and there is pressure to bring the troops home. While the Wehrmacht was defeated, the Nazi leadership has spent 1943 onwards building up a huge secret guerrilla force &ndash; Werwolf - to turn the occupation of Germany into a costly quagmire. Other groups, calling themselves the Edelweiss Movement, are opposed to the Nazis but also to the invaders and will fight to restore an independent and patriotic Germany. The Fuhrer himself has gone missing, and many Nazi officials are in hiding, perhaps awaiting their chance to return to power.<br/>Four factions are now competing for control and the loyalty of the German population: the Allied Occupation Forces (Western Allied Troops and German police, referred to as Allies in the rules) the Soviet Union (the Red Army and NKVD, referred to as Soviets in the rules), the Edelweiss Movement (patriotic but anti-Nazi German resistance, referred to as Edelweiss in the rules) and the Werwolf organisation (former SS and other Nazi fanatics trained in guerrilla warfare, referred to as Werwolf in the rules). The struggle will be not only for military control and the hearts and minds of the German people but also over the remnants of the Nazi war machine and research programs. The Soviets and Allies may reluctantly co-operate to crush German guerrillas but will compete to secure top German scientists and prototypes for their own arms race. As the Allies try to de-Nazify the populace and entice them with American pop culture, the Soviets will use everything from indoctrination to mass deportation to keep Germany under control. Loyalties will be split between democracy, communism and resurgent fascism or nationalism. This will not be an easy occupation&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game was created by the owner of Maison du Billard in France, Philipe Rog&eacute;, and won the Concours Lepine Gold Medal in 2009.<br/><br/>Each player has 4 coloured discs that are positioned on the circles marked on the playing surface. The player who starts is drawn at random, and play goes clockwise.<br/><br/>When a player shoots an opposing disc into the black hole in the middle of the board, he can play again. If his disc enters the hole at the same time as an opposing pawn, he passes the turn to the next player. Direct or indirect shots are allowed.<br/><br/>1) If a player shoots one of his discs out of the playing field, it will be lost and taken out of play. If it is an opposing disc, it will be placed on the circle closest to where it went off the board.<br/><br/>2) If a player by mistake plays (touches or shoots with) an opposing disc, his disc furthest from the hole will be taken out of play.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE GAME ENDINGS:<br/><br/>The last player who has one or more discs left on the playing surface is the winner. If there is only one disc left for each of the last two players and one of them pockets both of them at the same time, the game is drawn and must be replayed. There are no winners or losers.<br/><br/>As soon as a player no longer has a disc on the playing surface, the game is over, and the 1 point per disc is scored for the other players. The first player who reaches 5 points wins the game. It takes 2 points difference to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

The climactic clash of the Hundred Days campaign wrought the end of around twenty years of continuous warfare on the continent, and with it an end to the reign of Napoleon. The Battle of Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in all military history, provides more than a fitting subject for our second foray into the 'Epic' scale of wargaming. Black Powder Epic Battles: Waterloo is here.<br/><br/>Wellington's British Army starter set provides a solid core of a British army serving in the Hundred Days campaign - 10 units of line infantry, 3 units of 95th Rifles, units of each type of heavy cavalry (Heavy Dragoons, Scots Greys and Household Cavalry) and light cavalry (Hussars and Light Dragoons), ably supported by 16 pieces of artillery and brigade commanders. Also included is an MDF building of La Belle Alliance Inn and a bespoke A5 softback rulebook with Napoleonic specific content.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On the iceberg is 30 faced down nuggets to be mined. Each player have 4 plastic penguins as the maximum number of workers per round. Other components are action cards, contract cards, precious metal nuggets and resources.<br/><br/>At the start of every round, players take turns to place their available workers (penguins) to either harvest resources or mine nuggets on the iceberg through worker-placement. Once enough penguins(as indicated per mining tile) are placed on a mining tile in the iceberg, the precious metal may be mined. At the end of each round, players recall all the penguins, who bring their mined nuggets and resources back with them. Resources may be used to purchase action- or contract cards. The action cards may be played in the next round to upgrade mining skills or to increase the players penguin colony by adding additional (to a maximum of 4) penguins. The nuggets of precious metals and contract cards are kept until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once all the tiles on the iceberg is mined, the game ends and the players apply their nuggets of precious metals to their contract cards, earning victory points for each completed contract.

Of course, much of the knowledge that was once lost still exists in the frozen ruins, so the book also features several scenarios set in the once-great factories where the art of construct creation reached its pinnacle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Beware, though! As you thwart characters&rsquo; low-level defenses, you&rsquo;ll strengthen their resolve and drive them to use more powerful weapons against you to protect what few resources they have!<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of turns where you pick a member of your warband to attack an enemy character, with each dealing damage to the other.

Draw symbols, which increase your victory points and fulfill contracts along the way with your drawn patterns to please the monarch of your Peninsula.<br/>The winner is determined, by points for the most efficient peninsula after the last symbol card is drafted.<br/><br/>The novel mechanism is that you cannot draw anywhere but only on adjacent hexes to your architect token. This forces players to move at the right time to the right place, otherwise players run out of hexes where they can draw new symbols.<br/><br/>Check the link below to get notified of our coming crowdfunding campaign.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game recreates the situational challenges of charismatic Union spy, James Andrews, and his band of Union raiders just as they have arrived incognito in Marietta, GA from TN and are making final preparations to steal &quot;The General,&quot; a Confederate engine with a tinder and 3 boxcars. Their plan is to travel north to meet up with Union General Mitchel's force heading to attack Chattanooga. Their assignment is to burn bridges, tear up track, and sever telegraph wire along the way so that reinforcements and supplies cannot be brought up from Atlanta. This is not an easy task since there is only a single line of track and extra trains are unexpectedly heading south to Atlanta carrying people and supplies! Meanwhile, Confederate railroad-men Fuller, Murphy, and Cain did not take the train theft very well and began chasing the &quot;engine thieves&quot; (as Southern newspapers referred to them)- first on foot, then by pole car, and finally on several trains. Can you fare better than the original raiders, all of whom were captured and some were hanged, and meet General Mitchel in Bridgeport with the mission accomplished?<br/><br/>The Raiders player must decide, in 15-minute increments, what Actions they want to accomplish, all the while keeping an eye on the train's wood supply and planning stops to replenish it. With the trainmen and a train from Marietta in hot pursuit, the player must negotiate southbound trains, Station Challenges, and Encounters with Station workers and suspicious citizens, all deep behind enemy lines and surrounded by Confederate Units. Sometimes all that will save the group from disaster is Andrews' Persuasive ability!<br/><br/>The raiders player begins a turn by choosing 15 minutes worth of Action cards, in order, to move, damage track, burn bridges, cut telegraph lines, resolve challenges and encounters, initiate combat, and more. The game&rsquo;s bot controls the dogged pursuit of the trainmen and the movement of the southbound trains. The Raiders player must be careful to not use up too much wood in their tinder or allow the Alert Level to rise high.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Raiders player either passes through Chattanooga and reaches Union General Mitchel in Bridgeport, must abandon the stolen train, all Raiders are killed or captured, or the time track reaches 4:00pm. The Raiders player wins by accumulating a net of at least 22 Victory Points. Victory Points are mostly gained by reaching Bridgeport by 4:00pm, burning bridges, cutting telegraph wire, damaging track, and eliminating Confederate Units. The Raiders player loses Victory Points for each Union Raider captured, hanged, or killed.<br/><br/>",

Though it could not outmanoeuvre the A6M Zero at sub-200mph speeds, its speed and rate of climb lent it the capability of making several high speed passes in combat, and Japanese aircraft armour was more susceptible than German aircraft to the tight groupings of the P-38s guns.<br/><br/>It was P-38s that engaged in the fighter-intercept mission that claimed the life of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In this engagement, 16 P-38G lightnings met two G4M &ldquo;Betty&rdquo; transports and six escorting Zeros. Both transports were lost as well as two Zeros, for the loss of one P-38.<br/><br/>",

Scoring is tight, so this choice makes a world of difference!<br/><br/>Hybrid open/closed drafting: You can use monsters/accessories from your hand -OR- from the Shortlist/Market (public card rows). Either way, you always end up putting a card into at least one of those rows.

        "description": "BIKE DELIVERY:  <br/>A game of dice collecting and strategy<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>Dice must be placed one by one on the 12 available squares of the first half of the board (the first 3 columns).<br/>Then the players dispute the die who starts the game. Whoever is first has the right to choose the exit point before others, but whoever makes the first move is the player who came in second and so on.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>On their turn, each player may move along the paths in 2 different ways:<br/>1) Along the asphalt streets (gray): they may move 1 square at a time, ahead or to the sides.<br/>2) Along the fast bike lanes (brown): 2 squares at a time, ahead or to the sides.<br/>Each player may make their move and collect the die at the door with a number equal to the die in the center.<br/>In this case, the Player has reached door #3 of the green house and may collect the die with number 3.<br/><br/>CHOOSING THE DICE<br/>You must choose and collect dice, trying to pick up those which will provide the best total, and find the best trajectory to take them to their destination.<br/>Choices must take into consideration the number and color of the dice, which grants special features to each of their number:<br/>-  Blue - Increase the number on the die by 1 (+1); <br/>-  Red - Reduce the number on the die by 1 (-1); <br/>-  Green - Allows an extra move (&gt;1); <br/>-  Orange - Double the number of the next die to be picked up (x 2).  <br/>Dice that are collected go to each player's marker on the TALLY CHART.<br/><br/>END OF THE FIRST STAGE<br/>When a player reaches any position of the 4th column - where there is a traffic light in the middle of the game board - the first stage of the game ends.<br/>All the dice to the left of that column are removed and rolled again, completing the 12 squares of the second stage, from the 5th to the 8th column.<br/>Players keep their current position and game resumes with the next player after the one who first reached the middle of the game.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT DETAILS<br/>Picking up 2 dice<br/>In some cases, a player's  movement will allow them to pick up 2 dice (or more):<br/>- When they pick up a green die and make an extra move, they may pick up a second die;<br/>- If they reach a square in which both door numbers allow them to pick up both dice;<br/>- On the fast lane, if they move 2 squares and pass by doors with the same numbers of the dice, they may pick up both.<br/>Extra movement<br/>Picking up 2 green dice only allows for 1 extra move. On the fast lane, picking up a green die also provides an extra move (i.e., a third move).<br/>Changing direction<br/>If a player wants to change direction during the game, they may spend one action/movement to make that inversion.<br/>Doubled dice<br/>The player who picked up an orange die will pick that one with its normal value and double the next die - even if that just happens on the next round. The die with doubled value will go to the gray area of dice tally.<br/>Blocking<br/>A player may not occupy the same square as another player. To move, they must go in a different direction. A player may also choose not to move.<br/>Movement from the brown lane to the gray lane<br/>When leaving the brown lane to the gray lane, a player doesn't lose the second movement. It may be performed in the gray area. To have a second movement in the brown area, the first movement must be in that lane as well.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>To end a game, each player must have picked up at least 1 die of each color.<br/>When a player reaches one of the arrival points, the game ends, and the other players may still play their last turn.<br/>Besides the scoring from the dice, some Bonuses* may also be acquired by players:<br/>- First in Stage 1 (+2 points);<br/>- First in the Final Stage (+2 points);<br/>- Player with the most dice (+3 points).<br/><br/>The total sum of dice and bonuses determines the winner. If they are tied, the winner is the player who collected the most dice.<br/><br/>",

So ask for the help of the god DION&Iacute;SIUS and together they created a THEATER FESTIVAL to mark the beginning of winter entitled OSCHOPHORIA.<br/>     They invited the greatest artistic producers in Greece to represent them and thus, PRODUCE a GREAT THEATER SHOW. And for this dispute to become more fierce, the gods create an unquestionable rule: 'THE SCENARIO used in productions must contain perfect sculptures'. And for that, it will be necessary that NOBLE ACTORS SACRIFICE themselves in great pose and style, facing MEDUSA on their island to be PETRIFIED. And later these statues must be RESCUE and linked to the great show.<br/>      Other gods would also like to participate in this event helping producers with specific powers.<br/><br/>You'll have up to 15 turns to create the best show. At the beginning of the game, you must choose whether to defend the interests of Athena or Poseidon. Your choice will determine which benefits you get at the start of the game. The game will have a maximum of 15 turns, which may decrease depending on the perks earned during the match. Managing your time during the match will be essential to build the minimum necessary to score. At the end of the game, the player must have the minimum necessary to count the points.<br/>Each player will have four meeples to move around the board, collecting resources distributed in nine factories. You will also be able to collect cast cards, mask cards and also petrified statues on the island of &quot;MEDUSA&quot;.<br/><br/>The roll of the dice will serve to create the resources in the factories and also to make the movement of the four producers.<br/><br/>To take an actor to the island of &quot;MEDUSA&quot;, just enter with your meeple in the place destined for this. And to rescue a statue of your petrified actor, the player must have another actor hired and also a mask activated. To hire actors and activate masks it will be necessary to allocate the correct components to each card.<br/><br/>On the board there is a space for market transactions between players. And some houses of movement, called squares of Dionysus. When stopping at these squares, the player will receive resources in gold. With this gold you can offer and receive help from other gods. Every time the player receives 3 gold, he must advance one turn on his turn track.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player reaches the &quot;0&quot; square on the turn track. And the winning player will be the one who scores the most points with their hired squad cards, rescued statues and resource filling on their individual show sheet (chosen at the beginning of the game).<br/><br/>The sum of this score will show which player manages to perform the best show in honor of the chosen god. And if there is a tie, art always wins and all players share the victory.<br/><br/>",

The game master tells the crime story and guides the other players step by step through the adventure and the puzzles using the game master's booklet. They know the solution to the current puzzle and can decide whether to give the players hints or not.

To solve these puzzles, the co-operation of all players is mandatory. The game ends when the players have reached the exit of the mountain hut.

During the Battle at the Wkra River, Władysław Sikorski's Polish 5th Army fought against numerically superior Soviet forces (three Soviet armies); yet, they succeeded in halting the Soviet advance, forcing them to retreat. During this battle, Polish 5th Army tied the three Soviet armies, making it impossible for them to reinforce the Soviet assault on Warsaw.

If there is a tie, whoever has fewer groups wins.

There's only one issue: the wares of the market are only marked with Orpian symbols! You only know one symbol and must deduce the other players' tidbits of alien symbology to be the first to fulfill your wealthy client's request and profit from the intergalactic bazaar of Orp.<br/><br/>Instead of traditional hidden roles, every player knows the translation of one Orpian symbol. Players take turns asking each-other questions about their symbols or their meaning. They may also additionally ask a second question, swap cards with another player, or draw locked container cards from the deck. Once a player believes they have won, they will declare victory and then secretly check the results. If they have not won, they are eliminated from the game and play continues, so one must be fairly certain of victory before declaring it.<br/><br/>This game is a must-have for lovers of matrix logic puzzles, alien linguistics, trading, and social deduction.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It has never had trains (and likely never will), but it is a beautiful island and a fantastic place in many other respects. It would be even better if it had trains...<br/><br/>So the city council decided that Sado should have trains indeed, and gave a small budget to three companies to develop a rail network for tourists and freight on Sado, connecting the main ports (Ryotsu and Ogi) to the main tourist destinations and centers of (mainly agricultural) production.<br/><br/>AoS Sado doesn't deviate much from standard Age of Steam. It is a 3-player variant with a few twists and turns. Black cubes represent tourists, and consequently, these come in at the ports (Ryotsu and Ogi) only. Towns start with one cube each. And players/companies start with a little bit more money thanks to a government grant to promote tourism and the local industry (through railroad development). That extra money is necessary, however, as finances tend to be extremely tight in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Industry is dynamic with finance, and local municipalities grow depending on the economic activity in their immediate area. Players also compete against the plutocracy, a NPC.<br/><br/>COMPANIES<br/>Like many train games companies are separate entities than the players. Company management changes depending on share ownership. Other companies, the government, and the plutocracy can also own companies. Companies get started with an IPO, after that share price is dependent on both industrial activity and share trades. Company management can involve managing railways, ships, wagons, and hiring professionals to provide the company advantages.<br/><br/>GOVERNMENT<br/>The government is controlled by the player with the most votes. Votes come from not only other players, but from the public and the plutocracy as well. Certain actions impact the public's and plutocracy's opinion of the players which can change their vote. In addition to creating government run companies or investing public funds into private companies, the governor is able to change corporate and income taxes, outlaw or legalize labour unions, provide welfare payments with government funds, and hire and manage lawmen.<br/><br/>THE MOB AND THE UNION<br/>These are 2 other entities that players can use to manipulate the situation on the map. Union stewards can harass company activity and attempt to gain higher wages for the public. The mob might also harrass companies, but can also come after union stewards. Lawmen can always attempt to stop gangsters, but can't interfere with union stewards unless unions are outlawed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

During the game players take the role of heroes, each one represented with a model of a warrior, mage, rogue, ranger, paladin or warlock.<br/><br/>Heroes must explore the map and overcome challenges in order to win color potions. To do so, the will have to defeat creepy monsters and fight in desperate duels against other heroes. But that is not all, because randomly a magic storm of colors will hit this epic history. Only then players can get magical items, forge the cromatic crown or paint their bold characters.<br/><br/>RULES SUMMARY <br/>Players play turns as follows:<br/>1. MOVEMENT. The player rolls the die and moves his HERO on the map. If the HERO lands on any other square than a CITY, the player draws an ADVENTURE card. In cities, the player can roll again or rest. If a HERO lands on a square already occupied by another HERO, they could DUEL.<br/>2. ADVENTURES. Another player draws a card from the ADVENTURE deck and reads it. <br/>- ENCOUNTERS: The player rolls the die. If the number rolled is the same as or higher than the MONSTER's difficulty level, the player wins.<br/>- RIDDLES: A question related with color and painting must be answered.<br/>- TRAPS: Resolve the effect on the HERO (or player) and keep the card if it is a permanent card.<br/>- MAGIC BOOM: Stop the game and start the CLOCK for painting.<br/>3. MAGIC BOOM. In this pase players get their brushes and paint with the colors available in their inventories. While the CLOCK is running they can: <br/>- CRAFT MAGIC. Each player may paint the HERO miniature.<br/>- FORGE MAGIC ITEM. Players may paint two gems on the base of their miniatures. They must be two colors from different lands. They take a MAGIC ITEM card then.<br/>- INSERT COLOR RUNE. Players paint with the colors available in their inventory on their COLOR CROWN boards.<br/>4. DUEL. Each player rolls the die. The winner gets 1 GLORY token and deals wound or madness to the loser.<br/><br/>Once a player finishes the turn, then it passes to the player sitting on his left.<br/><br/>A player wins the game if his HERO has become a LEGENDARY HERO. For doing that he/her must forges 5 MAGIC ITEMS and complete the combination of the COLOR CROWN.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jester is a &quot;trick&quot; based game, like hearts or bridge, using a standard 52 card deck with 2 jokers (Jesters). Players bid on the number of tricks they believe they can take in each hand.<br/><br/>Jester is one of the most enjoyable and sophisticated two player card games.  It is a fairly straightforward game to learn, but the strategies are challenging and there are multiple modes of play that add to the fun.<br/><br/>A game consists of multiple hands and a cumulative score is kept. The score is based on the accuracy of the bidding as well as the number of tricks taken. Games can be very short, or quite long, as scores can increase or decrease based on the success or failure in any given hand.<br/><br/>Jester Rules<br/><br/>",

In addition the rules got simplified so that new players can join the game immediately.<br/><br/>World&ndash;Facts is an entertaining geographical guessing game for 2-6 players aged 8 and up. Does Canada or Australia count more inhabitants? Does Rio de Janeiro or Sydney indicate a higher average temperature? And does London or Rome have more annual rainfall? These are just a few questions, where the players need to find an answer. In doing so it is not necessary to know the exact values, but rather to estimate and compare them in between different countries and cities. Through the different categories of questions the game offers a lot of variety and excitement.<br/><br/>Another special feature of World-Facts is its internationality. Via translations of all categories into 5 languages, global topics and the frequent use of symbols, World-Facts overcomes the usual focus of quiz games on just one language and culture. Thus, World-Facts is very suitable for multicultural groups.<br/><br/>​-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An eternal struggle rages amongst the animals in the breathtaking African nature reserves such as the Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Masai Mara, and Kgalagadi. Every animal, pack or herd wants a territory, fresh grass or juicy meat. A lazy or unattentive animal will be chased by other animals, who will claim this area as their new home. Also be wary of the roaming poachers. Luckily the rangers are also on the look out.<br/><br/>In this simple card game you and 1-3 other players try to gather the most points by scoring animal cards from your hand. Each animal has a nature reserve, strength and a worth. Strong animals are worth less than weaker ones. Simultaneously, everyone plays a card. The strenght of each animal played determines the order in which the players get to select a card from the market (which contains the same amount of cards as the amount of players). Only played animals matching the same nature reserve (colour) as those in the market allow you to take a card and score the animal played. If you cannot take a card matching your nature reserve, you draw a blind card and score no points. However, do you play a strong animal to be guaranteed of a card and points, or do you play a weaker animal which will give you more points, yet may allow the other players to take all the suitable cards from the market?<br/><br/>",

The player&rsquo;s goal is to get as many of the 13 states as possible to ratify the Constitution.  The game takes around 15-20 minutes to play and can be used as a teaching exercise in a classroom.<br/><br/>The game includes a deck of 29 cards, 13 of which are convention cards--one for each of the 13 states.  The other cards are Federalist Papers cards representing a selection of the 85 historical Federalist Papers political essays. When a convention card is drawn, the player holds that state's ratification convention.  Starting with a base number representing the state's starting level of support for the Constitution, the player rolls two dice to add to the base number.  Twelve or higher and the state ratifies; less than 12 and the state rejects it.<br/><br/>The player may choose to add Federalist Papers cards to the convention to increase the odds, but may also spend them for die rolls to advance along two tracks to gain bonuses in future conventions.  The player mat is used to keep track of which states ratify as well as progress along the tracks.<br/><br/>Most of the Federalist Papers cards appear early in the game when the easy states hold conventions.  The player must conserve them for use late in the game when the difficult states hold their conventions.<br/><br/>To win, the player must get at least 9 states to ratify--the minimum number required for the Constitution to go into effect.  But each state has a number of victory points, and the more states that ratify, the higher the score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If players point to the same score condition, the player nearest to the card will choose who receives it while the other player will draw two cards and choose one to claim.<br/><br/>After all five cards have been placed, players set aside all claimed score conditions and reset the game. After three rounds, tally up the scores and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>Wacky Cousin Wendell is the third game in the Risible Relatives Series. Each game in the series is a standalone 54-card game for 1-2 players that can also be combined with each game in the series for a different experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If the tile matches one of the visible cards, they win the card! The player then turns the tile back over, face down, and takes the card as a point won.

        "description": "A Tome Weaver interlaces the different magical spell fragments obtained by the Arcane Scribes into a transcendent manuscript, arming the Battle mages with such ruthless combos that easily turn the tide in any war of magic. The intricacies and harmonies involved in such an enchantment are often insanely complex and requires not only a deep knowledge of the elements but also a strategic cognizance of how well all this fits together in an impossible manifest and more often than not in the midst of a chaotic and unexpected confrontation.<br/><br/>TKG ARENA: Tome Weaver is a game set up for 2 - 5 players.<br/><br/>Winning Condition<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to compile a valuable collection of spells into a volume designed to unleash a volley of spells in a battle. The value of the collection is determined by number of HARMONY points scored as it is an indication of its stability. The player with the most HARMONY points wins the game when it ends.<br/><br/>Ending Condition<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards are played from the hands of all players.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>A player starts the game by designating the following areas: A draw deck area O, a discard area X and five adjoining spaces that is marked A, B, C, D and E.<br/><br/>X    A    B    C    D    E     O<br/><br/><br/>     Determine the starting player by drawing cards from the deck of spell cards. The player who draws the highest face value starts first and turn order is clockwise. In case of a tie, the tied players keep drawing till the tie is broken with a player drawing a higher face value. The drawn cards are put back into the deck.<br/>     Shuffle all 36 spell cards and deal 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 cards to 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 players respectively. E.g. For 3 players, each player receives 8 cards at the start.<br/>     Place 1 face up spell card at each of the spaces A, B, C, D and E.<br/>     The rest of the cards are placed faced down as a stack in O.<br/>     Each player should also designate a small area in front of himself / herself to group cards of the same colour together for easy scoring later.<br/><br/><br/>On each player&rsquo;s turn <br/><br/>     The player may exchange a card by first discarding a card from their hand to X and drawing the top face down card from O before putting it into his / her hand. If the stack at O runs out of cards, shuffle any discarded cards at X to form a new stack at O to draw from.<br/>     Next, the player must either claim one of the cards placed in A, B, C, D or E or to play one of his / her cards face down in front of himself / herself. These cards are part of the player&rsquo;s collection and will be scored at the end of the game.<br/>     To claim a card placed in A, B, C, D or E, the player need to play either a card from his hand of the SAME COLOUR as the placed card or a card with a LOWER face value than the placed card. The played card replaces the placed card in A, B, C, D or E and the placed card is then claimed by the player as part of his / her personal collection displayed in front of himself / herself.<br/>     If all players have only 1 remaining card left in their hands, the game ends and scoring begins.<br/><br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>There are three types of scoring.<br/><br/><br/>     First Scoring: Check the colour of the remaining card and ignore its face value. Locate all other cards of the same colour in the collection and find the lowest face value among all these other cards. For each other card of this colour, score HARMONY points according to this lowest face value. The remaining card is not included as a card in the total number of cards considered for this purpose. E.g. The remaining card in a player&rsquo;s hand is ASHW with face value 1. There are other 3 ASHW cards in the collection, with face values 3, 5, 9. The power points scored will be 3 x 3 = 9 points. If there are only 2 ASHW cards with face values, 5 and 9, the power points scored will be 2 x 5 = 10 points. <br/>     Second Scoring: For each card in the collection that bears the same colour as the card that remains in spaces A, B, D and E, score 1 HARMONY point. For each card in the collection that bears the same number as the face value of the card that remains in space C, score 3 HARMONY points. The last remaining card used in the first scoring is part of the collection and its colour and face value is considered for this second scoring.<br/>     Third Scoring: Each faced down cards is scored as 2 HARMONY points.<br/>     The final score of each player is the sum of these 3 scorings.<br/><br/><br/>",

In the first two phases, players upkeep and upgrade their kingdom during simultaneous play by exchanging resources for upgrade cards and purchasing units. In the third phase, players take turns controlling their heroes as they venture across the hex-grid board to take control of resources, battle other heroes, attack kingdoms, or return to their own kingdom for shelter or to resupply.<br/><br/>Battles determined by binary dice, unique unit abilities for each faction, powerful artefact cards, and a fully modular board all combine to create a game that necessitates thoughtful and adaptive strategy, with a high level of re-playability.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Put simply, over the course of the game, from two to five participants seek to avoid busy city centres and routes blocked by diggers to deliver data blocks from one city Internet Exchange to another.<br/><br/>Data, however, scores differently and is also subject to cyber attacks from other nasty trouble-making players. But at the end of the day, the first player to fifteen points can celebrate a well-earned victory.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>There are a variable number of rounds, with each player, during their individual turn, able to perform any two of the following actions:<br/><br/>Bring a data block into play <br/>Move a data block along a route<br/>Carry out a cyber-attack<br/><br/>The core of the game are the Location tokens.<br/>Each location token bears the name of a location on the board where there is an Internet Exchange. <br/>From time to time, players either leave these locations or have to reach them to deliver their data blocks and gain the points they need to win the game. <br/>Players need to find a container where they can put the tokens, shake them well, and then pick them out one by one as the game progresses.<br/>Data are represented by wooden cubes; they move along the routes on the playing board towards the locations that host Internet Exchanges.<br/><br/>In addition, players can place a digger (only one) on any route after finishing their turn and before the turn passes to the next player.

        "description": "It is late in the summer the land is dry and the rivers and creeks are low. It is bushfire season. Word gets around that the surrounding lands are like a tinderbox ready to explode in flames. Then it happens. A Raging Inferno is ignited and starts to bare down on your homes. It is too late to flee - you must defend the town until the Raging Inferno has been extinguished. You and your fellow residents are all that stands in the way of saving your homes and the lives of your loved ones. The weak and the injured are seeking safety and shelter in the Community Hall in the centre of town.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Raging Inferno is a collaborative board game for 1-6 players. The players must work together to save the town from the Raging Inferno. Wild winds and a climate crisis induced heat wave make the situation very dangerous. Dangers (in the form of fires) come at the town from all different directions. The players must rally the townsfolk to Defend the town.<br/><br/>Dangers come at the Town from eight random directions.<br/><br/>Defenders need to be strategically placed to combat these Dangers - ranging from Arsonists, Spot Fires, Bush Fires and the deadly &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; Dangers.  But watchout just when you think you have everything covered the wind can change and move the fires around.<br/><br/>Defenders operate in different zones - Scrublands, Bushlands, Farmlands and the Town Centre. The Defenders consist of Volunteers, Fire Fighters, Fire Trucks and the all powerful Fire Chief. You are also helped by lots of fire fighting assistance - Fire Breaks, Water Bombs and occasionally the weather might help.<br/><br/>You will need luck, lots of teamwork and some clever game play to save the town from the Raging Inferno.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Fading Star: Insurgency and Piracy in Somalia is Volume XV of the COIN Series originally designed by Volko Ruhnke. The year is 2007. We reach the climax of the several decades of civil war that have ravaged Somalia since the fall of dictator Siad Barre in 1991. An African Union coalition, assisted by the Ethiopian army, enters Mogadishu to support a nascent but corrupt Transitional Federal Government. They face a relentless and violent insurgency waged by Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, an Islamic group seeking both to expel the &quot;invaders&quot; and to transcend the traditional clan-based government structure of Somalia. In the middle of this power vacuum, minor clans and warlords organize themselves to administrate otherwise ungoverned regions, while others engage in large-scale piracy operations, painting their acts as a fight against foreign trawlers pillaging Somali fishing resources.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>     An updated take on contemporary aspects of insurgency and peacebuilding. The Al-Shabaab insurgent enjoys intelligence supremacy that allows them to conduct deadly out-of-turn ambushes, while facing a slightly less pronounced asymmetrical disadvantage than insurgent factions in previous volumes (due to the comparative weakness of the Transitional Federal Government). On the other hand, the African Union Mission's logistical, kinetic, and peacebuilding capacities will evolve as contributing countries join or leave the coalition throughout the game. <br/>     Intense urban warfare is depicted in more detail through the struggle for control of the capital city Mogadishu. Controlling a majority of districts will provide the ruling faction with further legitimacy and enhanced capabilities. However, limited operational effectiveness, mobility restrictions, and the looming threat from a major Al-Shabaab offensive will greatly slow the COIN factions' progress toward stabilizing the city.<br/>     A new &lsquo;Clan Struggle&rsquo; interphase draws out some of the conflict's unique uncertainties. All sides bid to forge new alliances with local clans, bringing new blood to the battlefield, while the African Union must deal with the consequences of delayed reinforcements or unilateral withdrawals by member countries, and the Pirate warlords collect lucrative tolls from roads and ports that they control. <br/>     A unique piracy subsystem debunks the Somali pirate mythos and explores how piracy stakeholders' interests actually intersected with other local actors during the golden age of Indian Ocean hostage-taking.  <br/><br/><br/>Each turn eligible players will select from a faction-specific menu of Operations and Special Activities in an order determined by the current Event card, or choose to trigger the Event text. Typical Operations include Sweep, Assault, March, and Attack, with more unique Operations and Special Activities reflecting the specific nature of this conflict and the factions involved. Regular play is periodically interrupted by Propaganda rounds, during which early victory is possible and some upkeep is conducted; and by Clan Struggle rounds (unique to this game), during which all players have the opportunity to bid for the loyalty of an unaligned regional clan. If nobody achieves an early victory then the winner will be determined by comparing victory thresholds in the final Propaganda round. Each faction has unique victory conditions relating to their aims and objectives during this period of history.<br/><br/>Faction descriptions:<br/><br/>     Al-Shabaab wages a deadly Islamist insurgency against the African Union &lsquo;occupiers&rsquo; and their dependent Transitional Federal Government allies. A clear edge in media warfare provides them with significant recruiting capacities that will help them build a Somali caliphate transcending the customary clan system.  <br/>     Ugandan and Burundian troops serving in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) aim to enforce peace, build support for the Transitional Federal Government, and train the weak federal army. Neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya may also enter the scene to stabilize their respective borders while interfering in Somali politics. <br/>     An abysmally weak Transitional Federal Government seeks to survive in a besieged Mogadishu while reaching out into the rest of the country to advance the federalization process. Unprecedented embezzlement capacities and partnerships with like-minded clans may offer the consecutive administrations an opportunity to survive the conflict unharmed and more prosperous than ever, and a new kind of militia unit emphasizes the opportunistic nature of the Somali clans' agendas. <br/>     Pirates, minor clans, and unaligned warlords pursue their enrichment projects by raiding the high seas or setting up roadblocks across unruly parts of the country. They'll settle for a &quot;customary&quot; Somalia, neither rooted in sharia law nor totally anchored to the liberal world order. <br/><br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Transperceneige, the game is an asymmetrical semi-cooperative game for 3 to 5 players based on the French comic book by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette, published by Casterman. Following a climatic catastrophe, the Earth has been plunged into a new ice age, removing all life from the planet. Only one group of humans has managed to board the Transperceneige, a train that runs around the planet forever, keeping them alive. The players, in command of the different groups of passengers, will have to make choices and collaborate with each other (or not!) to take control of the Transperceneige. But they still have to survive the trip...<br/><br/>To gain influence, you must satisfy your passengers, prepare revolts and achieve secret objectives. However, selfish choices will jeopardize the survival of the whole train, leading to defeat. Can you make the right decisions?<br/><br/>Action planning, cooperation, resource management and bluffing will be your best assets on board the train of a thousand and one cars. Welcome to the Transperceneige!<br/><br/>A. Setting<br/>After a climatic cataclysm, the survivors of the human species embark on a train with a thousand and one cars that runs forever. Prisoners of this machine, it is however their only hope of survival. The mechanisms that make the train move also allow, thanks to the movements, to operate the survival facilities for its passengers. Very hierarchical, the &quot;Golden Cars&quot; at the head of the train house the aristocracy, the richest passengers who live with all the comfort that these cars can offer. They are also responsible for the path to follow, as they direct the train not only from the inside, but especially towards the outside. Then there are the cars that specialize in recovery, recycling, food, but also military cars that help maintain order. Finally, the last wagons are simple warehouses fitted out as bunks for the poorest class. They are in charge of feeding the engine ovens and thus ensuring the survival of the passengers.<br/><br/>B. How to play<br/>Each player controls a class made up of the passengers of the train. Each class is different and corresponds to a specific hierarchy and function in the train (high, medium, low class). Players will have to manage cars using a deck of cards unique to each player, representing the possible actions to be performed during the game turn. Players will have to cooperate (or not!) to survive together to one of 5 possible endgames: 4 defeat scenarios, one victory scenario.<br/><br/>In addition to cooperating to survive to the end of the game, players will have to achieve objectives to gain influence within the train. The best way to do this is to access the leadership and direct the train. However, you'll have to be on your guard, because the players of the lower classes will have the possibility to rebel and take the lead position to, in turn, lead the train and satisfy their passengers!<br/><br/>C. How to win<br/>The end of the game can be triggered at any time, by a victory or a defeat.<br/><br/>Victory<br/>When the train reaches its destination, symbolized by a &quot;Sun&quot; marker on the central board, the game ends immediately. The temperature rises and humanity can finally be reborn!<br/>The player who was the most clever, and therefore with the most influence points at the end of the game, will take control of the Transperceneige!<br/><br/>Defeat<br/>When one of the conditions listed below is met, the game ends immediately. The last hope of humanity has been extinguished.<br/><br/><br/>     The train does not go in the right direction (the &quot;Death&quot; marker is reached on the central board)<br/>     There are no more Event cards to draw<br/>     A player loses all his passengers<br/><br/><br/>D. Game Turns<br/><br/>A game is played in several rounds (15 maximum). A game turn consists of 6 stages:<br/><br/><br/>     Phase 1 - Event: Draw a card from the current Event deck (Phase I, II or III).<br/>     Phase 2 - Prepare: Plan your actions, exchange resources or services with other players, negotiate...<br/>     Phase 3 - Work: Play all planned Action cards in order of initiative.<br/>     Phase 4 - Advance: Draw a number of Railroad cards defined by the speed of the train.<br/>     Phase 5 - Rest: Passengers at work must eat and endure the cold, those at rest may repopulate.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Transperceneige est un jeu&nbsp;**semi-coop&eacute;ratif asym&eacute;trique pour 3 &agrave; 5 joueurs**&nbsp;adapt&eacute; de la BD originale. Les joueurs, aux commandes des diff&eacute;rents groupes de passagers, devront faire des choix et collaborer entre eux (ou pas !) pour prendre le contr&ocirc;le du Transperceneige. Encore faut-il survivre au voyage&hellip;<br/><br/>Pour gagner en influence, il faudra satisfaire ses passagers, pr&eacute;parer des r&eacute;voltes et r&eacute;aliser des objectifs secrets. Cependant, les choix &eacute;go&iuml;stes risqueront de mettre en p&eacute;ril la survie de l&rsquo;ensemble du train, conduisant vers une d&eacute;faite. Saurez-vous prendre les bonnes d&eacute;cisions ?<br/><br/>Programmation d&rsquo;actions, coop&eacute;ration, gestion de ressources et bluff seront vos meilleurs atouts &agrave; bord du train aux mille et un wagons. Bienvenue dans le Transperceneige !<br/><br/>A. Univers<br/>Apr&egrave;s un cataclysme climatique, les survivants de l&rsquo;esp&egrave;ce humaine embarquent dans un train aux mille et un wagons qui roule &eacute;ternellement. Prisonniers de cette machine, elle est pourtant leur seul espoir de survie. Les m&eacute;canismes qui font avancer le train permettent aussi, gr&acirc;ce aux mouvements, de faire fonctionner les installations de survie pour ses passagers. Tr&egrave;s hi&eacute;rarchis&eacute;, des wagons dor&eacute;s en t&ecirc;te abritent l&rsquo;aristocratie, les passagers les plus riches qui vivent en profitant de tout le confort que peut offrir ces wagons. Ces derniers sont &eacute;galement responsables du chemin &agrave; suivre, car ils dirigent le train non seulement de l&rsquo;int&eacute;rieur, mais surtout vers l&rsquo;ext&eacute;rieur. Viennent ensuite des wagons sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s dans la r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration, le recyclage, les aliments mais aussi des wagons militaires qui permettent de maintenir l&rsquo;ordre. Enfin, les derniers wagons sont de simples entrep&ocirc;ts am&eacute;nag&eacute;s en couchette pour la classe la plus pauvre. Elles est charg&eacute;e d&rsquo;alimenter les fours des moteurs et ainsi assurer la survie des passagers.<br/><br/>B. But du jeu<br/>Chaque joueur contr&ocirc;le une classe constitu&eacute;e par**&nbsp;**les passagers du train.** Chaque classe est diff&eacute;rente et correspond &agrave; une hi&eacute;rarchisation et une fonction sp&eacute;cifique dans le train (haute, moyenne, basse classe). Les joueurs vont devoir g&eacute;rer des wagons &agrave; l&rsquo;aide d&rsquo;un deck de cartes unique &agrave; chacun, repr&eacute;sentant les actions possibles &agrave; effectuer dans le tour de jeu. Les joueurs devront coop&eacute;rer (ou pas !) pour survivre ensemble jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; une des 5 fins de partie possibles : 4 sc&eacute;narios de d&eacute;faite, un seul de victoire.<br/><br/>En plus de coop&eacute;rer pour survivre jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; la fin de partie, les joueurs devront r&eacute;aliser des objectifs pour gagner de l&rsquo;influence au sein du train. Pour cela, le meilleur moyen :&nbsp;**acc&eacute;der au** **convoi de t&ecirc;te**&nbsp;et diriger le train. Cependant, il faudra rester sur ses gardes, car les joueurs des classes inf&eacute;rieures auront la possibilit&eacute; de se rebeller et prendre la place de t&ecirc;te pour, &agrave; leur tour, diriger le train et satisfaire leurs passagers !<br/><br/>C. Fin de partie<br/>La fin de partie peut se d&eacute;clencher &agrave; tout moment, par une victoire, ou une d&eacute;faite.<br/><br/>Victoire<br/><br/>Quand le train arrive &agrave; bonne destination, symbolis&eacute; par un marqueur &ldquo;Soleil&rdquo; sur le plateau central, la partie prend fin imm&eacute;diatement.

They wander through the areas where the map of Bulgaria is divided and try to save the world from dark forces. They must face the horrors that lurk everywhere in order to reach the lost tales and gain influence over the various locales.<br/><br/>Information from the publisher:<br/>Hold on, Earth! is a family strategy game for 3 - 5 players.<br/>The main goal in this fantasy world is to find the lost fairy tales. But horrors lurk everywhere, and the people are divided. With cunning, strategy, and no small amount of luck, players will have to discover the fairy tales and save the world from dark forces!<br/>Players move their characters around the playing field in a predetermined order and aim to find the most fairy tales. However, this is not so easy! Instead of a fairy tale, you may find yourself face to face with а horror, misfortune may happen to you, or good fortune may smile upon you. Characters can also gain influence over localities, which will bring them extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Дръж се, Земьо! е настолна игра, в която участниците влизат в ролята на български герои в търсене на изгубени приказки. Те странстват из месностите, на които е разделена картата на България и се опитват да спасят света от мрачните сили. Те трябва да се изправят пред страшилищата, които дебнат навсякъде, за да достигнат до изгубените приказки и да спечелят влияние над различните местности.<br/><br/>Информация от издателя:<br/>Дръж се, Земьо! е семейна стратегическа игра за 3 - 5 играчи.<br/>Основната цел в този фантастичен свят е да се намерят изгубените приказки.

С хитрост, стратегия и не малка доза късмет играчите ще трябва да открият приказките и да спасят света от мрачните сили!<br/>Играчите местят своите герои по игралното поле по предварително определен ред и се стремят да намерят най-много приказки. Това обаче не е толкова лесно! Вместо приказка може да се озовеш лице в лице със страшилище, да ти се случи неволя или пък добрата съдба да ти се усмихне. Героите могат да печелят и влияние над местностите, което да им донесе допълнителни точки в края на играта.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Rogue Hammer.&nbsp;<br/><br/>In this rulebook you will find a fast, easy-playing game of unit based combat closely inspired by the setting and units of the original Rogue Trader rulebook, powered by Squad Hammer.<br/><br/>The game rules are unit based, instead of rolling by figure with a straight-forward tactical system that allows units to retreat and regroup and intense, dramatic firefights at close quarters. The rules cover large monsters, psionics, vehicles, heroes and infantry.&nbsp;<br/><br/>A typical game can easily be played in an evening and the rules can be used with a wide range of figures. Points values are provided to approximate the major troop types of the original Rogue Trader (Imperial army, star knights, galactic orcs, galactic elves and the 6 limbed Crawlers) plus a few new faces and a few vehicles with more to come.<br/><br/>A total of 32 unit types and 5 vehicle types have been given profiles and points values.<br/><br/>A typical battle is 4-8 units on each side and you can use your original figures or adapt any of the great scifi ranges for sale in the market including in 15mm scale if you prefer.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Scenario generation with discoverable objections, battlefield exploration and random events is included, suitable for pick-up games as well as those nights where making a scenario just isn't in the cards.<br/><br/>The rules include a progression system where units can be carried over and gain experience in battle.<br/><br/>And of course the game includes solo mechanics, meaning the only thing you need is some miniatures (whether brand new or some dusty old troopers ready for a new battle) and a 3x3 foot table. You can also use the solo system to play with a friend against the bad guys.&nbsp;<br/><br/>This is only the beginning: While this is a full game, it can be expanded in a number of ways including all the classic units, more scenario options, random events and more. The plan is to support the game through Patreon with updates every month that add new content to the game and incorporate any tweaks and corrections. These updates will be added to the Wargame Vault rulebook a few months later to allow time for testing and catching bugs. The intention is to do a single &quot;Living Rulebook&quot; rather than a supplement model.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

On this space, 1cm is equivalent to about 200-400m on the ground.<br/>1 turn of the game represents half a day of history, a game is played in 8 turns.

Will you manage to get out of this trap, will you succeed in uniting the Germanic tribes against the common threat?

Scan the unmapped depths and place tiles representing signs of marine life. Descend into the darkness and reveal these tiles to discover remarkable creatures.<br/><br/>The depths are vast and time is limited; savvy decision-making under pressure is crucial to a successful expedition. Choose wisely which creatures to investigate, as those you don&rsquo;t pursue may be discovered by your opponents.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll gain points based on the scoring criteria of species you've discovered. Some thrive in a homogenous environment; others fare better surrounded by diversity. The solitary life may suit certain creatures, but straying from the safety of a group spells disaster for others.<br/><br/>Discover the most synergistic ecosystem to win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The gathering entries in this year&rsquo;s event are sixteen Peanut characters driving their own custom built soap box carts, and they are excited for the fast downhill racing action derby boulevard provides, although Joe Agate forgot to fill in some potholes. Your roll in all this excitement is to be the racing steward guiding them along this competition and making sure the whole gang follows the rules. Being the steward doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t root for your favorites, but just make sure they follow the briefing rules contained in this manual, let&rsquo;s begin the racing fun on this beautiful day for the competition and crown a derby drag racing winner.<br/><br/>Each character has its own card to determine movement. The game uses a simple three die mechanic to the movement based off four variable skill movement characteristics: speed, soap box control, tire shake, and grooving. The result of the yellow D12 control die compared to the six sided red tire shake die will determine if the car drifts left or right along the track.<br/><br/>The game uses a sixteen single race elimination bracket, characters are randomly placed in the first round of the bracket and two drivers race against each other at a time, and the winner of each single race moves to the next round. Each race takes approximately five minutes to complete and there will be fifteen total races to complete the derby competition bracket and crown a winner.

It mixes bluffing and deduction with strategic thinking to create a funny and exciting gaming experience.<br/><br/>The game simulates a modern kendo competition between two fighters whose goal is to defeat their opponent using familiar elements of kendo. Players score points by performing striking combinations against their opponents and can keep or earn their focus points for executing these combinations at the optimal moment of attack and defense. Each player has a pre-set number of playing cards and each draw will allow him to change their technical &bdquo;inventory&rdquo; through optimal hand management.<br/><br/>Every decision must be carefully analyzed because one little mistake can cost you the battle. The game uses a small amount of kendo-specific terms in order to be easily understandable and enjoyable even for those, who do not practice the art. During the game, you can get a little insight into the wonderful world of kendo, the Japanese Way of the Sword, which is worth giving a try in a real dojo, aka training hall as well.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You have found some land and a few animals to get started. Can you turn your little start-up into a bona fide ranch?<br/><br/>The game consists of 2 phases, the Auction Phase and the Disaster Phase.<br/><br/>Your goal is to meet the objective on your objective card by collecting the indicated animals on your ranch. To win you must establish 3 Ranches this way. To meet your objective, all cards must be the same breed of the animal indicated. You may change which breeds you are collecting as the game progresses. Your ranch also has a max capacity that cannot be exceeded.<br/><br/>During each auction round players have a chance to take 2 cards from an open draft style auction to add to their ranch. They may not exceed their ranch capacity and must discard any cards that take them over the limit.<br/><br/>The end of the auction triggers the disaster phase. The active player turns over the top card from the Disasters deck reads the card out loud. Every player follows the directions on the Disaster card, not just the active player. Players have the option of avoiding disasters with a dice roll indicated on some cards. Certain cards also allow players to avoid disasters. You must survive the disaster round to consider you objective completed. Once an objective is completed players draw a new objective and start over carrying over only a few cards from the previous objective. The first player to complete 3 objectives wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

By collecting, playing and manipulating cards accordingly, players put them together as profitable sets and valuable sequences as well as use them to thwart the opponent's plans. All that for gaining the highest score at the end and winning the game. There are several ways of gaining points and performing actions, so each player may find his own method for playing. To get more points, players have to push their luck hard to take certain actions in their favor or against the opponent. But they have to be careful - these actions may quickly turn against them because of immediate opponent's return actions during the same turn!<br/><br/>The gameplay combines core mechanics such as Push your luck, Set/Sequence Collection, Hand management and Gaining score. Taking into account the quickly passing time, players are forced to constantly balance their tactics as well as adapt their luck based decisions.<br/><br/>Besides the default multiplayer gameplay, Continuum also contains a solitaire variant which introduces a demanding Automa opponent to compete with. This mode imitates the standard multiplayer game. It includes all features and competitiveness of a 2 player game but without the need of a human opponent. The Automa cards determine the difficulty and aggressiveness of the Automa opponent. Player may tune the Automa profile to his liking during game setup.<br/><br/>Continuum offers an endless replayability. This, combined with a very quick setup and pleasantly short gameplay time, encourages players to play several games in a row. With handy components, the game fits perfectly for lunch breaks, trips and any occasions when there's only a short time available. Additionally, the digital version of the game will do great in remote, online play.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCheck the forum thread for game presentation and all official resources/files/links<br/>[OFFICIAL] - Game presentation + PnP files + Links + WIP Thread + Digital versions<br/>",

Whoever manages to discard all his deck and cards in hand, will have won. Also, if someone finds a pair of Flora or Fauna among the stacks, he must mention them, causing his opponent to move that pair to the bottom of his deck.<br/><br/>In game 2 (Revelations) each player also has a personal deck, but no hand is used. Each player, in a clockwise direction, will reveal cards to the table. If any player at any time finds a pair of Flora or Fauna, he can cover them, and thus take them to his area on the table as a trophy. Whoever puts together the most pairs until the cards in each deck run out will have won. If any player incorrectly covers, he will not be able to cover until he passes his turn again.<br/><br/>Finally in game 3 (The Only One), we must go removing cards from the hands of others, to form pairs in our hand and thus discard them. Everyone will try to be without a hand, in order to get rid of it, and only one will be left with a card that does not have a partner.<br/><br/>",

Each card gives the result of the next four overs, allocating runs to each batsman, any extras scored, and whether there are any wicket chances.

All you need is a printer and some 6-sided dice! You can even use the digital print files to play on your smart device. This starts with Chapter 1 of 5 that are currently planned. Each chapter comes with 3 different game maps (1 for each act). Each act is an evolution of the previous game narrative with deeper rules and story points.<br/><br/>Players roll and draft dice to determine what kind of Guardians they can place to defend each of the 6 stones housed in protective sanctums. Remaining dice determine the type of creature (called Whims) that will be attacking. Players then roll another die to determine which sanctum each Whim will attack.<br/><br/>The goals of each act in Chapter 1 are for survival, to protect the stones from destruction. Future chapters may have different but similar style of gameplay following the narrative as the story delves deeper into the mystery behind the onslaught of Whims.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Fight monsters, learn new super moves, and rescue your captured friends. If you can defeat the Dark Emperor, the day is saved!<br/><br/>5-Color Sentai (五色戦隊) is a semi-cooperative worker-placement game. Each player controls an identical team of 5 sentai superheroes represented by red, pink, yellow, green, and blue squares. Players also begin with black and white squares that represent unavailable captured teammates. Each turn, players place one of their sentai on a matching space on a card in the row of monster cards. Players compete to be the one to play the last required sentai, because defeating the monster grants points and an effect or the ongoing ability to perform a special move. Once all players have played all their possible sentai, players take back all their sentai and a new round begins.<br/><br/>All players begin with a selection of special moves that allow them to place more than one sentai at a time. By defeating monsters, a player may unlock additional special moves like Bingo Attack, Triple Fireball, and the Rainbow Ray. Victory may also trigger special situations, such as taking the start player card or rescuing captured sentai teammates. But be careful: some cards can make you lose other cards or even one of your own sentai.<br/><br/>The Dark Emperor is always the final card to appear. Once a player is capable of defeating the Dark Emperor, they must do so. At that point, the world is saved and everyone wins. But the player with the most accumulated victory points on their cards is the biggest winner.<br/><br/>",

Sell Larry as many photos as possible, but be careful not to wind up with too many photos in your hand at the end of the game...as anything not sold will COST you money!<br/><br/>Now get out there and collect those photos, and make the people believe!<br/><br/>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>A turn consists of picking a face-up card from one of 9 stacks, or playing a series of cards to match and score adjacent (or diagonal) face up cards. Scored cards are set face down by the player.<br/><br/>The number of cards required to match increases, based on previous matches, and once something has been matched to its maximum amount that specific match can no longer be scored!<br/><br/>The game ends when 3 stacks are empty. Cards in your face down pile are scored, based on their value, but any cards in your hand are worth negative their value!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with cards in the hand, cards on the table face down, with face-up cards on top of those. You shed them to a center pile, then the next player needs to play an equal or lower numbered set of cards (up to four cards total, of the same rank), or take up the growing center pile.<br/><br/>When one player goes out, the other players receive points for the cards they hold. (You don't want points.) Symbols on the cards influence the counting of those points. After the final round, the player with the least points wins. SHIPHEAD is a fast paced game and accommodates 3-7 players. It's a fun way to start or end a game day. Kids who love games can play it too. It offers meaningful decisions and a compulsive feeling--&quot;got to get rid of my cards&quot;! The most powerful cards in the game are also the greatest liability. Do you get rid of them at the first opportunity, or save them for a decisive moment? SHIPHEAD comes in a sturdy box with 108 cards, a page of rules and a page of illustrated examples. SHIPHEAD features fun ship-headed cartoon characters on the cards.<br/><br/>Since each player is usually getting rid of 1-4 cards per turn, the ratchet squeezes, the cards in hand are getting fewer, and the play pushes toward a conclusion for concise play. Timing is everything. When do you take risks, or how do you avoid them? When do you put pressure on the other players? How do you manipulate the flow? Can you wait for the right moment to make your big play? ShipHead moves along quickly. When do you use the cards in the hand, and when your cards on the table?<br/><br/>ShipHead offers fast and spirited play, tension, and meaningful decisions.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Now you'll compete with other cities, securing the best building projects to gain the most prestige in hopes of become the Greatest Little City.&quot;<br/><br/>In this game, players will have two actions to perform.  Gaining tiles and placing them within their city.  Gaining a tile involves the Investor's Market, a series of building tile stacks arranged in a rondel.  The active player moves their Investor clockwise to the desired stack, claiming the top tile.  The Active Player pawn then moves clockwise to the next Investor in the rondel.<br/><br/>Between turns at the Investor Market, players can then add these buildings to their cities.  New tiles must be placed adjacent to their City Planner, who then moves onto the newly built tiles.  Each building type scores differently.  Once four piles have been depleted, the game is over.<br/><br/>Greatest Little Cities: Urban Sprawl is the larger box version of Greatest Little Cities, a Mint Tin Game.  The tiles are not only significantly larger from the original but the number of tiles of each type has been rebalanced to add a 5th Player from the original.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If a driver has the Action Number, you roll on the Movement Range area to see what happens. The driver can roll to not have anything happen on that lap, they can be able to challenge the car in front of themselves for position. They can automatically pass the car ahead of him or they can automatically pass the car just ahead and challenge the car ahead of that one. The Passing &amp; Defending ratings are used when the driver is attempting to pass the car ahead.<br/><br/>",

The lives of arachnids are never easy, and surviving is always part of a complex and never ending game of hunting, eating, growing, evolving and learning. In Arachno Evo you will step into the shoes of a Spider from one of these four different species - Black Widows, Tarantulas, Jumping Spiders, or Spiny Orbweavers, and will be competing with the other spiders to be the fittest at the end of the game - ensuring the continuation of your species.<br/><br/>Hunting, gathering resources, stealing other spiders' egg sacs, gathering knowledge and undergoing mutations will be the keys to survival. But, don't forget to ensure that some of your offspring comes to life to perpetuate your evolved traits and rule the arachnid realm. Each spider species will compete to collect protein, dna strands, new knowledge, new tools, silk and steal other spiders offspring. Every piece of scrap you collect may be the little advantage that will get you one step closer to domination.<br/><br/>Arachno Evil is a tableau and engine building, tile and set collection competitive game for 1 to 4 players that is played in rounds with five phases each:<br/><br/>In the PRODUCTION phase you will be running your engine to generate resources based upon your current knowledge base (the engine is built on your tableau).<br/>The second phase is the RESOURCES COLLECTION phase during which you will collect additional resources (tiles) that got caught in the central spider web that urdergoing constant change while you and your competitors try to control the best sectors of the web.<br/>Then get into the KNOWLEDGE GATHERING phase when you will invest your generated and collected resources into learning new abilities and adding them to your tableau - at the same time, you will be trying to breed your offspring.<br/>ELIMINATING FUTURE COMPETITION is the fourth and the cruelest phase of the round, it is during this phase that you will steal other spiders' egg sacs and make sure future competition to your offspring is kept to a minimum. Stolen egg sacs may be put to use in two different manners, as protein ingestion for you to open new spaces in your knowledge base (your tableau) or as war trophies added to your set collection.<br/>The fifth phase is MAINTENANCE, during which you will discard any resources collected from the web (tiles) that won't fit in your limited inventory, replenish items and refresh exhausted elements of your tableau.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer Alexandre C.

        "description": "Yafsiga is a diceless skirmish game for two players designed to utilize a single deck of poker cards to generate thrilling, tactical skirmishes between warbands in the remains of a once-great kingdom. Players will utilize face cards to facilitate activation of their units and use the numbered cards of the chaos deck to cinch the successes they need to triumph over their opponents. A bespoke scenario generator caps off the experience, thrusting both players into the maw of danger as their warband is forced to adapt to the changing landscape of the Bloomsreach.<br/><br/>Each player has the complete freedom to build the warband of their imagination using Yafsiga's roster system. Blending the line between Wargame and Roleplaying Game, players will stat out their profiles with as many bonuses they can afford and weapons they can muster. This is the Bloomsreach, after all. Your warband will need all the help they can get.<br/><br/>After you've played standalone games with friends and foes alike, dive into narrative play with Yafsiga's campaign system, offering points of origin and motives for your warbands with unique reward and injury tables and memorable merchants to visit between skirmishes. Play a simple three-act arc in a day, or prolong your campaigns into a larger narrative with your friends as your warbands grow in renown across the Bloomsreach and beyond.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Star Tower and the Night Tower have their truce, but for us in the lands between, everything has twisted, everything has shattered, everything has been scarred by their dread magic. And power-hungry factions stir. The Crimson Coven...the Eye Cult...the Doompipers. But let them have their mad schemes. We have ours. We find the shards, we harvest them, and we fuse fresh spells. Not because we crave power, but because we must so we might survive. I shall follow the trails of those who walked before me, and fashion my own magic before I perish in my SHARD HARVEST.<br/><br/>In Shard Harvest, you play as an aspiring mage in a land following a devastating magical war between the Star Tower (in the west) and the Night Tower (in the east). An uneasy truce exists between these two schools of magic, but their war has left the land between fraught with dangerous magical energies, strange factions, and hopeful villagers who wish to gain magical power for themselves by harvesting the shards that periodically emerge across the landscape, shards the talented can fuse into powerful spells. You are one such harvester. Can you survive the unforgiving landscape long enough to attain mastery or will you perish as the many shard harvesters before you?<br/><br/>This is a board game for 1 player. You control a shard harvester, seeking the power to create spells. Travel can be challenging and tiring. Encounters can be deadly and devastating. Your spells will help you survive the perilous wild. You might die from wounds or succumb to old age. If you have one or more shards collected and you reach either of the towers (the Star Tower or the Night Tower) you win the game, and your shard harvester may either retire or resume the harvest in future games. It may take several journeys for a single shard harvester to achieve the maximum victory.<br/><br/>This is a Make-as-You-Play game, which means that you will create and modify many of the components during play. The components include the rules, the game map, index cards, a pen or pencil, a pawn for your shard harvester, and a collection of coins or cubes for the shards. Each game of Shard Harvester will evolve differently, with different terrain shaping the lands between the towers and different spells available to gain. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of shard harvesters you can make to explore your world or the number of spells they can conceive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third expansion map set for Dual Gauge!<br/><br/>These maps introduce Star Dits, which function as normal dits for most purposes &ndash; they count as a stop but cannot be tokened &ndash; but are worth more money. Depending on the map, players may also have an additional incentive to hit these stops over others. Both maps also see players in a race to grab bonuses, which also serve as another game end trigger.<br/><br/>The Netherlands map seats up to five players and features a new gauge conversion step, allowing you to flip narrow track to its standard side. Of course, what it doesn't do is change your narrow trains. You'll need to plan your train purchases carefully, and beware of opponents who might use this tactic offensively.<br/><br/>That's if you have enough time, of course! The standout feature of this map is a race to complete certain Goals. Achieving one of the map's eight Goals will win you a disc. This can be traded in later, either to place a station or to buy a precious second share of stock in a single round.<br/><br/>The Eastern US map is for three to four, and is a bit subtler. Preprinted track segments provide awkward chokepoints to either work around or embrace. Company turn order isn't fixed, but shifts from round to round depending on company stock value. Increases in that value are gated &ndash; tied to your dividends, so you'll need to work for big routes while your rivals try to block you with aggressive token play.<br/><br/>At the western end of the maps, there are the destination cities of Detroit and Chicago, each containing a set of Bonus Discs. When a company ends a run there, their President claims a disc. At the end of game, you'll get a payout based on the number of discs you've claimed.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is played with a French deck of 40 cards (without 8, 9, or 10) and betting chips.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; The field is the complete set of cards owned by each player with which the plays are made.<br/>&ndash; The open field is a set of cards from a player's field that are visible to the other players.<br/>&ndash; The closed field is a set of cards from a player's field that are hidden from the other players.<br/>&ndash; The reserve is a set of N cards that a player discards when they manage to complete their card combination (where N can be zero).<br/>&ndash; An event is a category or type of combination that determines how the winner of a round is decided. Events are classified in order of importance: &quot;by points,&quot; &quot;by length,&quot; and &quot;by rank.&quot;<br/>&ndash; An amphora is a mandatory initial bet that each player must make before starting a round.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCard values:&ndash; The Ace has a value of 1 point.<br/>&ndash; The J has a value of 8 points.<br/>&ndash; The Q has a value of 9 points.<br/>&ndash; The K has a value of 10 points.<br/>&ndash; The rest of the cards have a value equal to their own number.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHierarchy of events:&ndash; By points: refers to the lowest possible sum of points in each player's field, with a minimum of 40 points and taking into account the lowest value of the reserve in case of a tie in points. In case of a tie, we use the next event as a tiebreaker.<br/>&ndash; By length: refers to the smallest number of cards in the field. In case of a tie, we use the next event as a tiebreaker.<br/>&ndash; By rank: refers to the lowest card in the field. In case of a tie, we proceed to compare the next lowest card and so on until breaking the tie.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDistribution:In the first round, a player is randomly designated as the dealer, who will deal five cards to each player, which will be their field. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the deck. In the next round, the player to the left of the current dealer becomes the dealer. At the start of each round, players place three of their five cards face up on the table to form the &quot;open field,&quot; and leave the other two in their hand to form the &quot;closed field.&quot;<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:The player to the left of the dealer starts their turn and performs these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Take a card from the deck and place it in your &quot;closed field,&quot; or decide to stand.<br/>2. Optionally bet any number of chips, as long as it is a multiple of the amphora.<br/>3. Choose one of the cards from your &quot;closed field&quot; and place it face up in your &quot;open field&quot;.<br/>4. Decide to stand by choosing not to take any more cards from the deck and horizontally placing a number of cards from your &quot;closed field.&quot; Reserve cards are not included in the sum because they are part of the discard.<br/>5. Pass your turn to the player on your left.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBetting:Before the cards are dealt, the amphorae are placed. If a player decides to bet, the other players can:<br/><br/>&ndash; Accept the bet by saying &quot;I&rsquo;m in&quot;.<br/>&ndash; Reject the bet by saying &quot;I&rsquo;m out&quot; and lose the round.<br/>&ndash; Raise the bet by saying &quot;I raise&quot;.<br/><br/>When all players have accepted the bet, the chips accumulate in the &quot;pot&quot;. The player who wins the round takes all the chips in the pot.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:When a player runs out of chips to bet, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when only one player remains who has not been eliminated, who is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Privateer Command is a space game adventure played on 18 cards where players assume the character of a space privateer traveling planet to planet to trade different types of commodities using the dice trading prices on each planet.<br/>Apart from the daily commerce, players may complete missions ranging from destroy freighters or pirates using the space radar combat system. Some privateer jobs are just simple escort VIPS missions or mercy mission to deliver food to planets. All jobs can be found through job postings from the job seeker computer and completing each job with satisfaction will increase the players reputation to satisfy certain scenarios for the game story line.  Earning Kredts(cash) will allow players to upgrade their ship. You may buy a new turret gun, add more missiles or even hire crew who will effect certain events and outcomes in combat.<br/>Perhaps tired of the honest living, players could also smuggle some illicit cargo or even do some pirating themselves by attacking poor defenseless freighters to steal precious cargo will incurring the wrath of the local militia. The choice is yours!<br/>There are a small range of enemy fighters to face of during the orbital phase and players will be rolling combat dice to inflict damage during space dogfights or bribe your way out of sticky situations.<br/>Check your fuel gauge and your missiles and strap yourself into this semi &ldquo;open world&rdquo; space adventure!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To open the portal to the dimension of the living and fill their bellies, they need your help.<br/>If you manage to place 12 dice with the correct value and colour on your player board, the portal will open and the Baron will reward you handsomely - with fresh brains! Muahahaha!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect brains. The first player to fill all die spaces on their board wins a brain. Each player receives a player board and a cogwheel. Shuffle the green and red cards and place them in separate face-down piles on the table. Place 4 dice of each colour per player in a supply on the table.<br/><br/>Draw a green card and read it out loud. The card will show an additional rule, valid for one round. It will make the game trickier or faster and even more fun &ndash; so that every round plays differently.<br/><br/>Choose any 3 dice and roll. Your turn ends when you placed 3 dice on your board or you rolled 3 times or you draw a red card.<br/><br/>To place dice you first need to roll a pair. Place that pair on your board in the corresponding colour segment. Now insert the cogwheel into your board accordingly.You can now place single dice on your board. Place them directly adjacent to dice you&rsquo;ve already placed, in the right colour and with the value indicated by the cogwheel.<br/><br/>After your last roll, if any dice you can't place fit on other players&rsquo; boards, you must pass them those dice.<br/><br/>If you roll a straight, you may - but don't have to - draw a red card and carry out its instructions. If you roll a three of a kind, you must draw a red card. Most of the cards are beneficial, some are risky, depending on the situation and your luck.<br/><br/>End of the game: The first player to fill all die spaces on their board wins the round and gets a brain. To win the game you need to collect the requisite amount of brains: 3 brains in a game with 2 players, 2 brains in a game with more players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Incal Infinite is a cooperative board game based on the captivating universe of the famous comic book The Incal  created by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Moebius. Immerse yourself in an epic chase across planets where you must escape ruthless enemies, unravel the mysteries of the Incal, and save the galaxies.<br/><br/>In this thrilling game, you'll embody John Difool and his companions, working together as a team to defeat the enemy who seeks to seize the Incal Lumi&egrave;re. The gameplay is fast-paced, the rules are simple, but the challenge is high. Only flawless cooperation can lead you to victory.<br/><br/>The core of the game revolves around the ritual of Transfiguration, where you must reveal the Incal tokens one by one in ascending order. But beware of the sneaky attacks from the enemy, as each game introduces a different adversary with their own powers and strategies.<br/><br/>Explore different planets aboard the Meta-ship, fulfill objectives, reveal the Incal tokens, and use the mystical light of the artifact to annihilate your opponent. Communication between players is crucial, but keep the information confidential and avoid revealing anything about the Incal tokens.<br/><br/>The Incal Infinite offers an immersive experience thanks to Moebius' unmatched artwork, capturing the essence of the The Incal  universe. Each game is unique and full of twists, providing exceptional replayability.<br/><br/>Join this mythical quest to preserve the balance of galaxies in The Incal Infinite. Let yourself be carried away by this cooperative adventure where victory depends on your ability to work together and master the powers of the Incal.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>Game Rules:<br/><br/>The players must perform the ritual of Transfiguration by revealing the Incal tokens one by one. However, an enemy, different in each game, will use attacks and tricks to hinder this objective. Only the mystical light of the artifact will allow you to annihilate the adversary who is hot on your heels.<br/><br/>When their turn comes, each player can either travel with the Meta-ship, skip their turn, or attempt the Transfiguration ritual. The travel phase consists of three steps:<br/><br/>Move the Meta-ship from 1 to 6 Location tiles.<br/><br/>Explore the location where the Meta-ship has landed. If the condition required by the Location is fulfilled, there is a Revelation: the player can secretly consult the Incal token present on that Location, then place it back without revealing or communicating the number to other players.<br/><br/>Complete their hand by drawing cards until they have 4 cards in hand.<br/><br/>The player who chooses to attempt the Ritual must reveal the Incal tokens of each location one by one in ascending order. If successful, the game is won for everyone! Otherwise, the game is lost.<br/><br/>During the game, players can openly discuss the cards in their hands but must not show them to other players. It is strictly forbidden to talk about the Incal tokens, even through hints.<br/><br/>Think you've understood the strategy ? Poor you ! The game offers 2 enemies (for now). Each one has a different gameplay mechanic. Each creature has its own powers and methods to defeat you. Therefore, in each game, you'll need to collaborate and come up with a new way to overcome the challenges.<br/><br/>",

As such, it will be in some ways unlike anything you&rsquo;ve seen before. In short, what distinguishes this oracle from many others is its ability to create a very visual story.

So, from a starting point, you will shape the game universe by going through different pages.<br/><br/>As you progress, you will discover images that will present you with a variety of challenges. These may be physical, mental, social or resource-related. Successfully overcoming one of these challenges can earn you Action Points, so that you can progress from one act to the next until you reach the final challenge and end the adventure.<br/><br/>If you are already used to using an oracle, you will find that this one will guide you quite a lot, giving you the necessary guidelines to enter the world presented to you and live your story. To play this book, you will also need the first volume of the Black Sphynx collection, entitled The Sibyl&rsquo;s Scrolls. This is an extensive collection of oracles, easy and quick to use, which will be very useful as you move through the game universe. In this way, we will use The Sibyl&rsquo;s Scrolls to provide narrative, description, additional information and answers to the events of your adventure.

Beginners should use a 3x3 grid at first, so just draw a tic-tac-toe board and you're ready to go!<br/><br/>The game starts on an empty board. Before the match begins the players must choose a set of numbers equivalent to the number of spaces on the board. Since a 3x3 grid is 9 spaces you could use 1-9, 2-10, or 3-11 for example. The most popular sequence so far has been 2-10. To play you take turns writing a number from the set in an empty space. Each number can only be used once. The match is over when the board is full.<br/><br/>One player's score is the product (remember, product means multiply) of each row added up and the other player's score is the product of each column added up, so make sure you decide which player is which before you start. Highest score wins. Draws go to whichever player DOESN'T move last.<br/><br/>Use the pie rule for balance. Some opening moves are strong, and some are weak, try to figure out the most balanced options. The pattern of winning and losing choices is interesting.<br/><br/>For a co-op game try to create draws!

It was an overwhelming defeat for the Arab powers, and it has shaped the power politics of the Middle East and the world at large ever since.<br/><br/>But that&rsquo;s not the story the Egyptian public heard. The powerful radio station Voice of the Arabs, located in Cairo, pumped out an absurd set of &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; regarding the course of the war. In this tale, the Egyptians and their allies were beating the hell out of the Israelis and on their way to an overwhelming victory.<br/><br/>Voice of the Arabs is a Campaign Study (a short book of scenarios and history) based on the story of the 1967 Six-Day War as the radio station told it: with the Egyptians and their allies overcoming the well-trained and well-equipped Israelis. It is and it isn&rsquo;t alternative history: the battles never happened, but the Egyptian-sponsored fake news said they did.<br/><br/>Voice of the Arabs adds 11 new scenarios to 1967: Sword of Israel, split into two chapters, each with a battle game to link the scenarios together. This being an Avalanche Press product, there&rsquo;s also the background story of the battles that never happened. You&rsquo;ll need 1967: Sword of Israel (and only 1967: Sword of Israel) to play all 11 scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
