        "description": "FOOTBALL ACADEMY is designed as a journey through the life of a professional footballer (soccer player).  The game is designed by a former professional player - Billy Hamilton.<br/><br/>The game is conducted in three phases:<br/><br/>The Apprenticeship - three (game) years of learning the skills and demands of being a footballer, as well as performing the thankless, but necessary, tasks essential to the everyday running of a football club.  This apprenticeship is the foundation upon which the professional career is built.<br/><br/>Professional Footballer - As a professional, the player strives to maintain a high standard, on and off the pitch.  He becomes more involved in duties outside the game and must lend himself to charitable and promotional work.  His good performances on the pitch may lead to international recognition.<br/><br/>Gain International Caps - It is the dream of every player to play for his country and win the World Cup.<br/><br/>The Apprenticeship stage is conducted by undertaking three circuits of the outer board based on a roll and move mechanism.  Activities are driven by the actions required of the squares on which the playing piece lands.  After completing three circuits any Skill and Effort tokens earned are traded in for a potential rating which determines which of four paths that player follows through the Professional Stage.<br/><br/>Progress through the Professional Stage is, once again, dependent on the roll of the dice with the effects of the square being detailed in look-up tables contained in the rule book.  The idea is to proceed to the International Stage as quickly as possible, collecting goal tokens on the way.<br/><br/>During the International Stage players roll two dice (one advantage, one penalty) to progress.  Dice rolls can be modified by the trading in of goals gained during the professional phase.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the first player to enter the World Cup Winner zone at the center of the board.<br/><br/>",

Keep guessing until you miss or pass; you get up to three cards per turn.<br/><br/>Whether you're an avid traveler; a proud native or simply curious and eager to explore; City Visions is for you.<br/><br/>City Visions is now available in five cities: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago (with 60 cards) and Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>",

The third level encourages you to play the game in its purest form, pitting your wits against the other players until a final winner emerges. (You will find a &lsquo;Quick Start Guide&rsquo; on the back of the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;.)<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to be the most successful Wheeler Dealer&trade; and depending on which level is played, be the first to have a total wealth of up to 3,000,000 &lsquo;credits&rsquo;. Players start with 8,250 &lsquo;credits&rsquo; and a random hand of 4 red and 4 green &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards on level 1.  Players accumulate wealth by selectively buying and selling &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards one at a time, until a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more identical cards has been built.  Once a &lsquo;set&rsquo; has been built it may be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; for 2, 3 or 4 (sometimes more) times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  It is good practice to place the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; in the middle of the playing board.  &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; are placed at the bottom of the coloured coded deck.<br/><br/>Players must start on the &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo;, from any of the blue spaces, in a clockwise direction. Players may only progress to the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; when they have sufficient total wealth (150,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo; level 1).  As soon as one player reaches the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; all other players are permitted to enter also, even if they do not have sufficient wealth.  Wealth is accumulated faster on the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;, however, there are greater risks.  All players must announce that they are going to enter the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; before the dice are thrown. Before throwing the dice to move around either &lsquo;circle&rsquo;, players may buy one &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card from any other player for 3 times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;. Other players do not have to sell and only one card may be bought at a time.  If buying a card makes a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more the player may also sell the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; before throwing the dice to move around the &lsquo;circle&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Players may at any time during their turn secure loans on other &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards in their possession at &frac12; &lsquo;face value&rsquo; which is known as the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;. Such cards must be placed on the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;, unless they form part of the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold immediately to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;.  &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; cards may be bought by other players, when it is their turn, at 2 times &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  If asked, the owner of an &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; card must sell it to the other player, repay the bank the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;, plus 10% interest. It is good practice to place the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo; to your left, thereby keeping your cards and money away from the other players.<br/><br/>Once the above options have been exhausted, the player then rolls the dice (2 &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo; 1 &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;) and moves his playing piece the number of spaces rolled in a clockwise direction.  The player turns over the top card of the colour landed on and may buy the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card at &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  If buying this card makes a &lsquo;set&rsquo;, you must wait until your next turn before selling the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;.  If a player does not have or cannot raise enough money to buy the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card or does not want it, the player must pay the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; 10% of the &lsquo;face value&rsquo; to cover the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card is placed to the bottom of the colour coded deck. If the player cannot raise enough money to pay the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo; bankruptcy must be declared.  When landing on a yellow space (outer circle), players have the option of turning over a yellow &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card buying it or paying the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo;, or turning over a blue &lsquo;Command&rsquo; card and following the &lsquo;Commands&rsquo;.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a blue space &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo; a 5,000 &lsquo;Credit&rsquo; bonus is paid to the player from the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;. The player also takes a blue card (&lsquo;Command&rsquo; card) from the top of the deck and follows the &lsquo;Commands&rsquo; exactly. If a player lands on a blue space on the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; no bonus is paid but a &lsquo;Command&rsquo; card must be taken from the top of the blue deck and &lsquo;Commands&rsquo; followed exactly.<br/><br/>",

When your opponent has only two pieces left, or cannot move on his/her turn, then you have won the game.<br/><br/>SETUP: The board is a circle consisting of 7 rings, divided into 24 segments. There is a circle in the center called the &lsquo;dead zone&rsquo;. There are 12 black counters and 12 white counters. Arrange these on the board on the outer spaces (one per space on the outer ring of the board), with the black pieces closest to the black player, and the white pieces closest to the white player.<br/><br/>PLAY: Players take turns moving one piece per turn. The pieces may be moved &lsquo;forward&rsquo; (toward or away from the center of the board) or &lsquo;sideways&rsquo; (left or right around the ring). The pieces may be moved as far as the player wishes, but must not leave the board on the outside, enter the dead zone, move diagonally or &lsquo;jump&rsquo; a piece in its way.<br/><br/>To capture a piece, you must move your piece so that it completes a &lsquo;surround&rsquo;, then remove the captured piece from the board.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>Released under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence.

        "description": "Maze - A Maze Building Strategy Game For Two<br/><br/>The object of Maze is to construct a maze with as few tiles as possible, and to move your pawn through it from Start to Finish.<br/><br/>Each player starts with their Start/Finish tile on the table. Each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice. That player will then choose 2 out of the 3 options to perform, and allocates one of the rolled dice to each of those options. The options are:<br/><br/>Option 1: The player turns tile face up from a face down stack, until the number of face up tiles matches the number on the chosen die.<br/><br/>Option 2: The player chooses the number of tiles indicated by the die, and adds those tiles to their existing maze.<br/><br/>Option 3: The player advances their pawn through their maze as many squares (there are 2 squares per tile) as the die indicates.<br/><br/>The tiles have various configurations of bold lines around certain edges, indicating walls of the maze. When the maze is completed, it must be fully enclosed by the border, and all squares must be reachable by the pawn.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player has completed their maze and has moved the pawn from the Start to the Finish, entering Finish with an exact die roll. Alternatively, a round can end when both players have run out of tiles, and one of them has reached the end of their incomplete maze. Scores are tallied using various factors (number of squares in the maze, number of squares needed to complete the maze, number of squares the pawn needs to travel to reach the Finish, number of squares on unused face up tiles), and low score wins the round.<br/><br/>Rules are also included for variants to adjust the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/>(C) The Game Works, Inc.  1983<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE LINCOLN CHALLENGE is a monopoly style stock-market board game developed by the LINCOLN (UK) YMCA to generate funds for its activities. Lincoln is situated in the East of England and  120 miles above London<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company <br/>(there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being <br/>retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular <br/>company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. <br/>This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/><br/>After a set time<br/>When the first player becomes bankrupt<br/>When all but one player has gone bankrupt<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each row starts with three pieces in it, except the outside rows, which start with two. Each player's turn consists of the following steps: 1. Choose a row. 2. Roll a die. 3. Move pieces. The object is to 'leap' your pieces from your side of the board to the other player's side of the board and then to safety. The trick is that each die roll can only be used to move pieces on one row.<br/><br/>Play continues until all pieces controlled by a player have been removed from the board. The game ends immediately unless that player went first, in which case the other player gets one more turn to play. If the game ends with no pieces on the board, then the game is a draw. If one player has any pieces left on the board, then the other player wins.<br/><br/>",

Words must have a minimum of 3 letters. Score one point for each letter used in forming words. Bonus: Use of all 14 letters counts 25, not 14. Bonus: The word &quot;GAME&quot; counts 50 points.

It debuted in the Bradley Games catalog of 1927 and was sold through 1933. A slightly larger but cheaper edition, at 10 cents, appeared in the 1943 catalog.<br/><br/>This is a simple spin and move game. It depicts a dirigible race. The board is a very simple track, which includes a few spaces where you get another turn or you have to move back. The first player to move his &quot;balloon&quot; the full length of the yellow route and back to the airdome wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The first player to successfully hang all of his monkeys is the winner. If the tree collapses the game is over and the players start again.

Team based where you can only hang your monkeys off of your teammate's monkeys. For ages 3 and up.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Monkey Business<br/>    Monkeying Around<br/><br/><br/>",

This game was premium giveaway item to customers of Shell service stations to promote Twentieth Century Fox Film's theatrical release of their animated film, Anastasia. The game comes with the board folded into a triangular suitcase that holds plastic playing pieces of the movie's five main characters and a sheet that folds into a 6-sided die.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for players to safely arrive in Paris and defeat the evil Rasputin. They accomplish this by rolling the die to move ahead the indicated number of spaces. Players must then follow the directions on the space, if provided. To win, players must reach the last space and then be the first to make the correct die roll to destroy Rasputin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "E-Sugoroku or Picture Sugoroku is Japan's version of the roll-and-move race game. This entry in the BGG database serves for the myriad versions and themes used in E-Sugoroku, which include religion, travel, theater and more.<br/>The earliest mentions of E-Sugoroku are of Pure Land Sugoroku, where the objective of the game is to reach the Pure Land, the Buddhist Western paradise. In the 17th Century, E-Sugoroku became popular with beautiful art on boards depicting the journey from Kyoto to Edo, or scenes of famous Kabuki actors. A second wave of popularity occurred in the 19th Century, after the Meiji Restoration, at which time it also became more of a children's game. Today, E-Sugoroku sets feature contemporary themes and can be found in toy-stores and 100-yen shops. <br/>A feature of E-Sugoroku is that dice rolls do not always translate into the same number of steps. Instead, progress from one step to the next could be made only by rolling specific numbers, or different numbers could indicate different paths to be taken.<br/>E-Sugoroku should be distinguished from Ban-Sugoroku (BGG entry at Sugoroku), a game with an earlier origin and which is more akin to Backgammon. The generic term Sugoroku literally means 'double six' and is applied to board games that use dice.<br/><br/>Reference: Masukawa Koichi, Scenic Views: E-Sugoroku. In: Asian Games: The Art of Contest.

The games in this series used a series rulebook which contained the production rules, ship information, movement and combat rules, etc., and a game-specific rulebook describing the scenario, units, and special rules.<br/><br/>This particular game covers a war between the Xenon Empire and the Federation of the Monad. From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim, but with some sections removed):<br/><br/><br/>        STAR WARS OF THE XENON EMPIRE: Crusade against the Warlords. Connected to the Deliverance Game, this is also a game in itself. IT has the most unique feature, as every BFA game has a new feature incorporating a special principles from others. THIS IS THE ONLY GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLITAIRE in its fullest sense. Yet, it is designed for &quot;LIVE&quot; play with one or two additional players. Many Gamers not having partners often play by themselves, but  the Paper-Computer set-up to function alone or with two players allows unique and individual actions!<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        Xenon has a vital Colony off the board (on another map in another Game). This Colony may be struck by the Kons Dirak Ahm, the oppressive Empire of such huge size and tyrannical rule that all independent Cultures fear it. Only the numerous revolts needing reprisals and other Cultures being overrun have prevented the Xenon Cluster-Colonies from being brought to heel. Xenon needs to consolidate its own systems before attempting to aid their Colonies, yet their Vast Cluster System is surrounded by the War-Lords - small petty Groups that of themselves have little power, but nibble away at Xenon Zones. To wipe them  out is easy, but time-consuming.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        [deleted for space]<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        The Monads, using the deadly Monadian &quot;web&quot;, a Plasma Body of sheer energy that drains and implodes ships and holds fleets in submission. The Xenon Vulcan Cannon and their &quot;Harpoon&quot; Missile Conglomerates (each one as big as Cuba or Florida!), and a variety of other weapons such as Diffusion Mines, Sabre Beams, Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, and even the Death Ray of Doom!<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        The entire Xenon Fleet is enclosed, as well as the Monads' strange ships and the Warlord forces, but over 30 Tactical-Variant Cards, play aids, and Scenario Manual. No two games or Strategies can ever be alike! The 22x28-inch rigid Map-Board predominates in Brilliant Reds and &quot;hot&quot; pinks - a startling appearance once observed by new players.<br/><br/><br/>",

You might stop off at another bar or stop for some fast food. You might be able to call a cab to drive you home (that's the plan). You better hope you get a chance to call a cab because there are police cars all over the board waiting to pull over DRUNK DRIVERS.<br/><br/>If your car lands on one of these spaces you must take a sobriety test (30 different tests, tongue twisters, memory tests, physical challenges, etc...), if you fail, you get a DWI and will find yourself in JAIL.<br/><br/>There are over 100 spaces on the board (exploding with exceptional artwork and design) telling you to do all sorts of crazy things. The game can be different every time you play it. You can rear-end people, cut each other off the road and even get into an accident, 3 accidents and/or 3 DWI's and your out of the game. You can also take a different route the next time you play, there are forks in the roads so you can go two different ways, the long route or the short route, which way will you be going? Who knows what's going to happen to you on your way home.<br/><br/>So call a cab and stay out of jail. The players in the cabs usually make it home before anyone, thus being the winner.<br/><br/>",

His picture appears on the box cover and on the board, and a letter signed by him is in the box. Another sheet invites people to write in to become a game-club member, in order to get souvenirs and a signed photo.<br/><br/>Communications SportStar inc., the publisher of this game, were also TV producers of Hockey-related television programming. The game itself was released to publicize a sports trivia TV show of the same name, then in development, that would have been co-hosted by Guy Lafleur. The show was never produced.<br/><br/>The game is a standard trivia game, with questions in 5 categories: Hockey, Baseball, Football, Olympic sports, and miscellaneous.<br/><br/>The game is played in two phases. Starting on the inner ring, the player can go in a direction of their choice the number of spaces indicated by their die roll, in order to accumulate 150 points. In the first phase, a player may choose to move to the outer ring. Once they have reached 150, a player will attempt to answer the most consecutive questions in each of the five sides of the outer ring, one per category. Missing a question forces the player to leave that side. A completed side is worth 40 points. The first player to accumulate a total of 350 points wins the game and is named &quot;Prodige du Sport&quot; (i.e. &quot;Sports Prodigy&quot;).<br/><br/>",

Take your turn, flip the square so that your opponent's color is on top, signifying that it's his turn, then walk away.  When your opponent sees that he's up, he can stop, play out his turn, flip the square, and go on about his business.<br/><br/>This feature justifies the magnetic aspect of the game.  It can be set up indefinitely and be played out as quickly or as slowly as you desire.  This makes it suitable for home or office play when you don't have time to sit down and play an entire game start to finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Be the first to patch Goofy's holey socks and win!&quot;<br/><br/>Players choose one of four pairs of tri-colored socks.  Each pair of socks have 6 holes in them that must be repaired by a patch chip of the same color.  The patch chips are face down in a common pool.  Taking turns pulling a chip from the pool, each player may potentially repair up to two holes each turn.  But if a moth chip is drawn, that player must return a played patch chip to the pool.  The first player to patch all their holes wins.<br/><br/>The chips are not drawn at random.  All chips remain in sight during the game, but all look identical when face down.  This introduces a memory element to the strategy.<br/><br/>Recommended for ages 5 through 9.<br/><br/>Manufactured in the USA by the Western Publishing Company Inc., Racine WI 63404<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;An Exciting Way to Discover Black Heritage!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a well-produced game that tests the players' knowledge of famous black people, black history, and black culture, with a predominantly American focus.  The primary goal of the game is to score points by answering questions on the above subjects, with individual turn actions keyed by a basic roll-and-move mechanic.<br/><br/>The significant twist in the game is that each player takes one of twenty cards sets, each set consisting of 11 cards.  Ten are clue cards related to a single black historical figure or celebrity.  Another card in each set has the person's name and picture.  During the game, the other players have the opportunity privately or publicly hear the clues and try to guess the character.  The clues are divulged based on the players answers to toss-up questions on cards (&quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Go Back to your Roots&quot;), drawn when they land on the corresponding squares.  Other squares allow free guessing of secret identities, answering questions for additional points, and other more typical roll-and-move actions.  Points for answers/guesses are tallied on paper for as the game progresses.<br/><br/>This game appears to have a good balance between movement, deduction, and trivia mechanics.  An unfortunate rule is that players who have their secret identities guessed are then out of the game, so it would help to have the most obscure figure possible. (There were two of twenty I was completely unfamiliar with, and a couple more I needed a clue to recognize.)<br/><br/>There will not be much replay after all the IDs have been used...but if that happens the game will have largely succeeded in it primary educational goal.<br/><br/>",

Two players strive on a board of seven points, each with three pieces, to block in their opponent's pieces so that the opponent cannot move.  Information on this game is sparse, as it is overshadowed by the similar-looking three men's morris, for which it is often mistaken.  A game board in the Hull and East Riding Museum, in Yorkshire, England, is often mistaken for this game in photographs but would rather seem to be an incomplete three men's morris board, this has been confirmed by the curator.<br/><br/>",

Perhaps the highest or lowest numbers drink, the last person to perform a gesture drinks, or the losers of a silly contest drink. Contest ideas are included on the back, such as: hairiest ass, loudest belch, dirtiest joke, or best armpit fart. This is a game for 2 to 100 players!&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes with five six-sided dice, each with text on all faces. The brown die indicates the action and the other dice are alike except that they are colored blue, yellow, orange or purple, to represent four different teams. The game has no stated objective or winning conditions, but presumably it is the same as all drinking games - to get away with drinking the least (or you may prefer the most).<br/><br/>Amusingly, this drinking game comes with a warning, &quot;Not to be played with alcohol&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Amaze your friends when you know the answer to: &quot;Where was the first Velociraptor fossil found?&quot;  If you are a junior player, do you know the answer to &quot;What did a T-Rex eat?&quot;  When you cannot answer some questions correctly, you might be asked to perform an outrageous action and pretend you are an Allosaurus chasing your prey!!!<br/><br/>[Text from back of box]<br/><br/>Players take turns asking the person to their left questions from the back of the next card drawn from the pile.  Standard questions may be quite difficult, even for an adult, while &quot;junior&quot; questions are very simple to accommodate younger players.  A correct answer earns the player the card while an incorrect answer may require them to perform an &quot;outrageous action,&quot; such as flapping their arms like a Pteranodon.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to construct a T-Rex skeleton composed of four separate images on the backs of the cards they earn.  Obviously many cards contain duplicate images, so reaching this goal may require more than four correct answers.<br/><br/>All information is taken from the book Dinosaurs by Michael and Caroline Carroll; religious content is held to a minimum on the cards themselves (2 of 100 questions).<br/><br/>",

A model F4 Phantom jet was able to make landings on the mock-up carrier deck.<br/><br/>An arrestor hook on the undercarriage of the jet would catch a nylon trip wire on the replica flight deck during a landing, stopping the plane and raising a trap door on the deck, indicating a point scored for a successful landing.<br/><br/>Flight Deck was played in competition between two players, but was also suitable for solo play.<br/><br/>Airfix released an improved version - Outside the Scope of BGG - in 1975, featuring a catapult launch system and improved mechanics -<br/><br/>",

The 4 x 4 grid is randomly created at the beginning of the game and the tiles can also have the 'action' or 'passengers' attribute on them as well as the track.  Players move by rolling a die and moving around the tiles following the arrows and only on track that can connect, if they end on an 'action' tile then they take an action card, if they end on a 'passenger' tile then they collect 3 passengers.  The next player then continues to play from the position of the last player<br/><br/>The action tile cards have different effects such as flipping the tiles over to the other side, making the player lose all their passengers, moving them to the bottom of the board, or cause them to end their turn.<br/><br/>The game continues until either a player decides to end the game, this gives the other players 2 turns to get additional passengers or the game ends when there are no more passenger cards left.  In both situations the player with the most passengers wins.<br/><br/>The box includes 16 track maze cards, 14 action cards, 40 passengeer cards and 1 player token (which is used by all players).<br/><br/>",

Each road along the board has a posted speed limit.  If on your turn, you exceed the speed limit, you have to roll another dice and move that many spaces backwards as a penalty for speeding.  There are a few different routes you may take (each with different speeds) as well as various spaces on the board where you must stop.<br/><br/>Overall the game is very simple and there is little strategy.<br/><br/>",

But be warned. There'll be both good news and bad news along the way - making it a game which can both unite and divide its players.<br/><br/>Victory may be only one news story away, but a simple act of sabotage from a cunning opponent can throw the game wide open.

The player is expected to avoid the many pitfalls of the route, to arrive at control points within the required time, to achieve a good average time, to not waste time at controls points and to persevere despite the sometimes adverse weather conditions and other hazards which will get in their way!<br/><br/>A second objective of the game is to see which players can get all of their team past the finish line in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines intact.<br/><br/>The game is played in two sequences: 1) The practice Lap at St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, 2) The Paris-Brest-Paris-Randonneur.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An early card driven pitch-by-pitch baseball simulation designed for two players.<br/><br/>Game Contents: Playing Board, Deck of 36 Baseball Cards, 4 Wooden Markers for Batter and Base Runners, 2 Wooden Markers for Strikes and Balls, 1 Wooden Marker for Outs, 1 Wooden Marker for Runs Scored in an Inning, Score Sheet, Instructions.<br/><br/>To play, the cards are shuffled and held in the hand of the player at bat.  The player in the field calls a pitch (fastball, curve, slow ball, drop, or knuckle ball).  The result of the pitch is read from the top card.  Pitch results include strike, ball, foul ball, hit batsman, wild pitch, balk or &quot;field play.&quot;<br/><br/>When &quot;field play&quot; is the result of the pitch, the card is turned over to the Field Play side to determine the play outcome. Different play outcomes are included on each card, and the specific outcome used is based upon the number of outs and the number and location of baserunners.<br/><br/>After the result for a particular pitch has been determined, that card is discarded and play continues with the next card in the deck.<br/><br/>Although the game concept is simple, it works quite well, and play can be very competitive.  However, the strategic aspects of baseball are ignored.  There is no bunting, hit and run, positioning of the defense, etc.<br/><br/>This game has one notable oddity.  The game board is a depiction of a baseball field with defenders drawn at the normal defensive positions.  The defenders are numbered based upon standard baseball scoring conventions, except that the corner outfielders are reversed--that is, the rightfielder is shown as &quot;7&quot; and the leftfielder as &quot;9.&quot;<br/><br/>This game was produced and marketed for at least 10 years under a variety of names: &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Baseball Game for Young America&quot;, and &quot;Little League Baseball&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the description on the back of the box:<br/><br/>Metagon is a game of skill in which chance plays a small part. It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.<br/><br/>The object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.<br/><br/>1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.<br/><br/>2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.<br/><br/>The game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board.  The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players race their horses through a track which has various printed events as well as &quot;Chance&quot; and &quot;What the judge says&quot; spaces, both of which give cards that the players keep for the duration of the game, and which represent events happening during the competition, giving either positive or negative points. Unlike most roll-and-move games, while getting to the Finish first (and second, third etc.) carries a good bonus it does not mean automatic victory; once all the players have reached the Finish line, points gathered from the cards are counted also and the one with highest point total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players move their pawns around a map depicting the 2006 member states of the European Union. After each move the players answer questions arranged in five broad topics: A) The EU; B) sport; C) history &amp; geography; D) art, science and technology; and E) society, nature &amp; culture. For a correct answer the player receives an EU-flag within that topic. After collecting ten flags (two flags of each topic A-E) the player heads for goal and wins the game.<br/><br/>This seems a very simple game that has its primary purpose in teaching matters concerning the EU with European history and culture. The components of the game are nice and look professional enough, but there is very little to call a design here.<br/><br/>",

From the starting area, paths of circles lead to a picture of each animal. The game is divided in two phases; in phase I, players try to collect the footprints of their chosen animal, being occasionally hindered by Wind or Snow. Phase II starts as soon as one player has collected all 14 footprints of their animal, and in this phase the players use their collected footprints as &quot;stepping stones&quot; to reach the picture of their animal on the board; naturally, in this phase those who managed to collect more prints in phase I have a better chance of success. Winner is the first player to reach their goal.<br/><br/>This is a reworking of a similarly themed game by Peliko's preceding publisher Paletti, WWF Taktinen Luontopeli, using very similar components and game board.<br/><br/>5 Finnish marks (about 1.30&euro; in 2020) from the sale of each copy were donated to Lastenklinikoiden Kummit RY, a Finnish charity raising funds in support of five university hospitals providing a clinic for children.<br/><br/>Published with the new Peliko logo already, while the Finnish mark is still in use; therefore, this is from sometime in the 1990's.<br/><br/>",

The children in the family liked to play with the nativity set so the pieces are scattered throughout the house. Players must use logic to correctly discover which piece was the last to be found, which room it was found in, and who found it.<br/><br/>This is a Christian Family game, which uses a mechanic similar to that of Clue (the cards players try to identify are placed in an envelope under the board), but without the murder theme. There are variations provided in the rules to make it more or less challenging depending on the ages of the children involved.<br/><br/>The game features a miniature nativity set and distinctive art on the board, box, and player tokens. The game also came with an offer from the publishers to order new custom drawn player tokens of your family based on a photo you mailed in.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules: In brief the purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 48 states shown on the map of the United States as possible.<br/><br/>Description from the rulebook:<br/><br/>Three hundred years ago the world powers were moving.  Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.<br/><br/>It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &quot;Order of Conquest&quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.<br/><br/>In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.<br/><br/>In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.<br/><br/>In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.<br/><br/>In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.<br/><br/>To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The exciting race game where players pieces may suddenly disappear with a &quot;plonk&quot;.<br/><br/>The game board consists of two layers. The top layer has a race course with hole on each square surrounded by a plastic rim to hold upright the narrow player pawns. The bottom layer is on black card with various holes and sits inside the box. When the upper board is placed on top most squares on the race track have a solid footing for the pawns, but some have holes that allow the pawns to fall through into the box and out of the game. The boards are square so that they can be rotated in relation to each other to provide variable distribution of the holes.<br/><br/>Each player takes 5 pawns. The winner is the first person to get a pawn to the end of the track. Players roll the dice and move one of their pawns the distance indicated. If they have multiple pawns on the track they can chose which one to move. When a hole is discovered by a player losing their piece to it all players need to remember where it is so that they don't repeat the mistake.<br/><br/>",

A player can pass other pawns, but cannot pass the walls.<br/>To remove a wall, a player has to land exactly on the space where the wall stands. Then another player draws a card and chooses a question or an instruction. If the player answers the question correctly or fulfills the assignment, the wall is removed and placed elsewhere on the board.<br/>The player who finishes exactly with one of his/her pawns on the destination field, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game En-Ar-Co Automobile Tour was developed by EN-AR-CO Brands of Scientific Refining and produced by the National Refining Company in 1919. Each player spins to see who will go first. Players then spin in rotation, each player taking one turn. You then move a number of circles equal to the number that you spun. If the dial of the spinner lands exactly on a line you take another turn. If more than one auto lands on a circle they both stay there. Some circles give players one or more extra spins while at some other points you must go back a certain number of circles. If a player lands on the last circle located at number 45 before entering the large final circle, he must spin a #1 in order to win the game.<br/><br/>See Also:<br/><br/>     En-Ar-Co Auto Game A similar 1925 game also issued by En-Ar-Co, with a different track.<br/><br/><br/>",

The game includes a spinner, a game board and four wooden pieces as well as directions on how to play the game. The game is a simple spin and move game which was somewhat a kin to Sorry or any other game of that ilk. One spun the spinner and with a spin of a 6 one got a piece onto the board. After more spins that piece and others moved around the board and eventually wound up in the home square. Successfully getting all pieces into the home square resulted in you winning the game.<br/><br/>",

Free Agents: Someone who is self employed or freelance (or don't specify their employment).  These get two moves per turn.<br/>2. Chiefs: Any card from an executive or someone in an obvious leadership position.  These get +1 to attacks if they touch their opponent.<br/>3. Underlings: Anyone else.

The board has 40 holes in it, with a separate cardboard disc underneath. The bottom disc has 21 holes and can be rotated incrementally so through-and-through holes open and close in the board as they match up.<br/><br/>Players have two pawns each, spin to see who starts (this is the only function of the spinner in the game), then move one space at a time from Launch Pad through the different zones, then back to Earth. If he lands on a hole in the &quot;Orbit&quot; zone that shows a dot in his colour, he can &quot;shoot the Space Gun&quot; (rotate the bottom disc one space left or right using a finger hole). This will make some new holes open and others close in the board, and any pawns falling through new holes must begin again. The winner is the first player to have both his pawns complete the journey to the Moon and back again.<br/><br/>Box says this game was based on &quot;Outer Space Station #1&quot; by Abel-Klinger, a game publisher in West Germany.<br/><br/>",

Tokens are placed in the locations indicated on the board, as are the shuffled surprise and destination cards. The first destination card is turned face up.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn by rolling the two dice and moving round the board with the object of being first to reach the destination address. A player rolling doubles is allowed to go directly to the destination and claim the card. Each destination card claimed requires a payment of $50. Extra money may be acquired by moving to indicated spaces at a rate of ten times a dice roll (doubled if doubles  are rolled). Spaces marked 'surprise' require a relevant card to be taken by a player and the text is acted upon. A player landing upon another's space may purchase a destination card for $25 from that player or take another turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has collected ten destination cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The box contains two games.<br/><br/>TWO'S GOLF shares some features similar to the much more recently released Box of Golf.  The score sheet consists of 18 hole, each consisting of 22 spaces.  The first space is the tee, the last space represents Out of Bound, and the remaining 20 in between are either various hazards (water, shrubs, sand), fairway, or the flag.  The flag is usually between spaces 8 and 20, depending on the length and par of the hole.<br/><br/>To begin a hole, you must pick up the number of dice corresponding to your first choice for a club (3 for driver, 2 for iron, 1 for putter, 1 for sand wedge).  Ball movement is determined by the sum of the dice rolled.  Continue on making a new club selection, taking a swing, and marking off the ball movement until it lands in the hole.<br/><br/>The six-sided dice in game are all identical: 1, 1, 2, 2*, 3, 3.  The asterisk gives you the ability to double the sum of the dice roll.<br/><br/>2'S WILD is a Yahtzee clone specifically designed to take advantage of the dice for TWO'S GOLF.  Five dice are used for the various scoring combinations.  There are score pads included for that game as well.<br/><br/>",

Players start in the head and move towards the tail. Landing on a coloured space gives the player one counter (quarter) of that colour; landing on a white has no effect; and landing on a black space causes the player to lose a number of quarters, the colors chosen by player.<br/><br/>Quarters collected during the game are scored when all players have either finished or dropped out. Quarters forming a circle of a single colour score the most, quarters forming multi-coloured circles score less, while left-over quarters score least.<br/><br/>During the game, there are four chances to drop out, identified by the grey shaded areas. This may make sense because the numbers in the black segments increase towards the end, and a player that has collected a good set of circles may want to cut her losses rather than carry on.  <br/>(This is the sole tactical choice in the game.)<br/><br/>Paletti game no. 4065<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>OOgal is a fast-paced exciting game building on the dual classic concepts of word-building of Scrabble(tm) and dice play of Yahtzee(tm). In OOgal, players roll the special dies in an attempt to build words with the greatest point score. Unique 20-sided dies contain all the consonants, while the custom cubes contain all fo the vowels. If OOgal eyes on the special black die is rolled, an OOgal occurs and the score is doubled. A 60-second sand timer keeps the action going while a player races through multiple rolls to build the greatest scoring word. Multiple words, slang terms, and proper names can also be spelled at the discretion of the players. Great game for the entire family at home, at camp, or on the go. Makes a perfect gift!<br/><br/>",

Over 300 vehicles provided various duties, as well. The chosen sector for the attack lay between the Red 8th and 9th Armies and was not covered well&mdash;it was very porous. The Red 36th and 40th divisions held the 100 km section of the line (with gaping holes where 40km was not covered) through which Mamontov's corps&rsquo; passed. Mamontov used air reconnaissance to find a sector where his cavalry could slip through without serious opposition to avoid contact with Bolshevik units and struck deep into the Red rear with orders to wreck the rail lines and destroy military stores as they advanced.<br/><br/>The Mamontov Offensive ripped through the Red lines and at lightening speed made incredible advances into the rear of the Red beast- 125 miles! Both Trotsky and Lenin were very concerned about the White advance and the ineptness of their own troops, many of which defected to Mamontov at Tambov, a supply center. Like the panzers of WW2, the White cavalry seemed unstoppable. So much so, that Red air units were sent flying to find them and attack.<br/><br/>Like all White attacks, it too, had begun well. However, Mamontov's men were not professionals, they more like mercenaries and were easily diverted to looting, mayhem and rape, which turned the local population against them. By Sept 10, many of his men had simply went home with the loot and soon he found himself and those that remained in a &quot;situation&quot; at Voronezh nearly surrounded as Red troops had finally gathered. Denikin ordered his Kuban Corps to attack from the south to divert Red divisions against Mamontov, and for the next week, a bitter battle ensued with Mamomtov trying to breakout.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 22x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. Scale is 3 days to a turn, 3-4 miles a hex, brigades. A very fast moving game as time plays against the Whites<br/><br/>NOTE: Rules are split between an 11-page &quot;Russian Civil War Series' core rulebook (actually 11 loose sheets printed single-sided), and a 5-page double sided Rampage special rules book (joined by a single staple). Counters are on a single sheet of paper and must be mounted &amp; cut. The map is on two 11x17&quot; sheets and must be joined together.<br/><br/>",

The prototype won first prize in the Economic Information Office's recycling competition and was then published by EIO in cooperation with the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.<br/><br/>The game board has several recycling facilities for different types of waste; each player is dealt five waste cards which they then have to deliver to the correct facilities. First one to get rid of all 5 cards is the winner. There are also event cards, which may help or hinder the players.<br/><br/>The die and playing pieces are wooden; the rest of the game is made of recycled paper and cardboard.<br/><br/>",

This is accomplished by laying down cards to form the queen's procession.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three cards and the remainder of the pack is placed face downwards in the centre of the table. Players look at their cards and the one on the left of the dealer takes the top card from the centre pack. He then sees if he has a police-card in his hand. If so he can start the preparations for his procession immediately by laying this card on the table in front of him, face upwards. Each player makes his own procession. There are eight cards in a complete procession. If he has no police-card he passes one card, face downwards, to the next player.<br/>If he has been able to play a police-card he takes another card from the centre pack and, if able, plays a FORCES card on to his procession and so on. When unable to add to his procession he passes any one card, face downwards, to the next player, leaving himself with three cards as at first.<br/>Cards must be placed in a line in the following order: policeman, 3 different forces cards in any order (soldier, sailor, airman), royal coach, page, archbishop, and queen. Each processional card placed in front of a player scores 10 points and the queen-card scores 30 points, giving a maximum of 100 points per game.<br/><br/>A game is completed when one player has presented the Queen for crowning or the last card of the centre pack has been taken.<br/><br/>There are 54 cards in the deck:<br/>7 x Policeman cards<br/>5 x Soldier cards<br/>5 x Sailor cards<br/>5 x Airman cards<br/>5 x Royal Coach cards<br/>5 x Page cards<br/>4 x Archbishop cards<br/>4 x Queen cards<br/>14 useless cards (1 each of Trumpeter, Royal Arms, Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Union Jack, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Ceylon.)<br/><br/>",

Each card contains 1 number, 1 color, and one suit, making 125 cards, 1 for each number/color/suit combination.<br/><br/>This deck can play many games. (14 are currently published at with more to come when I sell 100 decks.)   But all games take advantage of the fact that it's a 3 dimensional card.  Play 3D versions of Crazy Eights, Memory, Spite and Malice, Speed, Poker, Rummy, Blackjack, Cassino, Euchre, Tic Tac Toe, and 2 different versions of Klondike Solitaire.   Plus there's 2 games which cannot be duplicated with regular cards.<br/><br/>One is a 3-variable trick-taking game where you want to take certain cards but not others,Circles are worth positive points, but are the least powerful suit, and squares are negative points but the most powerful suit in terms of trick taking.  But Number rank and color team declarations take precedence over suit.   Can be played cooperatively, 2 on 2, or 4 for themselves.  Most net positive points wins.<br/><br/>The other game is an elimination card game where the object is to give someone six of the same number, color, or suit to eliminate them, and to be the last one standing.   Blacks, Blobs, and Question Marks always bring its owner closer to elimination.   And you can play offensively on your opponents cards, or defensively to make it harder to eliminate you.   A near perfect chess match with cards for 2 players, a game of negotiations if played with more.<br/><br/>Coming soon: 3D versions of 2 competitive solitaires, Thirty-One, Go Fish, 2 Versions of Egyptian War, another version of Spite and Malice, another version of Speed, Pope Joan, and Eleusis.<br/><br/>",

Nine cards are dealt to each player, with the four remaining cards forming the discard pile. The dice are thrown by each player in turn, and on each throw all players may discard one card corresponding to the total number thrown.<br/><br/>When a check turns up, the player throwing must take the top card from the discard pile rather than discarding, though other players may discard a card which equals the number thrown on the other die. When two checks are thrown, the throwing player must take two cards. When one player runs out of cards, each other player pays him one cardboard chip for each card remaining in their hand. Players play to &quot;100, 200 or any agreed number of points.&quot;<br/><br/>",

As in Ludo, 2 game pieces are not allowed in the same spot, so the last piece entering the spot remains, the other one goes back to the center. Goal is to reach the color corresponding corner of the board with all 4 of you game pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As suggested by the name, Go Fish the Board Games uses the basic mechanics of the card game Go Fish.  Players each select a color and the goal is to collect all three of the fish matching that color.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all the fish tokens are placed face down in the middle of the board.  Each player picks one fish token to begin then, in order, players spin and spinner.  If the spin results in a &quot;Go Fish,&quot; the player selects a fish token from the middle of the board.  If a number is spun, the player moves on the board and takes the action on the space.  There three actions: &quot;Go Fish&quot; where a player selects a piece from the middle, &quot;Shark!&quot; where a player must put a fish back in the middle, and &quot;Ask!&quot; where a player can ask another player for a fish.  If a player is asked for a fish and doesn't have it, he tells the other player to go fish.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately after one player collects all three fish of his color.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played in rounds. In each round, a planet is picked. Players then try to conquer that planet by deploying the largest amount of troops. A conquered planet earns victory points. When Coruscant, the galaxies capital planet, is conquered, the game ends and the player with the highest victory point total wins.<br/><br/>Troops are represented by cards; each card has one of six colors and a number from 1 to 5 on it. A set of cards of the same color can be deployed as the force trying to conquer a planet. The total sum of the numbers printed on these cards is the troop's strength. The strongest army wins the planet, earning 2 to 4 victory points for the player who deployed that army.<br/><br/>Since the game is based on 2008's &quot;Clone Wars&quot; animated TV series, some characters from the series are featured as &quot;generals&quot;. For each color, there is a Jedi/Sith leader or general that can be earned during the game and then played to add a +3 troop bonus. Available leaders are Commander Cody, Yoda, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker, Asaj Ventress and Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players rally new troops from the card deck to conquer the next planet.<br/><br/>The gameplay is rather quick and simple, strategic options are limited, and some luck is involved in getting matching colored cards from the card deck.<br/><br/>There is an alternate name for this game: &quot;Sith gegen Jedi&quot; (Sith vs. Jedi).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June 1944, the Russian High Command decided to knock Finland out of the war with an offensive designed to ultimately reach Helsinki. On paper, the Red force allocations seemed to guarantee victory by 4 to 1 and more. Hundreds of tanks, artillery and aircraft were opposed by weak Finnish forces, many of them at only 50% strength. Only a few Finnish divisions opposed over 15 Red divisions at full strength.The Finns were clearly worried and rightly so, as when the Red offensive began in late June, one Finnish defensive line crumbled after another! The only equalizer was the terrain mostly of forests and lakes. The few key roads channeled any offensive plans. By the 28th of June, the Finns had already sounded the SOS call to the Germans for help. Hitler sent in the Luftwaffe, StG 303, and hundreds of Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks. The Red steamroller stalled, started and inched closely to Ihantala, the last Finn defenses. When July arrived, Ihantala was threatened. The Finns were close to collapse-but would they?<br/><br/>",

It is a relaxation of menfolk, young and old alike. The holes (called oto; that is &quot;house&quot;) are usually dug in the ground, but wooden boards or receptacles of dried mud also exist. The counters (nyi baro; literally &quot;child of bar&eacute;&quot;) are pebbles, seeds or balls made of dried mud.<br/><br/>The game is based on much counting and calculation.<br/><br/>Bar&eacute; was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971. A minor variant of the game is Tok Ku Rou.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The game board consists of four rows each of 12 holes with two counters per hole.<br/><br/>Each player owns two rows and only plays in those rows, but tries to capture counters from his opponent's side.<br/><br/>The first move is performed simultaneously. The first player who reaches an empty hole starts the first move of the second stage of the game. Nothing can be captured in the first stage.<br/><br/>After the first move, players move alternately.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one by one in the following holes. If the last counter falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap until the last counter is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>A hole from which a move is initiated must contain at least two counters.<br/><br/>If the last stone lands in an occupied hole of the inner row and the two enemy holes opposite are both occupied, the stones of these two holes are captured.<br/><br/>The captured counters are sown into the ensuing holes starting from the hole that immediately follows the one which had effected the capture.<br/><br/>If a player failed to pick up his captures, his opponent may move them together in one of the two holes in question, so that they can no longer be captured.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player is no longer able to move, because he has been reduced to single counters. His opponent wins the game.<br/><br/>",

For the rest of the game and match you keep playing this way. <br/>This may leed to both players playing in opposite senses. <br/>In some cases it was recorded that, at each move, players choose the sense of sowing. <br/>There were other variants commented, but never on a consistent way. &quot;<br/><br/>The source is quoted here and seems reliable in spite of inperfect English.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "K&acirc;ra is a mancala game, which is played by the Bagara in Kordofan Province, Sudan, primarily during the fasting month of Ramadan. It was first described by R. Davies in 1925.<br/><br/>The counters are generally small balls of dried clay, called t&ucirc;b (&quot;bricks&quot;). A hole can become very full of balls, with the result that it is difficult to foresee the effect of moving its contents.<br/><br/>According to Davies:<br/><br/><br/>        this explains an otherwise obscure allusion to the celebrated Sheikh Musa M&acirc;dibbo, late nazir of the Rizeigat tribe, as bahr K&acirc;ra ghar&icirc;g - &quot;a deep sea of k&acirc;ra&quot;. The nazir's reputation was that he would sit in council with his sheikhs and elders, and would listen to all their opinions, but would not disclose his own, so that the result of the &quot;meglis&quot; was as unpredictable as that of moving the contents of a very full house at k&acirc;ra.<br/><br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>K&acirc;ra is rather unusual since it can be played by any number of players and seems to work very well when played by four. Each player owns three consecutive holes (called &quot;houses&quot;) and one store hole called makk&acirc;la (plural: mak&acirc;k&icirc;l). The playing holes are arranged in a circle with the mak&acirc;k&icirc;l in the center.<br/><br/>Each house has seven balls at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in single laps and in a counter-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the move ends in an opponent's hole or in your own right-hand one, the player &quot;eats&quot; the contents of all enemy holes containing 2, 4 or 6 balls.<br/><br/>If a player can't move, he passes.<br/><br/>The game ends when nothing can be ever captured again. The winner is the person who captured most balls.<br/><br/>Although not stated by Davies, according to Ralf Gering it might be a good idea that diagonally opposite players must form a team to prevent unfair coalitions during the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game from Somalia.<br/><br/>From Mancala World:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Layli_Goobalay_(long_board\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Layli_Goobalay_(long_board</a>)<br/><br/>&quot;Layli Goobalay (literally: &quot;closing the holes&quot;) is a mancala game played in Somalia. The board is dug in the ground and the pieces are dry camel dung called salo. Slightly different variants of the same game exist, among them a more simple game, which is promoted by the Somali ethnomathematician Jama Musse Jama in Italy.<br/><br/>The following rules were observed in 1931 by G. Marin in the area of Berbera, Somaliland, where it was (and probably still is) a favorite pastime of the Isaaq clan.<br/><br/>&quot;Layli Goobalay is played on a board that consists of two parallel rows of 12 holes on each side. A player controls the 12 holes on his side of the board.<br/><br/>[Holes all start with 4 seeds each.]<br/><br/>Each move a player empties the contents of one of his holes that is not an uur and distributes one ball in each of the following holes in a clockwise direction (as observed by G. Marin).<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped in an occupied hole, the player takes its contents, including the last dropped ball, and continues to distribute the balls in a clockwise direction. The move ends if the last ball is dropped in an empty hole.<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped into an empty hole on the player's own side, he captures this last ball together with the contents of the opposite hole if it contains one, two, four or more balls. A move which captures nothing is called abar (&quot;famine&quot;).<br/><br/>If the opposite hole contains three balls, one of these is put into the hole in which the last ball was dropped, so that each hole has two balls. These two holes now form an uur (&quot;pregnant&quot;), and both are owned to their creator. An uur may never be emptied by either player. Balls must be added to an Uur during the normal course of distribution. However, if the last ball is dropped into an uur, the move ends.<br/><br/>The game is over when one player has no legal move left. Each side then counts the balls he has captured together with the balls in his uurs and any balls remaining on his side of the board outside of uurs. Sometimes towards the end of the game the balls continue to circulate in a repeating pattern. Then the remaining balls are divided between both players as in Oware. The player who captures most balls wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Variant:<br/><br/>There is a similar game played on a 2x6 board in the south of Somalia, which is always played counterclockwise. It has special rules for matches that were first described on wikimanqala:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Layli_goobalay_%28short_board%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Layli_goobalay_%28short_boar...</a><br/><br/>",

It is mainly the relaxation of menfolk, young and old alike. The game is rather unusual as only multiples of four seeds are moved.<br/><br/>The game was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 (as Game 100) who learned it from James Tut, at this time a student in Addis Ababa.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on two rows each of seven holes called wang, literally &quot;eye&quot;. Initially there are four seeds in every hole.<br/><br/>The first player starts anywhere on his row by picking up the entire contents of one of his holes. If he did so from his middle hole he could place them in any hole, either on his own side or his opponents. If he took the contents of any of his other holes, he could place them in any hole except his opponents opposite hole.<br/><br/>Thereafter players alternately move either in a clock-wise or anti-clockwise direction by distributing their seeds always in groups of four.<br/><br/><br/>     A group of four seeds can be moved to an adjacent hole only on the same side of the board.<br/>     A group of eight or more seeds can be distributed on the basis of four seeds per hole in successive holes on one side of the board or another. <br/><br/><br/>If the last four seeds fall in an empty hole, the player captures the contents, if any, of his opponents opposite hole. The captured seeds are removed from the board. Then the player is entitled to continue his move by picking up the contents of any of his holes with which to play.<br/><br/>The player gaining the largest number of seeds is accounted the winner. The game is won in a single round.<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971. 'Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa', in Ethiopia Observer; 14 (3): 204.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of five catalin dice with faces depicting pins with numbers representing the number of knocked down pins or a special marking such as spare (/), strike (X) or split (O).  As in standard &quot;lane bowling&quot;, the dice game is played by rolling dice twice for each frame and uses a similar scoring sheet to regulation bowling. Another game by the same publisher already included on Board Game Geek is the more available &quot;Galloping Golf&quot;.<br/><br/>",

This game is sure to be a hit with your family on vacations, camp outs, or an evening at home. English and Spanish instructions are included.<br/><br/>Similar to the play in Rummy, players receive seven cards to begin and draw from the deck or discard pile to begin each turn. Player discards one card to signal the end of the turn. The object of the game is to collect groups of three houses of the same color or three houses at consecutive addresses on the same street. Players lay down collections to gain the 10 points on each of the cards. A player can match a fixer-upper house with a cash card for 25 points. There is an old fire station card and an old church card that can be played alone and worth 25 points each.<br/><br/>Like Mille Bornes, this game has a few roadblocks. A player can play a Haunted House card or a Termite card on an opponent. The opponent cannot lay down any point cards until the proper remedy card is played, which is a Medium or Exterminator. If the player has the Home Inspection Team card displayed, the player is exempt from Termite or Ghost troubles.<br/><br/>Hands end when a player runs out of cards. Don't get caught with a lot of points in your hand, as they are subtracted from the points you have collected on the table. Play continues until a player reaches 500 points.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.tricasagame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.tricasagame.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Big Score! is a game designed to teach the basics of credit scoring to beginning loan originators, underwriters, and loan processors.  It can be played by 2 - 8 individuals or teams.<br/><br/>Each player begins at &quot;Start&quot; with 400 credit score points.  Players then move around the board to each category and must answer questions: minimum 50 points/maximum 125 points in each category.  Each question is worth 25 points.  Players may encounter either Credit Scoring Advances or Obstacles on their way to each category or while in a category.  Advances gain points; obstacles lose points.  The first player to have accumulated the most credit score points (900 being a perfect score) from EACH category must make their way to &quot;Finish&quot; to win the game.<br/><br/>The game is produced by the United Guaranty Corporation, a member company of American International Group (AIG).<br/><br/>",

Also included are categories for rolling different dice (large and small universe). The player with the highest score wins, unless someone rolls five suns in which case that player wins immediately.<br/><br/>",

Draw the turn-up card, turning up the top reserve to replace it. <br/>Note that there is no discarding.<br/><br/>When a word is played or added to, the player scores 1 point per letter in the word.

Each player rolls two dice during their turn and flips over one, two or three (Shut the Box only allows one or two numbers to be flipped) chequers which add up to the total rolled on the dice. The player keeps going until he/she is unable to flip over chequers, when play passes to the next player. Each player is supposed to have their own set of chequers and before taking a turn, a player has to ante a chip into the centre of the table. When the turn comes round again, a player continues to try to flip over any remaining chequers that still show spots. The first player to go &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (i.e. flip over all their chequers) gets all the chips from the centre as well as a chip for each spot still showing on other player's checquers. <br/><br/><br/>",

Each line segment is connected to either the ground or other line segments at the endpoints.<br/><br/>Each of the two players is assigned a color (either red or blue). On their turn, a player removes one line segment of their color (or a green line segment) and then all line segments that are no longer connected to the ground. If a player cannot make a move, she loses.<br/><br/>Hackenbush was introduced in the 1981 book set Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays (by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy), and is used as a motivating example of partizan games (that is, games in which, unlike nim, each player has moves not allowed the other player).<br/><br/>",

For each miss, the player will have to do an extra penalty lap.<br/><br/>The game, along with the cover picture, was approved by SAhL (Finnish Biathlon Association) with the SAhL logo and a signed endorsement from the then executive director Pauli Swanljung on the box front, and probably originates from late 1970s - early 1980s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publishers:<br/><br/>The Last Straw! is a fun and exciting teaching tool on the social determinants of health. The game has three objectives:<br/><br/>* to promote discussion about the social determinants of health;<br/>    * to help players build empathy with marginalized people and gain an awareness of players' own social location;<br/>    * to encourage learning in a fun and supportive environment.<br/><br/>In keeping with current research on the social determinants of health, socioeconomic status is a primary determinant of health in this game, as are race, gender, sexual orientation and other factors.<br/><br/>Feedback consistently demonstrates that players gain a better understanding of the social determinants of health and the interplay between forces at individual and community levels.  Both players and facilitators (&quot;Game Masters&quot;) report having a great time playing the game.<br/><br/>",

One of the players, Captain John Konig protects the valuable energy packages while the others trying to get those from him. To achieve this he has to stop the other players, who have to get over various obstacles such as meteoric zones, narrow pass-through gates. These obstacles form concentric circles, the attacking players start on the outside, and their goal is to get to the center, get the energy packets, and take one of them to the starting zone. The quickest one wins the game. Each of the attacking players as well as Captain John Konig are controlling four spaceships.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Getta Goff Challenge games are a series of milk cap games (also known as Pog) with special rules and instructions meant to add a more educational twist to standard Pog.<br/><br/>Traditional Pog is played by stacking a variety of milk caps (aka Pogs) on top of a playing mat. Players then take turns throwing a &quot;Slammer&quot; (which is usually a much thicker plastic or metal Pog) onto the top of the stack in an attempt flip as many of the stacked Pogs upside down as possible. Generally, players then take  ownership of any Pogs that flipped.<br/><br/>In Advanced Math Getta Goff, for example, the players must carry out mathematical operations based on the instructions on the flipped Pogs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the Web Site)Untold Battle&trade; is a fast-paced, exciting way for players to duke it out with custom built creatures and parties. Showcasing the many Battle Factions of the Untold universe, Untold Battle was created for two players to choose two opposing factions and fight with tooth, bullet, tentacle and spell until only one side remains. But Battle players are not limited - they can use all of the Untold cards to change and make their units unique, or even create their own character, just as if they were going to play the roleplaying game. And Battle doesn't need to be two sided, the rules work for one-on-one, one-on-many, or many-on-many. Untold Battle Rules provide a brutal, bloody, and hard-hitting game that packs a punch!<br/>The Battle Factions<br/><br/>Untold offers limitless possibilities for worlds and adventures. And on every world there are nations, corporations, shadow organizations, alien marauders, and so forth; we collectively call these Factions. We've built all the unique creatures, minions, soldiers, and things that go bump in the night and put them together in Battle Faction packs, so you can pick your favorites or mix and match to do Battle. Untold Battle offers an arena for all the forces of your imagination to duke it out. Now you can pit zombies against soldiers, or tentacled demons against steam punk robots. Or you can help shape the destiny of one of the Untold worlds: will the brave forces of the North American Union overcome the twisted Flux Horrors? Or you can help reshape the face of Europe as the Churl Confederation advances on the new knights of Novus Europa!<br/>The Untold Rules<br/><br/>Untold Battle utilizes Untold Minion Cards because they are quick to use. Minions are one card, instead of a number of cards, that represent a single character, and that is important when your Battle has a large number of forces. And Minions still offer the limitless customization of Untold Powers through Swapping.<br/><br/>Once players choose their Factions and/or characters, Battle is as simple as lining up the cards on the table across from each other and taking turns between their minions. Battle utilizes Untold's simple and quick combat mechanics (see our Online Primer for more, or just refer to back of the handy insert that comes with every Battle Faction pack), and all the rules you need for the minions are on the cards!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher blurb<br/>Mystic Realm<br/><br/>Once upon a time there was a great realm, ruled by a wise and powerful sorcerer-king. The land was rich and the people prosperous. Out of their wealth a great temple was constructed, puissant magical items created and many fantastic beasts imported from faraway lands. But as is the way of all things, eventually the king grew old and passed on from this mortal plane.  <br/>His son inherited his realm and magical talent but not his wisdom. Greedy and grasping, searching for greater treasures and power than even his father had amassed, he reached past the limits set by the gods and opened a rift into a dimension of primal chaos. The once prosperous realm was sucked in and lost for millennia.  <br/>But now a new magic portal has opened leading to that mystic realm, or at least to what that realm has become. Overrun by monsters, the few remaining inhabitants are oppressed. The once-great temple is overgrown, the capital city lost in a jungle teeming with cannibals and wild beasts. But golden treasures and powerful magic items still remain, waiting for brave adventurers to discover. <br/>And the greedy prince? He too, remains. Preserved by his wicked magic, he is now an undead master, the Liche Lord. Still ruling the ruined kingdom from his father&rsquo;s throne, his only remaining desire to suck the life force from the bones of anyone foolish enough to enter his kingdom. Are you brave enough to dare his challenge? And are you clever enough to return with the fame, fortune and treasures of a lifetime? <br/>Mystic Realm is a one to ten player game of adventure set in a fantasyland. Players take the role of a heroic character and travel through the realm searching for treasures and encountering dangerous monsters (and sometimes something even more dangerous: the other players.) The player who survives and returns to the portal with the most treasure and fame is declared the winner. There are twenty different character types to choose from, everything from an Amazon to a Ninja to a Witch.  <br/>Easy to play, the game includes: complete rules, five player aid cards, six encounter cards, six sheets of terrain tiles, and one sheet of DIE-CUT playing pieces (including treasures and magic items.) Paper, pencil and some six-sided dice (not included) are required to play.<br/><br/>",

Players alternate throwing a die and moving forward that number of spaces, each moving from the center, on the ball, in the opposite direction toward the goal they wish to score. Certain spaces on the track award fouls, throw-ins, penalties, and offsides that result in the player's marker being moved forward or backward on the track.<br/><br/>If a player is close enough to their chosen goal (space 25), they score a goal by rolling a number high enough to go past 25. Landing on 25 itself allows the goalie to make the save and punt the ball back to space 5.<br/><br/>Either side scoring a goal sends both player's markers back to the ball in the center to start again. It is recommended to play a &quot;best of 5&quot; match.<br/><br/>",

Rules are provided for each of the 3 codes. You place your team of men onto the board (ie 11, 13 or 15 counters) into standard starting positions and kick off. Generally a turn is to move one of your men 1 space (with the option of passing the ball), but trying to take advantage of the board's special options to progress down the field and score a goal / try, while your opponent moves their men into defensive positions to tackle (hop over) and regain the ball.<br/><br/>",

Hit the roads and tour around North America trying to score tickets to the Naked Brothers Band's sold-out shows.  Follow the band from city to city and visit awesome places like Seattle - Boston - San Fran and Miami.  If you're the first fan to make it to the show, you'll get the best tickets and increase your score.  So, hit the road and catch as many concerts as you can.<br/><br/>- Gameboard<br/>- 4 Tour Bus cardboard pawns and pawn stands<br/>- 21 City cards<br/>- 24 Concert tickets<br/>- 24 Rest stop cards<br/>- 45 Travel cards<br/>- Instructions<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>On your turn, you're trying to get to the next concert city to get the best seats possible.  Concerts must be played in the order they are on the board, and all tickets from the first concert must be taken before the next concert can make its tickets available, and so on.<br/><br/>To move your bus toward a concert city, draw a travel card and place it face up so all can see.  If it is a move card, there will be a white bus on the card. You can move your bus the number of spaces the white bus indicates.  If there are other buses on the card, that color bus also gets to move.  If your colored bus also happens to be on the card, then you may move again.  Buses are moved in the order they are played on the card.  In a two or three player game, ignore any buses not being played.  If you happen to end your turn on the same space as another player, then jump ahead to the next space.  In some cases, the player who drew the card will also get to move another player's bus.  These are wrong turn cards.  Any special instructions will be on the cards.<br/><br/>Sometimes a card will have special instructions, such as move to any city, or swap tickets with another player.  In these cases instead of moving this turn, just do what the card says.<br/><br/>Once you begin to move in a direction, you cannot backtrack on the same road.  The only exception is in the case where a card you draw has your color bus on it as well.  These are considered two different moves.  They must be done in the correct order on the card.<br/><br/>Ending the Game:<br/>After all 8 concerts have happened, everyone adds up their points (from Rest Stop and Concert Ticket cards).  The player with the most points wins the game.  That player is the Naked Brothers Band's Biggest Fan!<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to build the most productive empire through conquest, trading, and economic development.<br/><br/>A fully reconfigurable board ensures that every game plays completely differently, and scales up to make room for additional players.  A three-tier tech tree creates an enormous amount of strategic depth.  An innovative turn system allows players to trade off resources for extra moves.

In this case, you get five dice where the the one-pip is replaced with a graphic of an alligator.<br/><br/>The game is a simple dice rolling game - players roll the dice and need at least one alligator before they can score, They can set aside one alligator and other dice showing pipped sides which give the score - the other dice can be re-rolled once to attempt to improve the score. The player then decides whether to increase the size of their 'gator' by rolling all five dice and adding the sum of pipped dice to their score; however on this subsequent roll, any alligators rolled count as minus five points.<br/><br/>The player with the highest number of points after all the rolling wins.<br/><br/>",

The cards are familiar, as long as you&rsquo;re looking at the fronts, lovingly illustrated by Aaron Williams. But on the back, one or more suits appear, giving you a glimpse into the future.  The better the card, the less information you have about what suit it is.  That ability to look into the future gives the game its shape, and presents some unique challenges for the veteran card player.<br/><br/>Foresight is also an engaging trick-taking card game, using that special set of cards.  The bidding system is at once familiar, a simple system of bidding how many tricks you are going to take, and different, in that you get to bid multiple times.  As befits a game with as much uncertainty as Foresight features, you get to place several bets, rather than be locked down into one bid.  And once play begins, part of your hand is obscured even from you.  Managing your information and your crucial hole cards is a skill that is unique to playing Foresight, and it&rsquo;s a fresh challenge that card players everywhere can appreciate.<br/><br/>",

The recommended treatment approach for anxiety is overwhelmingly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Bridge Over Worried Waters is essentially a CBT program in a box that incorporates all of these techniques.<br/><br/>To start the game, players place a Worried Waters raging river sheet in front of them. Then they choose a Problem card that describes an anxiety-producing situation. Players then decide on an appropriate Solution card to use as a positive strategy to address the anxiety in the situation. Solution cards include: Self-Talk Cards challenge self-defeating thoughts by replacing negative thoughts with positive,optimistic thoughts. Relaxation Cards calm down by using deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and meditation. Coping Cards distract by diverting attention away from anxious feelings to fun or effortful activities. When the problem has been successfully solved with one of the Solution cards, the player then tosses the Situation card into the Worried Waters, and the Solution card is used to create the foundation or top of a bridge. The object of the game is to build a bridge that carries the player across the Worried Waters to the safety of the other bank.<br/><br/>There are both competitive and cooperative versions<br/><br/>",

The first to reach the end of the track is the winner.<br/><br/>The second is a quiz game where players move around the board using a d6, answering Dinosaur trivia questions (which also have visual clues for smaller children) whenever they land on a footprint. Again, the winner is the first to reach the last space on the board.<br/><br/>The 'Pop-up' in the game's title refers to some cut-out dinosaurs which 'pop up' when the board is unfolded.<br/><br/>",

Players roll the dice in an effort to increase their fortunes and build their &quot;budding&quot; business. But in this game, danger awaits you at every turn and getting busted is just a roll of the dice away. Each player rolls two numbered dice (1-6) and one event dice with the event die determining what the numbers stand for, where even numbers equal good results and odd numbers equal bad results. The game contains two numbered dice, one event die, 100 chips and a rules card. Each player starts with 10 chips (their stash) with the remaining chips forming the pot, and the one with the biggest stash when the pot runs out wins.<br/><br/>",

Along with the prize's value, each prize card also has a code on it.  The code is input into the Money Machine in the centre of the board and corresponds to a cash prize amount in shillings.  The code is input by turning two knobs on the board until the correct numbers are displayed.  A random question from the question book is read out which all players can answer,  The player to give the correct answer can choose to take either the prize card, or go for the cash prize displayed on the Money Machine.  If they select to go for the cash, a dial on the Money Machine is spun to determine the outcome.  Getting a question wrong means a player loses a life, and when all three are lost, they are out of the game.  There is also a jackpot prize to be played for.  The winner is the player with the most money and prizes at the end of the game.<br/><br/>From the box: &quot;Another Chad Valley Television Game: For Love or Money - With the 'Magic Flying Shilling' Sign.

        "description": "Think! is a children's memory game from the 1970s.  The game comprises a 'master' board with 72 different images upon it, a corresponding set of 72 picture cards and a set of pegs.  Each image on the playing board has a peg hole next to it.<br/><br/>At the start of each round two images are eliminated by shuffling the picture cards and placing two of them face down over the matching images on the board.  Players then place pegs into the board in whichever spaces they like to mark images.  Everyone has 10 seconds to memorise which images have been marked before the board is  covered up by the box lid.  The picture cards are then turned over one at a time to players in turn.  If a player thinks the image on the card was marked on the board, they take the card.  At the end, players get a point for each correctly taken card and lose a point for each wrongly taken card.  The winner is the one with most points.<br/><br/>From the box: &quot;The Memory Game That Really Makes You Think!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players each have a team of 11 footballers represented by small plastic tokens.  One team is red and the other is blue.  The playing pieces fit into holes in the board which is a football pitch marked out into hex spaces.  There is a token for the football which can slot into the board or into the top of the footballer playing pieces to denote possession.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they may choose one of three actions: 1. Move a player with the ball up to five spaces in the direction they are facing then (optional) turn and pass the ball, 2. Move a player off the ball, 3. Attempt to tackle an opposing player.  There are additional rules governing the movement of goalkeepers.<br/><br/>From the box: &quot;Tactical football for 2 players - move, turn and kick away!&quot;<br/><br/>",

But before they can do this, they have to prove that they can produce and digest the greasiest fast food. <br/>On your turn, you throw the dice and move that number of spaces. <br/>If you land on a grey space, every other player but you has to eat at your fast food joint: on a menu table, fast food is selected via a d20 roll. This culinary sensation has now to be digested: the table gives a health number, added is a d6 roll, the player's experience level and various modifiers from cards. If the modified result is higher than that health number, the player gains experience. If he rolls lower, he is taken to the hospital and misses his next turn.<br/>The more experience the players gather, the harder will the menue tables become, but to win, you have to collect at least 30 points to finally eat at &quot;Dieter's&quot; and win the game.<br/>Other spaces help players on their quest, like &quot;Restaurant&quot; where you can eat proper food and gain more health (aka die roll modifiers), &quot;Doctor&quot; where you can avoid the next hospital result, or &quot;Toilet&quot;, where you can get all that grease out of your system and increase your health number.<br/><br/>",

The space you land is either blank (and the next player takes his turn); it on contains an event (like miss one turn, roll the die and move that more spaces, pay a fine, etc.); or it contains a color and a symbol. In the latter case, the player consults his character booklet and looks up the page with the corresponding color and symbol. A short story there is read and and the player has to decide what to do next: the booklet gives two or more choices and each choice corresponds to a numbered paragraph in the rule book, which is looked up and carried out. <br/>These paragraphs are the heart of the game and the key to victory. The rule book also suggests that you read the comic book to understand the game and the story better.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is for 4 players, playing as partners.<br/><br/>Each card has a value from 1 to 48. The four Aces are excluded from this and are called Muettes (the French word for Mute). Each player can bid which is really a search for a trump sequence. An example of bidding could be 'All the red cards' or '7s to 9s'. The only restriction in the bidding is that a legal bid must be at least 2 cards and no more than 24 cards. Once established, the hand is played. Note that there is no following suit, you can play any card in your hand to a trick and that the partnership, that won the bid, can nominate that each trick will be played High or Low (all tricks will be won by the highest ranked card or that each trick will be won by the lowest ranked card).<br/>I understand that one year after the release of the game, the author published a revised set of rules which customers could collect at their Parisian game's shop.<br/><br/>",

In his turn, a player turns over one card. If it does not have a number on it, the next player turns over a card, and so on. If a numbered card appears, the next player must turn over cards equal to that number. If that player turns over a number when doing this, the next player must turn over cards.

The object is to win tricks by the pairing of two cards relating to the same country. The pairs maybe a wedding pair, a pair of spinsters or a pair of bachelors. Each pair has a value in points. A 'Society' Wedding (the two coloured cards of a country scores 5 points. A 'Quiet' Wedding (The two non-coloured cards of a country or one with colour and one without) scores 3 points. A Pair of Spinsters or Pair of Bachelors (from the same country) scores 1 point. If you can collect all four cards from a country, you can score bonus points; Two Society Wedding Pairs 15 points; Two Wedding Pairs - no Society Wedding 10 points; Pair of Spinsters and a Pair of Bachelors 6 points.<br/>The game play is interesting. Players draw a card and place it to start to form rows of cards face-up. Five such cards are permitted in a row. If two cards from the same country 'touch' each other (vertically, horizentally or diagonal) then that pair is taken by the player. If a pair is taken the remaining cards are moved to the left of their row. If a card reaches the left end of a row and needs to be moved it is added to the right end of the row above.<br/>Play several hands and the first player to reach 100 points is the winner.<br/>A solitaire variant is also reccomended in the rules.<br/>Undated but it was probably in Austerity Britain in the 1950's (The rules say that there are only limited numbers of the game available, due to quota restrictions).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played with a pack of 52 cards, made up of 12 tradesmen and a Burglar each using three tools. Players are dealt hands of four cards, and each turn must draw from the top of the deck or from the discard pile. After each draw, the player must discard a card face down. The first player to collect a set of a tradesman and his three tools wins the hand.<br/><br/>The adult version of the game is set up for gambling. Each person antes a coin at the start of each hand. The winner of the hand collects half the pot, but if he has included another tradesman's tool by mistake, he loses a like amount instead. If any player has the Burglar in hand, he must pay a penalty of half the pot - unless he also has the Bobby, in which case he takes the other half of the pot. Similarly, anyone holding one of the Burglar's tools (crowbar, mask or swag bag) pays a penalty of two coins each unless also holding one of the Bobby's tools (handcuffs, lantern or helmet).<br/><br/>There are also rules for young people that make the game a form of &quot;Go Fish&quot;.<br/><br/>",

If you land on a space with an instruction on it, you must obey that instruction. These consist of things like 'Miss a turn', 'Hole in one, take another turn, Ball lost, take a detour, and so on.<br/>An alternative board exists but presumably with the same rules.<br/><br/>",

Numbers and colours are compared: the higher number wins BUT if colours match, the round is a draw (both players win).<br/><br/>The winner(s) then either 'attach' the card orthogonally, in a way permitted by the arrows drawn on each card, or use its 'attack'.

The directions (nothing as common as rules in this game) leave it to the players to decide how to organise the match - innings, numbers of players and so on.<br/><br/>Players put the pair of stumps about 5 to 6 feet apart (&quot;the average length of an ordinary dining table&quot; as the directions helpfully tell us). Dice are used as balls in the game. The bowler gently pitches a die (with faces 1, 2, 4, 6, out and NR (for no runs) to the batsman, preferably without the die touching the table. The batsman tries to hit it. If he misses and the stumps are hit, the batsman is out bowled. If he hits the die and it is caught by the bowler, the player is out caught. Otherwise, if he hits it, the result of the shot is shown by the top face of the die.<br/><br/>",

In it, players attempt to reduce 6 dice that are rolled to a single die on the board, with value of 6 on top.  As players move dice, they reduce in value.  As players merge dice, the new dice on the space merged equals the sum of the two dice merging.  Players are not permitted to combine dice to a value greater than six, and each die is permitted to only move in a line, one or more spaces.<br/><br/>Quick rules:<br/><br/>     Roll the six dice, and then place them on the board so they get reduced to a single die with a six on it.<br/>     As a die moves into another die, the value of the die moved into is increased by the current value of the die moving, and the die moving is removed from the board.<br/>     A single move for a die consists of moving in a straight line vertically, horizontally or diagonally, like a queen in chess.  For each empty space a die moves into, it decreases its value by 1.  A die may not be reduced to less than one doing this.<br/>     Each die can perform, at most, one move per puzzle.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each card shows the animal image on one side and has stats about that animal's weight, height/length, longevity and number of offspring on the other. Each player starts the game with three animal cards in hand, and the category tokens are placed in a circle with a shared pawn on one token.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she throws the dice tokens, then moves the sum of the pips being shown. If she lands on a regular category token, she can use the side showing &ndash; say, &quot;longevity, oldest&quot; &ndash; or flip the token to the other side &ndash; which might be &quot;offspring, fewest&quot;. Each player then chooses a card in hand and reveals it simultaneously. The player whose animal best fit the category places that animal card before her and draws a replacement card. Everyone else returns their card to hand.<br/><br/>If the player lands on a continent or animal token, she chooses a specific continent or animal type as well as one of the four animal stats and whether players want to be high or low. Each player then chooses an animal card and reveals, with the winning player(s) placing that card before them and drawing a replacement. (A player can swap out an entire hand of cards, but must sit out the next challenge.)<br/><br/>The first player to have five cards before her wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Using the same board and tokens, Union Jack and The Great Quarter Century Race Game make up The Jubilee Games Set.<br/><br/>Union Jack is a two-player abstract placement game where you are trying to force your opponent to complete a set of red, white and blue tokens in a single line.  Players alternate placing tokens on a 4 x 4 grid (with an extra space in the bottom left).  Tokens must be placed in a proscribed order (red then white then blue).  The player who is forced to complete a set of three colours anywhere in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line is the loser.<br/><br/>In The Great Quarter Century Race Game, 2-3 players bluff and guess their way through the 25 spaces on the board.  One player will hide a token in a hand and present both hands to the active player, who will select one.  If the hand without the token is chosen, the active player advances on the track, otherwise it is the next player's turn.  Some spaces will cause the token to advance further, and landing on a space occupied by another token will send that token backward on the track.  The first to reach the middle square is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The four services are The Royal Navy, The Army, The Royal Air Force, and The Women's Auxiliary Territorial Services.<br/>Deal out all the cards after shuffling. Each player does not look at their cards but makes a face-down pile in front of him. At the start players turn over their top card as fast as they can. Any number 1 card is placed in the middle of the table. From then on, you can earn 'Promotion' by playing a number 2 card of the same suit, then a number 3 card, and so on. The cards in the middle must be the right service to gain 'promotion', but you can also discard a card on any other player's face-up pack, obeying the promotion rule of the next highest card, but as it is not promoting a card in the middle of the table, any promotion card, regardless of suit can be played.<br/>Play should be fast, because there are many penalty card laws and the rules say &quot;The fun of the game relies on penalties being enforced&quot;.<br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards is the winner.<br/>The cards feature the insignia of rank in each of the four services. There is also a number in the corner of the cards so if you do not know the ranking, you can just remember to play the next higher card in that service. <br/>The box exhorts players &quot;Learn to spot the ranks&quot;.<br/>This is a patriotic game in that players, especially children, were very interested in all things military. I would date the game as 1918 because the RAF (Royal Air Force) didn't exist before April that year. Previously it was the RFC (Royal Flying Corps)<br/><br/>",

The board has a wheel with six different coloured speedway bikes on it. Players are invited to put their bets on to a Roulette-like board. You could play for real money or buttons. When all the bets are placed, you flick a switch and the wheel will spin. As each bike goes past a connection, their colour light flashes on, so with a fast spinning wheel, the lights all flash, adding to the excitement.

Players have question cards and risk cards, the starting player chooses a card and the candidate on his left tries to answer the first question - if he is right, the second is asked. In case of two correct answers the candidate receives the card and puts it with his risk cards. If the first answer is wrong, the left neighbour of the candidate can take over by risking one of his risk cards - if he answers wrong he loses the card.

On a turn, you lay down 1-2 types of jewelry on the table in front of you, then trade with other players for the cards in their hands while trading away what you hold. After trading, you may lay down additional cards from your hand if they match the two types on the table in front of you.<br/><br/>If you have enough points on the table, you can then trade them in for one or more gold bars from the stack. As the gold bars are claimed, the point value needed to claim more rises.<br/><br/>You can discard cards from your hand, but you receive a penalty point when doing so; alternatively, you can donate cards to other players. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to six cards.<br/><br/>When the last gold bar is claimed, the game ends. Who will be the Goldnaire?<br/><br/>",

The cards show a grid of 6 squares 4 of which are blank and two have either a red triangle or a red circle, or, indeed, a blue triangle or a blue circle. Each card will have a red and a blue example of the shape.<br/><br/>Each player shuffles their deck and then gives it to his or her opponent. Interestingly, it is allowed to shuffle them with some cards the wrong way round. Not sure if this adds to the difficulty or not.<br/><br/>At the word Go, both players start searching through the deck they have been given. The object is to find a matching pair. No two cards are identical so a pair is two cards that have the two shapes reversed, so to speak. For example, if a card had a Blue triangle in the top left corner and a red circle in the bottom right corner, the the matching card will be one thast has a red triangle in the top left corner and a blue triangle in the bottom right corner.<br/><br/>The first player to match the 20 pairs available, wins<br/><br/>",

Some ('straight') cards move a piece forwards so many squares, other ('bent') cards mean the piece must make a 90 degree turn as part of its move. Three special cards exist: '69' can be treated either as a straight six or a bent nine; '8' allow two pieces to be moved a combined total of eight spaces forward; and '1' allows a piece to move one square forwards or sideways. Opposing pieces not on safety square which are landed on are 'bumped' off onto an unfavourable start square.<br/><br/>The main game involves dealing out the deck between the players who can then pick which card to play each turn. If the game has not finished, the discards are shuffled and dealt again. A version for children involves picking cards at random to play each turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A horse racing themed card game.<br/><br/>One player is the Bookie and will offer odds on each race. Those odds are determined by how many cards of each colour are randomly drawn before the race starts. If only one red card is drawn, the odds will be better than a colour that has no cards drawn. If 2 are drawn for one colour, the odds increase. And so on. The odds reflect the fact that there are less cards in the deck for that colour to win.<br/><br/>Having established the odds and all bets are placed, the race begins. The Bookie turns over a card and that colour advances one card length. A horse needs to be moved 7 card lengths first to win.<br/><br/>There are some wild cards that have certain effects. They tend to affect the race of the next card to be revealed. For example, if you drew a Blue Horse Stumbles card, the Blue horse is moved forward as usual. But the next colour card drawn has to suffer the effects of having stumbled.<br/><br/>The winner at the end of the evening is the player with the most cash. I would suggest you might end it after every player has had one turn of being the Bookie.<br/><br/>",

On every round players place one card down in front of them and pick a player to roll the cube. The cube has three number sides and three action sides. If a number is rolled, players bet that number of chips, flip the card in front of him/her and the highest valued card wins the chips. Actions consist of trade, slide, and chip. Each action moves cards around the table to an opponent. If an action is rolled, complete the action and pass the cube to the next player. Play stops when a number is rolled. Quick wits and a little luck can leave any player in position to win on any turn. It depends on which direction the feet shuffle!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the world of Zulu 6: the world's deadliest covert special missions force.<br/><br/>Assembled from the ranks of the most elite special forces units from around the world, the 6 warriors of Zulu Team are the guardians of humanity against the evil faction known as S.C.A.R. (Soldiers of Chaos, Anarchy &amp; Rebellion).<br/><br/>Six of the world's top ten elite fighting forces are represented among the members of the Team: the Russian Spetsnaz, the French Naval Commandos, Israel's Shayetet 13, the U.S. Army Airborne Rangers, U.S. Marine Special Operations Command and the U.S. Navy SEALs.<br/><br/>Choose your side: one player controls Zulu 6 while the other controls S.C.A.R. The objects of the game: During each mission, Zulu 6 must use their elite combat skills to complete 2 mission objectives. S.C.A.R. must stop them with the use of overwhelming forces.<br/><br/>The game begins with the Zulu player choosing 3 of the 6 team members as his/her first assault team while S.C.A.R. player builds the game board by laying out 4 inch map tiles printed with a dirt path cutting through a jungle, placing each tile so that the path is continuous until the line of sight ends in a curve or a 3-way &quot;T&quot;. As the Zulu 6 team moves along the path, the S.C.A.R. player continues to build it. Some of the map tiles contain hazards designed to slow the Zulu 6 team members while others contain mission objectives such as a prison camp, a weapons facility and a downed spy plane. There are also map tiles that contain symbols that allows the S.C.A.R. player to place a number of his troops in that tile to keep Zulu 6 from completing its mission. The S.C.A.R. player also has the ability to spawn more troops to keep the danger moving.<br/><br/>Combat between the 2 armies is resolved using 6-sided dice (D6). Each Zulu 6 team member has a stat card that explains his special skill and lists how many attack dice he gets during combat as well as areas to keep track of ammunition spent during combat (10 slots) and wounds taken (3 slots). Each time a Zulu 6 team member attacks, a marker is moved 1 space along his ammo track. The same happens when a team member takes a hit. Every roll of 5 or 6 on a Zulu 6 die roll is a kill. Each S.C.A.R. trooper only gets 1D6 and a roll of 6 on the die is a wound on the target Zulu 6 team member.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, Zulu 6 races to achieve mission objectives as S.C.A.R. sends wave after wave of troops at them. All the while, Zulu 6 receives 5 mission points for each objective achieved and for each S.C.A.R. troop killed and may use these points in trade for special actions such as healing a wound, an extra attack die, an ammo drop to reload weapons or even to call in reinforcements if a Zulu team member is lost in combat.<br/><br/>There are 3 missions to complete that make up the core game, each with 2 objectives.<br/><br/>With expansions coming soon featuring different mapped environments, daring missions, and new team members, you can take Zulu 6 around the world battling the evil forces of S.C.A.R.<br/><br/>",

More information on the development of the games, and the original posting of the rules, can be found in this thread.<br/><br/>As in keeping with Duplicate Heartless, players will draft dice from a pool of dice and the play with their dice in the open, making for a game that is combinatorial in nature during play, and also the idea is to have the lowest score.<br/><br/>This game differs from Duplicate Heartless, however, in several ways:<br/><br/>First, game involves using 14 dice of one color and 14 of another color.<br/><br/>Second, during the game, if the suit die is one color, then the player who played the highest number of the suit die of the pair of dice takes the trick, and if another color is led, then the lowest number die of the suit pair of dice takes the trick.<br/><br/>Jambone is a word connected with a version of Euchre where cards are played face up.  In addition, bones is slang for dice.  Hi and low were chosen as part of the name, because tricks won vary between either high pair of dice, or low pair of dice being the winning pair.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Somewhere on the island is buried a chest full of gold doubloons. The task of the players is to try and locate the exact position of this hidden treasure. It can be achieved by the simple means of elimination.<br/><br/>The map is divided into forty-nine squares which are numbered horizontally and lettered vertically (fig. 1). There are also fourteen 'location cards' each containing a reproduction of the island map and with either one row or one column shaded (fig. 2). At the beginning of the game, these cards are divided into two packs, one containing the numbered columns and the other the lettered rows. Each pack is shuffled and placed face down and the top card drawn from each. These cards remain unseen and give the exact location of the treasure. For example; should the card with column 3 shaded be drawn together with the card having row F shaded, then the position of the treasure is at square 3F. The twelve remaining cards are shuffled together and dealt equally amongst the players of whom there may be two, three or four.<br/><br/>Each player also receives eight digging tokens. Having looked at the cards in his hand, the first player will place one of his tokens on a square on the map board, say B6. If the player on his left has a card indicating either row B or column 6 or indeed both, then he simply says 'No' and the first player's turn ends with the knowledge that possibly the treasure is not buried anywhere in column 6 and/or row B.<br/><br/>Players continue to place tokens in turn until one of the players suggests the location of the treasure chest. That player then looks at the cards selected at the beginning of the game. If correct, that player wins, if not the cards are replaced face down and that player is out of the game.<br/><br/>A variant suggested by the inventor, which makes a longer but possibly a better game, is where each player only has one token and, after it has been placed on the board during the first round, it may only be moved to an orthogonally, adjacent square on each succeeding turn.<br/><br/>",

Dits&ouml; means &quot;group&quot; or &quot;clan&quot;, which is represented by character cards that each player chooses to form his/her tribe. Each card has an explanation about what each character means in the native mythology, and the locations and unique figures keep their indigenous names.<br/><br/>In terms of gameplay, Dits&ouml; is played like a miniatures game, althoough it uses cards (folded in the middle so they can stand) instead of miniatures. Each player or team has a certain amount of points (100 points in a standard game) to recruit an army; each card has a value. It is allowed to recruit as many green cards of the same type as whished, but only one golden card of the same kind may be recruited.<br/><br/>Then players set their armies in the predesignated start zones and the game begins. Depending of the charactes chosen, they may have special abilities, but normally the options will be to start a melee combat, a ranged combat or just to move (some characters have the ability of flying). There is also the chance to counter attack, but the character should have this ability to do so.<br/><br/>The first player of team to destroy his/her opponent wins the game.<br/><br/>Dits&ouml; won the 2011 Ideas Innovadoras Award in the social innovation cathegory, and is an attempt to rescue Costa Rican roots in a fun and familiar way.<br/><br/>",

In the game, players attempt to control more spaces on the board by the time the game ends.  Pieces move like chess queens, and have the ability to pass through spaces control by their side.  Each turn, a player must either move one of their pieces on top of a single piece of an opponent, or remove an enemy piece on top of a stack from two players (this is in the basic version, with a variant providing more complex removal rules). Effort was made to provide a 3 player game experience that would try to prevent players from colluding to gang up against a single player in order to eliminate them from play.<br/><br/>The game provides a unique feature where it is possible for a player to win a game, even if they haven't made a move.

You will need to get into close quarters with the tank and blow it up with a blast from your Thermal Detonator.  Use the debris scattered around the battlefield for cover and look to the Jedi Anakin's Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi for aid.  But beware, the evil and powerful Asajj Ventress also lurks about the battlefield.<br/><br/>On a 3D hex filled board, using roll and move mechanics, maneuver your plastic pre-painted Clone trooper miniature around the board trying to stay out of the firing direction of the large plastic AAT.  Either through the use of cards or die rolls, your turn may also consist of firing red plastic discs with the AAT at the other plyers' Clone Troopers.<br/><br/>The game comes with a &quot;basic&quot; version of play using only a single 12 sided die as well as an &quot;advanced&quot; version using a 6 sided die and cards.<br/><br/>",

In a turn you can set your speed, which starts at 1. This lets you move one square. On subsequent turns you can increase or decrease your spped by 1. So a car travelling at speed 3 may, next turn, go down to 2, go up to 4, or to stay at 3.<br/><br/>Your move is drawn on to the board, so different colored pencils or pens is essential. All movement must be in a straight line for each move, so you can only change direction on your next throw, and so on. Thus, it is possible to crash if you go too fast around a corner. Forward planning is required.<br/><br/>The torturous track is, in effect, a figure of eight. First car home, wins.<br/><br/>",

The game develops social skills by helping children learn to gather information about others and share information about themselves. Children take turns assuming the role of a reporter, getting to the bottom of a story by using Who, What, When, Where, and How questions to figure out what another player is thinking. These conversational skills are used to teach children how to begin and maintain an interesting conversation. A variety of topics (a hobby that interests me, a movie I saw recently, my favorite season, etc.) are used to generate ideas, or stories, for the players to figure out. The object of the game is to complete a full circuit of the game board and file your story by the deadline. Designed for children with Asperger Syndrome in mind. Said to help kids develop the social skills needed to begin and hold a conversation.<br/><br/>",

One player is the Planet Player (otherwise known as the PP) and the other is the Aliens Player (AP of course). The Aliens are represented by a single card that starts at the top and then will move across the board and down, just like the real thing. The PP gets to fire first and if he hits any aliens, they are marked off the card with a wax crayon. Then the AP gets to drop bombs.<br/><br/>On any one turn, the PP can fire four shots or he may move to any space along the baseline and get two shots only. A die is used to indicate successful hits.<br/><br/>The PP player wins if he destroys all the Aliens. The AP player wins if he can get just one alien to touch the baseline.<br/><br/>Variants are included for using two dice and for adapting the game for three players.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing three shoe pieces of their own color on the board, which will not move during the game and will help or hinder the players depending on ownership.<br/><br/>Players then take turns moving lettered pieces, one at a time but with each piece needing to move five times (as the player says &quot;Cha&quot; with each step,) to get to a corresponding letter on the opposite side.  Pieces can move in any direction except diagonal and can jump, but do not capture or eliminate others.  First player to find a home for all their pieces on their opponent's side wins.<br/><br/>Note:  the game does not have a publication date.  However, it features both &quot;Hassenfeld Bros.&quot; and &quot;Hasbro&quot; names listed as publisher, and the &quot;cha-cha-cha&quot; was first known at some point in the 1950's or 1960's.<br/><br/>",

This particular game focuses on fairytales.<br/><br/>Central idea: A story or poem is being read, the kids listen, guess, rhyme and grab an object.<br/><br/>Components: 3 wooden fairy tale figurines (frog prince, dwarf, puss in boots), 12 cards (showing objects from fairytales, like an enchanted mirror, a witch's broom, gingerbread house etc.), one symbol die, one booklet with rules, stories, riddles and poems<br/><br/>Games that can be played:<br/><br/>1. Group and name: The players name the figurines and things on the cards and explain what fairytales they are from, or who else is part of that fairytale. They also look for objects that fit a certain criterion (something valuable, something in which one can live...)<br/><br/>2. Grab it: The figurines or cards mentioned in one of the texts from the booklet have to be touched as quick as possible.<br/><br/>3. Memory game: Only six figurines and/or cards are laid out on the table, the others stay in the box. When a character or object is mentioned that is on the table, nothing happens. If one that is inside the box is mentioned, the players shout that word to gain one of the pieces from the table.<br/><br/>4. Memory and storytelling game: The players use the cards and figurines to tell a story. 4 cards are used for the first figurine, the next 4 for the second, and the last 4 for the third. Then the symbol die is rolled. The symbol decides which of the three stories the players have to re-tell.<br/><br/>5. What can you do with this: One player secretly decides on one of the cards. He/she then says what can be done with that object (e.g. &quot;You can use it to make a rabbit appear from a hat&quot; when they have chosen the magic wand). The other players try to guess the object. The first player to touch the correct card wins that card.<br/><br/>",

But somehow humanity was able to survive the pulverizing chunks of moon rock that struck the planet; somehow humanity survived the various super volcanoes, massive radioactive solar flares and other terrible apocalyptic events. Frontier Apocalypse takes place over 100 years after that unspeakable event. In Frontier Apocalypse the Wild West never ended, it just got Wilder!<br/><br/>Frontier Apocalypse: The Hermit's Expedition is a solo Role Playing board/card game in the vein of games like Dungeon, Talisman, Chainsaw Warrior, and Dungeoneer. The player creates a character rolling dice, and then explores a post apocalyptic wild west by flipping cards that either reveal territories, critters, contraptions or various other events or points of interest. There are also boards to help with organization of character stats, gear and the game world. The game has several randomly chosen Expeditions that the player will need to complete with their character in order to win.Combat versus enemies is resolved by the character stats and contraptions and dice rolling. The player wins by completing their Expedition before running out of supplies or getting defeated the by various strange and weird critters who inhabit the Frontier Apocalypse world.<br/><br/>",

The first is for two or three players and starts with the board emptied of all it's pegs. Each player takes turns in adding a peg. If the peg completes a line, the player scores points. When the board is filled up, the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Game two starts with the board filled with pegs except the the hole in the middle of row seven. Each player takes turns to jump over a peg Solitaire-style and can continue jumping if there are more jumps available to him. The winner is the one with the most pegs once no more jumps are possible.<br/><br/>The third game is for one player who starts with the board full of pegs except for the one in the middle of row seven. The game is won if the player can take off every peg by jumping them and get down to just one peg left. For a harder game, that last peg must be in the hole which was vacant at the start (the one in the middle of row seven).<br/><br/>",

The first player to collect an eco medal on all six continents and to reach his/her starting location with 1.000 eco dollars wins the game.<br/><br/>Players travel around the world to take part in environmental protection activities and by doing so, win eco medals. Open cards present the actions that have to be taken. There is one card fewer than there are players, so there is competition for actions.<br/>Movement on the board is determined by dice. One can choose to use only one dice and earn 200 dollars, or use two dice and earn no money, or one can pay 500 dollars to use the plane. When a player reaches the target destination, they earn an eco medal of this continent and the card is removed from the game and replaced with a new one. If a player lands on the same space as another, he/she can take away money or a medal from that player.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has earned a medal of each continent and reaches his/her home town with at least 1.000 eco dollars in his/her pocket.<br/><br/>",

Mr. Duncan generously provided his game gratis to players while happily engaged in building his own model gunboats and conducting games we can only envy--or emulate.<br/><br/>The original rules were designed for battles between 25mm gunboats, mostly scratchbuilt. Specific rules for determining the full game details such as crew size, turning capacities, speed, when to make &quot;Special Hit&quot; checks, etc., have been added to the original rules.<br/><br/>Gunboat Diplomacy is a game played with ship models, either commercially produced or scratchbuilt by the players themselves. The game has been specifically designed to link with The Sword and the Flame: The Sun Never Sets and/or The Sword and the Flame. However, this is a &quot;stand alone&quot; wargame system requiring only the rules and components included or described in order to play.<br/><br/>",

If it is his own color, he also collects a bone.<br/>When the spinner points to a picture of Clifford, the player takes a clifford card. This card can either show one of the players or Clifford. If it shows one of the other players, that player gets a bone, and the player whose turn it is gets one as well. If the card shows Clifford, the player has to return one bone to the bank.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more bones left in the bank; the player with the most bones wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Air Challenge&rdquo; is a board game that lets players experience the thrill of runway operations and the challenges they pose, bringing the excitement of this world-famous airport into their living room!  To win the game, players need to manage their cards to arrange aircraft takeoffs and landings on the two airport runways and collect stars as fast as possible.  The first player to obtain 10 stars or points WINS!<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/>-Each player takes two Aircraft of the same color.<br/>-Shuffle the Action Card deck and deal each player 5 cards.<br/>-The rest of the Action Cards are placed face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo;<br/>-Shuffle the Aircraft Cards with the Scenario Cards. Place the deck face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Aircraft Card (Draw)&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>-The order of play is to be determined by the players.<br/>-At the start of each player&rsquo;s turn, the player should make sure that each of the three Aircraft Card spaces, both North and South, has an Aircraft Card as shown here. If any of these spaces are empty, the player should draw cards from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile to fill them. After the player finishes his turn, the next player should again replace the Aircraft Card spaces from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile if necessary.<br/>-If a Scenario Card is turned up before the game starts, no action is needed, and the drawn Scenario Card should be inserted back at the bottom of the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile. In subsequent turns, the instruction on the Scenario Card must be executed prior to any other action by any player.<br/>--A player can take a maximum of three actions on each turn; in other words, he or she can play a maximum of three Action Cards. All played Action Cards are discarded at the area marked &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Action Descriptions:<br/>-Take off from the Runway, Play a &ldquo;Takeoff Permit&rdquo; Action Card, or &ldquo;Landing Permit&rdquo; Action Card.<br/>-Select a face-up Aircraft Card from the &ldquo;Aircraft Card space.<br/>-Place an Aircraft on the selected Aircraft Card and place the set at the first space of the Runway.<br/>-A player uses &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft on the runways by matching the number of stars on the Aircraft Card. For example:<br/>-1-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card to move the Aircraft one space forward.<br/>-2-Star Aircraft:Requires one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card OR two &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward <br/>-3-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card, OR one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card plus one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card, OR three &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward.<br/>-So, the higher the number of stars an Aircraft Card has, the more difficult it is to move because it requires more arrows on the Action Cards. Using more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards than what is required is acceptable for moving the Aircraft, but the player will not receive the difference back. For example, a player can use a &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card to move a 1-Star Aircraft one space. However, the other two arrows will be forfeited.<br/><br/>-When a player has moved the Aircraft to the third space on the South Runway AND then uses one or more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards that allow the Aircraft to move one more space forward, the takeoff process is complete. The player may keep the Aircraft Card and get a score according to the number of stars shown on the card. The first player to obtain 10 stars wins.<br/><br/>-An Aircraft that has not completed the takeoff process in one turn will remain in its final position on the runway until the player&rsquo;s next turn. Aircraft idling on the runways are subject to other player&rsquo;s actions, including &ldquo;Diversions&rdquo; and instructions shown on drawn Scenario Cards.<br/><br/>Diversion:<br/>-When a player wants to take off, land or move an Aircraft on the runway but is obstructed by another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, he may use a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to divert it.<br/>-When a player uses a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to remove another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, the player being diverted can use an &ldquo;Emergency Takeoff / Landing&rdquo; Action Card to stop the diversion. Without the emergency card, the affected Aircraft Card will be removed tothe &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo; area.<br/>-When 10 Aircraft Cards have been removed to &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo;, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Other Important Points :<br/>-A player cannot keep more than 10 Action Cards at any time; otherwise, he or she needs to discard the extra cards in the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area.<br/>-When no more Action Cards remain, shuffle the cards from the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area and place the shuffled deck face-down at the &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo; area.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>Lilith's Avatar is unique in that she interacts very heavily with terrain, and can make significant changes to woods terrain and the board as a whole. She creates and spreads woods terrain, and then makes that woods terrain very scary for her enemies. She retains most of the abilities of her pre-Avatar form, though many become more woods-dependent. Lilith also gains some very useful long-range attacks and damage effects, which can assist in pushing opponents around and controlling board position.<br/><br/>In Avatar Form, Lilith suddenly needs to worry about two things that didn't matter as much before, woods terrain and Blood Tokens.<br/><br/>Woods Terrain: An overwhelming portion of Lilith's Actions, Spells, and Attacks work only in woods terrain, or work much better in woods terrain. Lilith wants to stay near the woods, and to keep her enemies near the woods too. Place your initial woods terrain carefully, keeping near any objective locations and any likely spots for enemies to congregate. Be sure your Illusionary Forest is in a good place, too, before you Manifest Lilith's Avatar. You can spread woods further from these existing locations, using Lilith's Sanguine Proliferation spell. This requires a 9 card or better, and suits don't matter, so you should plan to have a card in hand for it in case your flip isn't enough. This growth can seem very slow, however, since you can only expand by 3&quot; for every action, so it's usually best to do this only if you're setting up an immediate attack on an opponent who's not quite in reach of the forest on Lilith's turn. Note also that Sanguine Proliferation costs a Blood Token, which can be in short supply.<br/><br/>Gaining Blood Tokens: If you're fighting against living or Undead opponents, Lilith can usually gain a Blood Token every time something dies: anyone killed by her Nature's Revenge spell, or killed within 8&quot; of her and in base contact with a woods terrain, generates a Blood Token. Note that you also generate Blood Tokens when your own models are killed within 8&quot; of Lilith if they're in base contact with a woods terrain. Lilith's most likely crews (Nephilim and Waldgeists) are all considered living, so this may provide some benefit or at least consolation. She can also gain a Blood Token when she kills a living or Undead unit by using Drain Blood, but this is a (0) Action so she can only use it once per round. Note, though, that if your enemy has a lot of Constructs, Nightmares, Objects, Spirits, or Soulless models, these won't give you any Blood Tokens so it may not be worth Manifesting.<br/><br/>Spending Blood Tokens: While pre-Manifest Lilith only really keeps her Blood Tokens to feed her young or try to meet a scheme for VP, in Avatar form she has tremendous need of Blood Tokens. Avatar Lilith uses Blood Tokens to use her Erupting Underbrush mass melee attack, to expand the woods with her Sanguine Proliferation spell (though she can use Blood Tokens from nearby minions within 6&quot; instead for this), and to attack units with her Nature's Revenge spell (though this may also give her Blood Tokens back, possibly generating a profit if she kills a lot of wounded minions). On top of this, she can also use Blood Tokens to grow and mature her Nephilim. The demand and uses of Blood Tokens are quite high for Lilith, so take some care in choosing the right way to spend a Token. A good general rule is: if it's going to kill at least one enemy model, it's worth spending a Blood Token, especially if that model is living or Undead. Otherwise, the Blood Token is probably better spent growing a Terror Tot.<br/><br/>Card Flow Control: Avatar Lilith retains her Rush of Magic Ability and Bloody Fate trigger, so you will often pull a card and discard it during play. This doesn't give you more control cards, but it can be a helpful way of raising the average value of your cards and helping you find the Mask (or occasionally Crows) cards you need. Remember to use these card flow effects, since they will help refine your hand.<br/><br/>",

Britain hardly ever developed stats games up to 1980 or so, and Gary filled the gap in the market by making games for Cricket and Soccer.

A time for the quiz to last is set by the host, say 20 minutes for example.<br/><br/>At the word &quot;Go!&quot;, each team captain comes to the table at the same time and each selects a question slip. This is then taken back to his team, who may consider what the right answer may be. When ready, the team captain goes back to the table and hands their answer to the host. If it is right, the captain takes another slip and returns to his team. Note this is done in real time, there are no turns as such. If the answer is wrong, the captain must wait half a minute before being allowed to take a new question to his team.<br/><br/>When the time is up, the team with the most correct answers wins.<br/><br/>A variation is provided for individuals to play but it is pretty tame, just being a regular quiz game.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played by any number of players, and the first player to reach 80 and get into &lsquo;bed&rsquo; is the winner. Don't forget that you must obey any instructions that you land on.

When a proton is dropped, the surrounding cells are examined in order to determine if an electron is to be created there or not. An electron is created in a surrounding cell if there is a majority of one color's protons surrounding that cell. In that case, the newly created electron takes on that color and orbits the surrounding protons. If the number of surrounding protons of either color is the same, then an electron is not created in that cell, or if the cell already contains an electron, that electron vanishes.<br/><br/>The score indicators display the total number of particles owned by each player.

In the original game of Pogs, players would gamble Pogs from their own collection in an attempt to expand their collection further. Players would stack Pogs face down in a stack and throw a 'Kini' (a hard plastic disk, sometimes referred to as a 'Slammer') from above in an attempt to turn the Pogs over and claim them for their collection.<br/><br/>Pog word builder combines the classic action of Pog with the challenging gameplay of Scrabble. Use 1 letter and 2 letter Pogs to build the biggest words possible. Pog's are obtained in the same way as the original game, by by trying to turn over a stack of Pogs containing unknown letters. The player who builds the most words wins.<br/><br/>As the emphasis of Pog word builder is on the number of words, rather than the length or the quality of words, the game is easily accessible to young players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A children's game from the Rupert Fun book, in 1988.<br/><br/>A parent should first write some short messages, each on a separate piece of paper and give one to each player. It is important that each message should be different and yet have the same number of letters in it, say fifteen.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to see which player can first cross out all the letters of his message. To do this the players take turns to shut their eyes and put the point of a pencil on the checkered squares of the game. If the pencil lands on a picture, the player must say what the object is. For example, &ldquo;D&rdquo; for Dog. If &ldquo;D&rdquo; appears on the player&rsquo;s paper it can be crossed off the message. Sometimes a player will be lucky enough to land on one of the squares which contain an alphabet letter (that too can be crossed off). Should the pencil land on a blank square, the player ends his turn. The games goes on in this way until one player has all the letters of his message crossed out.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of ready&not;made 15-letter messages which the parent can use to start the game.<br/>PLEASE COME TO TEA.<br/>DO YOU LIKE MY TOYS?<br/>MEET YOU TOMORROW.<br/>I HAVE SOME SWEETS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "T&uuml;bingen is a traditional university town in central Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, Germany. Once a year during the Feast of Corpus Christi there is a punt boat race (Stocherkahnrennen) in which competitors are mostly students. This is a very important local and touristic event which gathers usually about 10.000 spectators.<br/><br/>This boardgame tells us about this event. Each player controls 3 or 4 punt boats (depending on the number of players). On each turn a player rolls a d6. If he rolls 1-5, he moves certain number of fields forward or diagonal. If he rolls a 6, he must roll an event die (d8). If the result of the event die is 1-6, the player moves accordingly but if the result is 7-8, he looses his turn.<br/><br/>Punt boats can also be sunk. To sink a boat it must be surrounded by opponent's boats. Sunk boats return to the start fields or to the anchor field.<br/><br/>The game ends when all punt boats arrive to the finish line. Each boat recevies points adequate to its position on the finish line. 1 point for 1st place, 2 for 2nd, etc. The winner is the player with the least points.<br/><br/>",

The red player travels along the red line and the blue travels along the blue line.

When the blue player lands on a yellow square, he goes forward two spaces. When the red player lands on a green square, he goes forward two spaces. If either player lands on a grey square, that player has to go back three spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the centre illustration of Andy Pandy and Teddy having a sleep on a garden bench, wins.<br/><br/>Andy Pandy was created for the BBC television slot that later became Watch With Mother. In 1952, 13 episodes were recorded and these thirteen shows continued to be broadcast for 18 years! In 1970, the BBC made another 13 shows, this time in colour.<br/><br/>",

The dark side of the cards features one of the numbers 1 through six or -1 through -6. Each number appears six times. There also are Sun and Infinity wild cards. The light side features one of the letters C, O, S, or M, with the O appearing twice as often as the other letters.<br/>Instructions are included for seven games, including solitaire and a children's game. Many of the games involve building sequences or sets; others use simple math. Games that use only the light side of the cards tend to be variants on spelling COSMO or finding the letters in COSMO.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Elvis - The Game that Allows The Legend To Live On<br/><br/>Using tokens that include a blue suede shoe or a teddy bear, players roll and move around the board, hoping to land on enough spaces (or draw enough record-shaped cards) to earn $25 million - in a combination of cash and gold records (which are valued at $250,000 each).  Most cards list an accomplishment (&quot;Variety declares Elvis &quot;The King of Rock and Roll!&quot;) or event (Daughter Lisa Marie is born) in Elvis&rsquo; life.  Many cards let players collect money and/or gold records.  Others force them to pay money to the bank.  Some send them to specific spaces on the board.<br/><br/>Several of the spaces are named after places where Elvis spent his time (Graceland, Hollywood &amp; Recording Studio).  There are also Army and Hawaii boxes, where (if you draw a card and get &quot;drafted&quot; or go on vacation) your token must stay for one or two turns.<br/><br/>One unique feature about the guitar-shaped game board is the &quot;On Tour&quot; row of spaces that make up the guitar&rsquo;s neck.  Most of the ten spaces here are just the names of cities where Elvis toured and don&rsquo;t offer anything of value.  But the ultimate goal is to reach the last space - Las Vegas - by rolling the exact number needed.  When a player makes it to Vegas, they immediately collect $500,000.  For their next 4 turns, as long as a 1 or 2 is rolled, the player can stay in Vegas for a &quot;Return Engagement,&quot; collecting $500,000 each time!<br/><br/>Players get a &quot;grace&quot; period and can take out a loan if they lose all of their cash and are forced by a card to make a payment to the bank.  According to the rules, &quot;In the spirit of Elvis&rsquo;s well-known generosity, no player can be forced out of the game by going broke!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inter-war trivia game.<br/><br/>The box contains 25 tiles, each with a subject on them (e.g. Fluss (River), Dichter (Poet) and so on). There are also 17 circular counters, each with a different letter on them. The idea is to name a subject beginning with a certain letter.<br/><br/>A game master sets the 25 subject tiles face down in front of him, and the 17 letters should be placed in a bag. Now he turns the top tile over. Then he draws out the first letter counter. Now, the players call out possible answers (Example Subject could be Country and the counter might by R. Correct answer could be Romania). Who answers first gets the question tile. The letter tile is however is placed back in the bag so that it might re-occur in the game.<br/><br/>If a tile and counter is not answered by anyone, then the tile is pushed under the stack and will be later revealed to ask that subject again but hopefully with a different initial letter.<br/><br/>Who finally has the most tiles when the tiles run out, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Other illustrations refer to other parts of the La Grande Complexe.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to be the first to construct a hydro-electricity complex. Each their turn, players will develop their own construction techniques. It is important to read the rules book for each step of the game.<br/><br/>The game has two main phases, each with their own track on the board. First is the Organization phase, where players acquires Exploration, Project, Financing and Worker cards to begin a Construction site.

The lines are numbered along one edge, goals are drawn near the ends, and then irregularly-spaced line segments are drawn along the lines to create obstacles.<br/><br/>Kick-offs, extra points, and field goals are accomplished by placing a pencil at a certain point, closing your eyes, lifting the pencil, and attempting to bring it down as close as possible to the goal line (for a kick-off) or in the goal area (for a field goal or extra point).<br/><br/>Regular plays are done by placing the pencil at the spot where the ball is, closing your eyes, and attempting to draw a path towards the goal that avoids obstacles. Each player gets four chances (downs) to advance the ball in this way, then the opponent takes over.<br/><br/>The game can be played solitaire using a provided board.<br/><br/>",

Introduce yourself in the big circus involving states, rating agency and crisis phenomena!<br/><br/>Each player takes charge of a State and starts with a more or less average (of course, Italy is worse off than Germany to start) notation. The State card is used to record scores.<br/><br/>Each turn, one of the states plays the role of the CRA.<br/><br/>The CRA chooses a Crisis card among the first three on the top of the pile and puts the States to the test:<br/><br/>1) CRA requests States an estimate of a real quantified data. The more a state is mistaken, the lower its rating will fall...<br/><br/>2) CRA suggests a crazy imitation on the subject of the Crisis card. The most convincing State may increase its rating by three grades.<br/><br/>After 9 turns (about 30 minutes), the game ends and the State with the best rating will be declared &quot;Survivor of the Crisis.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Triple HA!&quot; is both informative and humorous and deliberately shifting between tragedy and comedy, in order to discuss the crisis without over-dramatization. This game will lighten up your evenings even when the CAC 40 is down 1.15%!<br/><br/>",
