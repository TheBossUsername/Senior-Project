You have to work to build your own order combos while blocking your opponents. Oh, and there's a limited set of orders. The easy ones go fast, so plan ahead! It's kind of like a certain candy-swapping puzzle game but made with cards where players can mess with the board of chocolates &mdash; and each other!<br/><br/>All players share the cards on the table and may use any of them to complete and score orders.

While deciding on a character, a &quot;summon card&quot; will also be drawn. The player who draws a summon card becomes a demon king summoned by the Ancients and fights against other players secretly.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the end of the map, the map exploration phase will end and the identity of the Demon King will be revealed.<br/>The next step is to enter a one-on-many card battle, where other players have to join forces to defeat the player who has become the Demon King.<br/>Will the player who becomes the Demon King be inspired by the values of the ancients and win?<br/>Or will the player with modern thinking and debating ability be able to overrule the ancients?<br/><br/>Here comes the battle of ancient and modern arguments!<br/>Debate Card: The wisdom of Eastern and Western classical thought will become the basis of your debate.<br/>The &quot;no contest&quot; card: the slippery slope, the face ......, the modern way of &quot;discussing&quot; things, will become your best trick.<br/>The unexpected event card: in the process of exploring the map, the effect card will be randomly drawn, and you have to sense the direction of the wind in case of emergency!<br/><br/>Five Demons, Five Levels<br/>The five demon lords and five levels are drawn by 葉長青, the artist who won the 2021 Japan International Manga Award, and have both ancient and modern aesthetics.<br/><br/>Mulan<br/>In this game, you designate the size and wind direction of your own card.<br/>Defiant card: 5 effects and one more &quot;symbolic struggle&quot;.<br/>Debate card: 3 cards exclusive to Mulan + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile<br/><br/>Emperor Qin Shi Huang<br/>Invalidate the opponent's disobedience card once.<br/>Disobedience card: 5 effects and 1 more &quot;facepalm&quot; card<br/>Debate cards: 3 cards exclusive to Qin Shi Huang + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile<br/><br/>Mencius｜I am doing this for you<br/>Replace a card played by your opponent with a blank card.<br/>Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 additional &quot;Karma Blast&quot;.<br/>Debate cards: 3 exclusive cards of Mengmu + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile<br/><br/>Pu Songling<br/>You may replace a card from your hand once after you open a duel.<br/>Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 more &quot;Slip&quot; card<br/>Debate card: 3 cards exclusive to Pu Songling + 4 cards drawn blindly from the debate card pile<br/><br/>Zhuangzi｜Northern Meditation with Fish<br/>1. 1 point of blood is returned at the end of each match<br/>2. not take any damage once<br/>Defiant card: 5 effects and 1 additional &quot;Sleep&quot; card<br/>Debate cards: 3 copies of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; + 4 blind draws from the debate card pile<br/><br/>Explore the map with the topic!<br/>The map of &quot;Call of Ancient Fighters&quot; combines five issues: gender roles, authority, parenting styles, media literacy, and philosophy of life.<br/><br/>In order to create a richer &quot;educational and fun&quot; experience, both the map design and the play style are intended to combine both the issues and the player's own reading experience.<br/><br/>For example, in the &quot;Mulan&quot; map, we designed three special exploration points: jeans, car keys, and pens. Players need to explore these points and open the map card before they can successfully summon Mulan to appear.<br/><br/>These three exploration points correspond to the &quot;gender roles&quot; we want to convey in this map.<br/>Jeans symbolize the imagination of women who no longer have to conform to a specific feminine temperament.<br/>The fountain pen represents the power of women to speak, to argue, to write, and to enter the public sphere.<br/>The car key is a means of transportation, signifying the independence and mobility of women.<br/><br/>While novels and comics focus more on the plot, the board game is based on the concept of classic humanistic sentences, focusing on the four protagonists, who enter the realm of the Ancients' obsessions and need to defeat them to regain their freedom. The tabletop game is a combination of two modes: map exploration and card battles, plus role-playing and camp battles.<br/><br/>The five ancients (five maps) represent the following issues: Mulan (gender roles), Qin Shi Huang (authority), Mencius (parenting style), Pu Song Ling (media literacy), and Zhuang Zi (philosophy of life).<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two types, one is the &quot;debate cards&quot; which are based on sentences from Chinese humanities classics and Western contemporary thought classics, divided into three main parts: rational, emotional and value, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the cards are played in the way of point size comparison. The second is the &quot;disobedience to battle cards&quot; that use concepts commonly found in modern slang to trigger events or effects, such as: karma detonation, facepalm, slippery slope, etc.<br/><br/>&mdash;another description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bord&eacute;locratie is a game that puts players at the heart of the French political &quot;bordel&quot; (or shambles). Find yourself at the head of a political party that will leave its mark on the Fifth Republic (or maybe just a dent).<br/><br/>But to reach the supreme position of President and get to move into the Elys&eacute;e palace, you must first increase your popularity, get more votes in the Assembl&eacute;e et vote laws for the good of your part... country !<br/><br/>Designed as a party game that can also be played in a more political version (longer, more intense and with more knives stuck in your back by the end), a game lasts around 1 hour and brings to the table 4 to 6 fans of the best televised political debate of the Fifth Republic, or 4 to 6 players who want to feel powerful while disdaining your nobody opponents (until they become somebody).<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Every turn, players draw 2 Action cards then can only play one.<br/>Then the First Player draws three Bills, submits one to the Assembl&eacute;e and draws a second random one.<br/>Players vote on the Bills submitted (each one giving victory points to player based on specific conditions).<br/>Then the turn end and we start again.<br/><br/>THE ACTION CARDS<br/><br/>The Action cards you get to use have different abilities. Events change the course of the game, Campaign increases your popularity and backers bring you more weight at the Assembl&eacute;e. You can also play fraud cards to turn the tide in your favor, or rip the tide away from another player.<br/><br/>ELECTIONS<br/><br/>Mimicking the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic (with a few liberties of course) every 5 turns, a President will be elected in a two round system. In the first round only the two players with the most popularity get to the second round. Then for the second round, every other players has to endorse one of the two finalists and lend them their own popularity.<br/><br/>WINNING<br/><br/>At the end of turn 12, it's time to see who collected the most victory points through being elected or Bills that gave your points based on the backers you have accumulated.<br/><br/>Of course there is much more to discover in the cards and positions within the government, but that's for you to discover in the game !<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (English)<br/><br/>Bord&eacute;locratie est un jeu qui vous plongera dans le bordel politique de la Ve R&eacute;publique.

The Unseen Domains are treacherous, but might lay the foundations of a new future if it is not destroyed by greed first.<br/><br/>In Unseen Domains the players compete for victory points over three rounds using their unique decks. In the end, the player who has the most victory points wins. During the rounds, each player can perform actions by playing their cards. Actions are used to recruit new units and move them, activate area abilities, and perform various maneuvers for a positional advantage.<br/><br/>Victory points are scored for controlling the domains at the end of each round. They also let the players use the given area's abilities. In the Wilderness, various quests can be completed for powerful Bloodshards.<br/><br/>Each player can perform actions in their turn, but only one of each action type. With certain abilities, and the precious Bloodshards, this limitation can be exceeded, so the pace of the game can be manipulated.<br/><br/>Once the first player has run out of cards, the round ends. Everyone else has one more turn to play, and the player who ended the round gets a free bonus action. With this bonus action in mind, it might be worth it to play your hand as early as possible. But some players who read the game well can make an even better deal by leaving the bonus to the others.<br/><br/>The key is to carefully assess your options, use the abilities to your advantage and time your actions right. Those who can do this can dominate the Unseen Domains.<br/><br/>",

You also stop to participate in some instant auctions against the other families in the home.

At the end of the day the family that scores the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Estate Sale is a 1-6 player table top game involving buying; auctioning; and acquiring different items from an estate sale. Players represent families competing against one another to score the most victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>What is an Estate Sale?<br/><br/>An estate sale is a method of selling ALL (or most) of the contents of a home. Estate sales usually happen after the death of an occupant or other event that causes the inhabitants to quickly move away from the home. Estate sales usually take place over several days and are generally open to the public. An estate sale is like a garage sale or a tag sale. The main difference is that an estate sale is meant to dispose of all of a home&rsquo;s possessions in an orderly manner. Estate sales are much more than a yard sale as EVERYTHING has a price tag. Everything is up for sale.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Score points for difficulty and type, and meeting personal and public objectives.<br/><br/>Better Letters is played on a 5 x 5 grid of cards. Set up the game by shuffling the entire deck and dealing out nine cards into a 3 x 3 grid into the middle of the play area. Cards may be placed in any location as long as there are no more than one of each type (color/shape) in a column or row (Sudoku-style). If you are unable to place all nine, discard the duplicates and redraw/refill until the 3x3 grid is complete. Shuffle the personal objective cards and deal out three to each player. Each player will select two to keep and discard the other.  These are kept secret from other players. Shuffle the public objective cards and deal out three face-up next to the playing area. Place the three timer cards in order from 1-3 above the public objectives and set the 30-second timer next to them.<br/><br/>Better Letters is played in rounds with all players acting at the same time. Turn over the 2-minute timer to begin the round. Each player&rsquo;s goal is to form a word(s) by following the restrictions listed on one or multiple cards. You may work from the top, bottom, left or right, in a straight line without skipping any cards and beginning with a card on the edge. Write down your word(s) on your score sheet in the corresponding round box. All players must finish discovering their words before the timer runs out. When the timer expires, everyone makes sure they have one word circled from their list and will be the word they submit for the round.<br/><br/>Custom scoring commences and the game is played over 10 rounds.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To score points the other players must provide three more items that fit the list's category, but are NOT on the card.<br/><br/>For Category cards, the reader slowly reads each item in the list as the other players shout out guesses as to what the category is&mdash;for instance the reader could be reading &quot;lookout&quot;, &quot;thief&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;parrot&quot;, and so on, and if a player correctly guessed &quot;pirates&quot;, they would earn points.<br/><br/>The Lightning Round cards simply provide a subject (e.g., &quot;Celebrities&quot;) after which players take turns quickly providing a thing that matches the subject. If a player can't come up with something quickly enough they are out. The last player to provide a timely answer gets the points.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to score 5 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gridiron All-Stars is a hard-hitting game of American Football set in a post-apocalyptic America.  Gridiron All-Stars does away with the complexities and randomness that have become a staple of sports games; instead relying upon abstracted movements and euro-mechanics to deliver an authentic and quick-playing sports experience that takes mere minutes to learn yet many games to master.<br/><br/>Gridiron All-Stars relies upon action programming and resource management to create a deep tactical experience that captures the feel of the sport without getting bogged down in its nuance.  Before each drive, choose a Play to determine what Actions your team will take on that Drive (action programming).  Once the ball is snapped, you can use a limited pool of Action Cards to supplement or upgrade those actions to try to score a touchdown or tackle the opposing team&rsquo;s ballcarrier.<br/><br/>Start playing the Base Game in 10 minutes.  Captain a seven player Gridiron team in the local leagues to develop your favorite Plays, learn to manage player positioning, and how to maximize the impact of your Action Cards.  When you&rsquo;re ready for the primetime, unlock the asymmetric aspects of the game by taking control of one of one of the pre-made teams or create one of your own.  Add Star Players and specialized Team Cards to unlock new levels of strategic and tactical depth.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Gridiron All-Stars plays fast.  There are no dice.  There are no charts.  There is no waiting for your opponent to decide whether to block your action.  Play moves quickly back-and-forth emulating as much as possible the speed with which the actual sport is played.  Play as fast as you want &ndash; think speed chess &ndash; with a full game playable in 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beat to Quarters, Vol III (Blue Cross, White Ensign) is an official expansion to Blue Cross, White Ensign by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game to play.<br/><br/>One of the most common criticisms of the Flying Colors system is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.<br/><br/>Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.<br/><br/>Individual tracking cards are included for all 231 individually named ships included with Blue Cross, White Ensign. But that&rsquo;s not all!<br/><br/>As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Blue Cross, White Ensign. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Blue Cross, White Ensign. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the huge battles without the space requirements for several game maps.<br/><br/>NOTE: This volume of Beat to Quarters only includes marker sheets for the British, French, and American fleets. There are insufficient Spanish, Venetian, and East India Company ships to form a fleet, but these ships can be included in the fleets of the other nationalities as desired or added to the cards from the first volume of Beat to Quarters.<br/><br/>With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Blue Cross, White Ensign!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a track game, copyright 1888, with &quot;safety tracks&quot; (turnouts) on each side. In fact, it almost exactly resembles the board layout of Parker Brothers' later games Pollyanna and The Popular Game of Broadway. The only real difference is that there are no &quot;home&quot; paths branching off of the main track. Instead, players start pieces off on their &quot;entrance&quot; space (the board corner in front of them) and make a single loop of the board, returning pieces to the entrance space and then moving them to the center of the board, called the &quot;court.&quot;<br/><br/>THe game is first seen in the Parker Games catalog for 1889, on page 5. The ads do not indicate how the game is played, only that it includes &quot;turned maple pieces&quot; and a spinner. Identical listings are found in the 1890 and 1891 catalogs.<br/><br/>By 1892, Rex is being packaged with The Amusing Game of Kilkenny Cats as two sides of a &quot;combination&quot; board game. It is available in this form until 1895.<br/><br/>",

Then, roll as many times as you like to try to win a pizza card, hopefully rolling enough of the good ingredients pictured in order to win it! But other players may challenge you for that pizza card! And if you roll too many of the bad ingredients listed, you'll go bust for that turn!<br/><br/>But beware, at the end of the game, the leading player rolls a die one final time to select a topping -- the player who grabbed the slice with that topping at the start of the game gets bonus points, and could potentially come out in the lead!<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins the game as the ultimate pizza aficiona-dough!<br/><br/>Freshly delivered in a pizza style box, it's perfect for pizza lovers or anyone who loves a cheesy party game. With gameplay for both small and large groups, it's suitable for ages 8+, 2-6 players and has an average 30 minute gameplay.

On their way back they ignore the arrows and may not shoot at enemy soldiers.<br/><br/>The party or player to get the most soldiers to their opponents starting spaces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Your eight-person clan will trek through hazardous terrain, encountering events along the way, while foraging for food, crafting, and entertaining each other to keep spirits up. No two journeys are ever the same.<br/><br/>You begin the journey with a clan of eight people - a mix of adults, youth, elders and toddlers who each contribute dice to the clan's dice pool. Each turn, you decide how far to journey. You can camp in place to rest and remove weariness, or move more quickly through a landscape of forest, meadows, rivers and other types of terrain. Be careful of moving too quickly, however, or members of your clan will become weary.<br/><br/>Each time you draw a Terrain card, you also draw an Event card. Depending on the cards, your clan might have to deal with anything from a sudden blizzard to an encounter with stragglers from another clan.,On each day of your journey, you choose whether to craft clothing and shelter to keep out the cold, to entertain the clan to keep morale up, or to forage for food and medicinal plants. You can only perform two of these activities, so choose wisely - whichever activity you don't choose will cause members of your clan to become hungry, sad or cold. At the end of the day, you check to see if any of your clan become sick - or if they die from illness.<br/><br/>When your clan finally reaches the cave, the game is scored based on how many of your clan survived, and whether they are sick, injured, or suffering from a condition.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview:<br/>WORD TO WHO is a guessing game that consists of the most popular and widely used slang words and phrases from the Baby Boomer, Gen X, Millennial and Gen Z generations. Players compete against each other to see who can guess the most slang words and phrases. The player or team to guess the most right wins!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Players break up into teams and teams take turns, alternating players each round, with one player attempting to prompt his or her teammates to guess the slang word or phrase on the card. When your teammates guess the word or phrase you move on to the next card. The opposing team keeps a timer with each round lasting 1 minute. Each card is worth 1 point and the first team to 30 points wins.<br/><br/>Cards are color coordinated by level of difficulty, green cards are easy, blue cards are moderate and red cards are hard. Each card comes with a definition that players can use but players can come up with other hints, clues and definitions to help prompt their teammates to guess the word or phrase on the card.<br/><br/>Purpose: <br/>My ambition for WORD TO WHO IS to to promote social connectivity and build a sense of community across generations, cultures, communities, and cities. English is a language that is spoken all over the world and slang is a result of every place putting their own spin on it. My vision is to use slang as a way to forge ties of understanding, acceptance, and unity between people of different backgrounds.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

That meeple is removed from the road and returned to the owner. No points are scored by that player for that road. Should a road with a constable connect with another length of road which has a robber, that follower is also removed, with no points being scored. This same is true for any builder on the road. Should two road sections with constables be joined, nothing happens. At the end of the game, both players receive the full points.<br/><br/>The constable remains on the road until the end of the game.<br/><br/>The constable is not affected by the tower (being a royal servant itself).<br/><br/>The constable can be eaten by the dragon. If the dragon consumes the constable, return the dragon to a volcanoe and end the current movement phase for the dragon (it has retired to its lair to licks its wounds). The constable is returned to the players stock and made be played again.<br/><br/>A player cannot place the faerie in a tile containing her/his constable.<br/><br/>As the constable is not a follower, you cannot place your builder on a road with your constable.<br/><br/>Roads completed with a constable on them are not considered when determining the 'longest road'.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the constable scores VPs equal to the normal value of the road. If the road connects to one or more cities (complete or not) then the player scores one point for each tile that makes up that/those city(ies). If the road connects to a cloister, it scores an additional 5 points. (The tile with the well now becomes very valuable for the Constable, as it creates three endings and potentially more points).<br/><br/>Roads with a constable on them do not count for a point toward the value of the Robber Captain.<br/><br/>",

Or will you go busking, picnicking, shopping and exploring until it&rsquo;s time to go home?<br/><br/>For 2-4 players, take turns moving around the labyrinthine streets of the city, having encounters, buying useful equipment and exploring destinations. Visit city events and local sites of interest on the way, scoring extra points in the process. The first player to score 50 points and get themselves back to Brighton station wins the game.<br/><br/>You can play the game as a roll-and-move, or with sets of action cards that are unique to each player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The loss was never agreed to and remained a bone of contention between the two countries. As time went on, Azerbaijan became sovereign country and quickly built up its former Soviet army. Russia remains allied to both countries now but has a defense pact with Armenia. It also sells both countries its military weapons.<br/><br/>While Azerbaijan built up its military forces that are superior to Arme-nia, Armenia did could not match them due to the fact Azerbaijan used revenue from oil. By 2020, it was time for Azerbaijan to reclaim the disputed loss area.<br/><br/>In late September of 2020, Azer forces made a surprise attack across the Nagorno front positions and slowly made in roads. The opposing forces were fewer but it was the terrain that would determine success. But the war did bring into view future warfare using deadly armed drones that Azer forces bought from Turkey and Israel. Unable to shoot them down, Armenian tanks and radar were decimated within a week losing 173 T-72 tanks, 257 APC, 67 rocket launched artillery, 23 SAM, and 14 radar. It was a staggering blow and great military feat of future warfare tactics.<br/><br/>Eventually, Armenia agreed to a ceasefire in mid-October. Azer forces took the time to redirect their offensive and unleash its 1st Corps along the Iranian border on the 18th. This was a brilliant move catching the Armenian forces off guard in the Fuzuli\\Fizuli area. the Azer armor and mechanized formations raced deep into Nagorno territory coming with-in 20 km of the key town of Lachin in the mountains. If taken, Azer would cutoff the only supply road into Nagorno. As Azer forces cau-tiously approached, Armenian military units in Goris began to counter-attack halting further advance. Being that the two lane road was sur-rounded my 4000 ft. mountains, Azer forces pulled back on Oct. 24.<br/><br/>Now, Azer forces switched to another attack from Fizuli towards Shusha and the Nagorno capital. This main attack was a slugfest due to the mountainous terrain. Armenian troops fought tooth and nail but by Nov.4, Azer forces were within 10 km of Stepanakert and nearly sur-rounded Shusha. If either fell, again, the main supply road would be cut. Bitter fighting and artillery fire continued until Nov. 9, when Shusha fell to Azer.<br/><br/>It was now Armenia agreed to Russia's peace plan. Estimated losses were up to 8000 men, well over 300 tanks lost total and hundreds of artillery guns or rocket launchers.<br/>LESS<br/><br/>",

There are rules for 4 different games. In all but one of them the bigrams are all face up on the table for all to scoop from.<br/><br/>1. Be Quick: Reveal a target card, and everyone has 15 seconds to gather as many bigrams as they can that make a word with that card.<br/><br/>2. Elimination: Reveal a target card, and each player chooses one of their 10 bigrams to make a word with it. The one with the highest-scoring word gets the points of all the cards revealed.<br/><br/>3. Winner Takes All: Each player chooses one of their 3 letter cards and takes a bigram to go with it. The one with the highest-scoring word gets the points of all revealed cards.<br/><br/>4. Scoop Five: Each player takes five bigrams, one for each of their five letter cards.  Each player scores the points for each of their words made.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt 7 letter cards, one manifest, and one bonus indicator.<br/><br/>In a turn a player may do one of these: <br/>- Draw 2 cards. <br/>- Trade a card from the hand with another player. <br/>- Play one or more cards to make words on the table. <br/>- Add a card to another player's word to make a different word. <br/>- Take a card from another player's word. <br/>- Lock one of your words by flipping its letters face down. <br/>- Gather one or more letters from your words, making any words you wish, and placing unused cards back in your hand.<br/>Then they draw or discard so their hand has 7 cards.<br/><br/>The round ends when someone plays an End of Round card, or plays their whole hand out and declares the round over. Then players score positive points for their words that are listed on their manifest, and negative points for their words that are not on their manifest.<br/><br/>",

Points are scored for each letter in all the words a player owns, according to the letters' ranks.  Most cards are Privates, worth 2 points, but each vowel has two cards which are officers, worth more: <br/>A - General (20 points)<br/>E - Major (15 points)<br/>I - Captain (10 points)<br/>O - Lieutenant (5 points)<br/>U - Sergeant (3 points)<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

He then throws again and moves the counter in the direction of his opponents goal, as indicated by the dice. Should the counter fall on a line bearing one of his own players, he continues to throw except where otherwise marked, namely, if the ball lands on a line marked &ldquo;Foul,&rdquo; which is a blue player, the Red gets the next throw. If the ball lands on a player marked &ldquo; Hands,&rdquo; then the Blue gets the next throw, and if the ball lands on either player marked &ldquo; Free Kick &rdquo; then the same side gets a further throw. If the counter finishes on a line bearing an opponent, the throw passes to the other player.<br/><br/>The method of scoring goals is for the counter to fall exactly on Line 12, but if it should fall on or go past Line 13, a goal kick is awarded, the counter being placed on Line 11, on the spots indicated. The centre line is a neutral line, and if the counter falls upon this line, the player continues to throw. The player whose team scores the most goals in 30 minutes (or in the period of time arranged) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The players compete to see who can drive away the most enemies before the battle ends by rolling their dice and using them to attack, to heal, and/or to perform special abilities. Defeating enemies earns a player points, and gameplay ends once one player scores 100 or more points. The winner is the player who achieves the highest score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The picture on the back of the cards is of a wind surfer on Lake Okanagan, and the box features a cartoon of Ogopogo, the legendary creature inhabiting that lake.<br/><br/>The game comes with two decks, each with 51 letter cards and 2 wild cards named for Ogopogo. There are rules for five games:<br/><br/>1. A rummy-like game. <br/>Players are dealt 7 cards, and on your turn you may:<br/>- Play a word of 3+ letters from the hand, 4+ if you haven't played a word yet. <br/>- Take a letter out of any played word of 4+ letters, rearranging the remaining letters to make a word, and using the taken letter with letters in your hand to make a new word.<br/>- Replace Ogopogo with the letter it currently stands for and use it to make a new word from your hand.<br/>- Draw a card. You may use it to do any of the plays above. <br/>When one player uses up all cards in hand, the hand ends and each player gets one point per card in hand. After a certain number of hands, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>2. A children's game reminiscent of Rack-o.<br/>Each player has 5 cards in hand, and on their turn draws from the draw or discard pile, and discards. The first player to have 5 consecutive letters in hand wins.<br/><br/>3. A Gin Rummy-like game with growing hand size.<br/>Deal N cards to each player, who in their turn draws and discards, and lays down their entire hand to spell a word if they can, after which everyone else gets one more turn to try to do the same. Each player who lays down a word gets one point for the hand.  The number N of cards dealt (and hence the length of the target word) starts at 2, and increases one per hand until N=8.  The highest point total wins.<br/><br/>4. Themed words.<br/>The dealer declares a theme -- e.g. animals, colors, girls' names, etc. -- and deals each player 7 cards. Players draw and discard as in game 3. The game ends when a player can lay down a word of any length that fits the theme declared by the dealer.<br/><br/>5. Solitaire.<br/>Draw 5 cards, and try to make and lay down a word of 3 or more letters. Draw cards as needed. You win if you can use the entire deck making legal words.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with a pre-made ship and crew if you don't want to create your own.<br/><br/>The game features a procedural mission generator, where you roll dice to define a mission for your starship captain, and then you perform a series of &quot;command decisions&quot; that the generator reacts to, allowing a dynamic adventure to unfold based on tables you roll on in the book.<br/><br/>Challenges are met by rolling dice from the ship and crew against threats that the procedural generator creates; whichever die is highest is the one that determines what happens.  As you work your way through the mission, you'll be rolling to advance your mission until it is completed, but surprise revelations and other unexpected challenges can throw plot twists into the narrative.<br/><br/>In addition to the core gameplay, there are three &quot;gamebooks&quot; with the game that let you play the game with the same mechanics but through pre-written adventures. One of them, &quot;Charon Wormhole&quot;, is a learn-to-play adventure where you are introduced to the mechanics of the game while playing through a tense adventure about taking your first command.<br/><br/>The core game also includes optional extension materials for advanced play, adding excursion vehicles, companions, vignette missions, and nemesis enemies.<br/><br/>",

It is a variant of the traditional game Memory.<br/><br/>The 80 cards are laid out in a 8x10 grid face down. The first player states a word of 3+ letters. Then each player in turn reveals two cards, and if either of both of them spell the next letters of the stated word, they add them to the word and score their point values; otherwise they replace unused tiles face down. The word must be spelled in order. The player who finishes the current word states another word, and play continues spelling the new word. Once 5 words have been spelled, all the cards are reshuffled and re-dealt.<br/><br/>The player who achieves an agreed-on total -- 50 is recommended for beginners -- wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It is also well suited for adult team building.<br/><br/>The game consists of:<br/><br/>    6 beechwood blocks<br/>    1 bracket with metal rod<br/>    1 plate with 8 holes and 16 cords (each 2 metres long)<br/><br/><br/>For the Fr&ouml;bel Tower, a large outdoor or indoor play area is necessary.<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/>The construction of the Fr&ouml;bel Tower is possible only by means of joint, coordinated action. The Fr&ouml;bel Tower can also be built in a competition between different groups.<br/>The group that can build the highest tower wins the game in this version.<br/><br/>Preparation<br/>Form a circle and place the six beechwood blocks in the middle with the groove facing upwards.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Each player takes one or more cord ends in his or her hand, depending on the number of participants.<br/>The cords were previously passed through the 8 holes in the plate. Now you tighten the cords and try to hook the bracket into the groove of a wooden block, lift it up carefully and place it gently on another wooden block.<br/>It is important that you hold the cord only at the very end. It must not be shortened by reaching forward.<br/><br/>Together you try to stack the wooden blocks on top of each other until the Fr&ouml;bel Tower is completed. You have won the game as a team if you manage to use all the wooden blocks and the tower does not fall over during the building work.<br/>When you hook in the bracket, this may cause a wooden block to fall over. Therefore, you should decide before the game starts whether this wooden block can be put back in place or whether it is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Game variants<br/><br/>    The game is not over until you have dismantled the tower as a team.<br/>    You are not allowed to speak during the game. Naturally, this makes building the tower more difficult because you cannot give each other any instructions.<br/>    You are only allowed to guide the cord with one hand. This also adds another level of difficulty.<br/>    The most difficult way to build the tower is to guide the end of the cord with your &quot;weak&quot; hand. For right-handers it is the left hand, for left-handers the right hand.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mondriaan is a game in which colors and colored areas as well as their number play a very special role.<br/><br/>As simple as monochrome rectangles may be, they can be used in many different ways, which is why totally different game variants await you here.<br/><br/>In one of them, you'll have to keep track of the colors and be quick to react. In the second, on the other hand, it won't hurt if you think a little ahead so that you end up where the most points are.<br/><br/>GAME VARIANT: DICE STUDY<br/><br/>For this variant you need one die and five chips or coins per person. The 12 Mondriaan cards are laid out in the center of the table in a 3x4 grid.<br/><br/>One person rolls a number, while another randomly reveals one of the color cards, if possible at the same time. The two together determine what you need to look for in the cards.<br/><br/>So, if there is a 6 and a red card, you have to look for a card that has six red color squares on it and quickly put one of your chips on it. Whoever succeeds first gets to discard the chip.<br/><br/>Since each combination occurs exactly twice, you can also get rid of two chips per round. If you have no more chips, you win the game.<br/><br/>GAME VARIANT: SPACE COMPOSITION WITH 6 COLORS<br/><br/>For this variant you need two dice and three differently sized game pieces or markers per person, each in one color.<br/><br/>The six color cards are placed face up on the table as a circle. The shuffled Mondriaan cards are distributed evenly to everyone.<br/><br/>Take turns placing one marker on each color card. Never place two markers of the same size on the same card, but place several markers of the same size on the same card.<br/><br/>When both dice are rolled, you take turns performing one of the following actions:<br/>-  place a card from your hand on a color card matching the value of a die (if you roll a 6, you can place a card with six red squares on the red color card)<br/><br/>- place one of the upper Mondriaan cards already on the table on another color card, if the conditions there are right.<br/><br/>- place one of your own point markers on another color card<br/><br/>When a person puts down their last card, you calculate your points:<br/>For the color with the most cards on it you get three points, for the next two and then one.<br/>You then multiply these points by the values of your markers, from small to large with one to three.<br/>Whoever has the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The title means something like 'flower position'.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of seven cards in their own colour. Some cards are Warabe (children) and some are Ayakashi (weird). If a player can give away all their weird cards by the end, they win. Otherwise, points are calculated.<br/><br/>Each card has a shadow half, and a bright half, on both sides of the card. So a player can look at another player's hand and see which cards are the bright side up and shadow side up. Players arrange their own hands at the start of the game, and cannot change this later.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all the cards in the player's hand are shadow side up.<br/><br/>Players take turns to offer a card to another player, by drawing the card up a little in their hand. The player offered either takes it or declines it, but either way the card is now turned shadow side down, and cannot be offered away. If the card was taken, the player can place it anywhere they like in their hand. If declined, it stays in the same position as before and cannot be moved.<br/><br/>Once every hand is shadow side down, the game ends. If a player has disposed of all their own Ayakashi cards, they win. Collecting Ayakashi cards from other players does not matter.<br/><br/>Otherwise, players score points. +1 pt for Warabe cards, -1 or -2pts for Ayakashi cards. But if a Ayakashi cards is flanked by Warabe cards, it is worth zero. Then, the most points wins.<br/><br/>The rules allow for a 4 player game using two packs. In this case, it is played as a doubles game, with partners discussing their moves.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The fox player cannot see if a craw has a cheese in its mouth or not. In his turn, the craw player has 5 action points. He may use for each craw at most 1 point. There are 3 possible actions: entering new craws at the base line, advance a craw to a tree of the next line, eating a cheese for as many victory points as the number of the line. This craw is out of the game now. <br/>The fox player may move his fox one space within the fox net. All these spaces are connected with 1 to 4 trees. He may ask a craw on a connected tree to sing. If the craw has a cheese, it is out of the game, if not, it will continue. After all craws are out of the game, the roles change. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

To play, the tiles are scattered face up on the table; a child takes a board and looks for the letters on the board, and on finding one, takes the tile, covers the letter on their board, and says the letter and the item pictured that starts with that letter. The one who completes their board first wins.<br/><br/>It also says words and sentences can be made with the tiles, and indeed the frequency of the letters looks like it correlates with the frequency of use in everyday language use; but there are no rules for games or activities for spelling words.<br/><br/>",

This is a turn-based, resource-managing, survival, racing game. This is Rough baby!<br/> Traversing forests, and lakes, mountains and open fields, would be a challenge, but with the aid of a few scattered trading posts, caves and tents, you'll be able to equip and assist yourself along the way.<br/><br/>Each turn a player will be able to roll a custom dice 3 times to hike their pawn across the open grid-like board, gathering resources onto their player mat freely as they go. With every roll of the dice you can get a hike(Move 1 space), a hungry(discard 1 Berry or Fish and Move 1 space), or a disaster(end your turn and draw a Disaster Card). Throughout gameplay you will acquire cards that give you special abilities during future turns, make trades at Trading Posts located on the board for helpful tools and even have the chance to make a friend with a bear. <br/> Player's have a limited amount of space in their backpack, so they have to be strategic with what and how much of each resource to carry along with them.<br/> The most unique mechanic of the game is the Disaster Deck. The backs of the cards are disasters that will happen to the board or all players(everyone at the table sees this side), but the fronts are helpful abilities that only you can see and use. So as long as you are holding on to the cards in your hand, the disasters on those cards will always be a threat to the progress of all players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Play a card so one of the first letters or its state or capital name matches one of the first letters of the top table card; or just play a card onto the top of the table pile. If you match you keep all the current table cards, scoring the numbers next to the words whose initials you matched, and the same spot in all cards under the top card.<br/><br/>4. Hi-Number. Play a card whose blue number is higher than the last card played, or pass. If you play the last card in the current trick you keep the played cards and score the blue number of each of them.<br/><br/>5. Americana. Play one or more cards so that one large initial of each of them adds to a growing word on the table, or just play one card to start a new word. If you complete a valid word you keep its cards and score their blue numbers. Valid words are those about anything about America: a state or city name, famous person, work of art, invention, etc.<br/><br/>For each of these games, you refill your hand after play, and the target score for a win is 1776.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

They then proceed to move one of their pieces according to the chess moving scheme represented on the card (if you play a bishop you can move any of your pieces as if it was a bishop).<br/><br/>Pieces are captured the same way you do in chess, but following the roshambo logic (eg: a scissor piece can only capture a paper piece).<br/>After a player has moved he draws another card and the turn passes to his opponent.<br/><br/>Pieces  captured can be respawned in game using special cards and every capture is a point.<br/><br/>After 15 turns the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. If a player is able to capture all 3 pieces of his opponent before he is able to respawn any of them the game ends immediately by knockout.<br/><br/>Full rules and manual can be found on the official Scamorra site.<br/><br/>",

Including two never before seen miniatures, Akhelian Thrallmaster and The Auric Flamekeeper. These models will lead the two armies into battle, but who will come out on top is down to you.<br/><br/>Fyreslayers are born from the furnaces deep within mountain vaults, bellowing mighty war cries as they charge into the fray swinging their deadly battle axes. They carry little in the way of armour to protect themselves, instead blessed with the power of their God magical ur-gold runes that are seared into their flesh, allowing their God's power to flow through their veins and provide them with abilities of more resilient skin and increased strength to cleave their enemies in two and shrug off wounds that would slay a normal warrior. What drives the Duardin Fyreslayers ever on is the promise of gold to be won, to fulfil their oaths by vanquishing their enemies and the chance to honour the spirit of Grimnir.<br/><br/>The Idoneth Deepkin are a cursed people. When Teclis took his due of Aelven souls from the captive Slaanesh he crafted a new race that he hoped would embody the virtues of the Aelves from the world that was. He failed. The creatures he created were not untainted by their time within the God of Excess, holding within themselves a deep well of darkness. Horrified at his failure, Teclis attempted to eradicate his newly created children but could not act before they fled, far into the deepest oceans of the Ethersea. There they multiplied only to discover to their horror that the majority of their children possessed withered souls. Few survived beyond birth and fewer still to adulthood so a decision was made. In order to safeguard the lives of those few children that survived the Idoneth would need to graft healthy souls to theirs thus do the Idoneth venture into the mortal realms on raids to enslave living captives to be donors and ensure the future of their race.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, be careful not to run out of water, get caught in quicksand or encounter a scorpion!<br/><br/>Your maze exploration starts by shuffling all the maze tiles facedown and placing them on the table in front of you, being sure to connect at least one edge of each tile to another. You will then roll one or two dice to move over the tiles, turn them faceup, rotate them, and uncover the maze before you run out of your limited supply of water.<br/><br/>Along the way you will search for the hidden exit while also encountering various artifacts. Some artifacts, like the well, will help you to continue your explorations, others, like the scorpion or quicksand will not!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Close your eyes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Werewolf, open your eyes and point at the person you would like to kill. Okay. Close your eyes.&rdquo; (If there is more than one Werewolf, they will silently come to an agreement on ONE victim.) &ldquo;Prophet, open your eyes and point at one person to see their identity.

This advent had been promised in the Abrahamic religions, including Christianity. His name was &quot;the Chosen One&quot; and has been narrated in various languages throughout history. The name commenced its journey from the ancient Syriac language with Munahhemana (ܡܢܚܡܢܐ), passed by Greek with Periclutos (&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&lambda;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;) and then landed in the Gospel of John with Paraclete. This name has since remained in the hearts and minds of generations to come. In the Gospel of John, the Prophet Jesus (PBUH) said, &quot;I am announcing the coming of someone who, if I do not leave you, will not come&hellip; &ldquo;He will teach you everything and recollect what I have told you&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;When he comes he will bring justice and equity to the world&quot;. Ultimately, the Chosen One, named Muhammad (PBUH), appeared in the Arabian Peninsula. He, along with his companions, migrated to Medina to build the Abrahamic civilization.<br/><br/>Munahhemana needs citizens who will help him build the new civilization with their production and economics, dedication and obedience, intelligence and politics, and science and wisdom. In the Game of Munahhemana, various challenging events and important missions occur. Herein, only tribes with specific characteristics can support Munahhemana. They must find the balance between the strengthening of their tribes&rsquo; power and carrying out missions assigned to them.<br/><br/>ROUTINE, CO-OP or SOLO. You can choose and play any of these three modes. In routine mode, you compete with other players, while in co-op mode, you collectively work together, and finally, in solo mode, you work alone to play the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Using only 20 cards, it is extremely portable and can be played almost anywhere.<br/><br/>Shogun Dynasty is played as a series of games.  Players are knocked out of a game until the winner is determined.  The winner of the series is the first to win 3 games or to win a game with the Emperor.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of one card.  On their turn they draw one card and play one of their two cards, keeping the other as their hand.<br/><br/>Cards can be played face up or face down, with different effects.  Cards played face up take effect immediately.  Cards played face down take effect at the start of the player's next turn.  And players may discard the face down cards of other players before they take effect.<br/><br/>Card effects may knock a player out of the game.  At the end of the game, the remaining player with the highest ranking card in their hand wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Secret Cardinals is a &lsquo;take that&rsquo; player elimination game of Vice, Virtues, and hidden Roles within Roles. Eliminate political opponents and survive the power struggle from within the 15th century church through deception, sabotage, and calculated choices. For each turn, clever players will need to strategize their actions wisely to deduce who their political rivals are, acquire gold for its power, or gamble their advantage on the role of the dice. Use gold to purchase indulgences, gain virtues by giving charity, or pay a bribe to find rivals guilty of vice. Each turn brings unexpected dangers and new ways to win.<br/><br/>Rome, 1418. The Papal standoff that had split the church for decades has just concluded, but tensions still linger from when three rival popes simultaneously claimed to be the one true pope. Each claimant was backed by a competing power of Europe: Rome, Pisan, and Avignon. Driven by politics rather than theological disagreement, the church was thrown into turmoil. To find a compromise, a fourth Pope was chosen to succeed as the legitimate head of the church. As a result, the other three claimants were deposed, jailed for heresy, or excommunicated for their disobedience. In order to maintain a delicate network of alliances among the ruling powers, the new Pope has secretly named his choice for a new Cardinal from among these powers to honor this player&rsquo;s service while keeping them safe from the political machinations of the competing Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Adversaries with hidden agendas and hidden roles are looking to eliminate their opponents and win the game. An upstart with an agenda wants to be acknowledged as the Secret Cardinal and is looking to eliminate the competition. A rival Roman Cardinal is not keen to recognize the influence of the new Pope and the fanaticism of their Devoted Follower creates a dangerous situation for anyone trying to upset the status quo. No one is safe from the Heretic infiltrators, as they work to limit the growing influence of the church, even as the are being hunted by the an overzealous Inquisitor who is determined to root out anyone suspected of heresy. Lastly, interlopers associated with the neighboring monarchy have not forgotten their candidate for Pope was excommunicated and have sent a Royal Spy from Avignon to cause trouble.<br/><br/>Players will see similarities to Bang and One Night Ultimate Werewolf, with unexpected action cards and new ways to win with roles within roles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The headlights of each vehicle are labeled with a point value of 10 or 20 and each has a cupped tin tray underneath to catch a small disc and hold it in place.<br/><br/>The goal is to take your set of heavy cardboard discs - red or yellow - and score points by tossing them at the target and covering the headlights of the three cars. However, misjudging your aim and covering the headlights of the police motorcycles will instead accrue negative points!<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the first player to reach 100 points.<br/><br/>",

Whatever number is rolled, they may &quot;call&quot; for that card, and if another player has it, they must give it. Throwing three stars allows a player to call for any card they want to help make a continuous sequence. Throwing three crescents allows them to draw a Heck card and use it as a wild card in a sequence.<br/><br/>The first player to complete a sequence wins the game, &quot;by Heck!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a deck of 12 cards, 10 Warrior cards numbered 0-9, 1 King card numbered 10, and 1 Witch card numbered 11. A round begins by each player dealing out five card onto the play surface from left to right. The cards have a silhouette of an Axe or a Shield along the long edge of the card. When the edges of the cards line up they will either match axes, shields, or have no match. The number of Axes is your attack strength, the number of shields your defense. If you have more Axes than you opponent has Shields, you have wounded their tribe. See what their highest numbered card is. If it is a Warrior, remove the card from play. If it is the King, give them one of your matching wound cards. If it is their Witch, remove their Witch from play, but also remove your lowest Warrior card.<br/><br/>If the initial draw of cards results in a tie, each player plays another card to the right of the last card played. Count Axes and Shields again, and follow the above results.<br/><br/>If your tribe is going to be wounded by your opponent you may CALL UPON THE BERSERKS! When you Call Upon The Berserks you may draw one card and play it to either end of your row of cards. You may do this only once per round and the Berserk card will be removed from play after the round.<br/><br/>Continue playing rounds until one player has received the three wound cards from their opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Collect trinkets and tokens from the forest floor to increase the appeal of your nest. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better than that other guy's.<br/><br/>Bower is a competitive 2 player, pick-up and deliver game with engine building upgrades and push-your-luck scoring elements. Gameplay revolves around strategic pathfinding and turn optimisation. On your turn, your opponent will first populate the forest with berries and trinkets using the seed deck. You may then alter the paths through the forest by rotating the 7 central tiles, before moving your Bowerbird along its current path, collecting the trinkets you pass over. If you can return your bowerbird to the nest, you score points depending on the number of trinkets it returned with. You also earn a powerful crest to enhance your future turns. The player with the most points from their bower and personal goal cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Note: Great Bowerbirds (endemic to Australia) have a fascination with anything green or white. The Males will collect as many discarded toys, plastic scraps, stones, bones and shells as they can find to decorate their nest (Bower), in the hopes of scoring a partner during the November-January mating season. Young males will even work together on a &ldquo;practice&rdquo; nest, to ensure their skills are properly honed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brokers is a game where players role play as an intern investing a client's retirement fund. Each round of the game, players are presented with the current market conditions and must make strategic decisions on what to buy, sell, or hold in order to increase the value of their client's portfolio.  Players must push their luck to squeeze out as much money as possible before the inevitable market crash as only cash on hand is important once the market tanks.  Do you have what it takes to beat out the other interns and impress the boss? Try it out in Brokers: The Stock Trading Game.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly selecting 3 event cards including the Market Crash event and mixing them. Then 5 or 6 cards (depending on the number of players is add on top of these 3 cards.  This is the event deck.  The Stock Summary Sheets are placed in the play area and the price deck for each is shuffled and the top card of each is played face up on top of the corresponding Stock Summary Sheet. A marker token is placed on each Stock Summary Sheet for on the price listed on its current price card. The Energy stock does not have a price deck and instead has its marking token placed on 155. Each player is given a set of action cards which includes 3 buys, 3 sells, 2 praises and 2 critiques.  Each player is given a starting portfolio of $150, and share of 2 Retail, 2 Venture Capital, 2 Energy, and 2 Manufacturing stock certificates.  Players receive additional $150 on turns 2 and 3. One player is selected as the Lead Intern.<br/><br/>The game is played in up to 8 or 9 rounds depending on the number of players and each round an event is played which alters the rules of play for that round. Each round players secretly plan which 3 action cards they will play and players reveal their actions together. The player with the Lead Intern card starts playing 1 or 2 action cards for a single stock type and each player does the same taking turns going clockwise until all actions are played.  The action cards players choose influence the order of decisions that the other players make.  As players buy shares the price increases for the next player. As players sell share the price of decreases for the next player.  If a player plays a praise card, the price increases by two values. If a player plays a critique card, the price decreases by two values.<br/><br/>Once all actions are played, players collect exclusive roles for fulfilling specific portfolio requirements. The Major Retail shareholder role gives the player double dividends for retail shares. The Major Manufacturing shareholder gives the player an extra sell action each round. The Major Venture Capital shareholder role gives the player a free share of Venture Capital each round. The Most Diversified Portfolio role give the player an extra $25 dividend for having at least one of each stock and the greatest number of stocks among all the players.<br/><br/>After roles are collected or redistributed, players collect dividends for owning the stocks in their portfolios, and then the Lead Intern card is passed to the next player clockwise.  The game ends at the end of the round when the Market Crash event occurs. At that point, the player with the highest cash score (not share value) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Choose your captain, gather a motley crew, and use any means necessary to out-sail and out-wit your fellow players in the quest for plunder.<br/><br/>The strategic heart of Vikingskip' is about racing to see who can amass the most loot over four rounds by raiding and trading with historic Targets and surviving dangerous Longships.<br/>Each turn players strengthen and refine their Longship by drawing rooms and placing them. <br/>As ships get longer, players can amass larger crews with a wealth of skills, strengths, and cultural backgrounds.<br/>As ships get stronger, so do the longships that hunt you!<br/><br/>Players interact with each other by discarding cards from their Longship, playing Action cards from their hand, and raiding Trade routes controlled by other Captains. Action cards can disrupt, and even intercept other players. A clever captain can indirectly kill a greedy opponent, saddle them with a dodgy crew or build a Longship that can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>After the fourth round is over, players tally their banked loot and subtract any fallen Captains from their final score to determine the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Instead of playing with clans of mercenaries against marauding monsters, you now swap roles, taking on the role of hordes of fearsome monsters who fight off attacking humans. YOU are the monster player! Instead of looking for the favor of the Queen, you now work towards becoming the most infamous horde, competing to win the approval of the Great Entity of the Beast realm and be named Megalomonster.<br/><br/>Your hordes are made up of different types of monsters, the most powerful of which are your champions. Each champion (represented in the game as card) has an ability and brings along further monsters (represented as dice or tokens) to be used in battles and other assignments. Send your champions to perform different tasks in your territory, have them lead battle against the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; humans, or fight it out with your fellow monster hordes for rewards in the champions&rsquo; arena. You can acquire mutations, armor, reinforcements, health berries, chillies, and more, all with a dice placement mechanic that not only requires planning of the right timing, but also of the right dice/tokens to be used in each job. Lots of new and different places await you, making Monster Lands 2 a very rewarding experience for Monster Lands 1 players, while at the same time working perfectly stand-alone (you don&rsquo;t need Monster Lands 1 to play Monster Lands 2).<br/><br/>Wait, did we tell you that your monsters include mulfins? The mulfins, those little buggers, tend to explode, so be warned when handling them. But then again, your monsters still feed on their remains if they do explode ... after all, a monster has to eat.<br/><br/>Who is going to be the most infamous monster horde?<br/><br/>",

Manage your resource points to build an army capable of controlling the galaxy.<br/><br/>From the start of your turn you'll gather your resource points for the round. You can spend them on placing new troops, buying new ships, or upgrading your research and development. Then use these troops to fight or take over new territories.<br/><br/>You can move as many troops into an area with opponents on it. After the movement phase begins the attack. Each player will roll dice for attacks. The dice roll required depends on the type of unit attacking. Most units require a 5 or a 6 on the dice for a successful hit. Each player will learn from these experiences to deploy a more effective strategy as the game moves on.<br/><br/>Over time the territories you take away from your enemies will lessen the amount of Resource Points they get per turn, diminishing their ability to fight back. You can win by getting the opponent to surrender (ends a game faster) or you can play it out, and chase them through the map to destroy the troops they have left and end the game. Moving a fleet ship costs 10 RP, so the opponent will eventually run out. You win when the other player is unable to make any moves.<br/><br/>",

Points are scored by moving a neutral 'ball' piece back into a section of one's own back row, having pieces kick it about.<br/><br/>Play is progressive - that is, the first player moves one piece, the second moves two, and thereafter each turn involves moving three pieces.  Moves are 'slides', much like a queen in chess, but each piece must move as far as possible - meaning that the challenges of the game are less about speed (action is quick and can range rapidly around the board), and more about strategizing to keep good control over one's pieces and setting up good positionings.<br/><br/>Backscore is a more-complex descendant (different enough that it escapes being a plain variant, but close enough credit is important to give) of Neutron by Robert Krauss.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Superclass cards are postponed until the final stage.<br/>Class cards remain implicated in the challenge deck and drop out to players randomly during the game itself. Also in the game there are goal cards that are in the challenge deck (they come to players during the game). After receiving the goal, you put it in front of you next to the class card.<br/>Each turn, one challenge card should be played with a dice roll. If the number that falls out is greater than the number indicated on the challenge card, then the card is played and can be put away in a discard or folded into a set of goal cards.<br/>On each card, there are symbols in the upper left (bonus cards) or right (challenge cards) corner. On the bonus card - a positive or negative bonus. On the challenge card - the number of bonus cards that must be used to draw the card. If there are still not enough points, then life points are taken away from you according to the number of uncovered points (the total number of bonuses and challenges on the table is 8, 5 fell on the cube, 3 life points would be taken away from you).<br/>Players need to collect the complete set indicated on the goal card. After reaching the specified condition, the player receives a random superclass card, loses health points and continues the game. The game ends when all players have fulfilled the conditions indicated on the goal cards (or by agreement).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Chicken Hunter, players simultaneously reveal cards from their hand, aiming to score points.   There are no restrictions on what cards players can reveal (e.g. does not need to be a straight, or x-of-a-kind).<br/><br/>In each round, two hands will be rewarded with points.  First, look at the players who revealed the fewest number of cards.  This player earns points equal to the number of cards they revealed multiplied by the sum of the face value of these cards.  (In the case of a tie, the tied players first discard one card each.)<br/><br/>Then, from the remaining players, look at the player with the lowest face value sum of the cards revealed.  This player scores points using the same calculation.<br/><br/>Afterwards, players draw up to 6 cards and repeat the process.<br/><br/>The game lasts until a player achieves a preset threshold and at that point the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "West of Souls is innovative solo or cooperative fantasy adventure for 1-6 players. Enter the world of Eloria, plagued by darkness and monsters of a vitriolic nature. You and your party will explore and make decisions that directly affect the world&rsquo;s infrastructure and future. The vastly branching storylines and numerous NPCs found in West of Souls ensure unique game play and future replay ability.<br/><br/>Enemy encounters and agonizing choices abound in this game and even the simplest of decisions may alter the world as you know it. Players will take up the mantle of an unlikely hero who, through motives of their own, have decided to stop Eloria&rsquo;s impending doom. Be it gold, valor, or a deep empathy for the world around them, the players must work together to gain victory over scenarios and continue on their journey.<br/><br/>As players progress through the ever-changing world, they will develop their abilities, gain increasingly effective gear, and unlock additional skills specific to their character. Following each completed scenario, player choices will determine the future direction of the party&rsquo;s quest, guaranteeing player involvement in the development of their own story. <br/> The game is split into scenarios that are comprised of an exploration and journey phase, and each turn is split into a time of day (morning, mid-day, dusk, night). In the journey phase of the game, characters with travel throughout the game map discovering locations, triggering events, battling monsters, interacting with the world, and talking with NPCs to gain information about their quest and Eloria&rsquo;s tainted past. Action point-based turns are used within West of Souls. Each player will have a defined number of actions that may be completed on their turn (unless you have unlocked a skill or found some gear that says otherwise). Once enough information has been gathered and players are in the correct location, the exploration phase begins.<br/><br/>One unique aspect of West of Souls is that the exploration phase is a hybrid of non-linear narrative, card-based battle encounters, and dungeon crawling. In addition, all characters in play do not have to enter the same exploration together, allowing for multiple explorations to occur simultaneously. Within the exploration phase, players will be forced to make harrowing choices, complete skill checks, and defeat beast to move forward. Vital story elements, lore, and history will be revealed to the players as they progress through the game.  <br/>While death is an option in West of Souls, a player is never permanently removed from the game. The main resources in this epic journey are time and stress. If your team does not accomplish their goal within the allotted time frame, Eloria is cast into ruin. Likewise, if the encounters prove too much for your party and your stress level reaches a breaking point, you will lose the game. Victory is achieved at the end of each scenario as players defeat enemies of increasing difficultly and complete the necessary tasks. <br/> This flagship game from Sky Monster Games is an ambitious story telling odyssey that maximizes the use of battle mechanics in combination with non-linear storytelling and character customization.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Focus on building up your infrastructure and set yourself up for a strong finish or go for fast and immediate rewards. Use your Influence in the council chamber to make sure things progress according to your wishes, or resort to outright aggression to dominate the competition.<br/><br/>A New Frontier is a highly engaging conflict game where your ability to gauge your opponents is key to victory. Since players can interact with all other players, regardless of position, conflicts are plentiful, but also quite undramatic. There is no player elimination, and you also cannot &ldquo;gang-up&rdquo; on someone, at least not from a conflict perspective. Conflicts are multi-phased, with ample opportunity to outsmart your opponents.<br/><br/>A New Frontier has nearly no hidden info (the obvious exception being player fleets) and few random elements, and with only 5 turns every decision counts. The goal of the game is to become the most dominant Corporate Republic in the Alpha System, which is achieved by having the most Victory Points by game&rsquo;s end. All types of actions can potentially lead to Victory Points allowing for multi-pronged strategies. In addition to Actions and Credits, players must balance Prestige, which represents their organization&rsquo;s goodwill and reputation, and that is essential for certain aspects of the game.<br/><br/>The game is centered around four ore-rich planets, with each player being present at every planet. This is where players harvest ore for income, build ships and upgrade mines, as well as carry out attacks against each other. In addition, there are four support areas/phases (Exploration, Politics, Marketing and R &amp; D), where players can choose to diversify in order to gain advantages and Victory Points. Each Turn starts with a Planning Phase where players hiddenly set their strategic plan for the whole turn by using the resources at their disposal. Players then make tactical decisions during each Action Phase within the framework of their strategic plan.<br/><br/>Depending on chosen strategy, a player will normally amass between 30-60% of their Victory Points during the game, and the rest during end game scoring.<br/><br/>",

While the families struggle to survive day-to-day, they must gather the courage and tools to defeat the undead fiend!<br/><br/>Kringa is a cooperative horror worker-placement game with a strong push-your-luck component.<br/><br/>Players start with a family of four workers - each with unique abilities. Assign workers to locations to collect resources. Use resources to craft helpful items, hire helpers and overcome dangers. As dusk descends, you can choose to risk danger and stay to gather more resources, or return home to feed and protect your family with blessings and hexes.<br/><br/>As night falls, Grando stalks Kringa. If Grando stops at a location or home, unprotected workers will fall sick or even placed in the village's crypt. If the crypt fills up, the players lose.<br/><br/>Players have a limited time to discover how to destroy Grando by fulfilling the secret holder's objectives. Once a secret is discovered, you will learn one of Grando's weaknesses. Ready the weapons and set up a trap to lure Grando in. If you manage to successfully spring the trap and defeat the evil Strigoi, you win! If you fail, you doom Kringa to a fate worse than death!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Trump cards of the same value will cancel each other in a trick if present in even numbers, leaving the last one played to win a trick if an odd number are played.<br/><br/>The teams place their bets on a board where if one team bids a high number, the other team will be limited from bidding a specific low number.  Additionally, each of the values a team can bid has a multiplier for how it will pay out, and the teams are placing chips face down on the different spaces, giving a different weight to their confidence in each of their bets.<br/><br/>The team with the most points when one team reaches 150 points wins.<br/><br/>",

Competitors throw 44-pound granite stones (or &quot;rocks&quot;) down an ice sheet into a bulls-eye target area (the &ldquo;house&rdquo;) at either end of the 155 foot playing surface. Teammates often furiously sweep the ice with brooms to affect a thrown rock&rsquo;s speed or trajectory. This is a finesse sport.<br/><br/>In Big Time Curling two players each hold an 8-card hand composed of three types of cards: Guards, Draws and Takeouts. Guards are blocking stones that make it harder to throw (or &quot;draw&quot;) a stone into the bulls-eye (&quot;house&quot;) or remove (&quot;takeout&quot;) one. After all 16 cards have been played a round (&quot;end&quot;) is completed.

They have fought countless petty wars that have spurred their military and economic growth. Their influence and conflicts extend around the globe, and the aristocracy have no wish to see it end...but change is coming. Great alliances are forming, and the nations of Europe are consolidating their power for the final struggle. Will one nation's imperialist dreams raise them up as the world's sole power, will the world leaders form a great League of Nations to end all wars, or will the century old rivalries pull the world into the most horrific war ever seen?<br/><br/>As the leader of one of the five great powers in Europe, you will compete to spread and protect your influence around the globe using military, economic, and diplomatic might. Use the press to sway public opinion to force nations into alliances or war, and upgrade your empire's capabilities by establishing control over important regions of the world. You must be careful, though, because the world is on the brink of all-out war and it could spell the end of the West's dominance.<br/><br/>In Western Twilight, you will perform actions using your personal rondel, with opportunities to upgrade it with enhanced and new abilities for a unique engine-building experience. Compete with the other nations of Europe for control of territories around the world by competitively drafting cards to place your nation's military, economic, or diplomatic influence markers. You must be cautious because every action you take can bring the world one step closer to the war to end all wars.<br/><br/>Western Twilight can end in three ways: diplomatically, economically, or militarily. Each ending will change how your different influence markers will score, so you must steer the world down the path you are most prepared to win, whether that be peace or war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The number of dice decides where and whether the player may insert a new turtle or let it swim further, or whether a turtle rises or dives. Next, the player may place one of his animals from the island on a turtle. The player's third action is to move all of his animals one turtle further. Each animal (kagu, rabbit, coala, lizard, monkey) has its own properties for movement.<br/>Additionally, the player may play an action card and annoy teammates or defend himself to other teammates.<br/><br/>In the professional variant, events can occur at the beginning of each round.

All players draw 4 cards from each deck.<br/>     The player who owns the game goes first. On your turn, choose a green card and a red card from your hand, so the words at the bottom form a sentence (the skeleton). Read the skeleton aloud.<br/>     All players (including you!) discard one of their cards face-down in the center of the table, forming a loose pile &ndash; the closet. They place a green card (&ldquo;Shhh&rdquo;) if the skeleton is true for them. Place a red card (&ldquo;Nope&rdquo;) if it is not true for them. Be honest in your choice; the answers are anonymous. After placing a card, draw back up to 8.<br/>     When all players have put a card into the closet pile, loosely shuffle it face-down. Dramatically re-read your skeleton sentence and then one-by-one reveal the cards from the closet, saying &ldquo;Shhh&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nope&rdquo; as appropriate. Only the color of the cards in the closet matters for scoring, not the text at the bottom.<br/>     You score a point for each green card in the closet pile and place them in front of you as spoils. (If ALL the cards in the closet are green, you get NO points and they are placed face-down at the bottom of the green deck.) The red cards in the pile are placed face-down underneath the red deck; each of those fails to give you points.<br/>     Turns proceed clockwise and the game ends when players have no more secrets left to reveal. The players with the most scored points are the best at snooping out skeletons, and should be regarded with caution.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game uses a deck of 4 suits of cards, with 1 suit for each of the research areas the players will be pursuing, and 1 for the virus.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a role and will only be able to cure one of the types of viruses.  Each virus has a different mechanism for how it can be researched/weakened, and how it will be cured.<br/><br/>For instance, the red virus is weakened when the player in charge of the red researcher leads a trick with the red 1, 2, or 3, and wins the trick.  Later, if the red researcher can win a trick where they lead the red 4, and the sum of the three cards played to the trick are greater than the virus' strength at the time, then the red virus is cured.<br/><br/>The players win if they can cure the three viruses.  They lose if they have not cured the three viruses at the end of the third hand.<br/><br/>",

The last decade has seen bouts of warfare, outbreaks of plague and seismic political upheaval. The religious authorities are keen to stamp down on sinful behaviour, and witch trials are gathering pace&hellip;<br/><br/>In The Dregs of Days, players take on the role of neighbours in an East Lothian village. Players are allied in pairs, so gameplay blends competition and cooperation.* The aim is to develop your holding (home) by buying assets from a shared pool. Let your welfare or reputation drop too low, or get convicted of witchcraft, and it's game over!<br/><br/>Fate cards give players scenarios to navigate, while assets can be used defensively or to attack other players. Optional Story cards offer additional historical context, and each game will feature at least one witch trial, in which accused players try to defend themselves against damning allegations. Gameplay is straightforward while still being moderately strategic. Be prepared for unruly livestock, belligerent neighbours and tales of Satanic orgies, brought to life through colourful quotations from historical records.<br/><br/>Produced by a team at the University of Warwick, Witch Hunt 1649 comprises two fun and educational games. The aim is to provide a sensitive, non-sensationalised exploration of the witch hunts, promoting understanding of the historical backdrop and empathy for victims. The games are available for sale or free download/online play. All proceeds are donated to charity.<br/><br/>Alliances do not feature in 2-player games, and are optional in 3-player games. In games with an odd number of players, one player will be unallied.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Of course, players gain points if other players used their cards, and so on.<br/><br/>Each player has their own deck that consists of the same number and types of cards, with the exception that each deck has a unique back representing the given player's faction.<br/><br/>When the game starts, each players will lay three cards from the top of their decks to the player board's farm area. Then the game really begins. There are no turns, the game is being played in real time. Players will reveal new cards, one by one, from their decks and try to pair them with cards they have laid down on the three farm spaces or any of the cards from the middle of the table where the common market is. Remember: using a card from another faction will win that faction extra points at the end of the game, so pay attention who discarded what card!<br/><br/>Players will try to match cards: One Hatchet paired with a Apple Garden will generate one Apple Basket token. One Scythe paired with a Grain Field will generate a Flour token. And finally, one Food Basket paired with a Pig Farm will generate one Pig token. Of course, there are variations of these cards in your deck. Once a player has enough tokens to resolve a Contract Card, they can do so and score it. Once a player has solved all their ten contracts, the game will end, and the exciting and nail-biting scoring will begin; you gain points from scored Contract Cards and one points from each of your cards the other players used.<br/><br/>That game is a true draw and pair bonanza!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of noble Roman families who must balance competition with cooperation to expand the borders of Rome and create a civilization that can stand the test of time for centuries to come. This narrative game promotes constant player interaction across all four branches of command - military, legislature, diplomacy, and economy.<br/>At its core, Imperamus is a card-driven, deck-building system supported by traditional worker placement, resource management, and engine building. Players must balance crucial decisions as military leaders and statesmen to build their own local influence while supporting the formation of the Legions for the expansion of Rome as a whole. Along with the ability to customize their decks with recruits from Rome and surrounding societies, each family has a unique power to guide their strategy. Additionally, players will vote on both in-game laws and out-of-game scoring conditions, creating a new mechanical framework for each campaign!<br/>While the group has a common goal to gain the support of the people and ultimately give rise to the longest lasting empire in history, only one family will leave a legacy for the ages. The player with the most glory at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

Samaria has suffered the raids and ambushes of the Skarrd for as long as they have hunted for flesh to fill their bellies and machine parts to replace their own failing bodies.<br/><br/>The Skarrd are a savage horde that has broken into several distinct cults based on how their teachings and ideals force them to evolve and survive the hellish environments of Samaria. The cults focus on what drives and strengthens them, turning each sect within the greater Horde into a distinct family of brutal, barbaric marauders. There is the sado-masochism of the Blood Cult, the conversion from flesh to machine within the Cult of Metamorphosis, the body ravaging poisons f the Toxic Cult, and now the animated death and nuclear powers of the newly risen Cult of Decay. All are strengthened by the Horde, but each in their own way.<br/><br/>Over a decade since his exile from New Ashkelon, Saint-turned-Father Johann has been gathering all of the Skarrd under his collective banner at the dreaded Fort Retribution. Something tremendous and horrifying is happening within the Skarrd and there is only one thing to be assured of - they might be the only ones to survive it.<br/><br/>",

Failure to encircle Soviet forces west of Stalingrad ensures that an urban brawl for the city will ensue. Both sides are challenged to meet different objectives.<br/><br/>The Germans must utilize their Sixth Army to destroy the three Soviet armies in the land bridge between the Don and the Volga before they can fall back into Stalingrad. Historically, this attack was coordinated with operations by the Fourth Panzer Army that attacked from the southwest and which was to form the southern arm of a gigantic pincer. Supporting the attack are aircraft of the Fourth Air Fleet which ruled the air.<br/><br/>The Soviet player must not only ensure sufficient forces escape the intended German encirclement, but maintain constant pressure on the overextended Sixth Army with a series of counterattacks from north of Stalingrad to relieve pressure on the defenders of the city. The Soviets are also tasked to retain bridgeheads on the Don which will be their key for future operations.<br/><br/>Designed by Mark Stille, this game includes 1 and &frac12; maps with 420 counters. Units are at the division/brigade level for the Soviets while German and Axis Allied forces are depicted from battalion to division. Each turn is two days.<br/><br/>The game system is based on his earlier Wintergewitter design and emphasizes the effect of air power and a command and control system which makes players plan ahead to conduct operations and carefully weigh where their offensive efforts will be expended.<br/><br/>Maps - One and 1/2 full color 22&quot;x34&quot; hex mapsheets<br/>Counters - 420 standard 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>Rules length - 14 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Playing time - Up to 4 hours<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Average<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The classes are:<br/>- Knight (take less damage)<br/>- Ranger (escape more easily)<br/>- Wizard (spells pack an extra punch)<br/>- Merchant (save money on items)<br/>- Cleric (restore health over time)<br/>- Assassin (deal more damage)<br/>- Noble (get an extra item when you land on the castle)<br/><br/>You will take turns rolling and traveling around the board, landing on different space types (note: if you land on another player you may attack them). The rulebook has a standard setup shown, but is customizable so that you can add, reduce, and mix up spaces for variety and replay-ability. The space types are:<br/>- Monster (fight an NPC)<br/>- Random Event (something happens)<br/>- Shop (buy or attempt to steal items)<br/>- Tavern (restore health)<br/>- Castle (start here; get a gift from the King when you pass)<br/>- Arena (battle another player as if you just landed on them)<br/>- Bandit (pay to steal from another player)<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to defeat the other players in combat and earn points, with the first to reach the predetermined number declared the winner, or play last-man-standing in which the last player surviving is the winner and crowned Champion. Players may choose to team up if they wish, but can always end their truce at any time without notice.<br/><br/>When you land on another player you will have the option to attack and engage them in battle. In battle, you will take turns either rolling to attack or rolling in an attempt to flee, and may strategically utilize a wide variety of items and spells to gain the upper hand. Battle only ends when one player is defeated (their health drops to 0), or when someone rolls for a successful escape.<br/><br/>Items are purchased (or stolen) from the Shop. These include a huge variety of weapons, spells, trinkets, gear, consumables, and more. You don't have to show what items you have in your inventory unless it is actively equipped (like a weapon), so you never know what your opponent may have in store should you attack them and vice versa; Could be some paltry Moldy Boots and a Vegetable Stew, or an epic spell like Meteor Strike and a healing potion or two. Card-play is an integral part of Nooblings, and knowing when to play a certain card could mean the difference between victory or defeat.<br/><br/>On your quest to become champion, you will encounter a variety of dangerous monsters and may choose to either stand your ground and fight or attempt to run away. If you successfully defeat a monster you will receive loot (gold coins) which can be spent to purchase items, rest at the Tavern, and more.<br/><br/>Random Event cards are drawn and flipped over when you land on a Random Event space. Something will immediately happen. These could be good or bad, can affect one or multiple players, and sometimes you might have to make an important choice which could change the tide of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "China, LLC. is a game of China from the establishment of the Qing Dynasty in 1644 CE to the end of the Chinese Civil War of 1949 CE. Philip Jelley uses the same system as the popular Rome, Inc. in which you run China like a business, expanding its corporate power across China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and the Southern and Eastern Seas until it becomes the largest, richest, most populous entity in the world. From the height of power, the Qing CEOs became increasingly detached from reality, confined to their palaces, and dominated by managerial eunuchs while their vast empire is beset by internal rebellions and new barbarians from across the far seas. Can you succeed where they failed? Even if Qing fall, you have a second chance as the Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party) struggle to bring order out of the chaos of a crumbling empire.<br/><br/>Statesmen may become emperors, governors, rebels, and enemy leaders and are rated for their Military, Administration, Popularity, and Intrigue abilities. Each has a special ability, allowing them to defeat their historic foes, assassinate rivals, and influence foreign affairs. For example, the Emperor Qianlong has two Military, five Administration, two Popularity, and four Intrigue abilities, and the Conquest special ability, making him an indifferent general, but excellent bureaucrat even if he was reluctant to embrace popular reform, who expanded the Qing Empire to its greatest extent. Less useful is the Empress Cixi with one Military, two Administration, two Popularity, and four Intrigue abilities, and the Assassin special ability, whose habit of killing emperors destabilized the Qing Dynasty.<br/><br/>The map has provinces grouped into ten commands, each with their own governor to collect taxes, crush insurgents, fight wars, or perhaps assassinate the emperor, or launch a rebellion. Victory is determined by annexing provinces, defeating wars, financing massive prestige projects, and establishing the Mandate of Heaven. Cavalry, infantry, and fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces, expanding direct control, or creating vassals in outlying provinces. Enemy leaders and wars move from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, causing unrest, reducing income, but fighting them could lead to disaster. Unequal Treaties imposed on China by foreign powers robbing her of provinces, prestige, and cash and changing the rules as they expand their own empires.<br/><br/>Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each scenario. The four scenarios start in 1644 CE, 1735 CE, 1820 CE, and 1889 CE which may be combined into campaign games. You need to blend military acumen with careful administration, as well as intrigue, making the most of what you have each turn, just like any modern-day business. China, LLC will give you a new perception of how war is a cost, business is a benefit, and empire is somewhere in between. It&rsquo;s up to you to find a balance, or heads will roll. China, LLC comes with one full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet, 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces and around 12 pages of rules. Players should average from 3 to 4 hours per scenario.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

These wishes were realized as 'victory conditions' for each character.<br/>Each character has their own unique character action to reach the 'victory condition', and it is a game in which the character's actions interfere with the opponent and reach the 'victory condition' first.<br/><br/>However, in most games with 'various types of characters', the problem of balance is always on the rise. There were always strong characters or cards, and when everyone played with strong characters and cards, the interest in the game would diminish.<br/><br/>This game is the first board game used to balance the game, introducing AI to play this game in the testing phase.<br/>LastFairyTale's optimized AI based on Hanabi Play artificial intelligence performs test play through an average of 30 million simulations per turn.<br/>After training the AI ​​through these test plays, it goes through millions of battles to find the best play. Through this tests, we can check this character's strengths and weaknesses in advance, and find the best-balanced character action.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kangaroo Disco Mania is a fun, family friendly game centered around matching icons on custom cards to get the most points for the craziest moves. Each card has charming, custom artwork centered around animals doing the Disco. The game typically plays in 10-15 minutes and has multiple game modes to scale the gameplay in the interest of maintaining that quick-paced play. All modes except the solo mode have a built-in timer made up of cards, called the &quot;song&quot;, that can be claimed for additional points but also shortening the game time.<br/><br/>The core of the game is centered around matching arrays of icons along the tops and bottoms of the cards to get the most points. It is a simple enough concept to allow younger family members to play, however the ability to continue playing if you set up &quot;perfect matches&quot; allows strategies to pull off crazy and long combinations that will keep more experienced players having fun alongside them. In addition to its quick gameplay, the game lacks a true &quot;fail&quot; condition and players who go out on their turn are turned into audience members with a new set of actions that can still influence the rest of the &quot;dancers&quot; still playing for points.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Secret Word Deduction Game  <br/>Updated August 18, 2023<br/><br/>WQRDLES is a word guessing game for two or more players, generally aged 7+. Each player must guess their own word, one which an opponent has provided for them. All players play at once - no moderator is required. <br/>    <br/>COMPONENTS <br/>&bull; Dry erase decoding boards  <br/>&bull; Dry erase markers<br/>&bull; Dry erase racks.<br/> OVERVIEW <br/>The goal of WQRDLES is to guess your own secret word - one secretly created by an opponent.  <br/>Each player thinks of a word, writes it down in secret and hides it from an opponent. <br/>All opponents can see all secret words, except their own.<br/>Players write down words to query against their own secret word. Any opponent compares the word against the secret word and encodes an answer in the form of X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s. <br/>&ldquo;X&rdquo; means the letter is in the secret word but in the wrong spot<br/>&ldquo;O&rdquo; means the letter is in the secret word and in the right spot.<br/>     <br/>INITIAL SETUP <br/>1. Give each player a decoding board, a rack and dry erase marker.<br/>2. Each player thinks of a five-letter word and secretly writes it on their rack.<br/>3. Each player passes their rack upside down to the player on their right.<br/>4. Each player carefully flips over their new rack so that it is visible by all players except their self.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY <br/>Players write down a five-letter &ldquo;query&rdquo; word on their decoding board and pass the board to any player to decode.<br/>The receiving player decodes the word against the other player&rsquo;s secret word and returns the board.<br/>The receiving player now examines the result and decides upon the next query word to use.<br/>All players play simultaneously and game play can be quick.<br/>&emsp;<br/>DECODING &amp; MARKING MATCHING LETTERS <br/>Each player will be decoding the query word of an opponent. You must accurately mark each letter of the query word against the letters in the player&rsquo;s secret word.  <br/>Mark an &ldquo;X&rdquo; for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong spot. Fill the square for a letter in the identical position.<br/><br/>For example, the secret word is HOUSE. <br/>The query word is SHAPE. <br/>Three letters are in common and the &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the only letter in the correct place. Fill in the box for the &ldquo;E&rdquo; and mark the other letters with &ldquo;X&rdquo;. <br/>  <br/>Optionally, indicate that the secret word is lower than SHAPE by marking &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;.<br/><br/>PLAY IN ROUNDS <br/>At the start of each round, clear your decoding board,  except for your score. Continue with game play as above.<br/><br/>SCORING <br/>When a player guesses their word, the value in the leftmost box (1-6) is their score for the round. Add that number to the existing score and mark the current score on their decoding board. <br/>  <br/>TRACKING MISSING LETTERS <br/>Mark the A-Z letters at the bottom of your decoding board that you have determining are not in your secret word.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME <br/>The game is over once five rounds have been completed. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the case of a tie, erase your board (except for the score) and play one more round.<br/><br/>INCORRECT DECODING PENALTY <br/>If a player incorrectly decodes their word, they cannot receive any points for that round. It is very important to be accurate in decoding your opponent&rsquo;s word.<br/><br/>ALTERNATE WAYS TO PLAY  <br/>1. For an easier game, use four-letter words. <br/>2. Use the &lt; and &gt; markers as additional clues. <br/>&lt; means the secret word is alphabetically lower than the query word (eg BACON &lt;  STRIP), in other words, &ldquo;go lower&rdquo;.<br/>&gt; means the secret word is alphabetically higher than the query word (eg WAGON  &gt; TRAIN ), &ldquo;go higher&rdquo;.<br/>  <br/>STRATEGIES <br/>To narrow down and home in on your secret word, pick query words that alternate the known letters.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "115 expansion cards (of all types) created by 20 top webcomics artists, including Jeph Jacques, Zach Weinersmith, Ryan North, Andrew Hussie, Meredith Gran, Dylan Meconis, Jess Fink, R K Milholland, KC Green, R Stevens, and OTHERS!<br/><br/>Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

Events occur which the player or players (depending on conflict mode or not) overcome for rewards.<br/><br/>The Game ends when a fleet arrives at the target distance traveled. The players are given bonus points depending on how far they have traveled or how much cargo they have brought with them. The highest score wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Using only your wits, a fishing pole and a limited supply of fish you must create and navigate a maze path to find the way out. You will encounter twists and turns, polar bears and ice. You may even find yourself stranded on an ice floe, but you can be the hero of the group by being the first one to expose the maze path and find the exit!<br/><br/>Your Goal: Create a complete, unbroken maze path between the Maze Entrance and the Maze Exit and be the first Explorer to exit the maze. However, be careful not to get stranded in the maze without fish to eat and to keep the polar bears away!<br/><br/>Exploring the Maze:<br/>Your maze exploration starts by shuffling all the maze tiles facedown and placing them on the table in front of you, being sure to connect at least one edge of each tile to another. You will then roll one or two dice to move over the tiles, turn them faceup, rotate them, and uncover the maze before you run out of your limited supply of fish.<br/><br/>Along the way you will search for the hidden exit while also encountering various artifacts. Some artifacts, like the fishing holes, will help you to continue your explorations, others, like the polar bear, are not so helpful!<br/><br/>This is a fun, easy-to-learn game that's different each time you play. Winning this game will require you to adapt your strategy at various stages in the game.<br/><br/>The Maze Explorers Trilogy!<br/><br/>The Maze Explorers is a series of worlds each with its own set of unique artifacts and challenges. Each world can be played on its own or combined into a larger world (see the &quot;Related Games&quot; at the top of this page).

The defender may then choose a defense card to play.  If the defense card equals or exceeds the attack card, the defender takes no damage.  If the attack card is greater, the difference between the attack and defense card is discarded from the top of the defender's draw pile as damage.  A player may make up to three such attacks on their turn, then discard any cards they do not want to keep.<br/><br/>Play proceeds left around the table. Each player whose draw deck is emptied is eliminated, and the last player with cards in their draw pile wins.<br/><br/>",

You'll need to plan carefully as you help a team of spelunkers through an increasingly-perilous maze of unstable caverns.<br/><br/>During the player's turns, there are several phases. They first direct their team of spelunkers to explores the cave's caverns using limited movement cards. They must follow the arrows on each cavern's floor. Second, each spelunker surveys their occupied caverns by rotating the arrow. But be careful--once each cavern can only be moved once! Third, each spelunker excavates their caverns to search for buried treasure. However, each time a cavern is excavated, it becomes unstable! If they linger on that cavern in the future, the entire cave will collapse, and the player will lose!<br/><br/>Finally, after revealing all four of the buried treasures, each spelunker must return to starting Daylight cavern and escape before the end of the seventh turn. If they can do this, then the player wins!<br/><br/>Can you explore the cave, excavate all four treasures, and lead your team to safety before Arrow Caverns collapses?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

At the end of each round, new inhabitants from the neighbourhood are recruited (1d6), allowing the teams to develop their neighbourhood further. After 5 rounds, players win if they manage to lower the ecological danger (whose level is represented on the wheel) to zero.

For example, if you have the letters W, R, D, S &amp; T in hand &amp; the Community Vowels are A, E, I, O and U, you can make W O R D S from the letters in hand and O from the Community Vowels. Since W = 4, O = 0 (Community Vowel), R = 1, D = 2 and S = 1, the point total equals 8 (i.e. 4+1+2+1) for the round.

        "description": "Splatter! is a trick taking card game based off of the theme of the ever-classic amphibious arcade game. But the twist is that instead of playing the frog, you are the car. For that matter, all players are cars-competing to splat that blasted frog!<br/><br/>Players play tricks, earning and building up their stock pile of ammunition and weapons to better help them splat that frog once and for all. Of course the frog, Splatter, comes with 6 lives so he can handle quite a bit. Players earn victory points by winning the trick when they are in position to do so (by being next to the frog when they win a trick). If a player wins a trick and is next to the frog, they eliminated one of the frog's lives and earns a pink wedge victory point.<br/><br/>The game is over after 10 rounds or when the frog is out of lives, whichever comes first. Whoever has the most 'froggy bits' (pink wedge pieces) wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The playing consists of a square grid, on which two enemy commandos face each other. The one in A is the red command, the other in B is the blue command. In the middle is a kopje to fight for possession of. The winning command is the first to occupy the 5 squares framed with the color of the command. 9 figures of each color are required, which are placed on the spaces marked by colored discs. A move consists of either moving a piece one space, in any direction, or letting the piece make a single jump or a continuous jump. Only your own pieces can jump up to the squares of your color, where you have to pass between the enemy pieces, you naturally also jump over the opponent's pieces. If a command has succeeded in occupying one of the 5 squares of its color with one of its figures, the opponent loses a figure. Pieces that have already been placed on the squares of his color may not be removed. So it can only happen five times that one opponent takes pieces from the other, and that's the end of the game, because the command that only has 4 pieces left in the field can no longer occupy the kopje completely.<br/><br/>The game is set during the second Boer War (South African War 1899-1902).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players divide into two teams and share a play deck and group hand. Each individual player has asymmetric abilities from their venture (Tech Deck cards) that can develop over time. Teams compete to assist customers from the Customer deck. Successfully assisted customers can be used to: 1. build up their team's deck, 2. develop individual ventures, or 3. score. Rules for odd-number of players and solo-play are included. The theme of the game is a 21st century modern setting. Players on a team cooperate together. Teams may choose to cooperate and negotiate and assist customers (semi-cooperative) leading to lively group discussion and dynamics. The game uses simple math and card melds to determine who successfully assists customers. There are three mutually-exclusive competing objectives: 1. to develop your team's deck, 2. to develop individual player's venture and 3. to score customers. Teams compete to assist customers and then the team must choose how to use that customer card towards these three objectives.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE &ndash; Teams are trying to score points from assisting customers while building up their team&rsquo;s deck and ventures.<br/>GAME PLAY &ndash; During a turn, players can uses game effects from their hand cards and their ventures.

        "description": "For this dice game you will need 6 dice and three chips or tokens for each player. You don&rsquo;t even need a paper and pen to keep score.<br/><br/>Lucky Charm<br/>First, everyone picks a number to be their lucky charm. It is okay for more than one player to have the same lucky charm number. Once the number has been picked, it stays the same for the whole game. Next, the first player rolls all six dice trying to roll a 6. If he is successful, the dice with 6 on it is set to the side and play moves on to the next player. Instead of rolling a 6 a player can also use more than one dice to add up to the number. For example, if rolling for a six and no six was rolled but a 4 and a 2 were rolled they can be used to add up to six. In this case, both the 4 and 2 dice are set aside. Next, the player on the left rolls the remaining dice to try to roll a 5. Play keeps going in this fashion until 1 is reached. If 1 has been reached and rolled, then play starts over at 6 with the next player.<br/><br/>Missing the Mark<br/>On the other hand, if a player does not roll the number that she is trying for and can not add any dice to make the number, she is in jeopardy. She is standing on the edge of the volcano, waiting to see if she will survive or be sacrificed. She has one turn to roll the same dice that she just rolled and try to get her lucky charm number. If she rolls her lucky charm, she is safe. Play starts over at six with all six dice with the next player. If she doesn&rsquo;t roll her lucky charm then she is sacrificed and thrown into the volcano. She loses one of her chips. Play starts over with all six dice and then next player.<br/><br/>When a player loses all of his chips, then he is out of the game.<br/>Play continues until all the players but one have run out of chips. This last player is safe. The Volcano Powers are satisfied with the sacrifices. This player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The theme of this game is investment capitalism. Purchasing minor, major, or complete equity control in apartment housing regions and company sectors (i.e., airline services, legal and accounting services, and two different public services) will help a player win the game in multiple ways.<br/><br/>For example, a player with a designated sum of cash on hand and no loans or who owns two complete sets of equity control in an apartment housing region or company sector and no loans wins. Other winning methods involve parameters outlined in the ruleset and agreed on by players before the game starts (i.e., timed games or when players wish to stop playing).<br/><br/>First, players use a 12-Sided-Die to roll and move around spaces on the game board. Then they choose to buy or pass on investment opportunities. These choices affect their passive income (salary) and income from other players (penalties). Along the way, the owned investments grow, and players may collect additional revenue from drawn cards (one free set and one set that is not). Players may also collect cards that can get used in place of rolling the 12-Sided-Die.<br/><br/>Fear not the dilemma of non-trading players HODL'ing (holding on for dear life). A significant equity control (50%+) allows players to take over entire housing regions or company sectors by rolling the 12-Sided-Die higher than a competitor.<br/><br/>Please do not play it like Monopoly, or you may lose. So be the one who wins intelligently and earn the right to boast about your strategy (and luck).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game board consists of four pyramids broken down into individual small pyramids. At the beginning of the game, each player makes a throw and places his piece on the small square of one of the four pyramids that has the same number. This space, occupied at the beginning, forms the foundation stone of the pyramid to be built by the player and the number indicated on it shows the &quot;base number&quot;. The player who rolled the base number 1 is king or queen and begins. There can be multiple kings in the first game. However, if no 1 is thrown, the next lower number begins. Corresponding to the rolling, the game piece is then placed as many spaces further sideways as eyes have been thrown. When the end of a row is reached, the player moves on to the next higher row until he reaches the top of the pyramid. If a player throws his basic number, he is not allowed to move, but rather has to wait until it is his turn again. If the player rolls more points than he needs to fill the capstone, he must move back from the top of the pyramid by as many squares as he has rolled points too many. This is repeated until he manages to get to the keystone. The king or queen make an exception to this. These may occupy the capstone immediately as soon as they reach it or have rolled beyond it. Whoever is the first to finish building his pyramid receives the first prize and becomes king for the next game with the basic number 1. Whoever throws the basic number 1 in the next game must exchange it for 2, since the king number is then only one player may own. If several players finish in a round, the one who threw the lowest cornerstone at the beginning of the game has priority, i. h. started building the pyramid with 1 or the next lowest square.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was inspired by various mini-games which used to be published now and again in White Dwarf Magazine.  I have a fondness for the Orc and Goblin Army in Warhammer Fantasy Battle. One of the most powerful units was the Goblin Ball and Chain Fanatics which were available to Night Goblin troops.  The inspiration and some of the base mechanics totally come from this game.  It is random as hell but would make a great convention game.<br/><br/>Every now and again, in-between Waaaagh&rsquo;s, the Gobbo&rsquo;s get restless &ndash; what better way to kill time than by setting the Ball and Chain Loonie&rsquo;s loose in a make-shift arena?   Six goblin fanatics are placed into a small arena.  Once the fanatics are let loose nobody has much control, but carnage shall happen, and if that fails then perhaps exhaustion at the very least.<br/><br/>Don't take things too seriously.  Fanatics will die. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>This is a free to download game and can be found online inside the HeroHammer Fanzine in Issue #3.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mission Space players compete to be the first to get over 25 points by completing missions. Missions are either swinging around the Moon, orbiting the Moon, or landing on the Moon; the more difficult a mission is the more points are scored for successfully completing it. Points are also awarded for having fuel remaining and for rescuing players who run out of fuel.<br/><br/>The game is played by randomizing a mechanical &quot;computer&quot; and proceeding through a series of checkpoints - players landing on the Moon go through all checkpoints (there are 21) and players doing simpler missions skip some of them. At each checkpoint players simultaneously choose lettered navigational points and then the computer dial is turned to show the correct answer. Players who choose the correct answer skip one (in some cases two) checkpoints, while other players have to spend fuel to get to the correct location.<br/><br/>At certain checkpoints players consult a probability table to see how likely it is they can complete their missions given their remaining fuel. At these times they can choose to downgrade their missions.<br/><br/>",

Prepared are a number of giant-size flowers made of cut colored tissue paper, and also all kinds of headgear: pointed caps, hats, helmets, etc. The former for the participants who are to dance as ladies, the latter for those girls who are to dance as gentlemen. There are also a number of cards on which the names of the players are written. The mother of the ball is given a large cap of tissue paper, stands at the table on which the game is spread out, all the others stand in a large circle around her, each a few paces from the other; every second player gets a ball. The mother of the ball counts: 1, everyone throws the ball to the neighbor to the right at the same time, quickly turns to the left and catches the ball from the neighbor to the left, if the space is too narrow, one is enough the ball to the third or fourth. If you caught, the ball mother sets your marker on space 1; it means the first step to the ballroom; all players who drop their ball remain outside. The ball mother counts: 2, and the ball game is repeated, having previously determined the type of catch; once, twice, etc. clapping hands, jumping, spinning, hitting the ball with the wrong hand, etc. Each time she has to pass the marks of the lucky catchers, whoever drops the ball stays on the same space. If you drop three times in a row, you have to go back and start over, if you drop twice, you step back 2 spaces.<br/><br/>Whoever is first to number 50 wins the game.  He or she dances as a gentlemen, receive a hat and opens the ball with the ball mother. The second party entering the ballroom dances as a lady, they have a large flower stuck in their hair. This continues alternately till the ball mother determines that there are enough couples in the ballroom and the ball game is to end.<br/><br/>After the game those who are left behind are wallflowers and have the obligation to sing or play the music for the others to the dance to.  The ball begins with a big polonaise, the music moves ahead, the dancers in pairs behind. As the conversation progresses, the dancers now and then have to throw balls to the musicians at the command of the ball mother; if the catch is successful, they swap roles with the dancers on one or two tours. Finally, a large cotillon with the distribution of paper flowers and medals previously made of tissue paper.<br/><br/>",

Whether this is successful will be determined at the destination. The journey begins at space 1 at home. At the beginning of the game, each player pays 20 tokens to the till; one or two dice are thrown in the usual manner and one advances from number to number.<br/>One of the travelers is elected as chairperson. As soon as she continues her journey, she has to ask each of the people throwing the dice 3 questions about the last route covered: which countries she passed, which mountains or rivers she crossed, what curiosities could be seen, what natural or artistic products the countries contain, etc etc. Whoever answers a question incorrectly must pay a fine of 2 tokens; who misses 2 questions 4 tokens and goes back to the previous station; if you leave all questions unanswered, you have to pay 6 tokens and go back to your home town. If the chairperson is guilty of an oversight by asking a question incorrectly or failing to judge the answer, the same penalty applies.<br/>If you go abroad, you will receive a travel allowance of 5 to kens from the til, but has the obligation to answer the questions in English or French. Anyone who gets close to the border or port has a one-day stay due to customs clearance and is not allowed to play the dice once. In the cities marked with yellow numbers, the passenger missed the connection; this holds the same until she is replaced by another traveler who also stops here. But on the next roll she has as many spaces to go back as the dice show eyes. In the residence cities, whereby only Berlin applies in Germany, travelers receive 10 tokens to buy a travel gift for loved ones at home. Should the till ever go bankrupt, the players are obliged to contribute 5 tokens again. Whoever arrives in Stuttgart first receives the contents of the till.<br/>At the end all the players write a poem from the town where she got stuck, in which she describes the journey and the gift she bought. It happens in such a way that the winner begins with a long piece of paper and, after writing it down, folds it in such a way that only the two final words of the last two lines remain visible, to which the next one has to rhyme and so on. After the last one has finished her verses, the chairperson reads out the entire poem, which, if it is well done, may in fact be sent to the aunt so that she can see whether the dear maids have had a pleasant journey.<br/><br/>",

In this game of famous, faces each player picks a card, then by asking your opponent questions, you have to try and guess which celebrity card they are holding. The difficulty is that they can only answer yes or no!<br/><br/>Celebrity Who Is It? is a two-player game suitable for everyone aged 6 years and over. To start you separate the cards into three packs. There is a purple pack, a red pack and a blue pack. Each pack should have 24 cards. Each player should take one pack and the third pack should be shuffled then placed in the centre of the table. Each player lays out their pack of cards picture side up on the table in front of them so that each of the celebrities is visible. The youngest player should take the top card from the stack in the centre of the table then the second player should then take the next card from the stack. Then the guessing begins. The first person to guess the opponents' card correctly wins, but be careful as an incorrect guess means an automatic win for the other player.<br/><br/>Everything you need to play Celebrity Who Is It? comes supplied in the printed gift box, which is handy for safely storing the cards when the game is not in use.<br/><br/>",

Journey across ever-changing lands and meet fellow Travelers from history and legend. Encounter tricky and treacherous yokai and gain arcane, powerful items. Learn the many Magics that form the forgotten practice of Onmyodo!  Historically, Onmyodo was a practice of magic and mysticism that incorporated aspects of Shinto, Buddhism, Chinese Elemental Magic, Astrology and much more. The game references much of this rich history and tradition, mixing characters from legend with real-world archetypes from the Heian Period.<br/><br/>Designed as a solo adventure and storytelling game, Onmyodo can also be played with a small group of players, who collaborate to undergo the challenging journey.<br/><br/>The game employs the use of Tani cards (regions) that are arranged in a diagonal pattern to form a constantly evolving scroll. By forming certain patterns of card features, players can trigger various special items, weather effects, heavenly blessings and more. How long can your Travelers survive, what adventures will unfold, and what missions may they undertake along the way?<br/><br/>While the game is played as an open-ended story, specific Quests can also be integrated for even further challenge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Into the Rift is a 3v1 tabletop game where three players (the heroes) battle their way through custom layout dungeons created by the fourth player (The rift dweller).<br/><br/>Hero's winning objective: Defeat the rift dweller at the very end of the game, by traversing 3 dungeons that become longer and more difficult as more floors are completed.  Players will defeat monsters, find hidden rooms and relics, and become stronger as they reach the end to defeat the Rift Dweller in combat.  At least one player has to be alive in the end for the heroes to win.<br/><br/>Rift Dweller's winning objective:  Kill all three of the hero characters before you yourself are defeated.  Choose one of 3 bosses kept in secret until the final room is revealed.  Construct dungeons by placing room cards that may or may not be booby-trapped or infested with monsters.<br/><br/>Dungeon mechanics:<br/>Each floor begins at the entrance card, which is the first card flipped face up.  Connect other rooms to this by placing room cards face down.  Once players decide where to go, the room they select is flipped, revealing the next obstacle.<br/><br/>Every room has a maximum monster value.  Monster value is determined by the monsters placed in said rooms.  Each floor can only have a set number of rooms, which increases as floors progress, and also must include at least one beneficial room.<br/><br/>The final floor has a boss room hidden in the layout, and cannot be connected to the entrance, nor have multiple rooms connected to it (to avoid finding it too fast)<br/><br/>Currently in Open beta!

        "description": "SALVAGE: Deep Space is a co-operative legacy tabletop game for up to four players that places emphasis on customization, narrative, and teamwork.<br/><br/>To uncover a compelling narrative woven from the results of their own choices, players will group together to perform missions as Salvage Suit Pilots in command of fourteen foot tall Exo-Mechs. During these incursions, gameplay will take the form of tactical-combat where players make decisions and roll dice in support of individual miniatures that navigate hexagonal tiles to salvage technology, combat adversaries, and unlock additional story details and twists. The player objectives are dependent on each individual mission where success or failure will be largely determined by a team&rsquo;s willingness to work together and adapt to an evolving board state.<br/><br/>When not performing missions players will be prompted by both systematic and random story cues through a choose-your-own-journey style narrative book. These prompts will be evaluated for success or failure against a team&rsquo;s Qualifications: attributes that were chosen during the pilot creation process. Successful navigation of these moments may result in additional missions, unlocked technology that can be bought and applied to your pilots, and additional Exo-Suits.<br/><br/>SALVAGE: Deep Space is a sprawling, legacy-style game that is ultimately won through completion of its story. How it is completed and the subsequent results are up to the choices of the players and their crew of pilots.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is a strategic game but unlike standard chess, it is much more hectic. Each player has a full set of Chess tokens (16 pieces). The standard chessboard has been modified to accept the added pieces. All tokens move the same as standard chess, but some specific rules are different. It is a crazy game since not only do you have a competitor in front of you but also one on each side.<br/><br/><br/>     Four brightly colored chess armies, Red, Green, Blue, and Purple battle it out on this modified chessboard. Each army has a full set of sixteen tokens, making this game PSYCHO.<br/>     It is PSYCHO as you fight your way across the board to victory. Unlike classic chess, here the first two Kings are taken.<br/>     If you lose your King early, all is not lost. You enter the Deadwood zone and become an antagonist. You have the opportunity to take other opponent&rsquo;s tokens as well as get your King back.<br/>     The last two Kings play a more traditional game, but until the third King is in checkmate, it is anyone&rsquo;s game.<br/><br/><br/>64 Tokens, four different armies, Red, Blue, Purple, and Green<br/><br/>The first two Kings get killed. Last two fight to Checkmate. You are not out when your King is killed, you become an antagonist with a chance to return.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Farm Warriors is a fun, educational board game where players grow, harvest, and deliver the crops to the city to save citizens from city-wide attacks.<br/><br/>Several cities on the planet have been infected by terrible illnesses and we are counting on you and your healing crops to save us!<br/><br/>In this game, all players become farmers.<br/><br/>Each round of the game, a city would send a news alert describing what the evil doers did to infect their citizens and which winning crops are needed to heal the citizens. Now the race to save the world is on! Farmers would race each other around the boardgame and collect resources to grow the winning crops. Make sure to dodge the wild farm attacks and make smart trades with the other farmers. The round ends when a farmer harvests one of the winning crops before the other farmers. The winning farmer receives a city trophy and prize money for saving the citizens.<br/><br/>Whoever saves the most cities will be titled the ultimate farming warrior.<br/><br/>Let's save the world, one crop at a time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On their turn, each player draws one Special Card from the deck and has the option of playing an MS with a Pilot from their hand to their fleet, playing an Event Card, attacking an opponent's Ship with their own Ship or MS, or attacking an opponent's MS with their own MS. In combat, each player rolls a number of 6-sided dice equal their unit's Combat Strength and score a hit for each die roll less than their Hit Number. When a unit is destroyed, the victor takes the card and adds it to their score pile.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of three conditions, decided on by players before the start of the game:<br/>a) The Special Card deck is depleted.<br/>b) One player loses all the spaceships in their fleet.<br/>c) Only one player has spaceships in their fleet.<br/><br/>At the game end, each player tallies up their score based on the opponent Ships, MS units, and Pilots they destroyed in combat. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The spaces are cards that are laid out by the players every turn so the map will always be different.<br/><br/>The first player who collects 4 diamonds and is able to get them back to base camp (the central starting card) is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cold Waves is the final game of a set covering the War of the Austrian Succession at sea (plus the concurrent War of Jenkin's Ear). Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Cold Waves examines the European Atlantic coasts, the Channel, and the North Sea, where tedious blockade duty and convoy hunting was laced with the ever present fear of amphibious invasion &ndash; something both sides tried more than once.<br/><br/>Cold Waves is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points). You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your 'sail' (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at battle readiness is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters actually in play on the map is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players.<br/><br/>Every ship that appeared in the theatre is accounted for, as is every leader of note. (Although by the basic rules ships are generic 'SPs', players can use the OOBs to add detail and even fight battles using their favourite tactical system.) Squadrons are rated for movement and the number of sail they can contain. Specially named squadrons represent the great ships, like the 112-gun Real Felipe, which successfully beat off a simultaneous attack by three British ships of the line. Other counters represent special assets, like fireships, frigates, and galleys. These can be 'played' (like cards) to conduct special tasks such as search and shore bombardment. Leaders are ranked, and rated for skill and personality.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As you race across the globe searching for each artifact, you fight against members of the Yovuz Ustalar. Your travels take you to the ends of the earth and to the Boss of the Yovuz Ustalar. The world won&rsquo;t be safe until you defeat the Boss or ensure that all the artifacts are out of the Yovuz Ustalar&rsquo;s reach.<br/><br/>This is a solitaire card chase game, in which you will go from site to site to fight the 4 evil gang members one by one, trying to defeat them before they gain 4 powerful artifacts. Each gang member has its own strategy, so you should plan your game accordingly to their appearance order.<br/><br/>The game evolves around &quot;scenes&quot;, when each turn is represented by a unique scene card. Each scene offers 4 different strategies to pick from. Strategies includes actions like &quot;attack and research&quot;, &quot;attack and invest&quot;, &quot;research and fortify&quot; etc. The evil gang member always choose his strategy first, according to his own preference and his resources, and then the player gets to retaliate.<br/><br/>The player needs to destroy all gang members, one by one, before time runs out. The player loses if he fails to defeat the boss before running out of time.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a powerful artifact will be found in a scene and the players should secure it before the Evil Yovuz Ustalar will be able to collect it.<br/><br/>Part of the  2022 pnp solitaire contest.<br/><br/>",

The multidisciplinary approach forces relationships between the Civil War and the following disciplines: mathematics, social science (history, politics, economics, and geography,) fine arts (art, music, drama, and dance,) language arts (creative writing, literature, and language,) science , and the occupational arts.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 'board' of over 346 spaces, which are displayed in sequential order all around a classroom or other large room.  Each player will create their own pawn to move, based on some historical item from the period: a cannon, a horse and carriage, a Southern Belle figurine, etc.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to complete all the activities through the end of the war.  The player with the highest score wins.  No additional points are specifically assigned for speed, but players who do finish before other players are done may go back to the beginning of the board and play through more spaces to earn more points.<br/><br/>Each player takes their turn independently; they do not have to wait for others to catch up.  Each space on the board contains either an activity, a quiz, a research project, all in chronological order starting in the 1830's and ending at the surrender of the Confederate forces in 1865.  If a player cannot complete the task in the space after a reasonable amount of time, they are allowed to move either one space back or forward, and try again.<br/><br/>Each player has a Personal Score sheet and a Witness Tally sheet.  When a player completes the task on a board space, they are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 according to the completeness of the effort.  Witnesses are assigned for each session, and they function as rules enforcers while other players are taking their turns.  Witnesses also earn points for monitoring other players, and log their activity accurately on the Witness Tally sheet.<br/><br/>The game ends when either all players complete a course through the spaces to the end, or a pre-determined time limit has been reached.<br/><br/>",

The North Africa compilation includes all of the existing Mid-War books for the war in the desert:<br/><br/>Afrika Korps, 90th Light, and Death from Above for the Germans,<br/>Armoured Fist and Red Devils for the British,<br/>Avanti and more from Death from Above for the Italians, and<br/>Fighting First and All American for the Americans.<br/><br/>In addition, we&rsquo;ve brought back many of the odd and unusual tanks from the Mid-War Monsters book from ten years ago.<br/><br/>The book really does have everything a beginner needs: history and background, interesting formations, organisational information for building a force, and game stats for playing the game. Each army has a painting and basing guide, along with a beautifully illustrated catalogue of the available models. It is a one-stop gaming resource for the fighting in the Western Desert leading to the decisive Battle of Alamein and the close-fought battles in Tunisia that finally sealed the fate of the Axis in North Africa.<br/><br/>Each country has its own section, starting with a guide to some of the major battles they fought, their unique special rules, and the organisation of their forces. Each country has a selection of formations that you can field. These usually include light and medium tanks or self-propelled guns, and various types of infantry including armoured infantry in half-tracks for the Americans, paratroopers for each country, and rangers and commandos. This is followed by a selection of anti-tank guns, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and aircraft to support your core formation. All-in-all, there are 33 different formations to choose from, or to mix and match to create your unique force.<br/><br/>",

Practice makes perfect so if you don't reach the climax together then try again and again.<br/><br/>Two lovers roll the dice and move around a game board and have to draw passion cards which dare them to perform sensual actions, share secrets, etc.  The game is a race to the climax space game, where the board and the passion cards create obstacles and challenges.  Players move around the track, but in different directions.  The board path is loosely in the shape of a heart, and the center of the heart is the climax space where both players are trying to reach.  Also, the second player gets to roll last, so there is a chance that both players reach the climax together (which is a perfect game, the rules state).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

To make the most out of your stay, you will have to play some &quot;fair&rsquo;s games&rdquo; and pile up the tickets of every booth before your opponents. Prevent your rivals from scoring, take their tickets away, challenge them and at the same time defend yourself from thieves and other attacks. Choose a strategy and hurry up to be the first one to reach the goal, but you have to be careful, because they will do everything in their hands so that it won&rsquo;t be easy to reach it. Let&rsquo;s get started!<br/><br/>Each turn you either play a card or discard as many as you want, and then you replenish your hand to five cards again.<br/><br/>In the fair you could find: <br/><br/>     4 Different booths, which have to be placed in front of you as your collection, after that you will be able to get its 1, 2 or 3 card tickets.<br/>     4 Types of tickets + the minstrel's tickets.<br/>     The minstrel itself, whom could be doing any kind of roguery.<br/>     2 Firamic crowns. First one to get each objective will receive a high ticket reward.<br/>    4 &quot;fair&rsquo;s challenges&rdquo;, which you will have to win playing with the golden cards every time in order to get the tickets.

Last one to arrive will pay!<br/>     And a thief ... and if you are lucky, maybe you could also find a security guard nearby for help.<br/><br/><br/>Use your wit to create your own collection of booths, challenges and fill up your pockets with lots of tickets. It is recommended for a 2-4 player&rsquo;s competition a goal of 20 tickets, and for a 5-6 player&rsquo;s just 15 tickets.<br/><br/>Is this rivalry going to separate or gather your family and friends?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Landing on a property gives players the chance to buy it by correctly answering a related question. Players may also land on Opportunity Knocks spaces, where they draw a card to receive either a bonus (&quot;Your story is voted most imaginative. Collect $10.) or a penalty (&quot;You mix up antonyms and synonyms. Pay $5.). The board's Brain Drain space is its answer to Monopoly's Jail, and Think Tank is its Free Parking.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player who collects all seven properties from one of the four color groups. In addition to buying properties on which they land, players may also buy, sell, or trade properties with one another to reach the goal.<br/><br/>Game questions focus on American English grammar, vocabulary, expressions, and  syntax, and increase in difficulty from kindergarten to high school level. They may be asked to all players in their original order, or may be chosen based on each player's age, so that younger and older players all have questions appropriate to their knowledge level.<br/><br/>Wordopoly is packaged in a durable blue plastic case with a double snap closure. It includes a folding game board, two six-sided dice, money in increments of $5, $10, and $20, 64 Opportunity Knocks cards, 28 deed cards, a rules manual, and six pawns.<br/><br/>",

The first player to 300 points wins the game.<br/><br/>In the destination version, you must collect all seven destinations as well as get the 300 points.

(to simulate the time we lose working for others)<br/>- Life : You get to spin an arrow attached to the board, where you land on one of life's surprises.<br/>- Deals : You get to withdraw the deals card, and invest (only possible for business and investor)<br/>- Choices: You get a choices card and based on the answer fill the zen card (helps detect the player's nature).<br/>- Stocks and bitcoin: quick risk taking action, with rewards based on dice value.<br/>- Sabotage: You get to sabotage another player (details in the rules).<br/>- Bills: You need to pay ...<br/>- Other important slots: Taxes, Debt, Insurance, give an even extra realistic level to the game.<br/>- Rules get all these elements interacting in a harmonious and homogeneous way, to make sure that not only luck is the deciding factor for winning.<br/><br/>Winning condition:<br/><br/>There are different game settings, to allow the game to be played for different periods of time.<br/>Thus winning conditions also vary.<br/><br/>- In timed games: after the timer signals the end of game, the winner, is the user with most: <br/>    option 1) Cash Money (for simpler game - or younger players)<br/>    option 2) Recurring revenue<br/><br/>- None timed games: <br/>    + Elimination game: you play till all players except 1 are eliminated. Elimination is triggered by not being able to     pay debt or taxes. (simulating bankruptcy)<br/>    <br/>    + Goal set games: <br/>    option 1) First player to reach X amount in cash money (50k, 100k, 500k etc ...)<br/>    option 2) First player to reach X amount in recurring revenue (10k, 20k, 50k etc ...)<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the discovery of the Pacific Ocean by the Spanish explorer Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez de Balboa in 1513, it became the subject of dispute between the two great colonial empires of the time, Spain and Portugal. The Treaty of Tordesillas established a principle agreement for the division of the world, leaving this vast expanse of sea on the Spanish side, which came to be known as the &quot;Spanish lake&quot;.<br/><br/>The expeditions sought quick access from South America to the Spice Islands, the Moluccas and also the mythical &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; where they intended to find gold, spices and exotic products for the greater honour and wealth of the Spanish and Portuguese Crowns.<br/><br/>Thus, during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Pacific Ocean was a Spanish sea, only disturbed by some English and Dutch expeditions. During those years, Spanish navigators crossed it in various directions and discovered most of its archipelagos (Galapagos, Marquesas, Hawaii, Marianas, Philippines, Marshall Islands, Society), as well as circumnavigating New Guinea, sighting the coasts of Australia and exploring and colonising the Philippine archipelago.<br/><br/>One player represents the Spanish Empire based in the Viceroyalty of Peru, organizes his expedition departing from the port of El Callao.  The other player in turn organizes another expedition departing from the port of Acapulco.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins. Victory points are earned by discovering islands and mapping them, establishing colonies, Christianising natives, collecting exotic species of plants, birds and animals as well as natives and bringing them to the home port.

However, players can accept bribes, so whoever can make the best deals is sure to win!<br/><br/>Each player begins with 25 health and 3 coins. At the end of each one of their turns, a player draws a card. Cards have a value of 3-7 and be either coins or swords. Coin cards are immediately replaced with coin tokens. However, sword cards can be used on future turns to lower someone else's health by the indicated amount, which usually leads to lots of threats and deals.<br/><br/>All deals are binding on the turn they occur, but you don't have to follow up threats. Will you be able to get away with paying nothing? Will you become a coward, but also a survivor? Will you establish Communism? Will you give away your money to appear weak, only to watch a bloodbath ensue between everyone else? Nearly anything can happen in Politi-King.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each card could be the beginning, middle, or end of a trip depending on which row is used.<br/><br/>- If an itinerary is with one airline, the player scores $5 in profit and draws one card.<br/>- If an itinerary contains only two affiliated airlines, the player scores $4 in profit and draws two cards.<br/>- If an itinerary contains non-affiliated airlines, the player scores $2 in profit and draws three cards<br/><br/>The second player will select one of the three cards on the table and add two cards from their hand to make a new set.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can create an itinerary. The player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead By Dawn is the debut title from Retro Active Games<br/><br/>Will you survive the night?<br/>Will you find The Truck Key and escape??<br/>Or will you end up...Dead By Dawn???<br/><br/>&quot;Head for that Farmhouse!&quot; you think to yourself as the moans of the recently undead trail at your heels. You pass a Truck and some gas pumps outside the house...maybe there is a key somewhere? No time now! You just hope to make it inside and find some supplies to survive until the National Guard can sweep through in the next 12 to 24 hours. You see faint other figures on the horizon, assuredly living. Will they be friend or foe?<br/><br/>&quot;Dead By Dawn&quot; is a fast paced, strategic zombie kill-a-thon with a tinge of survival horror. Play with 2-6 players in a time (and part luck) based game of desperation and intuition. Survive until the game ends (Dawn) and have the most kills to win. Or hunt down The Truck Key and escape! But it's a big house, with many locked doors, and the key could be anywhere! You'll have to look for other keys to open any doors along the way, along with gather Weapons and Items to help you survive and win the game!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player gets their own character card with unique abilities for the duration of each game. (Random distribution recommended.) Players attempt to roll and move, while strategically avoiding, fighting, placing, and moving the growing horde of zombies that keep filling the board. Players will attempt to reach the farmhouse at the center of the board with a &quot;KEY&quot; CARD or Character Ability to be able to unlock one of the the many doors in the place. <br/>   Inside these rooms, there are plenty of useful cards in the form of Items and Weapons, and sometimes even Key Tokens, to help you gain points via zombie kills or help you gain the upper hand and survive long enough to escape. <br/>    But along the way, you may encounter an unlucky or helpful event via the EVENT spaces that litter the board and force players to draw an EVENT CARD- that could change the course of the game!<br/><br/>Games are timed. A 2 player game is an hour, 3-4 player game is 2 hours, and a 5-6 player game is 3 hours. A sand-timer is included to track turns. Players have 2 minutes to complete their turn (barring house rules).<br/><br/>Players have limited inventory space likened to the mechanic present in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video games. This can be increased by 1 slot by finding &quot;The Backpack&quot; ITEM CARD.<br/><br/>During each standard turn, players take possession of two dice. One black D-6 die with numeric values of 1 through 3 on all faces(these add zombies to the board every turn!). And one blue D-8, 1 - 8 die that is used for player and zombie movement. (Example: player rolls an 8. They may move 8 spaces, but zombies also get to move 8 spaces after player has made their movement. The Zombie Movement can be split any way. (One zombie can move 8 spaces, or two can move 4. etc)<br/>    The player also gets use and possession of the sand timer. During a turn, the player starts the timer, rolls and FIRST places zombies, THEN moves their player Pawn, use any cards, equip items, trigger an event/etc, THEN LAST- You may move any zombies on the board (this matches your rolled movement)<br/><br/>To win- survive until time runs out and have the most kills. OR alternatively, hunt down the keys to the truck outside and refill the gas tank and make it to the ESCAPE space at the back of the board. (This ends the game early and regardless of kill score)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Multi-layer team tic-tac-toe with cards! With 4 ways to score you'll need all your Wit &amp; Whiskers to come out on top of this dog pile.<br/><br/>The game starts by first splitting players into two teams, this should be done using alternating seat positions going around the play area so no two teammates are sitting next to eachother. The game cards are shuffled and 4 are dealt to each player to form their hands. Play starts with the player who most recently pet an animal.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the first team to score a total of 15 cards. Cards are scored whenever a scoring pattern, called a Whisker, is formed in the 3 by 3 play area. The player who played the final card to form the Whisker scores all cards used to create that Whisker. There are 4 types of Whiskers: same animal in line of 3, same weapon in line of 3, total 10 in square of 4, or same color in solid area of 5.<br/><br/>Players take turns going clockwise around the table, playing one card into the 3 by 3 play area, and then drawing a card from the deck. Players can play their card into any empty space or on top of a card with a different background (e.g. play a day-time card on top of a night-time card). Stacking cards can be strategic, but is also a risk as creatings Whiskers will score the entire pile of cards!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

As a creator of the game I wanted to make sure that this game is not sexual, derogatory, or prejudicial.<br/> The game consists of 150 laugh out loud cards filled with obscure facts and pop culture about swearing. There are 10 categories: Geography, Going abroad, History, Social trends, Texting acronyms, True and false, TV/movies/music, Word definitions Wordplay and Visual cards (guess the phrase).<br/><br/>The game is super easy to learn and fast paced.<br/><br/>It can be played as individuals 3+ or in groups. It is very adaptable and has been played on Zoom as well. The object of the game is the first person to collect 10 correctly answered cards wins. The twist of the game is when a player has collected 9 cards anyone can challenge them to take a &quot;Challenge card&quot;. Once challenged you have to play. If the player answers correctly its an automatic win. If not, the challenger earns the card.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 16 + due to the use of swear words.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Like any good clinic, you not only want to give your patients (who are all unicorns, of course!) the best care, but you also need to get those positive reviews to grow your clinic's reputation. Unfortunately the supply closet is a mess and the line of waiting patients is growing by the minute. While you scramble to find the supplies you need, each waiting unicorn is wondering where their doctor is and rapidly losing their patience. Work together to quickly treat patients and get those sweet 5-star reviews!<br/><br/>In Unicorn Clinic, you'll work together to run your own clinic for sick and injured unicorns. On your turn, you'll decide which patient to visit and roll your dice to try to complete their treatment. If at first you don't succeed, you can try to roll again, but you'll have to be smart about which dice you reroll and where you spend your time. Do you go after a new patient who still has a rosy 5-star view of the clinic and hope to treat them fast, possibly earning more time to take on another patient? Or do you choose a patient who has been waiting a while and try to finally get them out the door? You'll also want to consider where your fellow doctors are- every doctor in the room will give you an additional specialty die to roll and increase your odds for success.<br/><br/>After your turn, any unicorns left unattended in other rooms will lower their potential star rating. If any unicorns reach zero stars, it's CODE U! You have one last shot to join forces as a team to treat the unicorn before they leave the clinic in disappointment, ruining your reputation (and ending the game.)<br/><br/>If you DO successfully treat a unicorn, of course they leave you a review to read! Score enough review stars and you'll secure your clinic's reputation as the best place for excellent unicorn care.<br/><br/>&quot;They totally removed the crab from my butt. 5 stars!&quot; - Actual Unicorn Patient.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Your workers are tasked with collecting resources to turn them into equipment to aid your knights.

        "description": "This is essentially a card-based game of Dominoes, using cards instead of plastic or wooden tokens. It is themed around the folk tale of the Old Woman and Her Pig, where an old woman goes to successive figures and encourages each one to do something to the previous one, creating a domino effect that will get her pig over a stile: the butcher killing the ox that drinks the water that quenches the fire that burns the stick...and so on.<br/><br/>Most of the 60 cards have a number of dots on one half (like dominoes) and a picture of a character on the other. Players can match numbers or pictures. Pictures are considered &quot;doubles&quot; and must be placed at right angles to the match.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player runs out of cards in their hand; that person then scores based on cards remaining in their opponents' hands. The game is repeated until someone reaches 100 and becomes the overall winner.<br/><br/>This game was released by Noble and Noble Co. as part of their &quot;Games My Children Love Best&quot; series. It is functionally 'identical' to &quot;House that Jack Built,&quot; which was released simultaneously as part of the same series, albeit with different pictures on the cards.<br/><br/>",

It was a form of erasure that allowed for reuse of the piece of parchment for a new piece of writing. Then, writing materials were difficult to come across and labor intensive to create, leading to the practice of scraping that resulted in the faint appearance of previous text. In recent years, the concept has been used by social scientists trying to explore and understand how the past continues to influence the present in variety of fields. It calls us to reflect on how we inherit institutions, laws, policies, neighborhoods, ideas, and histories from the past and how these influence the present.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>In this game you will be playing the role of a scribe trying to leave their mark on history. Each turn you will erase a letter and come up with a new word. If you cannot create a new word or there are no spaces able to be erased, you are lost to history. Players will continue doing this, passing their card around clockwise at the end of each turn, until there is only one person remaining. The last player able to make a word is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players assume one of two opposing roles: Jirel the tempestuous flame-haired female warrior or the phantasmal Black God with its unknowable intrigues. Each character will be forced to make difficult choices as Jirel confronts the inhuman residents of the Black God&rsquo;s pocket dimension and ultimately the black god itself. Jirel must explore the nightmarish terrain via dice driven movement each round, to join combat or avoid traps and challenges to her sanity. The Black God will array its forces to stop her from reaching her goal by placing fiendish enemies, traps and psychic snares in her way. Can Jirel claim the Black God's deadly kiss and retain her sanity? Will it be worth the effort, or will she ultimately regret her choice?<br/><br/>&quot;Black God&rsquo;s Gambit&quot; is described by the publisher as a fast-paced, rules lite, solo or two-player, GM&rsquo;less tabletop &quot;micro game&quot; to be included in the &quot;Black God's Kiss&quot; RPG box set. The game will include punchboard tokens for the players, various enemies, traps, and a 11&quot;x17&quot; hexagonal game map. At the time of the Kickstarter optional add-ons for the rpg included a 48mm resin Black God and 32mm resin Jirel miniature. The microgame will feature several different scenarios or play modes, according to the successful Kickstarter that ended in late September 2022 (the game and its parent boxed rpg set are planned for release sometime in late 2023).<br/><br/>Based on the towering sword and sorcery stories by C.L. Moore (one of the first women to write in the genre and a contemporary of Conan's Robert E. Howard), the warrior Jirel of Joiry&rsquo;s kingdom has been overtaken by the warlord Guillame. Her last ditch attempt to save her kingdom is to travel into the realm of the Black God via a secret passage in her keep's catacombs, searching for the means to destroy her enemy and take back her kingdom... potentially at the cost of her own soul.<br/><br/>",

Only those who have prepared for war will survive the coming winter.<br/>Be among them!<br/><br/>In Mirianth Wars, players are creating their factions trying to earn the loyalty of warriors, build the best dwellings, find the most valuable treasures, and commit to engage in memorable battles against monsters, all through rounds of negotiation with their opponents for the cards.<br/><br/>However, when player strategies conflict, diplomacy will be the last resort before luck comes into play. If the players do not come to an agreement, they will face the plague deck, and the outcome will only depend on luck.<br/><br/>After everyone has created their faction, they will go through the tests that will define how good their strategy was.<br/><br/>First, players need to check that all their heroes can be accommodated in residences, from simple huts to sumptuous castles, otherwise they will scatter and leave the player.<br/><br/>From the heroes who were accommodated and did not perish to the plague, the battle will begin against the monsters, which if not defeated, will destroy houses, steal treasures or kill the heroes. After the battle, you will once again need to accommodate your heroes in order for them to recover.<br/><br/>Finally, from the surviving heroes, saved treasures, and defeated monsters, the player's points will be counted.<br/><br/>Mirianth Wars presents a game of diplomacy and strategy based on the balance between ambition and luck.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You step into the role of a condemned inmate on a space prison. You're duking it out, gladiator-style, in a no-holds-barred arena deathmatch for the entertainment of other inmates. Condemned have weapon and armor slots to equip various cards. Some weapon types are stronger or weaker, depending on the type of armor they're hitting. In addition, there are events that change the flow of battle and preparations that give you an edge in the fight.<br/><br/>You win by reducing your opponent's life to 0. Simple, right? Not necessarily! There's lots of play and counterplay in The Condemned. Armor cards have weaknesses and resistances to different damage types. Events can change the course of the game when you least expect it. That Alpha Strike you were planning on using to win you the game? Nope! Your opponent just used Repossess to take your weapon away and now you can't attack!<br/><br/>The game is fast, fun, and has plenty of depth!

Aventurine Expedition is a card/board game thought up by 2 game enthusiasts with a dream to design a quickly played, action-packed game where you scheme against the others in an attempt to become the greatest Aventurine Miner the world has ever known.<br/><br/>Aventurine Expedition is a fast paced card/board game, (it has the elements of a board game, without the board itself) that has you playing destructive cards against your opponents to stop them from acquiring more Aventurine and Gadgets, in an epic vector art format.<br/><br/>You begin with 2 Aventurine Mines, they are used to gain Aventurine (think of Mines as your source of income).  You gain 1 Aventurine per mine you have every turn. You take 1 Recruit every turn from the Recruit Display into your hand. Aventurine is used to activate Recruits abilities which involve many different unique strategy building mechanics, some abilities include, &quot;all opponents loose 2 mines&quot; &quot;lock a Gadget from an opponent&quot; and &quot;look at an opponents Recruit hand and take 1&quot;. Playing Recruits also allow you access to their mines.  Another use for Aventurine is to purchase Materials. Materials are used to purchase Gadget cards, which help you ultimately win. When you acquire a Gadget card you flip it upside down and receive the reward denoted at the top left of the card. However you cannot buy Materials and Gadgets on the same turn. Collect 3 Gadget Cards to be the victor.<br/><br/>A basic turn would go something like this:<br/><br/>James collects 5 Aventurine for the 5 Aventurine Mines he has, he looks at the Recruit Display and take his 1 card, the Mighty Boom. He then spends the required 4 Aventurine to play a card from his hand. Mighty Boom goes into play and makes his opponents loose 2 mines each, they proceed to complain and James uses his remaining Aventurine to purchase a Water Drop costing him 1 Aventurine. He has enough materials for a Gadget, however he bought a material on this same turn so he must wait at least one turn before he can purchase.<br/><br/>",

They might not be as friendly as they look. Will they prevent you from getting any more fields, or hinder you from growing corn? They might however also lend you a tractor because your own is in the workshop, the choices may not always be so true, but they are wise.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s always a good idea to keep a good relation with the trading stations, as they can supply you with important crops or animals and the machines needed for your farming operation when your money is limited.

Just add NOT CHESS to your own chess set, or buy the Ultimate Box for all the glory.<br/><br/>In NOT CHESS, players work in teams to eliminate all of the opponent's pieces. These pieces are divided in to two types - each team has 1 Queen and 15 Not-Queens. While Queens can move any number of spaces, and kill opponents at any time, Not-Queens can only move 1 space, and can only kill pieces if coupled with a NOT CHESS action card. These 90 wacky cards allow pieces to move and murder in increasingly ridiculous ways, from teleporting across the board, to moving multiple pieces in a 'battering ram' to knock out the opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And no one needed to know they were real until 6 strangers from all around the world decided to bet their fate in the mythical forest of Fyri.<br/><br/>The Forest of Fyri: Perilous Pursuit is about hunting monsters and collecting bounties in the forest, then turning them in for victory points. Every player has up to two Move actions. To start your turn, exit toward a certain rune of their choice from the tile they stand on, then onto a new tile in the direction of matching rune. (1st Move) There are 2 types of tiles they will land and interact with. First type is Forest tiles, which means the player will have to flip an Encounter card to face a monster in the forest. Second type is Location tiles, which the player will skip the Encounter card and interact with the specific tile. If the player flips an Encounter card with no monsters or decides not to interact with the tile, they can move onto another tile and encounter/interact with it instead (2nd Move).<br/><br/>There will be repeated death &amp; revival throughout the gameplay, but it is done without harsh consequence as the game is created for every level of players. When a player dies, their next turn is automatically moved to the last place in the turn order. And by rolling the Champion die, the player will find out where their champion will respawn and how much health they will be able to restore.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to turn in certain number of bounties to the town before other champions do, racking up Victory points. The first player to reach a set amount of Victory points will win the game. How you interact between the forest and the town will be the key to victory in The Forest of Fyri.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ratten Reich: The Board Game is a physical tabletop companion to the upcoming RTS wargame, Ratten Reich. It is a grim and unforgiving world, where war has continued for many years. The war is fought between rats, mice, roaches and lizards alike in their never-ending struggle for power.<br/><br/>Your task is to lead your faction to victory. Whatever country you play as, you have to muster supplies and equip your armies, lead them into battle, face losses and recoup them.<br/><br/>In the Ratten Reich board game, your task is to lead your faction to victory. Whatever country you play as, you have to muster and equip your armies, lead them into battle, lose them and collect new ones. Under your command, three infantry armies are given, each of which can fit five infantry tokens. Military tokens are tied to military cards, so you can equip your armies with both elite units and simple cannon fodder. And so, the era of great conquest begins.<br/><br/>Naval battles are a common feature of imperialist wars and will therefore play a significant part in Ratten Reich: The Board Game. Large empires are typically surrounded by seas and ocean, allowing the transfer and logistics of military forces to travel from one continent to another. This opportunity pushes the development of military shipbuilding.<br/><br/>In this tabletop experience, each player is given one fleet figure to start. Choose to reinforce your fleet with heavy battleships and/or ironclads, intercept the enemy at sea, blockade ports or assist with naval bombardment. You can even execute an amphibious assault on your enemies.<br/><br/>Your army gains an attack bonus if it lands with naval support so ensure you utilize the whole of your forces! A fleet is also needed to transfer your armies to another continent.<br/><br/>Game pads are divided into two main types: the Main Player pads and the Autocrat Trade Military pad. The regular Player tablet allows you to design armies as you wish. The Autocrat tablet allows the player to create specialized armies and provides an opportunity to regulate the resource market by setting prices for mercenary armies.<br/><br/>Tokens are the same for all players except the Autocrat. Players can assemble armies themselves as they please. Meanwhile, the Autocrat collects and sells mercenaries whilst regulating the game market.<br/><br/>There is an additional battle pad that creates positive or negative conditions for the combatants. When the offensive player rolls the dice at the start of battle, the number rolled correlates to one of the six possible conditions that affect combat.<br/><br/>You may be lucky with fair weather conditions or you may be afflicted with corruption in your army, which will give certain disadvantages in the battle.<br/><br/>Tokens are an important part of the game. All resources, buildings, troops, and finances are considered tokens. Tokens in Ratten Reich: The Board Game are divided into two groups: military and economic.<br/><br/>Military tokens allow you to build armies on your side of the board and dually display the territories you have conquered. Economic tokens allow you to place buildings on the map, establish trade routes, conduct diplomacy, and arrange &ldquo;meanness.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cards are &lsquo;paper helpers&rsquo; in building your empire. Ratten Reich: The Board Game gives you the opportunity to build an economy, create your own armies, and create &lsquo;meanness&rsquo; at your enemy&rsquo;s doorstep.<br/><br/>Your faction&rsquo;s main power source is the army. At your discretion, assemble your army by selecting from several types of infantry and vehicles - all of which will be under your control. If you are lacking in resources, gather a cheap army on a whim to capture colonies or to defend your cities. Perhaps you might prefer to invest in high-quality troops with impressive armor and equipment to best represent your faction.<br/><br/>To dominate the sea, build and tend to your fleet. Whether you play aggressively or systematically, develop and evolve your troops to master the board. You will only be dealt a few moves of peace and tranquility during the game; when these moves end, no one will have the right to stop you.<br/><br/>The economy is a vital part of the game. Without a reliable economy, you simply won&rsquo;t be able to afford an army to face off against your enemies. Ratten Reich: The Board Game will offer you a standard set of building cards that includes: a bunker, factory, munitions factory, secret society, and market. Each building has a unique purpose.<br/><br/>Be wise with the limited resources you have! Construction will help create a defensive basis for negotiations, a stable economy, and eventual peace talks. You can play aggressively by contributing all of your resources to the army, but such tactics can end up being a lost cause. By spending some of your resources on the secret society and market, you can aim for a swift defeat of the enemy with both prosperity and gunfire.<br/><br/>A strong economy is the key to maintaining the army and vice versa.<br/><br/>Looking to harm your enemies? For this sole purpose, we have provided an opportunity for the player to build a secret society.<br/><br/>Players will have the opportunity to inflict greater harm upon their enemies through the construction of a secret society. A secret society grants access to cards of &lsquo;meanness.&rsquo;<br/><br/>Each faction has two unique villainy cards that the player can activate once per game. Each card gives a special ability to the player. For example, the player can build an underground city on the territory of the enemy and gain half of his resources or a player can burn their enemy&rsquo;s lands. There are eleven unique cards in total, each with their own abilities.<br/><br/>To make Ratten Reich: The Board Game more interesting, the game will interfere with your plans. Be it famine, plague, or a brutal winter, these events are meant to annoy everyone at the table as you recalculate your next move and adapt in battle.<br/><br/>But the game does not merely take. It gives. You may come across useful event cards that offer small advantages or stability. If the Autocrat takes part in the game, then they are free to choose the event cards themselves. In the absence of an Autocrat, the cards are drawn randomly.<br/><br/>Six unique factions await you! Each faction will have an original design, playstyle, a variety of abilities, and different military and economic potential. Revive the old empires in the eastern part of the central continent. Build a formidable fleet. Control the colonies. Determine which of you will become the world&rsquo;s new hegemony and whose country will turn to ashes.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 54 cards: four suits of ten cards each numbered 1-9 plus an &quot;archetype&quot;, and 14 unsuited cards.<br/><br/>In each hand players are dealt five cards and take turns drawing a card from the deck or discard pile and then playing or discarding a card.<br/><br/>A suited card can be played as part of a player's adventuring party or to attack a member of another player's party. A party consists of one card of each suit, preferably all of the same alignment: the numbered cards are divided into good, neutral, and evil alignments while the archetypes are wild.<br/><br/>If a player has a single-alignment party they can play an unsuited card, which is an adventure the party completes to gain a point.<br/><br/>A hand ends when the deck has been gone through three times. The game ends when each player has had a chance to deal.<br/><br/>Optional rules allow for such things as two-dimensional alignments (adding the chaotic-lawful axis).<br/><br/>",

The Boss determines which of the other dice can be promoted to the &ldquo;bucket,&rdquo; and which must be held back for the next roll.

        "description": "Historians estimate that the Kurukshetra (koo-rook-shay-trah) war occurred during the Iron Age of India, around 10th century BCE. The conflict arose from a succession dispute over the Throne of Hastinapur (has-tee-nah-poor). Duryodhana was the eldest from the senior branch of the family line, the Kauravas. But he was younger than Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava. Who would become the next ruler of the vast Kuru kingdom?<br/><br/>The epic struggle over the Throne of Hastinapur has begun! Use your influence over the ancient heroes of India to sway them to join your side, enlist the help of other Rajas, and surprise your opponents by making your own preparations for war before they are ready to fight!<br/><br/>In Throne of Hastinapur, players act as local supporters who are supplying resources and political leverage to either the Pandavas or Kauravas. To show support, you must place tokens on shared Hero Cards or your personal Pati (Pah-tee) in order to win Victory Points (VP), shown as Lotus flowers. Players will &ldquo;snake draft&rdquo; dice from a pool in order to place tokens that match. After the Endgame is triggered, players play a final round.

        "description": "When an asteroid crashes into Earth, the very foundations of society are left in ruins. With no remaining institutions, chaos erupts as governments crumble. Some blame inaction or even conspiracy for not deflecting the asteroid. Others see the possibility of creating a new and better world. Eight mega-organizations emerge, vying for the chance to take charge of rebuilding our post-apocalyptic planet. Each has a plan that relies on emerging technology and prevailing public opinion. The plans are wildly different: from building a green utopia to merging with machines in a matrix to fleeing Earth entirely and colonizing a nearby planet. But there are only enough resources left for one of these plans to succeed. And each step of the way, other players will try to compete for the same resources or even oppose you directly.<br/><br/>You are the chosen leader in a mega-organization. You must convince the public that not only are your ideas the best of those presented by the mega-organizations&mdash;but also that you are the one who can save the world and lead it safely into the future. Your task is to assemble teams focused on technologies to influence humanity's future. It is up to you whether to turn Earth into an authoritarian regime, liberate people from their oppressors, change what it means to be human, return to living in harmony with nature, let the free market reign, or control human behavior with a supercomputer.<br/><br/>You begin the game by choosing a mega-organization card, two technology cards, and four agent cards. Each turn, you draw one card and get two points you can spend to draw cards, move agents, execute special abilities, or research new technologies. You can also trade cards for points to execute more complex turns. The table is split into three lanes: development, commercial, and monopoly, representing stages of bringing a technology to market. Each gives you prestige, public opinion, or effect bonuses you can use during or at the end of the game. You can move a card to the next stage when the assigned team's skills fulfill the card's requirements. When resolving conflicts with other teams working on the same technology, your agents' skills determine who strikes first and how much damage an agent can cause and withstand.<br/><br/>The game ends when all technologies in the game are developed, or if you win the tug-of-war of public opinion and successfully initiate a revolution. In this case, tally the prestige from your developed technologies and add bonus prestige from your technologies that align with the prevailing public opinion. The player with the most prestige wins the game and the chance to make an IMPACT BEYOND.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There is a sacred cave in the great valley that can protect them. If they can get there before the impact, they&rsquo;ll survive. Meanwhile, having escaped their imploding home planet, a group of robots have landed on the planet to make a new home.

There is a deck of 7 day cards which act as a countdown clock for the game.  Each day is a round where all players get a turn.  The Asteroid day is the last day of the game and is shuffled in a way where you don&rsquo;t know if the game will end on day 5, 6 or 7.<br/><br/>Players Divide into two teams: Robots and Dinosaurs.

The Glory Trials are an assortment of mini-games that have each been designed to test your abilities in different and interesting ways.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will also collect Secret Cards. These cards are kept confidential until played, and will describe a secret objective or a hidden ability.<br/><br/>The game is incredibly easy to learn! To setup, the 3 Trials (Mind, Body, and Spirit) must be separated into individual decks and placed in front of all players. Players then sit in a circle where every second person is on the same team.<br/><br/>To begin play, teams alternate taking turns going around the circle. At the beginning of a players turn, they draw a card from any deck and follow its instructions. The first team to win 3 challenge cards from each of the Mind, Body, and Spirit Trials wins the game!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

There are four suits and they are not evenly distributed (e.g. there are 7 red cards, but 18 green cards.) The less common suits are higher in strength than the more frequent ones.<br/><br/>Players will earn points if they do not win a trick, but the winner of the game will be the player with the fewest points.<br/><br/>In the second hand, the cards are dealt face down and the player with the most points can look at the backs of the cards and choose which hand they want to play.<br/><br/>The person with the fewest points after an agreed upon number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

We continue singing and dancing with our Grandfather and the song.<br/><br/>In El Abuelo, it follows the rules for placing the tiles as in the basic game My Bag of Bones, but with some peculiarities. We tell you.<br/><br/>That contribute?<br/>-For the player who plays with THE GRANDFATHER<br/>Desert Tiles allow you to steal any tile from another player's bag but with your eyes closed. You can take 2 from the stack. They do not have to be consecutive. It's up to you. Take a good look at what the other players are discarding in their bag on the board<br/>Grandpa introduces changes for the other players. Specifically, when they extract a tile from the grandfather and another from a foreign character. They go to their respective characters, without losing turn.<br/><br/>With the Color Bags variant, we will steal a tile belonging to the player's bag of that color. In setup, they are exchanged for four desert tiles.<br/><br/>In the Multicolor Sachets variant, we substitute three desert tiles. Grandpa must be present. We choose two players to steal a tile from each one's bag. We can combine the two variants by substituting seven desert tiles.<br/><br/>The multicolored puff removes a puff from the board of a player of our choice. The character ones are only used when the grandfather is in the game.<br/><br/>Every time we have to place a breath and we don't have it, we take our character's. Only Grandpa has one for himself.<br/><br/>The winner will be the one with the most points. Grandpa adds one point for every two puffs in his pool.<br/><br/>",

Each player can only look at the top card from their deck. The player who starts the round chooses one of six bird attributes listed he believes is the strongest for all top cards that round.

Move them around the marketplace and interact with other players. You can play one of six actions each turn. Move, pickup a coin or item, deliver an item to your destination for coins, punch a player, throw a rock at a player, or take a nap to remove your dizziness.<br/><br/>You will need to balance between being peaceful and collecting your coins through deliveries and aggressively stealing other players coins.<br/><br/>The fun of the action happens around the turn mechanic which determines the order of play. All players choose their action card, places it in a pile and then the pile is shuffled. Cards are dealt from the pile which determines the order of play. This means you can play a punch card, but your victim might move away from you before you can strike.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit or play a magical card. If a player leads a Skull, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Taotl, then those who follow can play whatever they want.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If the Taotl was played, that player wins, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest Totem wins the trick, unless someone played a Red God on a red-suited trick or a Black God on a black-suited trick, in these cases the player has the option of declaring their god as higher than a Ten of Totems, but lower than a Jack of Totems. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Skulls, whoever played the first Skull wins.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 10 points, plus 3 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 5 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.<br/><br/>The total number of tricks bid in a round cannot match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.<br/><br/>The booklet attached to the papers was written by the well-known author Alfonso Del Bello, and in 64 pages he explains in the first part the meaning of the cards (which, as far as the traditional suits are concerned, is almost always modeled on the classic one of Etteilla) and a short divination game, and in the second the real game.<br/><br/>",

Kin, Propaganda, and Fervor.<br/>Blood feuds bubbling from within your own borders can be vented and tapped through fervor or quelled with propaganda heroes. Be sure not to let them get too high... The mob always comes for the man in the high tower. <br/>Protect yourselves from them with only your most trusted Kin heroes. But even family can be lost to the voice of god or fate. As heroes of your culture die their legacies remain and new legacies fill their shoes.<br/>Each game of Danelaw is different with unordered map additions added in random variations presenting opportunities that force players to think on their feet and change their approach. <br/>Convert or subjugate, stoke the coals of war or shackle those who would with propaganda and the axe. <br/>Keep your kin close, but keep your enemies closer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squirrel Nation is a family card game for 3-4 players. In the game, players compete to build the happiest and most well-fed community of squirrels in the city park. To succeed, you will need to overcome many threats to your community such as a tree-destroying woodpecker, a trash-devouring raccoon, acorn-stealing chipmunks, and one very hungry owl!<br/><br/>A game of Squirrel Nation is made up of rounds where players bid using acorns to take columns of cards from a 3x3 grid (3 players) or 4x3 grid (4 players). In a &quot;once-around&quot; round of open bidding, the players select a column of cards, going from highest to lowest bidder. Most cards will be beneficial by adding squirrels, trees and food to your community. Many squirrels come with special actions or abilities, such as adding trees or acorns to your community. However, dangers lurk! Other critters have their own agenda that may get in the way of your plans.<br/><br/>The game ends after 6 rounds of play. Any squirrels not in a tree run away. All other squirrels are worth points based on how many Food cards you have of their preferred food type (Walnuts, Seeds or Peanuts). Highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

These were created in 2020(?) with big silly plans to work on Twin Stars III and a combination of life and computer crashes slowed it down. We lost a few things, but still had parts of these, so we cobbled the rest together as a prototype edition. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Topple the Giant is a scenario in the Twin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. The game consists of just 3 cards and players will provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Each scenario comes with 2 all-new characters and can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience.<br/><br/><br/>This scenario has been released separately at ShyCon Nashville 2022.<br/><br/>",

Simply put you have cards on hand with a phonetic symbol on it. This symbol represents the sounding of the last syllable of a phrase in a poem. When putting down a poetry card on your turn, you compose a poem with an ending like the symbol on the card. (See more in Cards - &lsquo;Rhyme Card&rsquo;).<br/><br/>Four cards of the table equals two rhymes of a poem, and a verse. Each &lsquo;Rhyme Card&rsquo; has four colored hearts, corresponding with each player&rsquo;s Lover Card (See more in Cards - &lsquo;Lover Card&rsquo;). The goal of the poetry is to have as many hearts corresponding with your opponents colors and as few of yours on the table when a verse is completed. When a verse is completed, you tally up the colored hearts and discard that amount of tokens.<br/><br/>The secondary feature of the game is talking about your Passions with &lsquo;Passion Cards&rsquo;. These are missions that you can carry out during the conversation ensuing while playing. Completing such a mission grants you a number of tokens.<br/><br/>The key to winning is:<br/>- Pay attention and try to discover what Lover Card the other player&rsquo;s have. <br/>- Limit the amount of cards on the table with your Lover Card on it.<br/>- Complete Passions to recover lost tokens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Bring It On Games is proud to present The New World Order.  A game of the dynamics of what happens once that wall came down.<br/><br/>2-4 players will vie for world supremacy. The game spans 1992 to 2032 in 2 year turns. You will manage your country&rsquo;s economy, government, and population through these perilous times.  Players will represent the United States, NATO, China and the Islamic Coalition.  Russia starts allied to the US but may change sides as the game goes on. The game will cover national prestige, elections, regime changes, economic issues, and military deployment.  You must keep your people happy, your economy prosperous, and your global interests secure.  Your opponents (and sometimes enemies) will try and prevent this through sabotage, espionage, economic warfare, and sometimes, even outright warfare.  You and your opponents will fight over the world. The future is yours to write.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 22 by 34 inch map of the entire world.  A countersheet of 5/8ths inch counters in the game will represent military forces, spies, and all the markers needed to play; included cards will be used to keep things chaotic and tense; a full color rulebook will round off the basics.  We promise a thoroughly playtested, developed, and complete package that is second to none in quality and presentation.  There are 4 scenarios provided to start the New World Order at different times in history. A solitaire variant will also be included so you can play the game on your own.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You have to put work hours (task cards) on the table until you reach 8 hours. <br/>The challenge includes avoiding Action cards (that your co-workers/other players) can play to boost their game or to stop you. Also you have to deal with the boss cards, random cards that appear and have devastating effects.<br/><br/>The player that reaches 8 hours of work wins one visibility point. The player that gains 2 visibility points wins the whole game.<br/><br/>It's a game:<br/><br/>Easy to learn<br/>10 min games<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siege of Jerusalem AD70 is a two-player wargame simulating the epic Roman assault on the city of Jerusalem in AD 70. The battle pits a veteran Roman army commanded by Titus Flavius against Judean rebels who are making an epic stand. The game system emphasizes command control and the use of both troop and siege units. Players randomly pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of battle. The Roman objective is to take Jerusalem, while the Judean objective is to delay the Romans long enough to claim an apocalyptic victory.<br/><br/>There are two players in the game: Roman and Judeans. The game consists of five months of battle (one turn each). Within each month there will be several turns, each generated by the pick of a command marker. Each hex on the map represents 200 yards. Each Roman Legionary unit represents two cohorts (800 to 1,000 men). Cavalry units are about 400 each. Auxiliary units represent groupings of 1,000 men. Judean units range from 500 to 2,500 fighters. A leader represents a great man or a lower commander along with their staff and elite guard troops.<br/><br/>A game turn represents about a month of operations. Each game turn will include Impulses representing anywhere from a day to a couple weeks of intense combat plus periods of reorganization.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Korea the Mobile War (1950-51) is a solitaire wargame covering the first year of the Korean War (July 1950 to June 1951). The game covers the critical mobile stage of the war when a decisive victory was in the cards. Historically, this phase ended in a stalemate with the front stabilized at the 38th parallel. The player controls the United Nations Command (UNC) while the game system controls Communist forces. The objective for the player is to gain the decisive victory that proved elusive in 1950-51. The game rules provide asymmetrical capabilities for each side. There are also options for the employment of additional UNC forces and US nuclear weapons. While a solitaire game, two or more players can also play Korea, each taking charge of different UNC forces.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one month of operations. The map is set at 30 miles to the inch. Most combat units are corps, divisions, and brigades/regiments.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rules for three games are included.<br/><br/>Marathon-Pr&auml;mienspiel (Plan 1)<br/>For this game the tilt die is used like a normal die to get results from 1 to 6. The players start at &quot;Start&quot; and have to get their five meeples, numbered from 1 to 5, to the space marked with &quot;Ziel&quot;. If a meeple reaches a red space marked with five dots (tournament bonus space) it advances to the next red spot marked with a &quot;+&quot; (additive bonus space) from wich it advances further according to its own number. If the result of the die and the number of the moved meeple add to &quot;5&quot; its number is considered to be &quot;5&quot; when landing on an additive bonus space. The spaces marked with a double ring (pairing spaces) may be occupied by two meeples, which then move together as a stack.<br/><br/>Lotto-Turnierspiel (Plan 2)<br/>Six meeples, marked 0 to 5, are placed on the board by using the tilt die to get results from 0 to 59. Then all meeples standing on white spaces are placed on the red space marked as &quot;Start B&quot;. All meeples standing on the white/red spaces (tournament pre spaces) are placed on the associated red tournament spaces, stacked if necessary. In the next phase of the game the tilt die is uses to produce the digits 0 to 5. The goal of the game is to get all numbered meeples on the tournament spaces with digits match their number. The space &quot;Start A&quot; is used as an interim space to move meeples from a tournament space where they don't belong.<br/><br/>Lotto-K&ouml;nigs-Turnierspiel (Plan 2)<br/>The placement of the meeples is like in the Lotto-Turnierspiel. But in this game the meeples move from ant to the boards of the other players till all meeples end up on the same board and the owner of this board wins the game. The movement of the meeples between the bords is controlled by strict rules wich allows the players no own decisions. So, it's a pure game of chance.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Without showing anyone else, players grab the number of poop tokens indicated on their starting value cards and hide them with their left hand.<br/><br/>A rest area tile gets revealed every turn, showing how many bathrooms are available to use. Players choose a number between 1 and 5 and take that number of poop tokens with their right hand.

        "description": "XVII century. The Original Peoples and the Aboriginal Nation are all sovereign in the Abya Yala del Sud. The white huinca is hardly a distant threat to the Children of the Earth.<br/><br/>In that Land without evil, people live respecting nature, the well-being of the people and the bravery of their caciques.<br/>But not everything is harmony in the confines of the pachamama. In the tolder&iacute;as, the smell of war is felt in the air of meadows and mountains, jungles and deserts, mountains and steppes. The caciques and their warriors will fight for the territories and their possibilities.<br/><br/>The end of the story is beginning...<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>Players dive into the fight for territories starting with 12 starting totems each. Throughout seven rounds they will fight for each territory betting totems and adding alliances with the tribes of their original region; without losing sight of the alliances of the others and the final support of the cacique to the weakest alliance. Each round is divided into five phases: two alliance phases, two betting phases, and a fight phase. A fight for supremacy where you won't have to lose sight of the impossibility of participating in all the contests, so you will have to choose very well which battle to fight.<br/><br/>The player with the most totems at the end of the dispute over the 7 territories wins the game and is proclaimed the new Grand Cacique of Abya Yala del Sud.<br/><br/>",
