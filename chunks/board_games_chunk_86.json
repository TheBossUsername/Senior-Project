        "description": "Black Hole Explorer is an interesting children's game about building a rocket to travel to and study a black hole. The game is designed to be light-hearted, educational and fun.<br/><br/>The game is played in three steps:<br/><br/>First construct your ship using what funds you have available -- $10 million to $60 million. Your ship must have probes, radiation shielding, gravitational strength and power to drive your spaceship.<br/><br/>And, don't forget to name your spaceship!<br/><br/>Next, travel to the black hole and enter into a low enough orbit with it to launch your probes.<br/><br/>There are spaces around the black hole to draw Event cards that may help or hinder your mission.<br/><br/>Finally, escape the black hole's gravity (which is harder than getting there), return to Earth and study the data from your probes. Did you gather enough information to win the Nobel Prize? The first player back gets to roll for the chance first. But is he or she fails, then the next finisher gets the chance.<br/><br/>The game has competitive and collaborative playing options, and also information for playing the game with large groups.<br/><br/>",

If a player's vocabulary knowledge is shaky but his imagination and bluffing skills are tops, he could easily win the game by persuading the other players to pass their betting chips his way.<br/><br/>",

It was pure luck that the Germans had failed to blow the bridge up.<br/><br/>Operation Loralie, the codeword to destroy this key crossing and been fumbled. Fumbled badly by the Germans. Confusion reigned on the German side and the Americans seized the bridge.<br/><br/>Now, the battle began. Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;wonder weapons&rdquo; were all directed at the bridge, from V-2 Rockets (which came close), jet bombers, massive Jagdtiger, Jagdpanther, Tiger II tanks and even SS Frogmen, all took their turn at sending the bridge to the bottom of the Rhine. The 9th, 11th and Lehr Panzer Divisions attempted to destroy the American bridgehead but were low of fuel.<br/><br/>The game captures this pure luck situation, as at any moment, luck can change the course of the battle, as in real life! All the elements are present that were there in the battle. What might have happened had the bridge been destroyed after the Americans had crossed? or, had the German panzers been able to attack as a coherent force?<br/><br/>The game uses a point to point movement system, easy to learn and hard to master. Daily turns, units range from company to battalions. The Americans must capture the bridge and cross to expand the bridgehead.<br/><br/>",

The palm tree leaves (fronds?) have various colored circles on them in rows from closest to the trunk to farthest away from the trunk.  The tree leaves have some degree of movement, and if too much weight is placed on them, they will dip or bend down.  Players take turn rolling a dice with various colored sides, and then placing a ladybug piece on a matching colored circle on a leaf.  The goal of the game is to get rid of all your ladybugs, but if your placement causes ladybugs to fall, those pieces become yours.  The game continues until one player is out of ladybugs. The leaves have different lengths and there are three sizes of ladybugs (small, medium and large), so there is some definite strategy about which ladybug gets placed where.  The tree, leaves, and ladybugs are all nicely formed and painted wooden pieces.<br/><br/>",

In this context, who would like to hazard his fortune on a throw of dice? Even in cases where chance is permitted, workaday personal and occupational practices persist - the neighbor is shunted aside or his property gloatingly purchased at auction...<br/><br/>All of this was not evident at the beginning of our rushing century. All one wanted to do at the end of the day was to relax. Television, radio, record player and cinema were unknown. The first motorists purchased their fuel at the apothecary and the operator of a magic-lantern illuminated his coloured glass slides with a kerosene lamp. The village squares were still the site of public wells, although some well-to-do people already had gaslight. Geese were allowed to graze the entire summer. Skiing was just beginning to be recognized as a sport. A race track for horses in the city was a novelty. And a locomotive engineer was admired by all the boys: 'What a man!'<br/><br/>Games of old reflect this world of the small adventures, where it was an event if a train derailed or even when a fowl flew its coop. Then in those days games were modern and exciting.

On the way you have to land on 4 pre-dealt cities depicted on the flight plan cards. You encounter hazards and have to refuel your plane.<br/><br/>In order to move you whirl the whole globe (hence the name of the game), and the two-dimensional spinner at the globe base connected to the globe shows on the inside what chance cards and hazards are encountered and if and how much you can refuel. On the outside is shown how many hours (points)you can fly and how much fuel is consumed.<br/><br/>And there is also a colour code depicted on the globe base, which adapts to the various countries spread all over the &quot;world&quot;.<br/>You have to take all these informations into account to work out the best route with the help of the transparent distance finder depicting the travel distances point-to-point.<br/><br/>There are also some extra advantages to gain achieving some goals during your travels (such as crossing the equator).<br/><br/>",

The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.<br/><br/>The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:<br/><br/>-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.<br/>-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.<br/>-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.<br/>-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played in two modes &quot;Duels&quot; and &quot;Quests&quot;. In &quot;Duels&quot; two players fight each other, trying each to eliminate the opponent by either reducing his life total or gaining enough fame. In &quot;Quests&quot; players try to advance their Hero, by taking him from his early age and completing quests in order to take fame and have him rise to become a living legend. At the same time their opponents try to stop them by playing monsters that will prevent them from completing their quests. The first one to reach a certain level of fame wins.<br/><br/>Currently, only one set has come out, the first Rhapsody as it is being called, named Genesis. There are plans for more expansions in the following years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a traditional native American dice game, played exclusively by men. It is also a board game, with the board created on the ground using stones and sticks as markers and pieces. Forty stones are placed in a circle to form the track; players use a stick as their marker (or horse). Players cast three wooden billets, known as Pa-tol sticks, onto a flat stone; how they fall indicates how far their piece can move. Landing on another player's piece sends it back to its start. Players may choose where they wish to enter their piece and can choose to go round the track in either direction. The winner is the first player whose marker completes a circuit of the track.<br/><br/>While ostensibly a game of chance, descriptions of the game claim that expert players can throw the sticks to get their desired results.<br/><br/>Rules and more information are available here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html</a><br/><br/>",

Each player takes turns placing one of his stones on the intersections of the grid (only the center 12&times;12 grid on the go board is used.) Your goal is to recreate the web pattern on your card by placing your stones on the board. Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved. It is possible that the webs two players wish to create will overlap, in which case it becomes a race to see who can capture those intersections first. Points are scored based on whether the stone placed is in alignment with your web or one of your opponent's web, with more points being scored for stones that are placed in alignment with your web.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players have used all their stones. The winner is whoever gets the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Victory consists of capturing or sinking all enemy Merchant Shipping so that the enemy is completely blockaded and cannot obtain further supplies from Neutral sources.<br/><br/>The Map shows four countries (two sets of paired enemies).  The land war between them is considered to be locked in a Maginot Line type of stalemate so the battle hinges on the war at sea.  The map has 32 ports (5 in each warring country and 12 on the coasts of the neutrals).<br/><br/>Each country has a different starting mix of units (for example Leoland is high in Naval Formations and Adlerreich has the most submarines).  The player round consists of moving all your cargo ships 1 space then rolling the dice and moving your units. A player may make a single air attack instead of moving any naval units.  The air units have unlimited range and the number required to make an attack is based on the target.  Losses are also based on the target and are automatic (for example it takes 4 air units to attack a naval formation and 2 air units are automatically lost).<br/><br/>A merchant ship can join a naval formation and create a convoy for more protection. Naval combat consists of a surprise attack (by submarines) and open attacks between naval formations.  The surprise attack can be triggered by a roll of 8 or higher and an open attack requires the player to spend 1 or 2 pips of the dice roll.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This &quot;variant&quot; of Xiangqi is played on a 19 X 19 grid (Go board). Seven armies represent the seven warring states of the late Zhou Dynasty (1045 - 221 BC):<br/>Qin (white), Chu (red), Qi (indigo), Yan (black), Han (orange), Wei (green), Zhao (purple).<br/><br/>Each army is played by one player. For less than 7 players, there are several predetermined &quot;allies&quot;, so one or more players direct two armies.<br/><br/>Every army has 17 pieces, which makes a total of 120, regarding the central single piece, representing the kingdom of Zhou. This piece does not move at all and cannot be captured.<br/><br/>Each of the armies consist of the following pieces:<br/>1 General - moving like the Queen in modern Western Chess.<br/>1 Deputy General - moving like the Rook in modern Western Chess.<br/>1 Officer - moving like the Bishop in modern Western Chess.<br/>1 Diplomat - moving like the Queen, too, but cannot capture or be captured.<br/>1 Cannon - like the Cannon in XiangQi (moving like the Rook, but capturing over one intervening piece).<br/>1 (Unit of) Archers - moving like the Queen, but only for 4 spaces.<br/>1 (Unit of) Crossbowmen - moving like the Queen, but only for 5 spaces<br/>2 (Units of) Swordsmen - moving 1 space diagonally.<br/>4 (Units of) Broadswordsmen - moving 1 space vertically or horizontally.<br/>4 (Units of) Cavalry - moving 4 spaces: 1 in a straight line and then 3 diagonally.<br/><br/>There are several rules regulating possible allies and winning conditions over single states. Residual pieces of beaten armies are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Simplified, it can be said, that to gain a victory over another state, a player has to capture the general or more than 10 pieces of this state. The player with the most captured pieces at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>There are similarities both to Go (the central piece as the centre of the universe/representing the Zhou Dynasty, or the removing of &quot;dead&quot; armies) and Xiangqi  (the pieces, the armies ...); this and the 7 players make this game unique in the history of strategic boardgames.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, based on popular 1920s and 30s fictional detective Philo Vance, revolves around each player trying to collect a set of clue cards which matches one of ten suspect, whose attributes are kept hidden in play.  After collecting a set of clues, a player may accuse one of the suspects, and if enough of their clues match the suspect, the suspect can be arrested and brought to court.  If the player is able to present sufficient additional evidence, the suspect is convicted and the player wins.<br/><br/>While this game has been compared to Clue, there aren't many similarities.  Instead of trying to gather evidence to identify  a specific suspect selected and hidden at the start of the game (i.e. Col. Mustard with a Cuisinart in the Rumpus Room), the goal of this game is to wander around collecting clue cards until a picture of one of the ten suspects comes into focus, and then try to gather enough clues to put them away.  It's actually kind of a perversion of justice if you think about it.<br/><br/>Another odd element of the game is that landing on other players' pieces (i.e. &quot;bumping&quot;) can serious screw with the player, so there's an interesting screw-your-neighbor aspect to play.  Aside from that, the fact that repeated plays will almost certainly result in players memorizing the cards means that the replay value might be limited, but the bumping might actually keep the play interesting.<br/><br/>",

The game includes nine over-sized six-sided dice that feature every card in a standard deck (including two jokers). The dealer randomly selects five dice for a player to roll. After rolling, the player can then opt to trade up to four dice for four new dice, which represents drawing new cards. The dice are then given to the player on the left. Players must keep track of what &quot;cards&quot; have already been played in a hand so that no one can have a duplicate. Any duplicate cards must be rerolled.<br/><br/>The game includes chips and a scorecard for betting.<br/><br/>",

That player wins.<br/><br/>",

Remove the lowest die. <br/>The total of the dice removed represents total strokes for that hole. Mark your score on the score card.  <br/> B. Points are also awarded. Birdies are worth one point. Eagles are worth two points. A five-of-a-kind is a hole in one. It's worth 3 points. Points are recorded on the score sheet in the proper box for that whole.<br/><br/>C. The lowest score in the total column wins the game. The highest extra points in the total column wins the points.<br/><br/>D. Penalties: <br/>-When a player shakes three &quot;1's&quot; in one shake, he removes two aces and so his count for that stroke is 2. (Sand Trap)<br/>-When a player shakes three '2's&quot; in one shake he is penalized 2 strokes and must remove two deuces so his count for that shake is 4 strokes (out of bounds).<br/><br/>When the above rules are followed, the scores will be very representative to a regular outdoor game of golf.<br/><br/>",

If the spinner lands on his color, he may put one of his colored balls in the hole on the Christmas tree that shows the matching color. If the spinner lands on the tree, he must remove one of his colored balls from the tree. If a player spins Santa Claus before he has 8 balls on the tree, he can spin again. Once a player has all his 8 balls on the tree, he spins on his turn for Santa Claus. When he has all 8 balls and spins Santa Claus, he yells out &quot;Hi Ho!

Each has brought a pile of games and is trying to get certain games on the table for playing. Best played with 3+ players due to the bidding mechanism.<br/><br/>A board is set out on the table. A 20 point, timer track encircles the entire board. In the center is a board with five tracks on it. The tracks are labeled &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;Weight&quot;, &quot;Luck&quot;, &quot;Strategy&quot;, &quot;Interaction&quot; <br/>Each track is numbered 0, 1-9, with the zones 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 clearly marked.<br/><br/>During the course of the game each player will blind bid to move the marker up or down the track of their choice, trying to either keep that track in the same zone as their played game(s) or new game they wish to start. Blind bids are all taken, even if you don't win. The counters used for bidding are divided amongst players who bid zero, keeping a closed economy for &quot;money&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends after a set amount of &quot;game-time&quot; has gone by which all players' games add to when they are completed. Add up the total games' times for the winner; highest wins.<br/><br/>Each person who decides to make this game will be able to place the name and categories of their own favorite games as it comes with blank cards to print out. Also, a supply of counters will be needed for the bidding as well as a printing of the gameboard.<br/><br/>The rules can be found on the thread: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88063</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ace Handicap Golf game comes with two large double sided boards depicting 18 golf holes and a practice hole. Each hole may contain some of the various golf hazards: bunkers, water, rough, trees etc. Three different games are described in the rules: novice, standard and handicap. For each golf hole, players select from several possible routes marked on the boards, study a club/distance chart to determine which club best suits the chosen route then roll a 14 sided dice to determine the accuracy of the shot (accurate, good, poor, hook/slice, fault). This repeats until the green is reached. Once on the green, separate charts manage the process of putting.<br/><br/>The handicap version of the game allows chips to be won for good shots which can be played at various times during the hole eg to avoid bad rolls, negotiate hazards or make small advancements.<br/><br/>Not so much an edit as an addition to the information. The designer and artist of this game was Eddie Solomons,not Eric as stated. He was assisted by his family who have happy memories of researching and dry running the game. One daughter, who was just 18 at the time was sent off to the patents office in London, England, to research the design of the then innovotive multisided dice based on a golf ball.How do I know all this? I am that daughter! Sadly, Eddie passed away on the 9th September 2011 aged 86. It was kinda nice to see his game remebered on the internet. Unfortunately, when his grandson arrived at his hospital bed to show him, he was already starting to slip away. Thank you,all the BoardGameGeeks, for immortalising part of the eccentric late Eddie Solomons.<br/><br/>",

After his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry wanted to divorce from her, against Roman Catholic mandates. Not agreeing with the Pope, Henry starts the English reformation, branching off into the Anglican Church. Henry then marries 5 more times during his reign, the historical order of his wife&rsquo;s goals which is best remembered in the mnemonic device &ldquo;Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Now you can live the life of King Henry the VIII and give your six wives the same fates.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to meet 4 different goals; &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; two of your own queens, &ldquo;behead&rdquo; two of your queens, have one of your queens &ldquo;die&rdquo;, and to have one of your queens &ldquo;survive&rdquo;. Each of these goals requires a different interaction of pieces and or positions to be met. The first player to meet all of these goals is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Travelling is done by rolling the dice. If a player reaches one of his targets he has to read the text of the card and follow its instructions that usually favour far away locations and add handicaps to near locations.<br/><br/>Beside the normal movement there exist two special movements: one clockwise around the map by travelling by bus and one counter clockwise by travelling by 'Pl&auml;tte' (tourist ships that were used for shipping salt along the river in former times.) The special movements normally increase your travel speed but add the risc of too far movements.<br/><br/>After a player has reached all his targets he has to move to the castle of Burghausen (the longest in Europe or probably in the world) in the middle of the game map. There he has to roll the dice for each of the six castle wards. The first player to reach the most inner ward wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Instead, players builds their own word puzzles in front of them. Letters are worth points (vowels are worth 1 point, consonants 2 points, and super consonants J, K, Qu, X, and Z, are worth 4) the object of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points. Every player randomly selects eight tiles and places them face down. Simultaneously, players turn them over and begin building the puzzles with as many letters from their individual pile as possible. Once someone has used up all eight tiles, he or she says &quot;Saygo&quot; and all players will select another tile. If nobody can use their tiles it is a stalemate, and everyone selects another tile. Should players find they can not use all of their tiles, they have the option of rearranging their puzzles as often as needed, in attempt to use all letters. The game continues until all tiles are used and the last person to use his/her last tile yells &quot;done&quot;. Once the group verifies the accuracy of the winning player's words, the winner collects the remaining letters and adds them to his/her score. Once a player has 500 points (that number can be lowered or raised if desired), the round is finished and players can play again.&quot;<br/><br/>",

You can push dangerous guests to your neighbour's door, but if you're not careful, you might get one yourself!<br/>The character the players play all have different areas they are good at and bad at. And they, too, are former adventurers, so they have individual skills to attract or deter guests. The one who uses these skills the best, gets the most content customers and earns the most money during the festival will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Translated from the Japanese rule book)<br/>In this game, players cooperate in order to defeat huge monsters. All damage dealt to the monster is directly converted into Victory Points, and the one with the most VPs when the third monster is defeated, is declared the winner.<br/>But it is not an easy task to deal damage to these huge creatures. If you're too far away, you can't deal any damage at all. In order to deal damage, and earn points, you need to get close to the monster, and run the risk of taking damage yourself.<br/>And dealing damage isn't the only thing you must be careful about. The other players are aiming at your back. They might try to push you to the front line. If you're pushed to the front, and the monster gets you, all your points are halved!<br/>Seeing to that the leading player gets nicely defeated, and still having cards left to deal some damage to the monster, will make you the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dresda is a &lsquo;fast-play&rsquo; fantasy battle skirmish system designed for small numbers of troops yet involving more than a little role-playing on the part of the players. Indeed, unlike many conventional wargames with little or no &lsquo;role-playing&rsquo; element, in Dresda you are your units' Commander in the field, and you not only have the responsibility of commanding the unit in battle, but also the headaches of paying your troops, buying their equipment and generally trying to improve your (and their) financial position.<br/><br/>Dresda is a scenario driven game, not points based one. This means that careful thought needs to be given to the designing of scenarios by the GM. So, although you can line up your troops on opposite sides of the table and simply advance until you bump into each other in the centre, you'll find this isn't really much fun, and you'll quickly find that your games will be much more enjoyable if you (and/or a good GM) put some effort into designing an interesting or challenging scenario.<br/><br/>Of course, it also helps to create a feeling of unit continuity by treating your unit as a group of individuals rather than disposable 'cannon (or halberd)-fodder'. Name each of them, decide what they like to eat, drink and how they feel about their Mum, and suddenly you can see them as characters in a role-playing game, not just as troops in a &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; wargame.<br/><br/>Over a number of games you'll see your unit develop, watch their fortunes wax and wane and individual characters come and go. Eventually you'll find that some of these factors will start to dictate your actions on the battlefield, for instance you may see &lsquo;heroic&rsquo; traits develop in one character or cowardly traits in another as the miniatures begin to become characters in their own right, and not just anonymous lumps of painted white metal.<br/><br/>The Aim of the Game<br/><br/>The basic aim of Dresda is to raise a small unit of fighters, fight battles and get rich!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, whilst this basic aim is simple, it isn't necessarily easy. What's more, this is likely to be a more 'hands-on' experience than you may be used to, even in skirmish wargaming. That's because you, the Player, will take on the role of your unit's Commander, and will be represented on the battlefield by a miniature figure!<br/><br/>",

When shapes are revealed, you may or may not get to discard your strategy card, depending on the shapes and strategies of your opponents.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re a Jackrabbit, you succeed if you played the lowest strategy card.  If you&rsquo;re a Lion, you succeed if you played the highest strategy card.  If you&rsquo;re a Peacock, you succeed if no one else played a card that matches your card&rsquo;s rank or suit.  If you&rsquo;re the first one to discard all of your strategy cards, you win.<br/><br/>Druid&rsquo;s Duel is a game for two to four players. Druid&rsquo;s Duel uses a standard Poker deck.

        "description": "Confrontation was the name given to the original Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader skirmish game set on Necromunda in which gangs fought against each other, and attempted to increase their prestige and equipment.<br/><br/>The game was published over a number of issues of White Dwarf, starting with Issue 130, and with the last installment in Issue 142.<br/><br/>The mechanics focus on realism, allowing characters to make use of cover in specific ways, and requiring them to make specific tests when under fire.  Actions are performed on a points basis, so a character could run forward and fire a few badly-aimed shots, or stand still and fire more rounds at a target.<br/><br/>The game contains a large amount of detail concerning combat and psychological effects.<br/><br/>Rules for purchasing and trading equipment for players' gangs, were also included.<br/><br/>The game appears to be the precursor of Necromunda, published five years later.<br/><br/>",

There are 6 birds to collect, worth different points, in descending order of value they are: Kakapo, Albatross, Kiwi, Takahe, Kokako and Blue Duck. The game is intended to educate about the conservation of these species and the threats that they face in the wild.<br/><br/>The mechanic of the game is similar to the card game Rummy - on each turn the player picks up a card, either the top card from the deck or the top card from the discard pile, and then the player discards a card. Once a player has a complete family they must lay it down on the table.<br/><br/>In addition there are three other types of card with various properties. These are protection measures, conservation actions and threats. These can be played at any stage of the game during a players own turn.<br/><br/>Threats can be played against the families laid down by other players and will either destroy a whole family or only take one or more chicks depending on the type of threat. Threats include cats and dogs, rats, stoats and weasels, long line fishing, plastic waste, developers, infertility and virus. Protection measures are laid down on families on the table and they protect against some of the threats. Conservation actions allow a variety of different actions such as exchanging cards with other players, picking up an additional cards and neutralizing threats.<br/><br/>Each round finishes when one player goes out by playing all the cards in their hand onto the table. Points are scored for going out, for each bird in the families on the table and for having protection measures in place on those families. Minus points are scored for having threat cards remaining in a players hand when the round ends. A game ends after a set number of rounds or when a player reaches a set points target.<br/><br/>",

The player takes the role of the Israelis. Arab deployments are automatic.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game is played on three Fronts: the Northern Frontier (Galilee), Central Frontier (Jerusalem), and Southern front (Negev). Each Front is represented by six Territory Tokens, all of which are under the control of the Israelis (the solo player) at the start of the game. If the Arabs are able to acquire control all six tokens on any one Front, you suffer a Complete Loss. If you win all battles on all three Fronts for two turns in a row, you achieve a Decisive Victory. If the Arabs run out of unit cards, you achieve an Attrition Victory.<br/><br/>The Unit cards are intended to represent Arab and Israeli forces involved in the 1948 hostilities. Units are drawn and played to the Fronts - Arab units to designated Fronts and Israeli cards as desired by the player. Each turn one card is drawn from the Event deck. The Event card confers benefits to one side or the other.<br/><br/>",

Players then randomly choose a criminal to track. Opposing players then are provided the clue envelopes for their opponent's criminal. Players then place their pin on the map where their criminal is wanted. Highest roll of the dice goes first.<br/><br/>The Play<br/><br/>Players then attempt to track their criminal first by reading the biographical card, and judging what location the next clue to his whereabouts may be obtained. Dice are then rolled to determine the distance the player can move, the full amount of two dice for air travel, the large number of the two for express train, or the smaller number of the two dice for automobile. Upon arrival at his destination he will ask the player holding his clue envelope if a clue is found at the location. If no clue is found he must return to the city he started from, or last city where he obtained a clue. Players may also send other players on missions to uncover clues for them. If the player being sent refuses the mission he must pay $100 into the reward pool. If he goes on the mission and uncovers a clue for another player he will receive $50 from that player. If no clue is uncovered, the player sending him on the mission pays $50 to the reward pool.<br/><br/>The final clue will advise of the death or capture of the criminal.The first player to uncover all of the clues for his criminal receives $1000, the second to finish $800, and third $600, and any players after $500, or until the reward pool money is exhausted.

This game is playable either as a 2-player or a 4-player game in two variations - an easier game with less options or more difficult (in a manner) with more options and restrictions on movement/opponent elimination.<br/><br/>You basically roll two 6-sided dice and them can jump with one of your soldiers from the field numbered on either the first/second die to a field numbered on the second/first die.<br/><br/>Example: you roll 2 and 6 and therefore you can jump from 2 to 6 or from 6 to 2 (you are not allowed to jump 2 to another 2 or 6 to another 6) if your soldier stands in a formation (2 soldiers on adjacent hexes). If you land on a square with your opponent, you eliminate him from the board. If your soldier stands as a single unit, he can only jump onto an adjacent hex (providing appropriate numbers have been rolled).<br/><br/>There is also one general per side which can jump on any appropriately numbered hex even if he does not stand in a formation. He also has 2 (or just 1 in case of 4 players) &quot;Home hexes&quot; where no soldier can attack him unless all other soldiers of the general's side are dead already.<br/><br/>When the enemy general is removed from game, the game ends.<br/><br/>In the advanced game there is an inner area which is used for elimination. The outer area is a no-fighting zone (cover).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from their website)<br/><br/>Calling All Race Fans<br/>CATCH THE EXCITEMENT OF &quot;BIG TIME AUTO RACING&quot;!<br/><br/>If you love stock car racing, you must play Speedway Racing's board game. The Speedway Racing  board game gives you 'big time stock car auto racing' and 'live event track action' for true, behind the wheel racing experiences.<br/><br/>At the Drivers Meeting, you will receive your Drivers Handbook and will learn the rules of the race.<br/>With one to five drivers, choose your favorite car, then 'start your engines'. Drivers race their cars around the oval track based on a roll of the dice. There are Bonus Points in the game. If you are lucky enough to roll doubles or other combinations imprinted, on the Speedway Racing game board, you will accelerate your advancement around the track.<br/><br/>During the Driver's meeting, you also learn that this will be a fast paced, five-lap competition. You will be driving against other highly competitive opponents. There are many Challenges and Pitfalls ahead of you as you speed around the track to take your car, to the coveted &quot;Winner Circle&quot;, of Speedway Racing's board game.<br/><br/>Before you begin, choose Option 1, for the first driver to cross the finish line. Or, Option 2, in case all drivers are 'stacked up' and trying to cross the finish line. One last roll of the dice will determine the winner. You must choose Option 1 or Option 2, before the race begins.<br/><br/>The Race is Underway! Of course, the object of the game is to win the race, but beware; there are advantages and obstacles as you thunder around the track.<br/><br/>Hit the &quot;Pit Stop&quot; Zone or the &quot;Speedway Challenge&quot; Zone and adjust your position based on the events of each opportunity. Hit the wall and you suffer the consequences, in your quest. If you can avoid an accident, you will advance your position on the track.<br/><br/>Take care in selecting your pit crew. Many track advantages will depend on the timing, action and reaction speed of your pit crew.A driver can pilot the race car, but the pit crew will make the crucial difference in the outcome of the victory.<br/>    <br/>As in real speedway racing, your pit crew is vital! The Speedway Racing Board Game track graphics are beautifully illustrated. The game's race cars are authentic 1:144 scale die-cast metal with moving wheels.<br/><br/>The &quot;Challenge&quot; cards and &quot;Pit Stop&quot; cards are<br/>realistic 'during the race' events. As you position your car and maneuver around the track, you will encounter cars hitting the wall, track debris, flat tires and yellow flags.<br/><br/>Caution Flags Are Out! Beware of Hazards!!<br/><br/>White-knuckle rookie drivers could hit the car in front of them, have stalled engines or make serious driving errors, while lapped traffic slows you down. The events of the &quot;Speedway Racing&quot; board game will impact the sheer adrenaline rush of moving forward, as you concentrate, on the coveted first place win. As you cross the Finish Line, move your car into the &quot;Winner's Circle&quot;.<br/><br/>Each game contains a highly detailed graphic game board, five 1:144 scale die-cast cars with moving wheels, drivers challenge cards, dice and directions, in a re-usable bag. Family board game enthusiasts may want to have multiple games for their weekly or monthly family board game night.<br/><br/>The rules, of this family board game, are easy enough for the youngest race fans, but challenging enough, to keep you and the other drivers ever watchful on the track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game with 44 animal cards divided into 7 sets. Each set has a &quot;Mother&quot; card, 1 or more &quot;young&quot; cards, 1 or more &quot;Where Found&quot; cards, and 1 or more &quot;breed&quot; cards. The cards of each set have the same number on them. This number is the points you earn by collecting that particular set.<br/><br/>The object of each round is to collect 1 &quot;Mother&quot;, 1 &quot;young&quot;, 1 &quot;breed&quot;, and 1 &quot;Where Found&quot; card from any given set. The first player to do this wins any given round and receives the points shown on that set.<br/><br/>The fun part for little children comes in when a player has managed to collect a &quot;Mother&quot;, a &quot;breed&quot; and a &quot;where found&quot; card for one set. At this point that player &quot;cries&quot; for the young by making the sound of that animal. The idea here is that the mother of the set is calling out for her young. When this happens, any player in possession of &quot;young&quot; cards of that specific animal type must give them to the crying player.<br/><br/>The first player to 60 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A &quot;rudimentary&quot; game (the designer's word) in which each player controls a single piece representing an airplane and attempts to shoot down the opponent. Moves are plotted in groups of five. The planes move the same as the rooks do in the later games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pentaplane-Checkers. This is played much like standard checkers, but the pieces move diagonally between boards, not on the same board. Some spaces on the boards have dots to facilitate diagonal movement, which is always from dot to dot or blank to blank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pentaplane-Chess. This has a number of differences from standard Chess besides the board. There are no kings of queens, instead there are monarchs, and they can only be obtained by promoting pawns. Pawns can move backwards as well as forwards. The bishops move the same way as the pieces in Pentaplane-Checkers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Super Pentaplane-Chess. Pentaplane-Chess but with a much greater variety of pieces: a president which can move along flat diagonals, a hopper which must jump over another piece when moving, missile versions of pieces which can destroy other pieces at a distance, bomb versions of pieces which can blow up and destroy a 3x3x3 area, etc. Players agree on which pieces are allowed before the game. They do not have to use the same set of pieces. Note that the new pieces introduced here are not included in the Pentaplane set.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pentaplane V. This game is not included in the rulebook, but is available online (see the Links section). This is a modified version of Super Pentaplane-Chess with some differences in the list of pieces.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each cube has the same 6 different patterns on its sides, but no two cubes have the same arrangement of these six sides. The sides have dots or lines in different patterns, carved into the wooden surfaces.<br/><br/>Each player &quot;owns&quot; a type of side, e.g. the &quot;cross&quot; or the &quot;four dots&quot; and places one cube on his turn onto the 5 x 6 grid board, starting from a corner. There are only a few rules:<br/><br/>1. Placing a cube, the sides surface-to-surface to another cube has to have the same pattern.<br/><br/>2. This also applies, if the cube has to fit in between two or three cubes already placed, thus limiting the possibilities.<br/><br/>3. It is forbidden to place a cube in a way, that an adjacent cube cannot be placed. SO, sides facing a &quot;spare&quot; place are not allowed to be the same.<br/><br/>4. There may not occur any &quot;holes&quot; on the board, so the whole grid is filled up slowly.<br/><br/>Since you have to draw your next cube randomly, there is a &quot;luck factor&quot;, for the limitations in placement can be huge or non-existent.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>If the grid is filled up - or cannot be filled any further - the sides showing upside are counted for each player. The player with the most sides showing up is the winner.<br/><br/>There are a lot of puzzles, too, for the 1-player-variant, and 3D-variants.<br/><br/>One special thing about this game is, that you can also play it blindfold or with blind people.<br/><br/>",

Avalon Hill's Tanktics is probably the best known.<br/><br/>Sieg in Afrika is particularly outstanding in the fact that fog of war is simulated by 2 identical maps and counter sets.

        "description": "&quot;Card Game for 2-4+ players. The Thirty Years War took place in Germany from 1618-1648. The main adversaries were the Catholics and the Protestants. Each player takes the role of a Military Contractor of the age. The goal is to use your skill as a general and an entrepreneur to amass wealth and fame.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player creates a Leader character with three random traits (skills). Each Leader has a Reputation score, which starts at 0 and is increased or decreased based on the Leader's performance in campaigns.<br/><br/>A Leader gains gold each turn based on the value of his employment contract. An additional random amount of gold is gained each turn for &quot;savings, investments, contributions, estate incomes, financial backers, looting, etc.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victory: When the deck runs out, the player with the most Gold wins. If two players are tied, the player with the highest Reputation score wins.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The time is January 27th 1945.<br/><br/>Allied Command HQ<br/>Excerpts from the Wolf Group Briefing<br/>Without cause the Germans winter offensive through the Ardennes Forrest has abruptly come to a halt. Along the entire front, hordes of refugees have flooded into Allied camps all telling the tales of the dead coming back to life. Something has gone horribly wrong and zombie German Army humanoids, known as Kroids, are attacking with organized military efficiency.<br/><br/>- Who is leading the Kroids?<br/>At this time we have no idea who, or what, is controlling or leading these Kroid forces. Reports have led to speculation that the leader of the Kroids is a summoned demon that was resurrected or awakened by the experiments of the SS Project Diabolus team at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany.<br/><br/>- Where do the Kroids come from?<br/>All we know at the moment is that they are the reanimated remains of fallen soldiers or zombies &ndash; but not the mindless zombies seen in the Dracula movies we watched in the theaters as kids. Instead, these zombies appear to independently think and communicate. As they attack and kill our troops their ranks grow in numbers. What we do know is that a dead soldier, in any condition, burned, missing limbs or shot all to hell will, if not 'finished,' rise as a Kroid within 24 hours. A 'finished' corpse is one that has had its head removed.<br/><br/>- Why are the Kroids here and what do they want?<br/>Sadly we have no idea. We believe this is the result of same wacky Nazi secret weapon experiment gone horribly wrong and we will just have to deal with it as best as we can. We do know that a Nazi machine called the Cyclomatron was built and activated by a team of SS scientists and engineers working at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany. Somehow this machine is the power behind these Kroids.<br/><br/>- How do we defeat the Kroids?<br/>To date our strategy has been one of attacking the Third Reich's ability to wage war. We have been very successful in dismantling their infrastructure by destroying factories, refineries and transport. We have denied them the ability to manufacture and deploy the tools of war. The Kroids have no supply lines and they pick their tools of war up off the ground. They do not need to eat; they do not need to sleep. Their machines do not run on gas and ball bearings. Simply put, we have to change our entire strategy. As commanders you must think with your head. A casualty in your command is a new recruit for the Kroid army. The orders you have already received detail our current strategy, which is one of containment. Until further notice we are going on the defensive.<br/><br/>",

They first group the animals together by type (all the penguins, then the elephants..), then link the groups together.<br/><br/>Three of the games are interactive and one of these is cooperative. One is to match the threading to a picture (many pictures for this are included), another is a race to complete the threading first but pieces are only added when the right die roll is thrown, and the third is to cooperatively build a single thread as fast as possible. The fourth activity in the box is a solitaire exercise.<br/><br/>",

The game scale is 10km per hex, units are brigades or divisions, or cadres/groups.<br/><br/>The Advanced Millennium Wars system is quite unique relative to traditional wargame designs. Rather than utilize quantitative &quot;factors&quot; for such things as movement and combat, the game is entirely missions based, with each unit being capable of performing a given set of missions as indicated by icons on the backs of the unit counters. Missions are combined into Operations against specific targets, which can include other units in play, populations centers on the map, or political capital. Targets on the receiving end of such operations must execute specific casualty chains to account for losses caused by offensive operations. The game also utilizes a unique &quot;Tier&quot; system that determines the number of phases the units of any given faction may conduct missions per turn.<br/><br/>The full game (not yet released) explores the past, present, and future of the Arab/Israeli struggle. Includes a 56 page booklet focused on the history behind (and yet to come of) the game.<br/><br/>Scenarios included in the full game:<br/>1. '48 War Phase 1<br/>2. '48 War Phase 2<br/>3.

        "description": "This is a dice game in Barti's range of match-box sized games (Art. 3606).<br/><br/>The game comes with 3 wooden dice and 6 red wooden pawns that are called 'bottles'. The first player rolls the 3 dice and has up to 3 rolls to get a score that he/she is satisfied with. Ones count as 100 points, sixes as 60 points and other numbers of pips are face value. A player can stop before using all 3 rolls. Subsequent players now have the same number of rolls to roll a higher score. If a player fails to roll higher than the previous high score, the player has to take a bottle and a new round begins. When all the bottles are taken, the rules change - a player now puts back a bottle in the middle if someone is unable to beat their score. The loser is the last player left to hold any bottles.<br/><br/>",

(In this era, rifles could not be fitted with a bayonet! Only muskets had the bayonet attachment!)&quot;<br/><br/>The players must supply the appropriate toy soldiers. The rules divide the figures into five types: Infantry (foot soldiers), Cavalry (mounted soldiers), Artillery (gun crewmen and cannons), Rangers (infantry with rifles), and Indians (who fight as infantry or cavalry).<br/><br/>Each type of figure is rated or movement, as are wagons and caissons. Six types of ranged weapons commonly found with Revolutionary War miniatures are rated for range, damage, and rate of fire. Other concepts covered in the rules include terrain effects, hand-to-hand combat, walls/bunkers, forts, and soldiers fighting as units.<br/><br/>",

Players can assume the identities of historic Union and Confederate generals and admirals, or simply be referred to as Commander 1, Commander 2, etc. down the lines.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This opposing line of players stretches from Virginia down the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast to Texas and then up the Mississippi River Valley.  Any map of the eastern United States can be used, or an outline of the coast created with masking tape, but is not required for play.  Each commander has six cards; two navy, two army and two special cards.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;In multi-player games, players can only communicate by passing messages verbally to other commanders seated immediately beside them . . . Washington and Richmond can attempt to pass a grand strategy to the rest of the team at the beginning of a turn, but the word must be passed &lsquo;down the line.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Goal of the game is to get rid of them. First player who manages this wins the game.<br/><br/>The player in turn rolls a die, and moves his figurine forward by the exact amount. Depending on the space he lands on, he might have to do one of the following actions: Give on of his disks to another player, remove it from the game, place it on the board, or take a disk from the board an add it to his load.<br/><br/>Included are two variants: In one, you start without disks and try to collect a given number; in the other, you have the choice whether to move you figurine forwards or backwards after seeing your roll.<br/><br/>",

The players try to help Anna to keep the animals safe.<br/><br/>7 pairs of animal counters are placed on the table; the large ones open, the small ones hidden. One of the small counters is placed below the alligator card. On command, all players simultaneously peek underneath the remaining counters. When a player thinks he knows which animal the alligator is after, he grabs the corresponding large counter. If he is correct, he gets to keep the pair (1 point for each tile); otherwise he has to give back a piece he collected earlier. In addition, there are a few minor special rules regarding the horse Mississippi.After each round, a new animal pair is added to keep the total at 7. The game ends after 19 rounds, when there are now animals left to refill.<br/><br/>",

In this, as in other 18xx games, players assume the role of investors in railroad companies. Play alternates between share dealing rounds, in which players buy and sell stock in railroads, and operating rounds, in which players build track, run trains and ferries, and manage the assets of the companies in which they own controlling interest.<br/> 1865: Midwest uses 8 major railroads, 4 minor railroads, and 8 private companies to simulate the rich railroad history of the region. As the game progresses, the 4 minor railroads will pair off, each pair forming a larger railroad, or system. Later, two of the major railroads are destined to merge into a third system.<br/> The game is designed, from the ground up, to give each player an equal opportunity to succeed in amassing great wealth during the game. In 1865: Midwest there is more than one path to victory, so don't be afraid of losing the game in the first few rounds. You have more control than ever before of the operations of your railroads, but be mindful: so do your opponents!<br/> 1865: Midwest should be a challenging, and engaging gaming experience for the seasoned 18xx gamer.<br/><br/>",

Through strategic card play and and tactical pegging, each player attempts to avoid Collisions, Oil Spills and Spin Outs while trying to force his opponent into them.  By crossing over the inside lane before each turn in the track, a player can shorten the overall distance from 121 holes -- as in traditional Cribbage -- to 107 holes.  By taking advantage of the powerful &quot;Slipstream&quot;, a trailing player can change the face of a game in a single hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Haunted Destinies is an identity mystery game set on the Scottish moors.  At the start of the game, one player is secretly assigned the role of Opener, but no one - not event the player who is the Opener - knows who the Opener is.  The Opener card, and other attribute cards, are distributed to the players in destiny piles.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, your destiny, and the destiny of the other players, will gradually be revealed. The Opener is destined to break the walls that keep past, present future, the dead, and the living separate. If you discover that you are The Opener, your goal is to complete the opening ritual by killing all of the other players. If you are not The Opener, your goal is to bind him or her and stop the opening ritual.<br/><br/>If you die and the game is not over, you become a ghost. Ghosts can only win if a Haunting card that gives them a win condition is in play. What are Haunting cards and how do they work? You add Haunting cards to your destiny pile when you are haunted by ghosts or if you fail a destiny search. A Haunting card comes into play when another player probes your destiny pile and finds a Haunting card.<br/><br/>Haunted Destinies uses a tiled board system similar to Betrayal at the House on the Hill, but each tile edge indicates the minimum number of movement points need to leave through that edge.  Some tiles have an &quot;X&quot;, indicating that you can not leave that way.  This tile setup creates interesting, semi-solid maze-like boards that are different each game.<br/><br/>Haunted Destinies is a game for three to six players. It uses a custom set of board tiles, three custom card decks, a black six sided die, and a white six sided die. You can download the custom parts and the rules at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/499/haunted-destinies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/499/haunted-destinies</a>. A four-player game takes about 60 minutes to play. Since it deals with ritual sacrifice and murder, Haunted Destinies is appropriate for ages 16 and up.<br/><br/>",

Your union won't let you actually hurt each other, so the only way to settle this like, well not like men, is to have an&hellip;Evil Vendetta Pie Fight.<br/><br/>Players each take a unique monster character (Witch, Mummy, Werepoodle, Vampire, etc.) and commence to throw magic pies and spells at eat other. If one of their six body regions is struck by a pie then it is immobilized and can not be used. There are spells to deflect pies, clear pies off body parts, and bend the rules. Last thing standing wins.<br/><br/>In general, when a player begins to carry more pie than others, players will gang up on him/her to eliminate them from the game. In addition, as play progresses more and more of the defensive cards leave the game thus ensuring acceleration of pie hits and a certain and quick end to the game.<br/><br/>Evil Vendetta Pie Fight is currently available in a Flagpole edition. What does that mean? Glad you asked. It means the game is made out of cardstock that I have printed out on my little HP Officejet and chopped up on a paper cutter by my very own hand. It comes in a plain white cardboard box BUT every game is numbered and autographed. There will only be 100 copies of the Flagpole edition. If they sell well we hope to have a production version out soon.<br/><br/>The flagpole comes with:<br/><br/>64 pie cards and 32 spell cards for a total of 96 cards <br/>36 cards to construct your being's bodies from. <br/>1 normal six-sided die <br/>42 bingo tokens which are used to target pies and spells<br/><br/>You can play it right out of the box. Come on, you KNOW you want to throw pies at your friends&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game (the name means &quot;demimonde&quot;) was designed by the German writer and cartoonist Kurt Halbritter and was published 3 years after his death by his widow. 120 image tiles, drawn in his typical style, and 10 text tiles can be used by the players to lay &quot;tableaux&quot; or play a dominoes variant if following one of the three variants that come with the game. The images and texts range from the funny through slightly erotic to absurd. However, the author himself makes it clear that this is not meant to be a game in the first place but rather a flight of fantasy for the players: &quot;Whoever did not have to suppress his play instinct from earliest youth will know immediately what to do with the tiles, and will have a foreboding of the sinful diversity of variations.&quot; But, since &quot;the Germans always want to win something&quot; (Kurt Halbritter, but also Arno Schmidt), he provided some rules nevertheless: Demimonde Dominoes, Basic Demimonde and Demimonde Tableau. The aim is, in all variations, to get rid of one's tiles first (or not to be caught to be the last with tiles left). The tiles have a varying number of points on their backs which can be used for some kind of scoring system.<br/>The game comes in a flat, long box with a cardboard sleeve.<br/>More samples from the cover text: &quot;...tile-laying fun from the erotic flora, ... designed and drawn in colour for pan flautists, Faun girls and creation engineers&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The game was was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Game 17. Similar games exist in Western Eritrea and Somalia.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Lahemay waladat is played on a board of two rows of of (sic) six holes. The game starts with four stones in each hole.<br/><br/>The right to start the game is decided by a hand-play referred to in Tigrinya as shekut. To begin with, the two players are holding hands as in a handshake. After breaking the hold, they would either expose the first finger, last three fingers or the open hand with fingers side by side. A player who displayed his first finger defeats one with three fingers, three fingers defeats the hand, and the hand the first finger. <br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. <br/>If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. <br/>The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole. <br/>Groups of three stones made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of three that was effected by the last stone in hand which is won by the player whose hand it was. The latter kind of capture, however, does not terminate the move. The player would continue to move until his last stone in hand is placed in an empty hole (in other words, the player gets a bonus move). <br/>The game ends when a player cannot move at his turn. The remaining stones are won by the player who could move last. <br/>The player who wins more threes wins the round. <br/>For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. If a player has one surplus stone, he cedes it to his opponent who can then together with his own surplus of three stones would open another hole. If each player has a surplus of two stones, their ownership is decided by shekut. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round. <br/>The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is to reduce his provision to less than four stones. &quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971.

The fantasy element is strongly emphasized while keeping the abstract game play of Chess. So now, you can play Chess with interesting pieces such as The Cyclops, Ninja War Lord, Succubus, and the Fairy. Expansion for this game is unlimited and at an extremely low cost as players can do everything in a homemade fashion. Unlike normal Chess, the game play is not as competitive and has a much more laid back atmosphere.<br/><br/>",

Each game takes 20 to 60 minutes to play, and features a tense, surprise-filled chase mechanic.<br/><br/>The story thus far... Fluffy has had a lot to drink and is looking to &ldquo;visit&rdquo; a tree on his way home late one night. And he&rsquo;s found his mark -- a beautiful, secluded tree right there in the back corner of the cemetery. Unbeknownst to poor Fluffy, the cemetery is filled with man-eating, er..., dog-eating zombies who just woke up for a midnight snack. Fluffy is gonna be that snack if the shambling menaces having anything to say about it. Can you help Fluffy race to freedom (and relief!) before his bladder explodes or he becomes zombie chow?<br/><br/>A serious game is at the heart of this absurd premise.<br/><br/>",

The scenarios all include armor and the armies of Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Hungary or Slovakia.<br/><br/>FE 116 Bad Neighbor Policy: A small scenario set on boards 3 and 49. The scenario features a March 1939 border action featuring a small Slovakian combined arms force attacking a small Hungarian force. This is nice tourney sized scenario.<br/><br/>FE 117 Sanok Action: This scenario is set on boards 48 and 2. This is a medium sized scenario set in the opening days of Barbarossa. The scenario features a dug in Russian force holding off a German-Slovakian force that needs to capture some pillboxes.<br/><br/>FE 118 Zaporhze Island: This is another tourney scenario set on boards 47 and 8. Some dug in Russian defenders defend a stream crossing and try to hold some buildings against a infantry armor Hungarian force.<br/><br/>FE 119 The Face of War: During the Crimea Campaign, this scenario features the Rumanians attacking some dug in Russians supported by late arriving armor. This scenario is set on boards 19 and 16. This is your typical attack counterattack situation.<br/><br/>FE 120 Nasty Business: Much of the time Axis Minor troops were performing security services. This scenario set on boards 19 and 49 features a small partisan screening force attempting to delay rear echelon Slovakian troops from attacking the buildings on board 49 from a force of partisans set up on 49. This is a medium sized scenario.<br/><br/>FE 121 Allies in a Few Days: This one is set on boards 40 and 42. This is a meaty scenario featuring a river crossing with a twist. A dug in Russian force tries to keep a Rumanian force from crossing the river but the twist is that the Rumanians have troops popping out of the ether behind their lines. This action represents a situation where the Russians had broken through the Rumanian lines and reached a river. The Rumanian 1st Armored Division was tasked with counterattacking but the Russians were still dealing with bypassed units.<br/><br/>FE 122 Slovakian Slugfest: This one is set on boards 40 and 50. The Germans are attempting to squash the Slovakian Uprising. The Germans are attacking down these boards against Slovakian armor and infantry supported by partisans. Some unique set up conditions give this good replay value.<br/><br/>FE 123 Enemies All Around: The Bulgarians show up in this scenario. A small rear echelon German unit is surrounded. The Bulgarians have to destroy their vehicles. This scenario is set on boards 24 and 50.<br/><br/>FE 124 Paulis Detachment: This is a very meaty scenario featuring the Hungarians fighting the Rumanians on boards 49 and 22. A dug in Rumanian force tries to hold off an strong Hungarian attack.<br/><br/>FE 125 Lessons Learned the Hard Way: Here is a quick playing tourney scenario set on board 48. A small German force sets up HIP and tries to ambush a Bulgarian Reconnaissance unit. This should be a good one for lots of play with a great deal of replay potential.<br/><br/>FE 126 Path to Retribution: The Yugoslavian armored brigade shows up in this one as they try to catch and destroy a German/Croatian combined arms force. This meaty scenario is set on boards 41 and 49.<br/><br/>FE 127 Junkyard Wars: This scenario features the Bulgarian Armored Regiment attacking a force of Germans. Both sides get substantial armor and this is a meaty scenario. This scenario is set on boards 16 and 48<br/><br/>",

Along the way you have to collect eight various items to aid you in your expedition, but also look out for all the things which can trip you up and tunnels that can aid you in your search.<br/><br/>Treasure chase is a whole lot of fun with just a little element of strategy thrown in and is designed for the whole family to play almost anywhere &ndash; as there is no board.

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Selus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Selus</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Selus is a generic name given to mancala games which are played on three-row boards. Apparently, the word derived from Geez selus which means &quot;three&quot;. [NB: This makes sense since Ge'ez is an Afro-Asiatic language and this is then cognate with Hebrew shelosh.]<br/> In 1972, Richard Pankhurst wrote an excellent 53-page article on Ethiopian mancala games, including games from Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia. He gave the rules of 103 games, of which 12 were three-row games or &quot;Selus&quot;.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, Selus was still played in the highlands of Eritrea and in certain regions of modern Ethiopia, notably northern Tigre, Dorz&eacute; and Kulu Konta.<br/><br/>This particular variant was reported from the city of Massawa, Eritrea. It was described as Game 13 by Pankhurst.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board has 3x6 holes. Initially there are three seeds in each hole. Each player owns the row closest to him and the three holes of the central row at his right hand.<br/><br/>Each move starts with a player emptying the contents of one of his holes that is not a wegue (&quot;wound&quot;). Then, the seeds are dropped one by one into the following holes.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an occupied hole other than a wegue, the player takes up its contents and distributes these seeds in a new lap. Let's suppose you start the move in your left corner: the seeds are first distributed in your own back row from left to right, then in your central holes from right to left, afterwards in your opponent's back row from right to left and finally in your opponent's central row from right to left (see the diagram).<br/><br/>It is not permitted to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.<br/><br/>The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole. This is called kwah, an onomatopoetic word that imitates the sound of the stone alighting on the board.<br/><br/>Wegues are created when the last seed distributed falls into a hole of three, thus making four seeds. The creator is called the owner of the wound who marks it in a distinctive way. Creating a wegue ends the move. A wegue can be created on either side of the board.<br/><br/>If the last seed of a move is dropped into a wegue, the player captures this seed and, unless the wound was empty, one of the seeds it contained. Capturing is permitted from any wegue, irrespective of the owner. The player must move again (beginning with any hole of his side which is not a wegue) if he captured from a wegue he owns, but must stop moving, if he captured from a wegue owned by his opponent.<br/><br/>Exception:<br/><br/><br/>     The two left-hand holes in a player's back row are called ayemi (&quot;eye&quot;). A player is not permitted to capture from an eye on his side, only from the opponent's side. In that case, he must move again, even if he has captured from an opponent's wegue. If the last seed fell into a wegue in your own ayemi, the move ends. <br/><br/><br/>The creation of a wound is only permitted after the original set-up has been destroyed, i.e. after the first move of a game. If, in the first move, the last seed makes four seeds, they are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players have no move left. Each player scores a point for each captured seed and a point for each seed in a wegue owned by him. The player with most points wins.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DEEP INTO THE BEKAA<br/>Final Confrontation, 1000 hrs, June 11, 1982<br/><br/>DEEP INTO THE BEKAA is a simulation depicting the first T-72 and Merkava tank battles in the final stages and hours of the Peace for Galilee Israeli offensive in 1982. These tank battles were the largest of the war and occurred as both sides sought to position themselves before the ceasefire at noon. They began at 10 a.m. as the Israeli Merkava tanks moved deep into the Bekaa Valley from their 77th battalion and the 409th Anti-tank (TOWs on Jeeps) swept far to the north until both collided with the fresh Syrian T-72 tanks of the 82nd Brigade, 3rd Armor Division.<br/>As soon as elements of the Merkava tank battalion arrived, Syrian T-72 tanks began to fire from a distance of 2500-3000 yds. The Israelis inched ever closer to the Syrian border and in desperation, Syrian Milan AT units and Gazelle TOW gunships began to appear. To the Israeli, the going was a cautious advance yet one that had to achieve the most territory before the agreed ceasefire at Noon. The battle is unique for it was the first time the new Russian T-72 tank faced off with the new Israeli Merkava, for both their debut in battle.<br/><br/>Units represent single AFVs, helicopters or infantry AT teams. Each hex measures 324 yards from side to side. Each turn represents 5 min. time.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules.<br/><br/>",

Be fast or be last in the whackiest, zappiest American Diner on the block!<br/><br/>Sunny die up, over easy, hold the fries! Take the order, serve the food and collect a tip - but its your opponent that's in control of the time with the unique, shake, rattle and roll salt pot timer. They shake - you quake, as you race to be the first player to collect three tips and win the game.&quot;<br/><br/>One of the last game to be produced by Waddingtons before they were taken over by Hasbro. The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is frantically shaken to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.<br/><br/>During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:<br/><br/>- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour<br/>- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen<br/>- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready<br/>- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip<br/><br/>The first player to collect three money tips wins.<br/><br/>The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.<br/><br/>As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.<br/><br/>",

The board is a large hexagon, with its six sections colored to match the pyramids that will go on it - consistent with Chinese Checkers.  The line of hexes that forms the border between &quot;home&quot; territories is multi-colored, matching the adjacent home territories.  What makes E special is that it uses the natural size stackability of the Icehouse pieces to enhance Chinese Checkers significantly.  For one thing, pieces must move precisely as many steps and/or jumps as they have pips (i.e. Smalls go 1; mediums, 2; larges, 3).<br/><br/>The major effect on play comes from the stackability.<br/><br/>     A piece may never - not even for a step of a move - stack directly on its own color.  (except as the result of a guard exchange)<br/>     If you can physically touch your piece (without shifting things about), you may move it, even if that means pieces atop it will take a free ride.<br/>     If you can't physically touch your piece, it is trapped.<br/>     You may never trap a piece in its home territory.  The multicolor hexes come into play here, creating a somewhat safe zone for pieces.  The center space is safe for everyone.<br/>     You may liberate a trapped piece of yours, teleport a guard (a trapping piece of yours), and violate the &quot;never stack directly on yourself&quot; rule by performing a guard exchange.<br/><br/><br/>The game is otherwise exactly like Chinese Checkers.<br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>    Icehouse Pieces<br/><br/><br/>",

Whenever a pawn ends up on a &lsquo;DVD-space&rsquo;, the DVD is started and a randomly selected question is played on the TV screen. If the question is answerd correctly, the player recieves a DVD-chip.<br/><br/>A yearly published DVD (starting whith 2007) can be used as an expansion to the base game, but can also be played as a seperate DVD-game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Fanatic Enterprises web site:<br/><br/>FANATIC PACK #1 features 12 scenarios on card stock. Each scenario has been thoroughly playtested and balanced for your enjoyment. Here are summaries of the actions depicted:<br/><br/>FE1 A Victory for Early Polish Armor: It is 1920 and the Russian army is invading the fledgling country. But the tough Polish Army is going to fight for its independence with every tool it possesses. You want tin can action? Here it is! Uses boards 46 and 11 and requires use of Axis Minor and Italian counters.<br/><br/>FE2 Dans La Bataille, Pour La Patrie: May 1940, the French have their one opportunity to crush the German assault. The successful attack through the Ardennes is moving to the sea, cutting the French in half. However, this gives the French a singular opportunity for counterattack. Can DeGaulle marshal his forces for an effective attack? Requires board 12 and 4 and the French and German counters.<br/><br/>FE3 The Border Forts: November 1940 was a very bad month for Mussolini. His attack in Greece was failing, his battle fleet was heavily damaged at Taranto and his airforce was taking a beating in England. Only in the far deserts of East Africa was he enjoying any victory. Uses boards 27 and 31 and requires Italian and British Counters.<br/><br/>FE4 Whirling Dervishes: February 1941 finds the newly formed Free French Army looking for a way to contribute to the Allied cause. Bold action is taken from the colony of Camaroon. Using odds and ends of vehicles they traverse the desert and surround an isolated Italian fort. The defenders hang on until the cavalry arrive in the form of an Auto Saharan Company. Uses boards 26 and 28 and requires Italian and French counters.<br/><br/>FE 5 Beyond the Call of Duty: its April 1941 and the Germans are preparing to invade Yugoslavia. Just before the invasion assault troops cross the border and attack the fortifications along the frontier. Requires board 11 and 18 and uses Allied Minor and German Counters.<br/><br/>FE6: Cavalry Charge at Mussino: During the crucial battle in front of Moscow in November 1941, the Soviets are boosted by the arrival of Mongolian Cavalry units from the far east. However the cavalry would pay dearly in this action as they assault the dug-in German guns in a bloody cavalry charge. Uses boards 19 and 42 and Russian and German counters.<br/><br/>FE 7 Quick and Dirty: It is the Spring of 1942 and the Japanese have released their own form of Blitzkrieg covering much of the globe with their power. March finds them invading Java and in this opening skirmish a Japanese reconnaissance patrol races a Dutch force to capture a bridge. Uses Board 47 and Japanese and Allied Minor counters.<br/><br/>FE 8 Soebang Serenade: The only major armor clash of the Dutch East Indies Campaign occurred at Soebang on March 2, 1942. The counterattacking Dutch run into Japanese forces consolidating their control near the Soebang airfield and a melee ensues. Uses boards 24, 37 and 38 and uses Japanese and Allied Minor counters.<br/><br/>FE 9: Blackforce Counterattack: British and Japanese tangle in this PTO action. British armor and infantry slug it out as the Japanese try to protect their bridgehead. Uses boards 38 and 40 and British and Japanese counters.<br/><br/>FE 10: An Abandoned Army: The surrender of Allied forces on Java did not end the fighting in the Dutch East Indies. A desperate force of Dutch and native troops struggles to hang together on the island of Sumatra. The Japanese are poised to crush them along with the help of the locals. An Urban Guerrilla for the PTO with partisan units popping out of nowhere to attack the Dutch. Uses board 32 and Japanese and Allied Minor units along with partisan counters.<br/><br/>FE11: Italian Winter: The German SS Police force was a fearsome and tough group. This action covers a battle between the SS Police force using captured T-34's against a dug in Italian partisan force with some tricks of their own. Uses board 50 along with Italian, German and Russian counters.<br/><br/>FE 12: Once More into the Breach: Late in the war the Germans were desperate. Attacked from all sides they threw what they could at the tidal wave of Russians attacking from everywhere. This action covers a rescue operation as the SS try to reach a surround group of SS before they can be annihilated<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Advanced Squad Leader<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card Bowl reproduces the game of football using standard playing cards.<br/><br/>The game balances strategy and chance, and almost anything that happens in a real football game can happen in Card Bowl, including runs, passes, sacks, fumbles, interceptions, punts, field goals, etc.<br/><br/>Special teams plays<br/><br/>Cards representing different values are simply drawn in a certain order, and modifiers applied to determine results (e.g. spot where kickoff is received and yardage returned).<br/><br/>Scrimmage plays - Version 1 (Complex)<br/><br/>Each player is dealt eleven cards representing players, and spreads them out on the table in formation, face down. The cards are then moved and turned over in a generally specified manner and order, in alternating turns, which represents the development of the play. In addition, at certain points of action, cards are turned over from the remaining deck, which represent the element of chance and the unanticipated dynamics of the game.<br/><br/>The scrimmage play evolves around match-ups between offensive and defensive cards, with the values and modifiers determining the outcome. Multiple cards on each side plus drawn cards may be involved in one match-up.<br/><br/>At some point during one of its turns, the offensive player executes a play (e.g. hands off the ball, throws a pass). Cards from each hand that are directly involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The scrimmage plays can actually replicate the flow and dynamics of a real play.<br/><br/>The game does require a lot of addition, so being able to add quickly is also helpful.<br/><br/>Scrimmage plays - Version 2 (Simplified)<br/><br/>Each team has its own deck of cards (of course team playing cards would be ideal). A third deck is used as the neutral Draw Deck. For each play from scrimmage, each player selects four cards from his own deck. After each play, these four cards are placed in that player's used card pile, and can't be used again until the deck is exhausted. Thus the entire deck is used in 13 plays, then each player starts over with the whole deck.<br/><br/>For each play, each player places four cards from his deck face down representing players. The cards are all turned face up, and the offense chooses which card/player the play goes to based on the type of play he wants to run and the most advantageous matchup. Additional cards are then drawn from the Draw Deck and added to each player's side of the matchup. Cards involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome. Fumbles, sacks, incomplete passes and interceptions can occur.<br/><br/>For complete instructions, play diagrams and change history, see Web Links.<br/><br/>",

These extra-large sized dice can be useful for stimulating many word and spelling games.<br/><br/>This guide is not intended to be a comprehensive set of notes for the dice, but rather an offering of a variety of games and activities which are sure to generate many more ideas by both you and your students.<br/><br/>The set consists of 12 dice.  Two dice have only vowels printed on the six sides.  The other ten dice have a combination of consonants, vowels and blends printed on the six sides.  The letters are arranged on the die with the more commonly used letters appearing most often.  Following is a chart indicating how often each letter or blend appears in the set.&quot;<br/><br/>a-4 <br/>b-2 <br/>c-2 <br/>ch-2<br/>ck-2<br/>d-2 <br/>e-6<br/>f-2<br/>g-2<br/>h-2<br/>i-2<br/>j-2<br/>k-2<br/>l-2<br/>m-2<br/>n-3<br/>o-4<br/>p-2<br/>qu-2<br/>r-4<br/>s-2<br/>sh-2<br/>t-2<br/>th-2<br/>u-3<br/>v-2<br/>w-2<br/>x-2<br/>y-2<br/>z-2<br/><br/>Games suggested in the instructions:<br/>Make A Word (3 to 5 players)<br/>Write A Word (4 to 5 players)<br/>Nonsense Words or Not? (2 players)<br/>What's the Word? (4 to 5 players)<br/>along with other suggested games<br/><br/>Interesting is the fact that the same letter has different values on different dice.  For example, the letter &quot;a&quot; has a value of 1, on the dice with all vowels (a,e,e,i,o,u) but the same letter &quot;a&quot; has a value of 3, on a mixed die with vowels and consonants (a,l,n,o,p,r).  Also, there are five blends:  ch (worth 5), ck (worth 6), qu (worth 6), sh (worth 5), and th (worth 5).<br/><br/>",

Well... Your wishes have come true.  With The Wild Wigout Comix Gameboards!<br/><br/>Land o' Sugar was one of seven crazy art boardgames produced by Scairy Hairy Toys, San Fransisco in the early to mid-1990s.  Each was created by a local underground artist and each was handmade, silk-screened and extremely limited.<br/><br/>Land o' Sugar takes the player into the wonderful world of sugar.  The game requires one pound of hard round candies to play.  It came with a brightly colored silk-screened boardgame with a pinwheel pixie spinner and three mutant sugar eating game pieces. The object of the game was to get to the end without passing out from an over-indulgence of sugar or throwing up.  The game was created by illustrator David Fremont best known for his strange comics and silk-screened concert posters.<br/><br/>",

Board Game for 2-7 players.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is played on a 10x10 grid using tiles and cubes. Also required for play are Stock cards, paper money (or any reasonable substitute), and a scoring track. The board is randomly filled with tiles at the start of the game.<br/><br/>The game lasts for five rounds. During each round there are seven turns. Each turn starts with the players bidding for control of a single share of stock from one of the seven companies. The player winning the bid operates the company for that round (represented by placing cubes on the board). These operations determine the value of the company, which in turn determines the amount of money paid as dividends to the stockholders for that company.<br/><br/>Once seven turns have been played, one for each company, the round ends and dividends are paid to stockholders. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts a period with coins valued 5 (x1), 2 (x5), and 1 (x10). Each period consists of several duels. In a duel, the player who reveals the highest value of coins in their hand wins the duel and moves the puck down the ice (the game board). However, if they reveal at least 3 coins more than their opponent, they lose the duel and the other player gets to move the puck instead.  If a player manages to move the puck off of the ice, they score a goal. If one player has no more coins after a duel, the period ends, but first, the opponent may now move the puck according to the number of their remaining coins. The game ends after three periods have been played and the player who scored the most goals wins.<br/><br/>Originally published as Spielbox Edition No.2 in Spielbox issue 2/1993.<br/><br/>",

A longer version can be played with fourteen cards and seven tricks, using 2-10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18.

All pieces move and capture as queens from Western Chess. At the start the tanks are located on the 14 dark green and orange spaces, respective to the green and orange tanks. There are also 20 tree spaces on the board that tanks may not enter or pass through.<br/><br/>The objective is to enter the opponent's base with as many tanks as possible, scoring two points per tank. Any other surviving tanks not in the far base also score one point for the player. If your general stands in the corner where the enemy general started you score an additional point (3 for that tank). The game immediately ends when one side has moved his final remaining tank into the enemy base.<br/><br/>",

The other player plays the white pieces and is called White. In Reviser the players play different roles. One player will play the 'Setter,' the other will play the 'Jumper.' Setter and Jumper keep their role during the whole game. At his turn, the Setter places one of his pieces on the board. That piece must be in line with one of his pieces so that one or more opponents pieces are between them (without any empty fields between them). These opponents pieces are flipped. This is the same mechanism as in Reversi. At his turn the Jumper must jump with one of his pieces (on the board) over any number of his opponents pieces in a straight line. The opponents pieces he jumped over are flipped. He may continue to jump with that piece if possible. He must not jump over his own pieces or over empty fields.<br/><br/>The game ends if one player is unable to make a legal move. The player with the greater number of his pieces on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>An entry into the About.com: 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition.<br/><br/>",

The grid is variable, created by placing black tiles on the board before the game.<br/><br/>Each letter tile has 3-5 letters on each side (in the players' colors), only one of which is used when forming a word. Once a tile is placed, any of the letters can be used in forming a crossing word. Some of the letters (marked with dots) cause the tile to go to the opposing player (and cost points) - otherwise all tiles in the word played are turned to the player's side.<br/><br/>It is a requirement to play in the row or column (that has at least one empty space) with the greatest number of tiles. It is not required to form words in the other direction, as it is in Scrabble, but it is possible to do so to capture more tiles.<br/><br/>The object is mainly to have the most tiles on the board in your color at the end of the game, although points can be scored in other ways (negative for using dotted letters, positive for placing identical tiles next to each other).<br/><br/>While the rules say that the game can be played by more than two players, in teams, no guidance is provided on how to do so.<br/><br/>",

In &quot;Słony okup&quot; players take on a role of managers of shady companies. On one hand they are hired by shipowners as negotiators trying to convince pirate groups to release hijacked tankers. On the other hand they are also in the pirate businesses themselves by controlling various bands that capture defenseless ships for ransom. But good days for these enterprises are coming to an end as more and more ships are taking longer routes avoiding dangerous Somalia's shores. Only if your company  will convince the public of being the most successful in freeing hijacked ships you can count on being chosen as ONZ official ship negotiator providing you with endless profit possibility. But beware, competition is not going to give up easily ... more and more ships are being captured.<br/><br/>&quot;Słony okup&quot; is an bidding board game in which during a round one player takes on a role of Pirate and the other players roles of negotiators. Negotiators bid for the possibility to free the ship using sum of three resources available in the game: money, prestige points and troops (anti terrorists). Winner of the bidding round presents his offer to a Pirate. He can either accept the offer gaining all the money proposed (that later he or she can use to free ships from other players) or he can rise the price by using troops (acting as pirates this time). If ship is freed negotiator gets prestige points otherwise the ships stays on a board and becomes more valuable as the public pressure rises. Now the next player becomes a Pirate. The winner is a player with most prestige points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game won the contest for best prototype on Pionek (Polish board game convention)<br/><br/>",

Cut out the three colored triangles.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>The first player chooses a triangle, and rolls the dice (if you have one die, roll &quot;light&quot; and then &quot;dark&quot;). Find the number from your light roll across the top of the board, and the number from your dark roll down the left side of the board. The nine letters in the square where they meet are your choices for your starting letter.<br/><br/>Place one corner of your triangle on one of the letters in your starting square. Rotate the triangle around so that its second corner touches a letter. Using that letter as a pivot point, rotate your triangle around the next letter, and so on, forming a word. The word is scored as follows:<br/><br/>2 letter words = 4 points<br/>3 letter words = 9 points<br/>4 letter words = 16 points<br/>5 letter words = 25 points<br/>6 letter words = 36 points<br/>[etc.]<br/><br/>The second player rolls the dice (or die) and begins their word with a letter in the corresponding square.<br/><br/>If a player cannot make a word of at least two letters, they pass, and their score for that round is zero.<br/><br/>The person with the most points after 10 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>Created by indigopotter for Reprint's contest, February 2009.<br/><br/>",

If the color is black, player one (black player) gets to remove the opposing piece, and vice-versa. If the two pieces belong to the same player, the player has the option of removing one or none of his two pieces.<br/><br/>The objective is to be the first player to move one of your pieces across to the opposite edge.

Capturing Al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden and the mastermind of numerous terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East since the 1990s, is the military's highest priority. On 7 November, Coalition forces surround the city and U.S. Marines amass just to the north for the attack. Most of the civilians have fled the impending battle; amidst the buildings of the city await an estimated 3000 Islamic insurgents of Mujahideen Shura and Al-Qaeda Iraq. Operation Phantom Fury is about to begin.<br/><br/>Fallujah is a solitaire wargame pitting U.S. Marines, U.S. Army &amp; Iraqi special forces against insurgents. Can you clear the city of Fallujah of entrenched insurgents with minimal losses, or will you be forced to give up your field command in a stunning defeat? Play this highly replayable squad/platoon game using a new solitaire game system and find out!<br/><br/>Fallujah is designed by Mark Kalina, producer of Silent War. Easily playable in an afternoon, play time ranges from 2 hours for a short scenario to 3&frac12; for the full campaign. Complexity is medium (about 5/10).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1812 is a simple, card-driven game of the Anglo-American conflict that was fought from 1812 to 1815. It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Great Britain. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Canadian territory and to compel Britain to sue for peace, while the British player attempts to do exactly the same against the United States, perhaps with the aid of some Native American allies. The fledgling United States are making a huge gamble. Can they drive the British from Canada and unify North America, or will the Empire strike back and put the upstarts in their place and end their dreams of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;?<br/>  Prominent military leaders, army strength points, Native American forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, British and U.S. forces, though sorely mismatched in terms of professionalism and leadership, fought each other to a stalemate. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the either might have been able to achieve a decisive victory that would have changed the shape of the North American continent. <br/> Played on an authentic early-19th-century map of the United States and Canada, 1812 includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).<br/><br/>",

You then guide the plastic mice with a magnetic stick from under the board, to push dice into your area. Once all the dice are claimed, you total up the score of the dice to determine who wins.  The game can also be played in rounds.<br/><br/>The copy I found from thrifting says it was made in Western Germany, so it was made before pre-unification, but I didn't see a copyright, but most likely mid-80s.<br/><br/>",

You may not undo the previous move (i.e. may not remove a stone placed in the previous turn or replace a stone removed in the previous turn).<br/><br/>The reversible tiles are flipped over if entirely surrounded by the opposite colour horizontally and vertically. Two tiles can be flipped by using only one stone, others using 2, most need 3.<br/><br/>The game ends either when all but one square is filled by either reversible tiles or stones OR when all but one pair of tiles has been claimed.<br/><br/>The winner is the person who claimed the most pairs of tiles.<br/><br/>",

Each player then shuffles the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>Play: Players take turns moving one of their pieces in a straight unimpeded line, orthogonally or diagonally, a distance not exceeding the piece's visible number. The piece may land on an enemy piece of less or equal visible value to capture it by replacement, following which the capturing pieces is turned around.<br/><br/>Goal: A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's royal pieces, which are those pieces containing the highest number 4.<br/><br/>Curio can be played on Richard Rognlie's Play By Mail server - rules here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/curio.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/curio.html</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This auto racing simulation replay game comes with two versions, one for Indy Cars and one for NASCAR.  2009 edition comes with real-life drivers and stats based on 2008 season.  Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.<br/><br/>From the Downey Games website:<br/><br/>&quot;Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.<br/><br/>With Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.<br/><br/>In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.<br/><br/>All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.<br/><br/>Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.<br/><br/>And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!<br/><br/>Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!<br/><br/>Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &ldquo;game parts&rdquo; to buy.<br/><br/>The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is a 1937 Disney animated film based on &quot;Snow White,&quot; a German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. The film was Disney's first full-length animated feature film, and the first color, animated film in motion picture history. It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise. Products introduced in 1937 included &quot;The Game of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; from Milton Bradley Company. A complicated game with several different playing pieces and multiple types of rules, the game attempts to mimic the plot of the movie. The winning player's Snow White playing piece triumphs at the end with a kiss from the handsome prince.<br/><br/>Description courtesy of thestrong.org (Creative Commons, BY-NC-ND)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game Triad was self-published by Sid Sackson in 1957 and was the third game &quot;published&quot; by him chronologically. Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4&quot;x2&quot; white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.<br/><br/>Triad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.<br/><br/>In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.<br/><br/>",

The elf had killed many of the invading savages this day, but he knew the battle was already lost, there being just too many of the warriors of the northern wastes to possibly win the day. Turning at a new noise, the elf's heart rose in pride, for walking silently out of the brush to his right came a wood singer, one of the most powerful mages in the world. With her aid, and her magic, the day could still be won.<br/><br/>This is Steal and Glory, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. A fast paced skirmish game of battle, skill and guts, Steel and Glory allows players to field small bands of warriors, who will then fight bloody engagements. Each set within the system will cover two different forces, and also offer new battle tiles, new abilities and new excitement. So don't wait, gather your warriors to you and fight for the glory of your chosen lord<br/><br/>This second set covers the forces of the elven courts and the savage barbarians forces of chaos.

Its goal is to recreate the insane action stunts of movies like The Road Warrior and Death Race: 2000 using 1/64 scale toy cars (Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars, most commonly). Each car will be fully and easily customizable without complicated charts or difficult calculations. <br/>Each player controls one car, and that car has a point value based on its attributes. At the same time, there are cards that depict various optional equipment you can install on your car. The equipment has a point cost as well. We tried to keep the basic rules pretty simple and streamlined, while the equipment cards introduce new levels of complexity. This aspect is somewhat similar to a collectible card game.<br/><br/>The alpha rules can be download from here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.robotviking.com/2009/06/project-death-race-open-alpha-playtest-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.robotviking.com/2009/06/project-death-race-open-a...</a><br/><br/>",

In short, pure unbridled greed.<br/><br/>This game allows you to enter the mayhem as a speculator with immense influence in the affairs of major United States banks heavily invested in real estate throughout the country.  Your aim is to invest in these regional banks and build them up.  If the banks get large enough, you begin to score points for your efforts.  However, as the game wears on, events in the world threaten your more ambitious investments and other major financiers may also decide to make risky investments that run counter to your interests.  Likewise, it is also possible for the end of the bubble to never come in this game - and the same investments that can bring about your own downfall may very well make you a very rich person indeed.<br/><br/>The game takes place over four turns or quarters.

Then shuffle the Alamo deck and place it face down in the middle of the table.  The game play consists of 5 main steps per round, which are similar to the steps in a Texas Hold 'em game.<br/><br/>",

The other side controls the hordes of henchmen out to get the Damsel. While both work in entirely different ways, both offer many paths to victory, it's simply up to your skill, tactics, and cunning to determine the victor.<br/><br/>Damsel comes with four beautiful hex boards, each with their own sets of obstacles and tactical advantages. While the Craftsmen toil away building clockwork towers to protect the Damsel, the Henchmen horde approaches from all four sides.<br/><br/>For the Henchmen, it's all about numbers and diversity; getting the right type of unit to the right location at the right time with the right amount of reinforcement. The Henchmen have four different types of units, the rapid moving Assassin, the agile Horseman, the tough Knight, and the destructive Sappers.<br/><br/>For the Craftsmen, it's all about skillful placement and upgrades of towers. The Craftsmen get to place the Damsel anywhere on the board that they choose. They can place towers anywhere they wish as well, as long as they aren't in range of other towers or the Damsel.<br/><br/>This game involves only the tiniest bit of luck. Most of the time it is all about tactics and strategy. Do you have what it takes to protect the Damsel? Or is your soul black like that of the Henchmen out to kill her?<br/><br/>",

Using custom pewter tokens, players participate in one of twelve different Fair professions. As players make their way around the Fairgrounds, they can increase (or decrease) their worth by buying food or merchandise, winning contests and collecting money from ATMs. Strategy cards add interaction between players as opposing parties are forced to pay expenses or share winnings. The player with the highest value when they retire for the night in the campgrounds wins.<br/><br/>Produced and sold exclusively by the Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation, the proceeds contribute to ongoing efforts to renovate and preserve our historic Iowa State Fairgrounds. The game allows Fair lovers to help support renovations while enjoying the Fair year-round with family and friends!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Puzzling Pyramid, each player builds a maze on the side of a pyramid for another to navigate, sight unseen. They then race each other to the top, turn by turn.<br/><br/>Four triangular pyramid faces sit atop a base. On the reverse of a player's pyramid face, you build a maze by placing a number of baffles between posts (at least one route must be provided, and handicapping can be achieved by limiting a player's number of baffles). The pyramid is then rotated a quarter turn so that each player faces a different side of the pyramid. On a player's turn, you use a magnetic wand on the surface to move a steel ball up through the maze on the back, toward the top of the pyramid. If the ball encounters a baffle, it's separated from the wand and drops to the bottom of the base. If a player is unsuccessful, the turn passes until on a subsequent turn someone successfully navigates to the top.<br/><br/>",

The players are wanderers; drivers of cars that have been modified to help them endure the perils &ldquo;out there&rdquo; as they travel the highways between fortified villages and settlements.<br/><br/>The game can be played by one or more players. Ideally, the game is intended to be played by &ldquo;more&rdquo; players but works fine as a solo game. In a multi-player game, the individuals can work together, or against each, or as teams if they have enough players.<br/><br/>The basic component is a standard deck of 52 cards, a token to show the drivers movement across the cards, and two 1d6 to keep track of the drivers two stats: health/speed.<br/><br/>Each player is trying to get his driver across a wasteland of broken roads, and marauding bandits.  The cards themselves are used as the road, modifiers during movement, and combat against marauders or other players.<br/><br/>The card suite and face value will determine the type and strength of encounters the driver will face along the road,  The driver will in turn use their hand of cards to control the speed of their vehicle as well as the strength of their attack and defense.   During a co-op game, the drivers can use their cards to help friendly drivers fight off marauders or control their driving reactions.<br/><br/><br/>The game was designed as part of the Traditional Card Game design contest.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1</a><br/><br/>",

It could be played using all cards except the king in a regular deck, with the ace as 1, and using diamonds as gold.<br/><br/>The player with the 7 of gold plays first.  Players take turns (moving clockwise around the table) placing cards.  You can play a card one up or one down from any cards currently on the table (played on the 7 but leaving all cards visible), or you can play a 7 from a different suit to start another escalera (staircase) in a new pile.  If you can play, you must, otherwise you pass.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to play all of your cards.  At the end of each game, players with cards left in their hands receive 1 point per card.  When a player receives 15 points, that player is out of the game.  Once it is down to 2 players, the player with the fewest points wins (as the game is no fun with only 2 players, since you know what cards the opponent has).<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to control routes to recycling centers, where they exchange their plastic &quot;clunker&quot; cars for aluminum ones.  This game was created by a German auto parts manufacturer to keep his metal milling machines in use during an economic downturn.<br/><br/>Players drive around the board in their old cars. When they pass certain squares, they get money from the bank. When they have enough money, they can go to the car dealer in the center of the game board to exchange their old car for a new one, then drive home with it, kicking out other old cars on the way. When a player has no more old cars and has brought all the new ones home, the game ends and the richest player (in cars and money) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

As it is mentioned in the title of the game, the players manipulate triangles trying to make the most extended row with their colour. Each turn the choices are simple : put a piece in the axis from the common reserve or move one already in play. The efficiency of this game comes from the fact that the material channels the rules : if a triangle can&rsquo;t pass over another one then the move is forbidden.<br/>The accessibility of the rules allows everyone to plunge into a surprising game in which the material allies aesthetic and handling pleasure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From The Game Crafter's website:<br/><br/>&quot;MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries. You may play against each other, or cooperatively against the evil dictator Koen, and you may play individually or as teams. Either way, the goal is the same, to take control of the war torn tropical island of Tenagra.<br/><br/>Tenagra is a wealthy country full of industries. Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.<br/><br/>There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.<br/><br/>MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.<br/><br/>Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts. And don't forget that you can play as teams or individuals both in death-match and cooperatively. All of these variables ensure that you'll have endless amounts of fun playing MERC.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Road hazard tiles are used to hinder the movement of opponents, but once collected they can be redeemed later in the game for additional actions.<br/><br/>Car movement is determined by the arrangement of the road tiles.  Cars move from one traffic light or check point to the next via curved and straight roads.<br/><br/>If a car becomes trapped or if a road will cause a car to run into the wall, game mechanics allows a player to rotate a road tile or remove a road tile to be replaced by a more suitable tile in a later turn.<br/><br/>The first player to traverse the growing maze through both check points and across the finish line is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzertales: World Tank Division II (WTD II) is the sequel to WTD I.  Published in Japan and written in Japanese, it is an area movement wargame focused on armored combat in 1944-45.<br/><br/>The game consists of three maps (two sheets printed front and back), cardboard counters, a rulebook and four unpainted PVC tanks (Tiger II, Panther, Hetzer and StuG IIIG).  The maps depict the Normandy beaches, Remagen and Budapest.  Counters depict armored vehicles for Germany, U.K., U.S.A., and U.S.S.R.<br/><br/>The game is a light wargame centered around the abstract depiction of armored combat in Europe late in the war.  Obviously the intent of the game designers is for the players to equip themselves with World Tank Museum forces to use on the maps; the first four vehicles (all German) are a means to jump-start these forces.  As these are generally insufficient, the included cardboard counters, which carry the attack strength, defense strength, movement value, etc., for the forces, can be used.<br/><br/>WTD II is a successor to WTD I, but is not exactly an expansion.  Some minor changes to the forces have been made- e.g., point values for the units (which are used to build armies in design-your-own scenarios) have been adjusted.  However, several new factors are introduced, such as the inclusion of infantry, anti-tank guns, armored personnel carriers, and rules for indirect fire/air strikes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>In Conceptualize This! you're approached by two manufacturers of final products. They both want to launch a new product into the market, for which they need the same intermediate product. Step by step you conceptualize this intermediate product by collecting the right cards and placing them on the board. Be careful though, because every player is approached by different manufacturers and will do everything to get control over the intermediate product, which appears on the board.<br/><br/>Explanation<br/><br/>Conceptualize This! is a card game in which every player gets a unique target. During the game you try to collect cards which &quot;connect&quot; to each other in a dominos like way. The set of cards you collect results in a concept of the intermediate product, build up out of different components that need each other to function. The board supports the concept of tile (card) placement in such a way that the connections between the cards are made visible. The game is won by the player who completes his / her concept of the intermediate product on the board.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>The development on this board game started as an element of a Bachelor thesis. For the research in this thesis the board game was meant to educate people on how to model UML activity diagrams (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of actions are modelled) in a fast and easy way. During the creation of the board game the accent moved to a system diagram (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of components are modelled) which gave more freedom in the creation of cards. Because the concepts used in both modelling languages are the same, people should still be able to create an activity diagram after playing the game.<br/><br/>At first the game seemed to have a very high luck rate, but closer to completion the game turned out to be tactical as well. Due to this development a few extra rules were included which made the game even more tactical and increased the replay value.<br/><br/>The research on the Bachelor thesis for which this board game is created is still in progress. The board game itself however is completed and only needs to be stylised. If a publisher can be found the game will be published in the future. Currently both Dutch and English versions can be previewed by publishers.<br/><br/>",

In the dark depths of the forests and swamps of this realm, horrible beasts and dragons lurked, often terrorizing the helpless farmers and village dwellers of the kingdom. In order to make an end to the terror and rid the country from the bestial scourge, the king summoned the bravest and most fearless heroes from all four corners of the country. He sent them on a noble quest to free the country of all dragons and foul beasts, to make the kingdom a safe place to live in.<br/>Unfathomable peril, but also treasure, gold and glory await the fearless Dragonslayers!<br/> The goal of the game is to slay all monsters without being killed. You can either play solo or two players. If you play two players, the player who slew the most monsters in the end wins. If you play solo, you can set a high score in your first game which you can try to beat in further games by trying to beat the game in as few turns as possible while amassing a maximum of gold!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Diamond Mine is a game of diamond hunting for 2 or 4 players, utilizing Opaque pieces for hidden information, simultaneous programmed movement, and color dependency for scoring as notable mechanics. Players will set up the board by taking turns placing a large opaque piece that has been randomly filled with a medium and small colored piece onto the chess board. The players having placed the hidden information stashes on the board will then each turn place a card facedown on the table to represent how many spaces they would like to move. All players reveal this number simultaneously and may move any direction at that point but they MUST move that many spaces. If they cannot move that many spaces (due to board edges or exhausted veins or other players) they may not move at all. Players move to 'veins' and search for colored diamonds. Diamonds of their own color will be worth extra points at the end of the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Diamond is an Icehouse game designed by Sam Zitin.<br/><br/>To play, players will need 6 Icehouse stashes (2 of which must be opaque), a chessboard, three cards designating 1, 2, or 3, and an opaque bag or hat from which to blindly draw pieces.<br/><br/>Diamond Mine placed 4th in the Spring 2009 Icehouse Games Design Competition.<br/><br/>Diamond Mine was redeveloped into Iceminers.<br/><br/>",

Who is against him?<br/><br/>Board game created for the Town Hall of Oeiras. It&rsquo;s a board game for 2 to 8 players, from 8 years old ahead. Each player takes a roll of a noble family who is going to cooperate with the Marquis of Pombal, or will try to finish for once with his power. The King Jos&eacute; I, the Marquis of Pombal, the Jesuits and the court, bound by all the intrigue, take part in this board game.<br/><br/>The action occurs in the recreation farm in Oeiras, property of the Marquis of Pombal, extending from the palace to the agricultural area. It&rsquo;s been tried to mark out the most interesting and important areas of the farm (the waterfalls, the gardens, etc), showing this valuable heritage in the village of Oeiras. Focusing a game about the Marquis in this village puts in evidence the historical significance that this place has in the life of this important character of Portugal&rsquo;s history<br/><br/>",

The game consists of several &quot;trials&quot; that take place. There is a narrator who is the judge of these trials. He runs the trials but must remain impartial. Every trial ends either with everyone going to sleep (mistrial) or with an execution. The Innocents are trying to convict the Guilty criminals while the criminals are trying to remain hidden and get Innocents executed. Also, one or two of the Guilty criminals are murderers who kill a citizen after every trial while everyone sleeps.<br/><br/>The game centers on someone who is the Detective trying to hunt down all of the Guilty before they murder everyone. If the Guilty try to kill the Detective, the final round of the game commences. The citizens may still vote to convict criminals, but the Detective has his trusty sidearm and can shoot citizens at will! But he must be careful, if he kills any Innocent player the game is over and the guilty win! There are also several roles to help the Innocent (heroes, lawyers, vigilantes...etc.) and the Guilty (serial killers, pyromaniacs, dirty cops...etc.). All roles are hidden, so make sure you don't trust your friends, they might be trying to get you killed!<br/><br/>Gameplay: Detective is a role playing/negotiation/strategy game similar to Mafia/Werewolf. It is slightly more complicated and advanced, and should probably be played by people who have experience with those games. You are dealt a role telling you your powers and which side you are on. You must then try to figure out who is on the opposing side and get them executed, and who is on your side so that you may protect them. Revealing your role card is not allowed, but feel free to lie and deceive your way to winning.<br/><br/>Components: All that you absolutely must have is the deck of cards to play (which can be found here). But it is strongly recommended that you play this game with a loaded cap gun for added tension and theme. Dark lighting and theme music will also enhance the experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Polish May Coup d'&Eacute;tat on May 12-15, 1926 (Polish: &quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; or &quot;zamach majowy&quot;) is one of the least known events of the 20th century. Even so, its outcome was very important for the whole world, as it settled the overall course of Poland until 1939, including opposition both to the Third Reich, as well as USRR.<br/><br/>What started as an officers' demonstration led by First Marshall J&oacute;zef Piłsudski against the unpopular center-right government rapidly expanded into an unsuccesful coup d'&eacute;tat and ended as a short, albeit intensive quasi-revolutionary civil war. It put Poland at the brink of revolution and annihilation.<br/><br/>It is a rare example of an unsuccessful coup followed by a successful civil war.<br/><br/>&quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; had a very special climate. At the beginning it was partly a traditional &quot;szlachta&quot; foray (polish: &quot;zajazd&quot;), partly a political demonstration, with all of the 18th century &quot;honorable war&quot; traditions (including dueling officers and shooting above opponents' heads).<br/><br/>Unfortunately in a few days it fall into an abyss of bloody total civil war, with mass use in the center of Warsaw of tanks, armored trains, heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; with general strike, assassinating, sniping, and execution of prisoners as well as masses of civilian combatants, on both sides. It was really close to use of gas warfare.<br/><br/>The game &quot;Maj 1926&quot; (name may change) depicts those days in an innovative way: a card-driven euro-wargame.<br/><br/>Occupying areas in Warsaw (like the Citadel, telephone center, Prime Minister chancellery, Ministry of Railroad, Ministry of Defense, hospitals, supply depots; also railroad, power, gas and water stations) brings advantages (bonuses to combat, movement, logistics, politics, and many more, including variable phase order). Usually it is necessary to leave a unit to fully exploit such areas (a kind of worker placement).<br/><br/>Oddities of this conflict (such as a lack of fog of war, fluent dynamics of aggression, a big influence of politics over the course of battle) as well as all &quot;what-if&quot;s (like foreign intervention) are well represented in the mechanisms.<br/><br/>If you want to make successful coup in Poland (or defend the legal government) and you know the Polish language, it is a game for you.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the author doesn't anticipate an international version (other than translating the manual and all cards into a BGG file), as &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; is a kind of event understandable only by Poles.<br/><br/>Polish site about this game:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.strategie.net.pl/viewforum.php?f=161&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.strategie.net.pl/viewforum.php?f=161&amp</a>;sid=0239f37ae2c3e623e339d6505c118971<br/><br/>Photos about this game:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://umpapa.multiply.com/photos/album/26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://umpapa.multiply.com/photos/album/26</a>#<br/><br/>The game was to be published in 2011, on the 85th anniversary of &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot;.

Each square is marked at one of the  corners to help identify related squares during a complex move.<br/><br/>The game begins in a unique way: <br/>The players agree on how many pawns each side will have.  An empty board is placed between the players and the pawns are placed in front of the players, but not on the board.  Black begins by entering one of his pawns on any square except one of the  &ldquo;border squares&rdquo; (the squares along the edges of the board).  Then White enters a pawn, no more than one square away from Black's, and not on a border square.  The players continue to take turns, either entering a pawn or moving one that is already on the board.<br/><br/>How the pawns move:<br/>An isolated pawn cannot move &ndash; it's frozen (hence the name of the game).  A pawn that is not frozen has the potential to make a jumping or non-jumping move in any direction.  The jump can be over allied as well as opposing pawns.<br/><br/>When an opponent's pawn is jumped over, it's removed from the board.  If the player is not at &ldquo;stage 2,&rdquo; that pawn is returned to the opponent to be reentered.  If the player has reached stage 2, that pawn is permanently captured.<br/><br/>The last player able to move wins.<br/><br/>The game set has a high quality vinyl roll-up board,  12 black pawns and 12 natural wood colored pawns (molded from material that is 40% recycled wood), and the instruction booklet which includes an explanation of Freeze notation and 12 short sample games, illustrating the rules and touching on the strategy and tactics.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.frezcogames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.frezcogames.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Rail Road Building Theme. Pen and Paper Game: No cards or dice needed. This is a modified PnP version of Railroad Dispatch USA.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is played on a map of the United States marked with cities. The players build rail connections by drawing lines between the cities. Building rail lines is one of the means of acquiring Victory Points. Additional Victory Points are scored when the player duplicates the circuit covered by historical rail lines.<br/><br/>The game adds additional flavor to this basic framework through the Income, Research, and Stock Points tracked for each player's railway. A series of Events can affect these point values as well, based on historical events that influenced nineteenth rail travel in the United States.<br/><br/>The Income, Research, and Stock Point values also serve to increase a player's Victory Point total. Victory Points can also be scored based on the type of commodities produced in the cities connected to a player's rail lines.<br/><br/>Materials required for play: Two pens with different colored ink, a coin, a printout of the game map, and a copy of the scoring tables.<br/><br/>",

The Soviet leadership surrendered to the political and economic realities they faced. Events could have been different. Last Battle for Germany is a simulation of a military climax of the Cold War. The game is played against a backdrop of unknown political and military events over which the players have no control, but to which they must react. Players maneuver their divisions, brigade and regiments across a map with 15 kms per hex during turns representing 48 hour. An innovative game system represents each subordinate commander's headquarters and support assets. An integrated air game completes this definitive simulation of a Warsaw Pact-NATO conflict.<br/><br/>",

Ship units represent individual ships and aircraft units represent two to four aircraft.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>&quot;November 1941. War clouds are gathering in the Pacific.  Tensions have been increasing between Japan and the US since Japan&rsquo;s invasion of China in 1931.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Anticipating hostilities, the Imperial Japanese Navy has planned a surprise attack against US forces at Pearl Harbor, HI.  US intelligence has intercepted coded Japanese messages and has concluded that an attack is likely somewhere in the Pacific, most likely in the Philippines, between December 1st and 10th.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As a precaution, the Alert Status on the Hawaiian island of Oahu has been raised from peacetime Alert Level 0 to Alert Level 1.  Limited resources are available to selectively increase the Alert Level to 2 or 3, but extended increases in alert levels will unnecessarily tire men and consume limited supplies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora! is a game played in two parts - a strategic planning phase followed by a tactical attack phase. US players must decide how to employ limited forces in and around Pearl Harbor over the 10 day vulnerability period. Japanese players must select the timing, direction, and composition of the attack in order to inflict enough damage to prevent the US Pacific Fleet from interfering with future Japanese war plans in Southeast Asia.&quot;<br/><br/>The game map is an abstracted depiction of the battle area divided into four quadrants, allowing for simultaneous games to be played in each quadrant by different groups of players. The areas depicted on the map are divided into concentric zones - Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Oahu, and the Pacific Ocean. The map also specifies the position of naval installations, airfields, and anti-aircraft batteries.<br/><br/>",

None of them made it out alive.&quot;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.<br/><br/>&quot;Since this is a one-sided battle the goal isn't simply to win. Instead, each player is competing against his teammates. The Indians are competing to see which war band can win the most honors; the cavalry are competing to see who can last the longest. Indian bands can earn honor points for defeating an enemy in melee, capturing a guidon, or for a chief counting coup. The band that earns the most points is the Indian winner. The Cavalry company that keeps its guidon the longest is the Cavalry winner.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translated from publisher website:<br/><br/>Sudoku Color is both familiar and innovative. This unique Sudoku can be played solitaire or as a family game for up to 4 people, each with his/her own gameboard. Due to the handicap system kids could beat their parents. Furthermore each game can be played with numbers aswell as colors.<br/><br/>Additional info:<br/><br/>In the normal game, each of the players get his/her own sudoku board. A card showing an initial setup is drawn. All players start with the same setup by placing tokens (numbers or colors) on their own boards as shown on the setup card. Next, each player tries to finish his own sudoku as quickly as possible. The fastest player of the first round has to play the next round with the highest handicap, the slowest player with the lowest handicap. The different handicap levels are shown on the setup cards. Winner is the player that manages to be the first to complete his/her own sudoku board.<br/><br/>Then there's the Sudoku Sandokan type of play. In this variant, all players play on the same board. The goal is to get the board as full as possible. At first an initial setup is made based on what's shown on a setup card that is randomly drawn. The remaining tokens are then divided between the players. Each turn has to timed, so that each players has to place one or two of his tokens on a correct position on the board within half a minute. Failing to place a token correctly within the allotted time means that the player has to discard one of his tokens. A player scores a single point upon completing a single row, column or block. Completing two items (row+column, row+block or column+block) with a single token gives 2 points. Completing all three (row+column+block) with a single tile scores 3 points. The player with the most points wins the game<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>4 boards<br/>324 double-sided pieces with colors and numbers<br/>50 cards with 100 startup situations (at 4 different levels)<br/>Rules (in 6 languages)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some of London's main streets are familiar to a host of children and adults through the Monopoly board game, with almost everyone recognising the names of Mayfair, Park Lane and Bond Street.<br/>This Christmas, the towns and cities of Wales will become equally as familiar, with a new Welsh-language version of the game. Cardiff Bay will replace Mayfair and the Menai Straits will take over from Park Lane.<br/>In welcoming the new Welsh-language version, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Minister for Heritage, said: 'We are extremely pleased that the Books Council have been able to support the Welsh-language Monopoly and its success will not only bring pleasure to many this Christmas, but will also enable families across Wales to play this popular board game through the medium of Welsh.'<br/>Winning Moves, who have produced a number of versions of the popular board game based on different regions of Britain, are pleased to add a distinctive Welsh-language version to the collection, with the players winning or losing their fortune as they travel the length and breadth of Wales.<br/>The company invited the Books Council to assist them in selecting appropriate names for the game board, and the Council sought the assistance of the leading language expert D. Geraint Lewis, who has published numerous dictionaries and grammar books.<br/>'We were delighted to be able to work with Winning Moves to produce the Welsh-language version of this popular board game,' said Gwerfyl Pierce Jones, Director of the Welsh Books Council.<br/>'The Welsh-language version of Scrabble proved to be a best-seller and we are sure that Monopoly yn Gymraeg (Monopoly in Welsh) will have similar success amongst Welsh speakers and Welsh learners of all ages. The whole process was a most pleasing challenge and D. Geraint Lewis's contribution as a consultant was a key factor in ensuring that the game reflected all the different regions of Wales.'<br/>A set of both English- and Welsh-language rules are included with each game, to assist Welsh learners.<br/>D. Geraint Lewis added: 'Nothing gives me more pleasure than seeing people playing board games through the medium of Welsh, and to know that these games are of the highest quality.'&quot;<br/><br/>",

The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to player one to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the BrainBox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card.

The concept has been inspired (if such is the word) by the continual media coverage of such regrettable events throughout the world.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fundamental to this game is a sort of 'Theory of Riots; which is that a riot is one, violent, expression of deep-rooted unrest by members of the civil population. The causes of riots are not the subject of these rules, merely the events following their start.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is intended for use with 25mm or OO/HO scale models, with a crowd of 150 or so figures and 40-50 police/security forces; there is no reason why the game should not be played using 1/300 scale models, or even 1/32! (provided of course that the other scales are changed as appropriate).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The preferred way of playing the game is with one or more umpires and a group of say, 4-6 players (but there are other ways of setting up the game - see later).The players all represent the Security Forces and are given a copy of the SF Rules.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In practice, depending on umpire experience, we have found you need one umpire for every 3-4 players - there is quite a lot to do.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This game can also be played quite successfully as a solo game. To be most successful played solo it needs plenty of time to work through all the actions.&quot;<br/><br/>This set of rules was originally released in 1983. A revised edition was released in 2001.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subtitled &quot;Brigade Level Combat - Western Front 1916&quot;.<br/><br/>&quot;A command post game about commanding brigades and divisions in WW1 - particularly focused on 1916. The rules are intended to be run in real time, and by umpires - who then write messages to the HQ players in the form they would have been historically, and subject to the delays and inaccuracies that would have existed at the time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The players never see the rules at all, and must work from a map (ideally in a smelly cellar by the light of a flickering oil lantern while umpires chuck buckets of earth at then).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Players must not be allowed to use game counters, plastic overlays or any modern aids. If a telephone is available it must be unreliable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The basic player team is probably a Brigade HQ - but with a few more players it can be expanded to a division of 2-3 brigades.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules are simplistic and built around a few, hopefully easy to remember, die rolls - because umpires will need to spend time writing as well as adjudicating. Verbal reports from junior officers are possible, but rarely happened - the HQ builds its picture of the battle from a collection of highly unreliable information sources.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "En Avant! Tactical Warfare in the Age of Napoleon.<br/><br/>From the rulebook introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;This system is designed to play out a regimental level battle using 25mm figures in about half an hour or so.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ideally, the game is controlled by someone acting as Game Control (or Umpire) who does not give the rules to the players. This adds some uncertainty play and discouraged player from &lsquo;rules optimising' rather than just getting on ad playing the game.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In order make it as clear as possible what is going on, the status of the units is shown by labels next to the unit, and players issue orders by using order flashcards. The system does not use dice in combat resolution, which is an approach that is a unusual in most wargaming circles and will come as a bit of shock to conventional gamers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This does give a slight chess-like feel to the game, and it does mean that a game which follows the same course will always have the same result. Fortunately, no game survives first contact with the players, and the chances of two games being exactly alike is small.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Although the rules were tested using 25mm figures, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what size models you use, and it might look more realistic to put, say, 15mm or 1/300 scale figures on the same sized base.&quot;<br/><br/>",

These fights might involve only a few hundred fighters - too small to be counted as a battle - too big to be a man-to-man skirmish. In this game, players are significant individuals - leaders with great martial skills - and they have a following composed of their friends, family, vassals and servants.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This means that the composition of the force controlled by a player can be highly varied.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules are written with 15mm scale figures in mind - but there is no reason why they can&rsquo;t be adjusted for other figure scales - or even played with cardboard figures or counters depending on the sort of resources you have at your disposal.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OP COM: Operational Map Combat in World War II.<br/><br/>A set of detailed rules for running an umpired, double-blind World War II wargame for two players or teams. Written orders are issued by the players and the results are resolved by the umpire. The players represent command staff at division level or higher. The units controlled by the players are at least battalion sized and each game turn is a half day. The map scale will vary by scenario.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;These rules started out as a set of guidelines for the operational megagame Operation Market Garden. This game was run twice, once in 1988 and again in 1993. In the course of these outings, the rules altered and benefited from considerable feedback from participants. The game system I offer here is a distillation of that feedback from users, together with additional thoughts and research.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is intended as a generic map gaming system for WW2 operations in the Western Europe Theatre, that is, covering operations from Normandy to the Baltic. With some alteration they might be suitable for the campaigns in Italy, although the terrain and operational practices make that theatre sufficiently different to make a rethink of the rules a good idea. The rules are not suitable for the Eastern Front or the Far East. The underlying assumptions vary far too much.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Operation Market Garden was a large and complicated operational game. It involved forces down to battalion level and headquarters up to Corps. When running such a game there is a lot to bear in mind, and the game system has to be robust in order that things progress smoothly. Of course, these rules do not need to be used only in the context of a full sized 100 player megagame -<br/>there are plenty of smaller operations that they could as easily be used for in the context of a club game for half a dozen players.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In addition to the reasonably straightforward aspects of ground combat the rules consider the problems of air-ground operations (both close support and airborne operations) and logistics (hopefully not quite as boring as some folk make out!).&quot;<br/><br/>",

The famous battles are well known, but the emphasis of this set of rules is on the smaller actions typically between 500-2000 Zulu and a company of 120 or so of British.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is intended for use with toy solders at the 1/300 scale, although it could just as easily be played at other scales or even with counters on a map.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The fundamental assumptions are that the firepower of a formed line of British infantry is very devastating, and that the determination and tactical handing of the fighters on both sides is critical to the outcome of each battle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is a time when the Vikings (a collective term for various Norse peoples - Danes, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns), started their raiding of the coastlines within reach of their longships. Their control of the oceans eventually meant that they also became a major trading force, as well as the discoverers and colonisers of places like Iceland and Greenland.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In this game, you are a minor Viking village leader (think up a suitable name). You have managed to stretch the village&rsquo;s resources to the point of building a longship, to the latest and most fashionable design.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You will be able to equip and man the ship from your village initially, and dependent upon success or otherwise in your first voyages, you will be able to recruit more experienced fighters from outside the village.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Success is measured in two ways, status and treasure. These are self-evident.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Two four-player teams represent the opposing tank crews, portraying the commander, gunner, loader, and driver.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate, in a simple but realistic way, the problems confronting the crew of an individual tank in combat. To make the game even more difficult, the action takes place between two or more crews, in a sort of stylised 'duel'. Obviously, such one-on-one duels practically never took place, but these games are intended more as a sort of teamwork game, to illustrate a point. There is no reason why the game cannot be expanded to take on larger actions of up to troop level.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Any scale of model can be used, although it is important that the turrets of the tank models can be rotated independently. For reasons which become apparent later, 1/200 is probably the smallest practical scale, and 1/72 or 1/90 are probably the ideal scales.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is vitally important that the terrain scale is the same as the model scale, ie. for 1/72 the ground scale would be 1&quot; = 2 metres.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each 'bound' of activity takes 4-5 seconds of real time, and represents approx 10-15 seconds of game time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each player represents one crew member.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Your job is to pilot your taxi ship through warp gates picking up and dropping off passengers. Be careful of the nexus though, should your ship stop there you never know where you will end up. Will you be the first taxi driver to deliver seven passengers before the work day is over?<br/><br/>Nexus Taxi is a light and chaotic two player print-and-play game.  Players will need, besides printing the game board, 1 ten-sided die, 14 passenger bits (such as cubes or meeples), and 2 taxis able to hold a passenger piece.<br/><br/>The game board and directions for play can be found in the image and files section (pending).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kreuzwort-Pulok is a collection of games with the same materials: 256 letter tiles (15 don't have letters, but faces on them - these are wildcards) and a grid board for each player that is protected from the view of other players by an integrated paper screen. There also is a cardboard &quot;plate&quot; (a round disk for discarded tiles).<br/><br/>The goal is to form crosswords on the grid boards. There are ten games included:<br/><br/>Sechzehner-Spiel: Each player has to form a word that someone announced. Tiles not needed for this are used for crossing words. Tiles are drawn and discarded (openly, so other players can grab the discarded ones). When the first player finishes, the other get penalties depending on the number of tiles left over and the number of tiles missing for the basic word.<br/><br/>F&uuml;nfer-Spiel: Each player has to form a cross of two words with five tiles. When that isn't possible, additional tiles are drawn, but not more than two unused ones can be held in the end. The first player to achieve a legal crossword scores points.<br/><br/>Achter-Spiel: Same as the F&uuml;nfer-Spiel, but two or more crosses have to be formed, three tiles can be kept.<br/><br/>Kaufspiel (for two players): Each player draws ten tiles and looks at them without sorting them. The active player can then announce &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;playing&quot;. When buying, he/she also announces a number of tiles. Both players now have to discard this number of tiles and redraw them. When playing, both try to form a legal cross with their tiles. The winning player gets 10-15 points, the other one a penalty depending on the number of unused tiles.<br/><br/>Leiter: Two columns of ten letters each are places on the table. The task of the players is to extend each pair of letters in one row into words. Thus they can get rid of their tiles. A player who cannot play has to draw a new tile. The first player to get rid of his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Gruppenspiel: Similar to Leiter, but with an open cross instead of fixed columns. So the players can add tiles in any direction, as long as the letter combination occurs in a German word.<br/><br/>Wettrennen: Each player gets 19 tiles and secretly forms a cross using at least 11 tiles. The score of the first player to achieve this is 10 plus the last digit squared (11 to 91 points). The other players lose one point for each unused tile.<br/><br/>W&ouml;rter anbinden: A letter is placed on the table. Each player takes turns to add a letter, but the letters still have to form the beginning of a word. When that is not possible, all but the last (at least) two tiles are discarded and the last letters start the new word. The first player who can use up his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Ausf&uuml;llspiel: Three letters are flipped open on the plate in the middle of the table. All players now try to form a word which uses two of these letters as first and last letters. The first player to manage this is the winner.<br/><br/>Alleinspiel: A collection of four solitaire games.<br/><br/>The designer of Kreuzwort-Pulok is uncredited, but the preface is signed &quot;J.M.&quot; (It seems likely, but isn't entirely clear whether these are the initials of the designer).<br/><br/>(User Summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

The player will encounter walls, monsters, skulls, fountains, and treasure chests.  By using cards for all actions except moving, the players battle monsters, find gems, and find spells, weapons and armor.  The players' ability to use the items depends on their skills. Spell skills are based on the known elements of the universe, namely: Cheese, Nougat, Lint, and Uranium 236. Weapon skills could be: Stabby, Pummely, Huckey, and Minty Fresh.  The number of hits a player or monster can take is called, &quot;Chutzpah.&quot;  The game ends when 7 gems are returned to 7 skulls (just like Cutlass of Fire) and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decktet wiki: Rule of the land was benevolently shared by the six Crowned Princes. Every five years the people would elect one of the Princes to lead the land for the next five years. Before the election, the Princes would hold a series of debates in which they would demonstrate why they were most fit to lead for the next five years. The debates were always reviewed by the three major newspapers and typically two of the papers' editors would agree that one of the Princes won the debate while the third paper's editor would choose someone else as the clear victor. In the end, the people would vote and a new leader would rule peacefully for another five years.<br/><br/>Election Day takes great advantage of the structure of the Decktet cards. There are 6 suits with 2 suits on each card. Each suit represents a prince. Each player plays one card face up on their turn until all players pass, ending the debate. The suit appearing most frequently during the debate keeps two of its highest point cards as influence points until the end of the game. The next most frequently appearing suit keeps one of its highest point cards until the end of the game. After all the debates, the influence cards accumulated are added up and the suit with the most influence indicates who the winning prince is. The player who backed that prince is the winning player.<br/><br/>",

You can taste the satisfaction of forcing your opponents to pay too much for their modest properties, or jump at the opportunity of stealing a legitimate good deal by being shrewd and cunning.  If you like fast paced competitive fun that keeps the chance factor to a minimum, try Bid$, the game where you do control your own destiny.&quot;<br/><br/>Object of the game (2-6 players) - To make as much money as possible by buying stores and eventually towers.  Each player picks a marker and starts at &quot;receive $1500&quot; (you do not collect the money until you have gone around the board once).  All players play around the outside edge (lower level) and can only move into the upper level (inside edge) with a bank payment of $15,000.  The players begin by rolling the dice, and the player with with the highest number starts first.  The rest of the order is determined by going clockwise.  When play begins, if a player rolls doubles, he/she is allowed to go again.  The player keeps rolling until he/she stops getting doubles (property that you hit along the way must be bid on or if it is owned the owner must be paid).  Each player is given $21,000 at the start of the game.  When a property is landed on, the bidding starts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played on four trays, each tray having four by four holes where marbles can be placed. The trays are placed side by side on the board and each player starts the game with 12 marbles. On each players turn he can place one of his marbles on any tray as he chooses and thus trying to make four in a row (or a Q4 as it's called in the game rules). The Q4 can be on a single tray or spanning all the trays (that is, three dimensional).<br/><br/>After a player has played all his marbles he can start to move them around (on the same tray or between trays). After placing a marble he can claim a Q4. If the Q4 is on a single tray it should be fairly obvious whether it's a Q4 or not. If the Q4 spans all the trays, they must be stacked (the leftmost being on the bottom, the rightmost on the top) and then it can be checked whether the claim for a Q4 is true or not.<br/><br/>The first one to make a Q4 wins the game.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid<br/>    Four Letter Words - though with words<br/>    Qubic - which is also played, with placement only, on 4x4x4 grid but with 32 markers for each player<br/>    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.<br/>    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also<br/>    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up<br/><br/><br/>",

It is unknown whether or not this game ever made it into full production.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 Rules Folder (6 pages on continuous paper)<br/>- 54 Ship Cards (all cards for this game are printed on sheets for players to cut out)<br/>- 1 Set of Hit/Destroyed Counters (the sheet devoted to last minute changes indicates that these are not included)<br/>- 6 Play Sheets <br/>- 6 Player Order Cards<br/>- 114 Action Cards<br/>- (a six-sided die is required, but not included)<br/><br/>Notes on play:<br/>Each player has a Play Sheet where ship status and damaged is tracked. Essentially, the Play Sheet represents a player's home base... their ships (as represented on Ship Cards) are placed on areas on the Play Sheet that show the ship's position relative to their base. Players score victory points by finishing off other player's ships.  The game ends and victory points are totaled when only one player has active ships left.<br/><br/>",

Muchos tuaregs murieron por culpa del antiguo tesoro y Halim el Sabio, Se&ntilde;or de las duna, qued&oacute; tan apenado que mand&oacute; a sus s&uacute;bditos que enterraran el tesoro de nuevo en el desierto.

        "description": "Chieftain Chess is a structured multi-move game for 2 teams of 1-4 players/side. It is scalable, with larger and smaller versions available. A chess-wargame fusion that uses 5 different types of simple short-range chess-like pieces, it mimics various aspects of an ancient battle on a 12x16 rectangular field. Four chiefs [the strongest but not the fastest pieces] per side lead their 32 piece armies in a set-piece battle that begins just after the 2 armies start to close with each other.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by killing all 4 enemy chiefs before your 4 get killed. Players move as many pieces per turn as they have friendly chiefs on the board. The moving pieces must be within &quot;command control range&quot; of the chiefs, generally 3 squares, to be able to move that turn. This forces the royal pieces to be active participants in the heat of the battle, rather than trying to hide in the corners like the kings of chess.<br/><br/>Most games, regardless of size, are determined in 30-40 turns. The game is designed so the pace increases from beginning to end. The players start with 1 chief for every 8 pieces, so they move about 12% of their armies each turn in the beginning. By midgame, 20-25% of the army moves each turn, and by the endgame, roughly 50% of the remaining pieces move each turn.<br/><br/>The game trades space for time compared to western chess. Where attacks in chess are sequenced deeply in time but concentrated in space, in Chieftain multiple attacks are spread out across space, but can't be accurately calculated more than 2 or 3 turns deep in time. It has a deliberate, almost defining theme, yet it is a pure abstract game, with perfect information, and in its specific &quot;combat&quot; pieces and their movement rules, there is no semblance of reality. What it allows is a game played on 2 levels, the tactical level being a pure, simple chess variant, and the strategic level being a simulation of a wargame.<br/><br/>The game may be played online at chessvariants.org, or a Chieftain Chess set can be made from 2 complete sets of chesspieces and 3 same-sized chess boards, one cut in half, for face to face play.<br/><br/>",

The ten cards are numbered 2 through 6, and 8 through 12 (no number 7).  The players also receive 25 counters in a single color.  <br/>The game is played by rolling the dice and matching the number rolled to the cards in front of them.  If a number that was previously rolled is rolled again, the next player shouts &quot;Whoopee!&quot; and play passes to the next player to the left who still has that number face up.  If no one has that number still face up, the current player keeps rolling.  If a 7 is rolled, the player has to place a counter in the center of the table and play passes to the player on the left.  Play continues until one player has turned over all their cards.  That player gets all the counters in the table's center plus one counter from each player per card remaining face up.  That player then begins the next round.<br/>(from the enclosed &quot;Directions for Playing Whoopee!&quot;)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/>STALINGRAD, SOVIET UNION, 22 October 1942: The German 6th Army push into the heart of Stalingrad played directly into the hands of the defenders, intent on contesting every building. Pavlov&rsquo;s House became the name of one particularly well-defended apartment building, its moniker gained from Sergeant Yakov Pavlov, who commanded the platoon which first seized the building and which kept defending it throughout the battle. The house was a four-story building in the city-center of Stalingrad, overlooking a large square, the  9th January Square . The small garrison established anti-tank and machine-gun posts at the windows and held off all attacks for fifty-nine days. Each time enemy infantry or panzers attempted to reach the defenders, Pavlov&rsquo;s men took them under heavy fire littering the square with corpses and wreckage. Eventually the defenders, as well as the Russian civilians who remained in the basement throughout, held on until 25 November 1942, when they were relieved by counter-attacking Soviet forces.<br/><br/>This is STALIN'S FURY, a brand new set of four scenarios + a new 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on heavyweight stock. You also receive a color (red, naturally) cover and VARIANT RULES page. All you'll need to dive into the heart of the inferno that was the Battle of Stalingrad during 1942.<br/><br/>This scenario pack also includes Teufelhunden (GWASL #1) a 1918 WW1 scenario set in Belleau Wood France.<br/><br/>",

The game is themed around jousting events (the lance, the axe, and the sword) so there are three rounds with two &quot;passes&quot; each. One player leads a card and the other must play a higher card of the same colour, or a matching card of the opposite colour, or pass. If they play a card, then the trick continues and the other player faces the same three options. This continues until someone passes, the other player captures all of the cards played to the trick. At the start of the game, each player chooses 3 Royal Favours (court cards or Aces). These cards can be activated at the beginning of a round to impart a special ability to the owner (for instance, a Jack adds +1 to the value of all cards of its colour). They also determine which cards will be used for scoring your captured tricks: only cards of the majority colour within the 3 Royal Favours are counted.&quot;<br/><br/>All you need to play are the rules (PDF file) and a standard deck of cards.<br/><br/>",

It can stand alone as its own skirmish or massive fleet game, or be integrated into just about any existing science fiction Role-Playing-Game.<br/><br/>This game splits up portions of the rules into both a SCIENCE fiction (SCIfi) setting, or a science FICTION (sciFI) setting Essentially, space fights that look cool, or space fights that are based more on realism, with the ability for players to mix and match aspects of each as they see fit. It allows for space combat in worlds where ships tow each other by grappling hooks or by tractor beams, where space marines board by teleporting onto the other ship or by laser-cutting open holes in the hull, and where faster-than-light travel happens by a single instantaneous jump, or by traveling days in a warp bubble that allows ships to chase and fight each other while racing at speeds beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>",

Just a few years passed and in Europe it simmer again!<br/><br/>At the outbreak of the war, Europe is divided into five blocks, which are: Britain and its Allies, the Russian Empire, France and its Allies, Ottoman Empire and Central Powers.<br/><br/>The game uses a modified original map of Europe, close to the state in 1914, but reflecting the development of an imaginary continent.<br/><br/>Key imaginary historical events before the war include the following:<br/><br/>Britain: In the twenties Britain got into serious conflicts with the Tsarist Russia and left the Triple Entente. From the thirties there was a gradual democratization in the colonies. Scandinavian countries see in the UK its natural protector against expanding Russia and Germany. After the riots in the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar outpost spreads to Andalusia and Portugal.<br/><br/>The Russian Empire: in the late twenties hit the Russian Empire its limits in far Asia. The Grand Duchy of Finland used the growing tension between Russia and Britain to escape from the Russia in early thirties. The abdication of a liberal the Tsar and the emergence new militant faction to power jump-started a new phase of armaments in Europe.<br/><br/>France: After the failed assassination in Sarajevo, it was France who saved by its diplomatic activity the European peace. In the thirties, France tried to create a large Mediterranean Union. South of the Apennine peninsula and Balkan were hit by neoislamic expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the French plan foiled. Against the traditional enemy - Germany - has France built an extensive Maginot Line.<br/><br/>Central Powers: Emperor Franz Ferdinand poured into crusty Austro-Hungarian veins new blood. In early twenties he federalized and modernized Austro-Hungary and in the thirties gradually agreed to trade and customs union with imperial Germany. The economic and military power of Central Powers long dampen expansionary ambitions of neighboring states. The Germans built along the lines with France its own line of defense - Siegfried Line.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire: the rapid modernization of the Ottoman Empire, launched by the world's thirst for oil, awoke southeast Europe to a new prosperity. Once Europe's sick man rallied by endless supply of black gold. In the late twenties, after a series of smaller conflicts, Ottomans returned to the southern Balkans and Islamic radicalization in the thirties dominate in large areas of northern Africa and even in southern Italy.<br/><br/>Each of the Powers thinks only of itself and just like you wants to be the best and win over all. Powers also conclude mutually beneficial agreements, lead diplomatic negotiations to form a military alliances, and so even you can not ignore this part of the game. Occupy all three fields of one power or help push your arch-enemy of its territory. This is not &quot;Ludo&quot;, this is &quot;The War.&quot;<br/><br/>Goal of the game<br/><br/>Your task is to occupy the entire territory of any other power (three fields of one color), while keeping on your own territory at least one pyramid.<br/><br/>You also win when your arch enemy loses his last piece from his own territory. His loss is your victory.<br/><br/>",

Their pace of movement is determinend by how well they have solved the last question. Die kind of question is determined by the field their pawn is standing on. There are three different categories:<br/><br/>Extreme! : All players vote which one of two contrary characteristics on a Extreme!card fits most to the character of the active player. The two characteristics are either both negative or both positive, so everybody is forced to give a honest vote for the more fitting characteristic.<br/><br/>Hey, that&acute;s You!: All players point at each other simultaneously, voting who at the game table fits most to a given attribute.<br/><br/>Top or Flop: A situation is described on a card. The active player has to describe how he/she would solve it. The other players vote (by showing thumb up/down simultaneously) if they think his answer is honest and fits to his character.<br/><br/>As a very important aspect of the game, players act a lot with their hands while playing: swinging the fists, counting aloud, pointing fingers on other player, showing thumbs up/down and declaring counting-out rhymes together. So there is always action at the game table.<br/><br/>Gef&auml;hrlich Ehrlich is not just a fun game but also a kind of tool to find out more about how other people look at you and what kind of character they think you are.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played by two to four players each using one of the colors: blue, green, red, or yellow.  What is unique about this game are the playing pieces.  Each piece is about 1/2 inch in height and pieces are of various shapes.  If you look straight down on the pieces from above, the shapes are: square, triangle, circle, diamond, and octagon.  Furthermore, the square pieces come in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In the basic game, only three of the shapes are used.  Many advanced variations exist, including one in which all the shapes are used.<br/><br/>The game board has a series of tracks that lead from the start area to home.  Each piece must follow the track that matches its shape.  The square piece must follow the square track, the circular piece must follow the circular track and so on.  The tracks connect to each of the player's start areas to the central home area and hence intersect with each other.<br/><br/>Certain points on the tracks and intersections allow players to jump their piece over other pieces or to bump opponents pieces back along their respective tracks.<br/><br/>Finally, players can roll up to five dice (just once) to gain additional movement points.  Players must cover the numbers 1 to 6 with the five dice.  Two or more dice can be used to cover one number.  For example, on a roll of 1-2-2-3-6, the player could cover the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6.  In this example, 3 and 4 would be left uncovered, allowing the player to move pieces an additional seven spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to move all of his pieces to home is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The four jokers and one suit per player are used (eg. in a 3 player game, one suit of cards is removed so that you have just three suits).  The cards are split into a Resource deck (Aces and 2-10) and a Royalty deck (Jacks, Queens, Kings, Jokers).  Each player selects a suit and starts the game with a queen of that suit.<br/><br/>Three royalty cards are always available and each royalty card will have up to 7 resource cards in its row.  The rightmost resource card may be added to a player's hand for free and other resource cards and royalty cards may be picked up by paying 2 resources per card to the right of the card being purchased.<br/><br/>When the royalty draw pile is expired, the game ends and players compare total prestige points.  Points are earned as follows: 1 Point per Resource card of your suit; 1 Point for the 1st Jack; 2 Points per Queen; 3 Points per King; 4 Points per Joker; 6 Points per 2nd, 3rd, ...

If you find all your opponent's Velociraptor bones, you win the game. Easy? Think again! You'll need to avoid dangerous tar pits as you build your Velociraptor with the excavated bones! The first player to excavate and build a complete Velociraptor wins!&quot;<br/><br/>Players take turns to try to discover dinosaur bones using the same A-J, 1-10 grid references as Battleship. Key differences are that the bones do not have target points which consist of a single straight line and that the bones have preset positions to fit onto four 5x5 terrain tiles. Don't be fooled though, this preset position rather than destroying the game, as I expected actually makes it far more of a logical deduction game than a guess fest.<br/><br/>BTW the blurb about dangerous tar pits is just blurb. The game rules do not mention any tar pit effect.<br/><br/>",

The special 62-card pack that is used and the game itself are often known as Tarocchino (pronounced tarokino), the diminutive form of Tarocco referring to the reduction of the pack from 78 to 62 cards.<br/><br/>Ottocento is a point-trick game, with trumps. The cards have point values individually (as in other Tarot games) but also score in combinations. There is no bidding, but players can score by declaring card combinations held in their hands at the start of play, as well as for combinations taken in tricks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fool's Poker is a surprisingly deep poker variant which retains the hidden information and bluffing of poker but adds a strong deductive element.  It is played with a traditional 52-card deck.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all players are have hands of size 5.  Each round, the players are dealt a new hand.  One player calls out a 5-card poker hand that they believe can be made by the collective cards of all the players.  The player to their left must call the previous player's bluff by saying &quot;BS&quot; or similar, or otherwise state a higher hand of their own.  Play continues clockwise until a player's bluff has been called.  Players pool their cards and see if the last name hand can be assembled from their cards.  If the hand is possible, the hand size of the player who called the bluff drops by 1.  Otherwise, the hand of the player whose bluff was called decreases by 1.<br/><br/>The next round begins with fresh hands using the new lower hand limits.  The player who called &quot;BS&quot; last round starts the new round.  If a player's hand size drops to zero, they are out of the game.  Play continues until the players only have 4 cards between them, and the player with most cards remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>Rules for hands:<br/>Pair, Two Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, and 4 of a Kind: must name their card values<br/>Straights, Flush, and Straight Flush: must name their high card<br/>Flush and Straight Flush: also must name their suit<br/><br/>Variant: The 2's are wild able to take any value and suit.  The 5 of a Kind hand becomes a valid poker hand, ranked higher than Royal Flush.  This variant addresses the issue where, late in the game, it may be difficult to assemble even small hands.<br/><br/>",

Refence sheets of all the units are distributed with a free ruleset on the official website (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.smallwars-thegame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.smallwars-thegame.com</a>).<br/><br/>While the way of winning may vary from game to game (area control, enemy destruction...), it is always played on a 3x3 grid area in a pre-set number of turns. Once battalions have been built with an army point system, players activate units and use action points to move and/or shoot enemy units at range, using a simple threshold dice system. At the end of the last turn, victory points are calculated regarding the scenario chosen, the player having the most of them being the winner.<br/><br/>",

A game of Ki cannot end in a draw.<br/><br/>Ki is played with standard Go equipment on any odd sized square board. 11x11 is a good size to start on.<br/><br/>The objective of Ki is to have more stones on the board when the board is full. Note that completely filling the board will not be necessary to determine the outcome of a game as many of the placements will become obvious towards the end.<br/><br/>Starting with black, players alternate placing stones. A player must have at least 2 stones orthogonally adjacent to a space in order to control it. A player controls a space when he owns a majority of the stones orthogonally adjacent to the space. If the space is occupied by his opponent, the enemy stone is removed from play. If a space is surrounded by an equal number of stones of both colors, it is a legal placement for either player. It is forbidden for a player to place a stone on a space controlled by his opponent, even to make a capture. If a player has no legal move on his turn he must pass. Passing is otherwise not permitted.<br/><br/>",

The game itself is a print and play type, and available for free download.<br/><br/>From the Introduction in the basic rules:<br/>Starship Marine is a set of science fiction wargame rules, designed for use with toy soldiers. The basic idea is that there is a battle to control and capture a starship by a boarding party moving down the corridors and rooms of the ship. One side controls the attackers, who are mostly composed of the eponymous 'Starship Marines', and the defenders, usually less well armed crewmen, with perhaps a smattering of Marines to stiffen the defense. The deck plans can either be drawn out or built in 3D, depending on your preferences and time available. The scale of toy soldier is 25mm or 1/72, and any make of figures can be used [...]<br/><br/>The minimum you need are a few toy soldiers, some dice, a large sheet of paper with a deck plan on it, and the rules. A typical small game takes about a hour or so (longer if you like arguing about rules). The largest game we know of, to date, involved some 60 people, hundreds of toy soldiers, and many very very big sheets of paper.[...]<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;Last year I promised to present for discussion a set of rules covering the Armada period of naval warfare. Here are those rules, or rather a fast play version of the Channel Wargames Group's current set.<br/><br/>&quot;The philosophy behind them is both to make an attempt to make a set of rules that give a good flavour of the period and the methods of fighting with ships current at that time. And to make the games played with them as enjoyable as is possible. Because of this things such as gunnery have been simplified as much as possible.<br/><br/>&quot;Ships gunnery at the time of the Armada was a thing in a state of flux. It is as well to contemplate, that ships carried many different types of ordinance, all intermingled together on the same deck. The logistics of serving such a varied armament in a rapid manner was beyond the capabilities of the time, and I would hazard a guess beyond us today as well. Most authorities give a maximum rate of fire for the guns of the Spaniards as once, yes once, a day. Small pieces and hand held weapons were obviously much quicker to reload. Even the English rate of fire is said to have been at best once an hour. If this difference had been used in the rules the Spanish player's would be sitting on their for much of the game, and the English for quite long periods. The solution to this problem can be read in the rules themselves...&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Rules set covers scale, speed of units, sailing rules, handling classes, wind effects, firing, ranges, firing charts, special effects table (effectively a sort of critical hit table), putting out fires, effects of bowing on hull factors, boarding, morale, special rules for galleys, a ship list, and a brief bibliography. Game requires models (1/600 preferred for ease of scratch building), and two types of dice (d6 &amp; d20).<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #178 (July 2002)<br/><br/>",

A guide with the reproduction of real ancient Egyptian documents is featired to translate the hieroglyphics and identify Pharaos' names.

These are being called a fleet battle, but when either is said, it is close to the land battle of Napoleonic age.<br/><br/>Each player control one or more star fleets. <br/>Each fleet is commanded by one admiral, and organized by 10 to 20 ships units.<br/><br/>Each turn, a fleet are activated in the unintentional order by chit-pull system, and it resolves a movement and a combat. <br/>An average admiral has only one or two chits. But the heroes of the story has four or more chits, and it is activated  many times during one turn. <br/>A battle is resolved with adjacent hex on the Odds CRT.<br/><br/>The outcome is decided by the number which made a fleet collapse. A fleet collapses when a fixed unit is eliminate or admiral's mental agitation.<br/><br/>",

If a player loses his capital city, he is left out of the game. There are optional rules for winning: world domination, timed game play etc. The game map resembles RISK but the Tamga game map covers territories from eastern Europe, Anatolia and northern Africa. Battle mechanics involve dice rolling, army hiring and paying their upkeep cost, buying culture cards to be able to hire more powerful armies. Each clan has an army-location-figure to represent their army on the game map. A player can not have more than one army. The army of a player consists of maximum 3 squads. (Janissaries, Cavalry, Ranged attackers etc.)  Specific cities have to be captured to hire specific squads. More powerful squads can be hired from more powerful neutral cities. A player has to defeat the militia of a neutral city to be able to hire those squads. The Tamga game comes with 6-sided(d6) special dice. Each die have three Star faces, two Crescent faces and one Sword face. Different squads have to roll different symbols to be successful. The cards representing the squads have special abilities against other squads written on them. More powerful armies require cultural achievements. The culture cards have historical flavor text on them and a culture point value at the bottom. A player has to pay money(AKCE) to buy culture cards and hire squads. The game comes with a small pouch filled with yellow and white metal coins called Akce. The coins are designed true to the original coins of era.<br/><br/>(from the official Tamga board game website):<br/>TAMGA is a tactical strategic board game about the Ottoman Empire that takes place during from its the foundation until the end of its golden era. Players take role of Turkish leaders and try to defeat other players to become the ultimate ruler of Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>The flavor texts on game cards, the money currency of the game called &quot;akce&quot; pieces, drawings of soldiers and Ottoman Empire game map are the result of hundreds of hours of research from historical literature.<br/><br/>The creation of game's historical texts and design took nearly four years of careful research and reading. During this time Associate Professor Erhan Afyoncu have been consulted numerous times to provide a true to the original historical experience for the players.<br/><br/>",

Each player is encouraged to vocalize his opinion - to investigate how each group decision will affect him. It is recommended for groups of not less than seven nor more than fifteen players.<br/><br/>There are no rules in COMMUNITY - only procedures by which to play. Dice Roll and Role Cards create a simulation of day-to-day living conditions and the responsibilities which we all must face. The Event Cards simulate events which affect the community and require a group decision. The Pollution Index forces the community to take group action and Community Improvements offer a way to improve the quality of life.<br/><br/>User Summary: <br/>COMMUNITY is run by a Gamemaster who is in control of the game. Decisions about what a player can or cannot do are made by the Gamemaster based on his learning goals for the group. There are &quot;rules&quot; included with the game, but these can be adjusted per the Gamemaster's discretion. The game is over or is &quot;won&quot; when the Gamemaster's pre-determined goals have been achieved or the players have failed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 2 player abstract game, played with white and black stones on a Hexhex board. The goal is to have the largest group on the board when the game ends and the board is full.  There is a trick, though: You can place as many stones per turn as you have groups on the board (up to a limit).  There's a tricky balance: you need to connect your groups together to advance toward the goal, but you can't connect them too much or else you won't be able to place as many stones as your opponent.<br/><br/>The current rules:<br/><br/>1. The board begins empty.<br/><br/>2. To begin, White puts a single stone on any vacant space, and then Black does the same.<br/><br/>3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you may place as many stones as you have groups on the board, and you may place them onto any vacant spaces.  Except:<br/><br/>*You must place at least one stone.<br/>    *The stones you place may not be adjacent to one another. <br/>    *If you have more than 3 groups on the board, the maximum number of stones you may place is 3.<br/>    *You may not grow any group by more than one stone.<br/>    *A stone connecting two or three different groups together is considered to have grown them all (at the end of your turn, no group may have more than one new stone in it).<br/><br/>4. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the largest group wins.   If the players&rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger group wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box: Tembisa is a unique combination between card and dice game that allows you to play three different games which are all based on Africa and its adventures.<br/><br/>The three different games are:<br/>1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt<br/>2. Tembisa, the African farms<br/>3. Tembisa Memory<br/><br/>The game materials consist of 1 die, 4 wooden pawns and 56 playing cards. Besides a startcard and finishcard (showing the treasure in a cave), the cards show different situations you come across (e.g. a hungry lion, a wild river, a giant snake, friendly villagepeople). Each card also shows a negative number, STOP, or 1 or 2 dice to roll.<br/><br/>1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt<br/>A line is laid out of the playing cards. All cards, except for the start and endcard are placed facedown. A player rolls the die and moves his or her pawn accordingly. If the card where the pawn ends is not face upwards yet, do it now. In either case: this card shows a picture of what you met, together with a it's effect on your pawn: move it accordingly. (The number of places shown backwards, STOP or roll 1 or 2 extra dice.) The card where pawn ends up has no further effect for that players turn.<br/>When six uncovered cards are in a uninterrupted row, this region is deemed fully explored. Only the positive cards keep their effect.<br/>The player to reach the endcard showing the treasure first, wins the game.<br/><br/>2. Tembisa, the African farms<br/>For this variant, the start and end card are not used.<br/>Players try to build the biggest farms. A farm is build by placing a -1 card on the table. This farm can be enlarged by placing a -2, -3, ... on top in order.<br/>A player is allowed more than one farm, all starting with a -1.<br/>The STOP and 1 and 2 dice cards are used for protecting and stealing cards from the other players: to attack play a stop card on anothers farm, depending on further STOP or dice cards, a dice duel commits between attacker and defender. If the attacker wins he or she robs a die roll of cards from the top of the attacked farm. These must be used immediatly to enlarge his or her owns farm(s) or be discarded.<br/>A STOP card can also be used to protect one farm. When placed on top a farm of your own, that farm is protected against robbings. However, you cannot enlarge it anymore either.<br/>Players hold six cards in their hands, drawing 1 extra at the start of ones turn. This can be a card from the drawpile, or the top one of the (open) discard pile.<br/>At the end of ones turn cards are discarded or taken to fill up to 6 cards.<br/>STOP and dice cards are removed from play once used. <br/>Gameplay continues till there are no more cards in the discard and drawpiles. (The discardpile is reshuffled and becomes the new drawpile each time.) Then the values of the farms are added for each player, the player with the largest farm is the winner! (Just count as if each card had a positive number, instead of a negative.) Cards held in hands don't count.<br/><br/>3. Tembisa Memory<br/>A variant on ye old Memory. The goal is to make pairs of cards. The STOP cards count as jokers, it can form a set with any other card. However, two STOP cards are not a set!<br/>The 1 die and 2 dice cards are also jokers, but also give a number of bonus points at the end of the game: roll one or two dice accordingly for the number of bonus points.<br/>Scoring: The values of the couples are counted, dice bonusses are added. Player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Horse Racing Dice is a dice game using five special dice &ndash; a white handicap die, three red race dice and one hazard die. Players agree on the number of turns they will play, and on each turn a player rolls the handicap die first, then the three race dice. On the last turn, the players also roll the hazard dice. The handicap die has terms that add or subtract &lsquo;lengths&rsquo; to or from a players roll (e.g. &lsquo;on form&rsquo; adds a length, &lsquo;off form&rsquo; subtracts a length). The race dice have numbers of lengths (also &lsquo;necks&rsquo; which are worth a quarter length). The hazard die has hazards which subtract lengths or may even disqualify a player (e.g.  &lsquo;lost whip&rsquo;, &lsquo;fall/object&rsquo;). The player with the highest number of lengths when the race is completed wins.<br/>The game comes in a pocket book-sized container with a scoring pad and pencil.<br/><br/>",

As areas are cleared, the players can build houses and sell the houses to villagers.  When the village is complete and all the player heroes are healed, the game ends.  The &quot;winner&quot; is considered to be the player having the most gold when the village is complete.<br/><br/>Players explore the wilderness by playing tiles.  Each tile has a monster that the player must fight to the death.  When four adjacent tiles are placed next to each other as a square, the player can build a house and attract villagers.  During a player's turn, the player can take three actions including moving tile to tile to explore, digging for gold, building a house, selling a house to a village, or healing wounds.<br/><br/>Let's Build a Village represents an game improvised on the fly by a seven year old girl.  She invented the game because she had left over 1&quot; x 1&quot; ceramic tiles from a second grade project.  Naturally, Dad helped a bit.<br/><br/>",
