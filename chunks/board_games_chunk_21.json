        "description": "Bumper Car Arena is OGP's first full blown board game.  Earlier offerings were more along the Cheapass Game quality of components.  In this game, the components are quite good.  This is a race game with pre-programmed movement ala Roborally.  Players also score points for knocking into their opponents.  The last place player also controls the &quot;rogue&quot; bumper car, Jimmy Fudge -- who only wants to bump other players.<br/><br/>Each player controls one bumper car. Simultaneous movement card play determines the movement order. Players score points for moving around the track in the appropriate direction, and for bumping other bumper cars. Draws are done from a face up draft of n+1 cards where n is the number of players. The remaining card is used to control Jimmy Fudge's bumper car. Play continues until someone has scored 21 points, thereafter, there is an increasing chance of the game ending every turn.<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/><br/>It's a beautiful day at the amusement park. You and your friends have decided to take over the bumper car ride for your own purposes. Players score points for bumping other players cars and going around the track in the proper direction. (Going backwards makes the carnies angry.) And who is this Jimmy Fudge kid anyway?<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the 16-card orangutan deck, then lay out 4 or 5 cards face up, depending on the number of players; each orangutan shows one or more suit cards on it, and a player must possess matching cards to claim that orangutan.<br/><br/>Each round, the lead player lays a card on the table, then each player follows, without regard for suit. Whoever played the highest card claims one card played by another player, then either places it on the table before her or uses it (possibly with cards collected earlier) to claim an orangutan. The player discards all cards needed to claim the orangutan, and tucks any remaining cards collected under that orangutan.<br/><br/>Each player must claim one card, if possible, adding it to her collected cards or claiming an orangutan. Discard any unclaimed card. After all players are finished, lay out new orangutan cards (if needed), then play another round.<br/><br/>Once players have played all ten cards in hand, the game ends. Each player sums the points on the orangutan cards she claimed, then loses one point for each excess card tucked or collected card still on the table. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>All profits from sales of Old Men of the Forest will be donated to the Orangutan Foundation UK.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to hit the ground last. It's not much of a goal, but it's all you could think of on the way down.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;One player deals the cards, while the other players fall. There are no turns; everyone is playing at once. Players can play cards on each other, or on themselves. These cards are called &quot;riders,&quot; and they change how the dealer will deal. A &quot;Hit&quot; means &quot;Give me two cards.&quot; A &quot;Skip&quot; means &quot;Don't give me anything.&quot; And so on. Those Skips come in really handy at the end of the deck, when the dealer starts handing out the Ground cards. Catch a Ground card, and you're dead.&quot;<br/><br/>Falling is a real-time game, it takes as long to play as it takes to deal a deck of cards at a leisurely pace. You could literally play in less than a minute.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tactics was released in 1983 as a 25th Anniversary Edition of the first commercial cardboard-counter wargame. The original Tactics was notable for being the game that inspired Charles S. Roberts to found wargame giant The Avalon Hill Game Co. Since Tactics was a particularly rare wargame, it was an especially appropriate candidate for an The Avalon Hill Game Co anniversary reprint.<br/><br/>Tactics bore several similarities to both the original 1954 edition of Tactics and its 1958 redesign, Tactics II. The primary difference in the 25th Anniversary Edition was the unique mapboard layout. The map used in Tactics was said to have been based on an unpublished prototype that Charles S. Roberts had created for the original Tactics. In addition, the Anniversary Edition also included a colorful booklet which provided an illustrated overview of the first 25 years of The Avalon Hill Game Co.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Armed with a cab you travel the twisted streets of London picking and dropping off fares.<br/><br/>Each car has 20 points of movement each turn. Passenger cards with the pickup point listed are placed in 5 piles. Any player can pickup any passenger showing. When a passenger is picked up the player takes the card and a new card is turned over in that pile keeping 5 passengers available at all times. You can only have one passenger at a time. Upon picking up a passenger you also draw a destination card and you must drop off the passenger at that location. The fare is paid out from a chart that is very much like the payout chart in Rail Baron. Fares also pay out a small tip. Once a player has obtained 3 pounds (it's a British game) he can add another cab but you still have only 20 movement points to use.<br/><br/>The very large board is a true maze of one way and two-way streets. Cabs cannot move through other cabs and this can block streets that only have one lane. There are also 2 traffic jams placed each turn that block areas from movement and this also adds to the mayhem. Because of this the second cab can come in handy as it can allow you to use your full 20 points each turn but it will add to the congestion.<br/><br/>The victory conditions are left up to the players. &quot;The winner is the player with the most money earned in a specified time. Say an hour and a half, or two hours. Or a money limit can be set on the game. The first player to make 15 (pounds) or 20, being the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Rimtik is the name that macaws gave to this challenging party game, which has been transformed into a card game for those who like to play in nice homes far away from the tropical forests of South America.<br/><br/>In Rimtik, competing alone or in teams, players play cards on a shared discard pile. The cards show one or more feathers of various colors, and when you play a matching-colored card on top of an intact feather, then you must say a word that rhymes with the word last said; if the feather is broken, then you can keep your rhymes to yourself. Some broken feathers force players to race to slap the discard pile, with the last player drawing a new card from the deck. To win the game, you need to win a predetermined number of rounds. Macaw!<br/><br/>",

Set in the Caribbean and North Atlantic during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, SeaRovers recreates the true stories of the most fiendish filibusters and freebooters to ever roam the Spanish Main.<br/><br/>Historically accurate with unique and engaging game-play, SeaRovers combines; card-play and hand-management, dice-based combat, attacks and saving rolls, and a pick-up and delivery system that rewards tactics and planning. All brought to life on a hex-based map with actual locations of buccaneer and pirate attacks.<br/><br/>SeaRovers is also a visual tribute to history&rsquo;s classic illustrators Howard Pyle, Frank E. Schoonover, and N. C. Wyeth, whose work defined the archetypal image we all share of pirates today.<br/><br/>For 1 to 4 players, ages 14 to adult. Play-time averages 30 minutes per player with the Standard movement system (1-4 players, 30-120 minutes), 45 minutes per player with the Advanced movement system which uses wind and course direction (1-4 players, 45-180 minutes).&nbsp;<br/><br/>",

As their cards change, their loyalty may shift. The object of the game is to influence a majority of players to join your side (state or church). The church players must also have at least one player not imprisoned.<br/><br/>Unauthorized is unique from other social deduction games in a few ways. First, the player's loyalty may change during the game. Second, the mechanisms do not require a player to lie to effectively play the game. Third, to our knowledge this is the first game about an underground church. The game does not focus on theology, but does replicate the tension of living in an underground movement under heavy persecution from an oppressive government.<br/><br/>",

You play a card which is  placed next to cards in play to create compound words or phrases - as read down, or left to right.  The scores are the sum of the two cards - or more cards if in play.  You then draw a replacement card, keeping seven in hand.  The game ends when one player has played out their hand, or no player can play.

In every case there are resources - the so-called &quot;Nuts&quot; - to be collected that are needed to build ships, find colonies and gain technological advantages.<br/><br/>Every round every player can take risks to increase the number of his actions. Whoever is brave enough, can also attack the facilities of other races in order to take over their colonies.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who has found the greatest number of colonies will be the ruler of the galaxy.

The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.<br/><br/>SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice. The game system is loosely modeled on the HOUSE DIVIDED game system<br/><br/>",

Choose your side carefully because in the end it determines how many real points you've won!<br/><br/>RevoltaaA consists of a 66-card deck, with 7&times;0, 6&times;1, 5&times;2, 5&times;3, 5&times;4, and 5&times;5 cards in both ducks (red) and robots (blue). Each player starts with 11 cards in hand, and 11 cards are placed in a deck on the table. Each round, reveal the top card of the deck; each player then selects one card from hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whichever side - duck or robot &mdash; has the highest sum has won the round, and whoever has played the lowest card of this side wins these cards. (In a tie for lowest, the next lowest card of this side wins; if no cards of the winning side are unique, then the deck wins.) The winner stacks these cards and places a card of the winning side on top of this stack, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>As soon as a side has won four times, the game ends with this side being victorious. Each player scores one point for each stack in front of them that shows this side and one point for each card of this side still in hand. Whoever has the most points wins! (Alternatively, play a number of games equal to the number of players and sum your points over those games.)<br/><br/>RevoltaaA includes a &quot;bananas&quot; variant in which the face-down deck is not used and cards aren't played simultaneously. Instead one player leads a card face up, then each player lays down a card in turn, with the winner being chosen the same way and the first player breaking ties. The winner of one round leads the next, and points are scored as in the original game.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, two mission cards are on the table. One player is sent on one of these missions, but doesn't know which one whereas everyone else does know. This ignorant person has two stacks of item cards in front of them and starts the round by picking one of the two top items, showing it to the first player in clockwise order, and asking whether they will need the item for the mission. The other player may answer only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but can stress the words in any way they like.<br/><br/>Then the ignorant person picks another item and shows it to the next player, and so on. When the ignorant person has collected four &quot;yes&quot; cards, they have to guess what their mission is. If the guess is correct, the next round is played with an additional mission card, up to a maximum of five missions in play at one time. If the players can tell a good story about how to use the item, they get an extra point.<br/><br/>All &quot;no&quot; cards go as points to MacGivrette. If an ignorant person guesses the wrong mission, MacGivrette also gets the mission cards as a bonus (and the number of mission cards goes down by one). If any player answers anything else other than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, MacGivrette gets that item card as well.<br/><br/>When the group has solved a round with five mission cards, the game ends and they count their cards.

Action cards such as Peek, Steal, and Swap allow players to rearrange their grid and take cards from other players.  The hand ends once one player's cards are all face up.

Who will taste victory?<br/><br/>You can feel the racetrack vibrating - six of the best racers are fighting for victory today: Larry Leadfoot straightens his helmet, Thea Rocket revs up the engine, Captain Karacho is raring to make tracks, and off they go! The goal of all three game variations is to use the string to flick the vehicles along the racetrack. The player who proves themselves to be the most courageous and most willing to take risks will have the best chance of landing at the top of the podium! A fast-paced, action-packed flicking game for 2-4 players, ages 6-99. A popular and classic HABA game with over 100,000 copies sold in Europe, in a brand new design!<br/><br/>Sample Game 1:<br/><br/>How to play<br/>Take turns based on the order of the starting numbers. The player with the lowest starting<br/>number starts and rolls both dice.<br/>What do the dice show?<br/>&bull; Two matching colors<br/> Throw the dice again.<br/>&bull; Two different colors<br/> Take the flicking string and try to flick the race car matching the color on one of the die to<br/>another race car of the other color.<br/>Important: It mustn't come into contact with any another vehicles!<br/>Did you hit the right vehicle, and not touch another one in the process?<br/><br/>&bull; Yes:<br/> Brilliant! Take the gray trophy and put it on top of your own trophy, then advance one space<br/> towards the target.<br/> Whenever you have successfully flicked, you can choose between two options: <br/>1. Take a risk and carry on: Roll both dice again and continue as described above.<br/>2. Score points and end your turn; put your trophy in the place of the gray trophy and<br/> place the gray trophy back next to the points bar.<br/><br/>&bull; No:<br/> That's too bad! No points. If the gray trophy is displaying points that you already won, then<br/>you lose these points and the gray trophy is placed back next to the points bar.<br/>The player with the next starting number then takes their turn. Before rolling the dice, the<br/>player must fi rst check to see whether the distance between the sideline banners and the<br/>racing cars is at least the length of the short side of the drift block. If this is not the case,<br/>then the player may move the race cars accordingly.<br/><br/>End of the game<br/>The game ends when a player managers to reach the last space or beyond on the points bar<br/>with their trophy, and by doing so they win the &quot;Rumble Rage&quot;.<br/>Tips for experienced Rumble Racers:<br/>&bull; Double points: If you roll two of the same color and the gray trophy is already showing one<br/> or more points, then your go will score double points. Drag the gray trophy forward the<br/> exact same number of spaces that separate it from your trophy, then roll again.<br/>&bull; Drifting: If you use the drift block during your fl ick and it works, i.e. the fi rst vehicle bounces<br/> off the drift block before it hits the second vehicle, then you get an extra point and are<br/> allowed to move the gray trophy one space forward.<br/>&bull; Side banner crash: If you touch another vehicle with an outer band, then you do not receive<br/> any points and your turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A slapstick game of hockey management (endorsed by Howie Meeker, a Canadian hockey personality of the time).<br/><br/>Everybody knows that professional hockey game is won or lost on the ice, right?  Wrong.  The game that starts when the referee's whistle sounds is only half the story.  See that character on the end clutching the bankroll?  He's the team manager.  What you don't get to see is the game HE plays-and it's every bit as tough as the one on the ice.  Now's your chance to get the inside story.  In Face Off, you manage your own hockey franchise.  That means you have to scramble for league Superstars, trade players, and try to put together the strongest team you can --without running out of cash.  It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.<br/><br/>Of course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.<br/><br/>This game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.  If you liked Avalon Hill's Slapshot, you'll like Face Off.  The Canadian edition is bilingual with a two-sided board (English on one side, French on the other).<br/><br/>",

Whether you are a mere human, a ghoul, or an investigator, roam the streets of Tokyo, keep your identity a secret, investigate, and cover your tracks. The investigator and the ghoul want to find and kill each other, while the humans are trying to collect two or three of the same card. Players take actions during the game to pass around cards, which gives them information bit by bit about who each player might be.<br/><br/>It is up to you to uncover the other players' real natures and come out on top.

The poor old chef can't undo the spells because his vision is blurred, so the kitchen elves need to use magic potions to re-dye the bleached ingredients and try to protect them from the gluttonous magic garbage bin and further attacks from naughty students.<br/><br/>In Magi Kitchen, five wooden ingredients are placed in the middle of the table and the eighty cards are dealt out evenly among the players; cards show either a bleached food item (that is, a white carrot, white cucumber, etc.), a dye, a garbage can, or a student.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player turns over the top card from her draw pile and places it in a personal magic pile. If both a bleached ingredient and the matching colored potion are visible on players' magic piles, then players race to grab the proper wooden ingredient; whoever does so claims the magic piles showing these items and places them under her draw pile. If a rainbow magic potion is revealed, then it matches all bleached ingredients showing on magic piles and players can grab any of them. If a magic hungry garbage can is revealed, players instead race to cover a magic pile that shows a bleached ingredient, thereby protecting it from making its way to the trash; as a reward the player places the magic pile under her draw pile. Finally, if a naughty student card is revealed, everyone must race to perform the magic gesture shown on the card; whoever is the last to do so must maintain this gesture until the next student card is drawn.<br/><br/>The game ends when one or two players have run out of cards in their draw piles, and whoever has the most cards wins. Magi Kitchen includes advanced rules in which the active player, before revealing her card, decides whether to play on her own magic pile or that of her left- or right-hand neighbor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When the Boss tossed everyone a large pile of assignments all due tomorrow, there's not much choice but to stay overtime. Everyone just wants to go home, and will make sure they are the first to do so!<br/><br/>In Overtime, players take the roles of office workers, trying to finish up their assignments and go home. Everyone starts off as an Average Joe, the ordinary white collar worker, but as opportunities present themselves, you can show your true nature by becoming those Employee stereotypes like the Office Buddy, the Slacker, or the annoying Energy Vampire! Be the first player to get rid off all your assignment cards to win: You can acheive this by working hard and honestly, or be shady and play foul by passing off your assignments to the other players... play the cards dealt to you as best as you can! Of course, everything happens under the watchful eye of the Boss, so plan carefully.<br/><br/>All players draw from the same deck of cards, managing the resources they get to work and rest during their own turn, and interfere with their opponents during the turns of other players. A players actions depend on their Employee type, as it defines their action limit, card draw and hand size. The more you work, the more tired you get, making it harder to complete your tasks without resting to recharge. But while you take a break, other might use the opportunity to hand out their assignments to you, so watch out, and keep a Boss card in hand to defend yourself.<br/><br/>Overtime is a satirical take on those all to familiar real life situations people regularly experience, but in the form of a fun and competitive race. The clock ticks down the turns, and if no player manages to finish their tasks by midnight, when the 8th turn ends, no one wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore the dungeon each turn. Gather unique items and engage in combat with other players. The first player to get the Key and escape through the Gate wins. (Or the last player standing wins.) There are 12 unique characters called Keeyplings that players can play as. Each Keeypling has an attack, defense, and speed stat paired with a special ability. At the beginning of the game, players get two of these Keeyplings to pick from.<br/><br/>There are two main phases in The Keeyp, first the exploring phase and then the combat phase. You can explore a new area by moving your player, up to the number of speed you have, then drawing and laying down a Keeyp Tile. A Keeyp Tile can be a tunnel, crossroads, treasure chest, traps, and more.<br/><br/>Players will spend the first half of the game building out the map and finding treasure chests to collect weapons, shields, and items. Once the Key has been found, the combat phases begins. You can attack a player by landing on the same tile as them. Combat is determined by the players ATK stat verses the defending players DEF stat. These stats can be increased by using items. If your Keeypling is defeated, you then use your second Keeypling. If that Keeypling is defeated then you are out of the game.<br/><br/>There are two different ways to win in The Keeyp:<br/><br/>1. Safely make your way to the Gate Tile while holding the Key. (You can steal the Key from a player by defeating them in combat.)<br/>2. Defeating everyone in your path, while destroying friendships in the process.<br/><br/>Along the way there are traps and random events that damage the player, move the key back to the key tile, send you across the map, and even lose your turn. The dungeon feels like it's constantly changing making it strategic but enjoyably chaotic.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Deal each player a hand of four cards, then create a space next to the deck that can hold up to six cards.<br/><br/>Whoever has the lowest card in hand plays that card next to the deck, then refills their hand. Each player in turn plays a higher card, and when the sixth card is played in the row, discard all six cards, with the next player then playing whatever card they want. If you can't play on a turn, ask the previous player whether they have a card you can play; if they do, the two of you exchange cards, then you play.

        "description": "The game board is set up with 3D wall pieces that plug into the board, making a giant maze.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the Finish space.  Dice are rolled to allow a player to first move their pawn, and second to move walls.  The walls pivot around a point allowing the player to open new paths to the Finish, or to block opponents' paths to the Finish.<br/><br/>There are some special moves that a player may do when the player rolls doubles:<br/>1.  Change places with another player's pawn<br/>2.  Move through walls the number rolled (Double 4's means 4 spaces through walls)<br/><br/>    Note:  If option 1 or 2 is played, then the player forfeits their option to move walls.<br/><br/><br/>3.  Simply play the roll.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something more strategic than a dice rolling game, there is a second set of rules that eliminates the dice and makes the game more strategic.<br/><br/>There is also an option to add a &quot;Bad Guy&quot; to game play.  This gives the game an exciting element that makes the players play against each other and against the board.<br/><br/>The complete set of rules can be seen on the Kickstarter page:  <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/111778715/walls-race-through-a-changing-maze?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/111778715/walls-race-th...</a><br/><br/>",

The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.<br/><br/>The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;B, Country, Oldies.<br/><br/>The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Compa&ntilde;eros is a trick-taking game that includes six colored suits of cards, each numbered 1 through 10. In the game, you use as many suits as the number of players participating.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards, place a number of cards equal to the number of players face up on the table, then deal the remainder of the cards evenly amongst the players.<br/><br/>The starting player opens the trick by playing any card of his hand. The other players follow by playing any card from their hand. (Players are not obligated to match suit, and the game uses no trump.) After each player has played to the trick, the players add up the individual card values for each suit (color) separately.<br/><br/>The trick is won by the player(s) who have played a card in the color with the highest total. The player who played the highest card in that color gets to choose all cards of a color of his choice from the cards in the middle and keeps them as victory points. Then, the player with the second highest card in that color gets to choose, etc. Finally, the cards that were played during the trick are placed in the middle of the table for the next trick. If two or more colors are tied with high value, then no one who played in those colors (or any colors with a lower sum) scores any cards.<br/><br/>Once all nine tricks have been played, players add up the values of the cards they won during the game. The player with the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's a balmy summer evening, and you're sitting with your family on the terrace, playing a few games. A perfect evening &mdash; that comes to a sudden end as a flock of mosquitos is lured by the light of your lamp!<br/><br/>In Mosquitozzz, you have to fight off the attack of this swarm to lose as little of your blood as possible. To keep yourself from being stung, you cover yourself with many repellents, and if all else fails, you still have your hand ready to slay the attackers. How will you defend yourself against the mosquitos?<br/><br/>Mosquitozzz can be played either competitively or co-operatively.<br/><br/>- Game play<br/><br/>Each player has his own set of cards. At the beginning of the game each player draws 5 cards from his deck.<br/>In the player's turn these cards can be used to avoid the attacks of the mosquitoes. Then they go on an individual discard pile. <br/>At the end of the turn the player chooses one new card from a set of stronger &quot;experience cards&quot;. This new card also goes on the player's individual discard pile. <br/>When the player runs out of cards in his deck he grabs his discard pile, shuffles the cards and builds a new deck.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn the player sends all remaining mosquito cards from his hand into the swarm and gives the lamp card to another player.<br/>The swarm follows the light and then attacks this player. Before the active player can defend himself against the swarm the other players have the opportunity to play one concealed card.<br/>They can either play a mosquito card which will reinforce the swarm or a defense card to support the active player (e.g. in the co-operative play).<br/><br/>- &quot;Slap your luck&quot;<br/><br/>While defending against the mosquitoes the player can play a card named &quot;Flache Hand&quot;. Normally you play at least one card of this kind in your turn.<br/>If you do, you take a number of markers inside your hands, shuffle them and slap them on the table.<br/>The markers show a living mosquito on one side and a dead mosquito on the other side - so this slap determines how many mosquitoes finally survive the player's defense.<br/>It is allowed to play multiple cards &quot;Flache Hand&quot; in a row.<br/><br/>- Target of the game<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 drops of blood (wooden).<br/><br/>Competitive play: <br/>The game ends when one player runs out of blood. The player who has the most blood drops left wins the game.<br/><br/>Co-operative play: <br/>The players win the game as a team if no player runs out of blood until the deck of &quot;mosquito cards&quot; is empty.<br/><br/>",

Pan t'es Mort is back with a new edition, improved artworks and a new mechanism: The &quot;double draw&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is separated into two phases.<br/><br/>Phase one is a trick-taking game with simultaneous card selection. First we check for ties. The tie numbers are gone and then the highest card wins. Cards are 1 to 6. Four times per card.<br/><br/>If after the first check we have a 1 card and a 6, then the 1 card wins the trick.<br/><br/>So now all keep the winning trick cards and we are ready for phase 2.<br/><br/>Phase 2 is Russian roulette, a game of chance. We have 6 cards (bullet cards) in the middle of the table, as a revolver. 5 &quot;Clic&quot; cards and one with a bullet...<br/><br/>On your turn (beginning with the player with the most cards from phase one):<br/>You can draw a card (pull the trigger) or you can discard one card from that you collect before, to shuffle all open bullet cards back together and then draw one, you just spin the cylinder of the revolver, (no point to do it if you have to draw the first bullet)<br/>or you can discard as many cards as alive players in the game to pass your turn to the next player. Finally, you can also choose to reveal two consecutive open bullet cards: If you survive, you'll be able to steal cards from other players!<br/><br/>When you draw we check if you die or live from the bullet card.<br/>If you stay alive the game continues to the next player. If you die we shuffle the bullet cards and continue with the player with most cards.<br/><br/>Last man standing is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rabid fans wear their favorite team's colors and gather in virtua-bars to watch the battles. It's the perfect time for a savvy gambler to get filthy rich...even if you have to cheat just a little bit.<br/><br/>In Atlantic Robot League, players place bets on the outcome of a massive mech battle the size of a dozen city blocks. After bets are placed, they get the chance to influence the battle by sliding the mechs across the arena, knocking out rivals, and buying scheme cards from the insider to bend the rules. Particularly devious gamblers might even pay the fixer to change their bets during the battle.<br/><br/>Occasionally your opponents will be helping a shared bet; occasionally they'll be knocking out mechs you need to survive. Since all bets are hidden, you won't know until the end and might even be able to bluff an opponent into accidentally doing exactly what you want.<br/><br/>Five mech teams face off, each with three robots, and in each of three rounds, you bet on which team will have the most surviving mechs, which will KO the most mechs, which team will be eliminated first, and which five robots will be standing at round's end. The fewer the players who bet correctly, the bigger the payout for those who do. After three rounds, whoever has bet best wins.<br/><br/>",

You place the card on the stack face down, so now the back of the card will be shown.<br/><br/>&bull; Kumbi Zabuni is a Perudo variant. All players have five cards in front of them, with the back sides known only to their owner. Every player in turn can either call or bet as to how many of a particular symbol are showing; a bet has to be higher than the previous bet. If you do not believe the bet, you can call it. The losing player will have one less card in the next round.<br/><br/>&bull; Kumbu Kadi is a simple card game in which the highest cards score. You place your card in the middle of the table, then count both front and back. Highest number wins.<br/><br/>More games and variants will supposedly be available on the publisher's website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The hamsters have escaped their enclosure at the zoo and are making a run for it! Suddenly they come across a pond and see their most prized possession, the lily flower!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, lurking below the surface is a hippo waiting for his favorite snack. The hamsters have to take a risk and gather as many flowers as they can before all of the hippo's friends arrive to join in on the feast!<br/><br/>The game lasts 4 rounds with each player representing a little hamster. The player with the most flowers at the end of 4 rounds wins. Each round ends when hamster is eaten.<br/><br/>Each round, add another hippo card to the deck before shuffling and dealing the cards out. Since extra cards are placed to the side, the extra hippos may or may not be on the board.<br/><br/>The game goes 4 rounds, with the winner being the player with the most flowers collected during the game. If there is a tie after the 4th round, keep adding rounds (with the 4 hippo cards) until a winner is declared.<br/><br/>Playing a round:<br/><br/>A round ends as soon as a hippo card is flipped. Any hamsters that are still on grid when this card is flipped, lose all the flowers that they collected that round. Shuffle the cards adding a hippo, then deal out the next pond to start the next round.<br/><br/>Taking turns, each player ventures out onto a lily pad, starting by moving onto any card along the edge of the grid.<br/><br/>Each turn, they must either move, or spend 2 flowers to peak under an un-flipped card.  If they move, they must move onto an adjacent card (including diagonals). When landing on that card, they can collect any flower that is on top of it, and then must flip the card and perform the action (if any) underneath. If there are flowers underneath, they collect those too from the flower pile. Once a card has been flipped, a player can no longer step back on to it. Player can take up to 2 moves per turn, no including forced moves made from flipped cards.<br/><br/>Players can move off the board (from any lily pad on the edge) to safety during their turn. If they do so, they are out for the remainder of that round, but keep anything they collected in their permanent storage<br/><br/>Players can keep going until a hippo card is flipped, or until the last player has moved out of the pond<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A British campaign in the late summer of 1777 had defeated George Washington's American army to capture Philadelphia. The British dispersed their strength to hold the city, reduce Colonial forts along the Delaware River, and watch the Americans, who hovered nearby. Washington saw an opportunity to attack the weakened British at Germantown. The complicated American plan fell apart in dense fog, but a few breaks going their way would have endangered the British position in eastern Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Germantown uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>     Level: Battalion/Brigade<br/>     Hex: 352 yards<br/><br/><br/>",

You could spend the rest of the day helping those miserable, wretched wastes of human skin who come in and demand service, or you could do what you always wanted - tell them were to go and have a good time. And you know which one it&rsquo;s going to be...<br/><br/>From the instructions.<br/><br/>In Severance each player assumes the role of one the characters at the store. They can steal items from the store, slack off, or keep performing their work duties. Each activity has risks and rewards. The player scores points after successfully slacking off and after taking their stolen goods to their locker. When a player gets caught (by the boss) doing something wrong they gain heat. Heat also naturally rises during the game. When a player reaches 30 they are fired. The game ends when all of the players but one are fired or the event deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>Five Fingered Severance is a take that game. To gain points the players will have to open themselves up to the other player's attacks. I want the game to be more tactical though, so the plot cards in the deck are limited to just a few types of cards. This allows players to know about what they are getting when they take a turn to refresh their hand.<br/><br/>",

The target Lily Pad Card is determined by the top card in a stack of score cards depicting 1 to 4 bugs.

Those are but few aspects the players wrestle with as they try to convince the deep rows of the people behind their own agenda.<br/><br/>The players all live in the same society and seek influential power to leave their mark on the surrounding world. The people's opinions, what they feel and think, is determined by four societal values &ndash; militarism, economy, human values &amp; green values.<br/><br/>The players have game cards which become &rdquo;hot topics&rdquo; in the society once they are played. They will become the issues the imaginary townsfolk talk in coffee tables, what they read from the news and what shapes their view on the world. These issues then shape the four values, but also bring points through them. This means that the more militaristic the society is the more militaristic influence points you get from cards like 'Raise in Defence Budget' or 'War on Terrorism'. With these points you then push through laws that focus on that value. Only these law cards that the players have pushed through with their political influence they get victory points. And as each value has limited amount of laws there is a race who stands as the best advocate for each value.<br/><br/>Most cards have special abilities that makes them stronger with certain other cards (i.e. Feminism with Equality) or for example prevent certain points to be scored (i.e. Torture Scandal on militarism points or UN in Crisis on Human value points).<br/><br/>As the game proceeds the players try to sell their world view to the masses. But whether the well-being of the people is trampled as the players thirst for power and whether that society is still worth defending for? That is what the players decide all over again during each game they play the Modern Society.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The Napoleon at War classics are being updated to a brigade-level system with artillery largely in separate units.<br/><br/>After crossing the Alps in 1800 and advancing into northern Italy, Napoleon overextended his army in an attempt to ambush a portion of the Austrian army. Misreading the situation, the hunter became the hunted when the main Austrian army in Italy, over 30,000 soldiers with 100 cannon, advanced against Napoleon's 18,000 troops and dozen cannon on the Marengo plain. Perceiving the danger, Napoleon urgently summoned his reserves and wayward detachments, bringing his strength up to near parity with the Austrians. It was just enough to forge victory from a potential disaster.<br/><br/>Marengo utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber combat system, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Napoleonic era while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, while reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.<br/><br/>A new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that era. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Supply trains and headquarters help armies function smoothly, forcing players to protect their logistical base. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a party game played with partners. A card is drawn which instructs the players to write down a list of things like: cartoon animals, round fruit, pizza toppings, Jim Carry Movies etc. Players then compare their lists with their partners. The team with the most matches advances their pawn on the game board, and the first team to reach Brain Central wins.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/>Would you write the same things down when you are asked to make a list of pizza toppings? Things found in a fish tank? TV game shows? <br/> You'll find out when you play Like Minds. <br/> Players sit across from their game partner. The Like Mind's brain is put in reach of everyone. The category is read out loud for all players to hear ...but only ONE player from each team knows how many matches are needed to win the round. <br/> Everyone starts writing answers to the category. As soon as you think you and your partner have the number of matches needed, you grab the brain. Now compare your list with your partner's. <br/> Here's an example: The category is &quot;things teenagers do in their spare time.&quot; You know you and your partner only need three matches. You write down whatever comes to mind, hoping that it comes to your partner's mind too. &quot;Listen to music&quot;, &quot;watch TV&quot;, &quot;play sports&quot;, &quot;use the internet&quot;. <br/> Did you match at least three? If so, you win the round and get to move ahead on the game board. The more matches you and your teammate make, the faster you'll get to Brain Central and the win! <br/> Includes game board, 35 game cards with 420 categories, 4 folders, dice, dice cup, brain, movers, pads, and instructions<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Airport, the goal is to create the most profitable airline. The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.<br/><br/>When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).<br/><br/>The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.<br/><br/>",

The duration of each game session will be based on the number of missions played.<br/>The main characteristic of DemLoc is to switch between skirmish game sessions against other players and individual game sessions planning and improving a player own Guild.  <br/>The namesake app makes the game more dynamic and lets the players keep track of their progresses, helping them during missions in the damned city of DemLoc. <br/>DemLoc is a board game strictly integrated with its relevant app; for this reason there are two different game modes:<br/>Individual game: exclusively on the app, which allows the players to manage their cards and their Guild acquiring buildings and improving those already acquired (e.g. enlarging the space of the Dormitory to enlist more mercenaries). In addition, the players could explore the city of DemLoc and could access to exclusive functions improving their knowledge of the world of DemLoc and making their Guild more powerful;<br/>Group game: using the material at their disposal, the players could fight in different missions to gain the control over relevant spots in different areas of the city of DemLoc, increasing their fame and gaining gold (feods). <br/>The app shows the players the objective of the mission (taken from a database; it could range from killing opponent characters to collecting objects on the map) and the map (taken from a database). Using the modular map, the players design the setting.<br/>Using the app, the players choose the mercenaries in the Guild who will join the mission. The game can start once the players have picked their cards and have placed the miniatures on the map.<br/>The game lasts from 5 to 10 turns (based on the objective and on the number of players). On each turn, the players could move their miniatures on the map using the square grid. Characters could shoot, cast spells, conjure daemons, and take part into hand-to-hand fights.<br/>The app is used to apply hits and status to the characters. At the end of the mission, the winner receives Fame points and gold (feods). The Guild uses the Fame to level up (thus being able to enlist more or stronger people). Gold is used to buy new weapons and Arcane Code for the mercenaries.<br/>In each game, the winner could conquer part of the city. His conquest will be shown on the map in the app.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The bottom left corner, the center and the top right corner are starting spaces for the three musketeers. All other spaces are initially occupied by &quot;enemies.&quot; Musketeers can only move to adjacent spaces with an enemy piece, which is captured by this move. Enemies can only move to empty adjacent spaces. Enemies win if all three musketeers are ever on the same line or column. Musketeers win as soon as they run out of legal moves.<br/><br/>Musketeers will start the game. According to Wikipedia the game was strongly solved in 2009 by Johannes Laire. The enemies (that could be called Cardinal Richelieu's men) can always force a own win. References are missing but due to the restricted amount of available moves for the Musketeers and the strict, clear, and simple rule set proof is possible with acceptable effort with same result.<br/><br/>",

To do this, at the start of your turn you roll two dice, then move forward a distance equal to either of the dice or the sum of them. If you want the tile on which you land, you can place it in your wheelbarrow. The trick, however, is that you need to remember all of the tiles that you've already acquired because once you reach the end of the road you try to fill in your blueprint from bottom to top with those tiles; for each wrongly collected tile, you must discard one that's perfect for your plan. Whoever first manages to use the colored tiles to build their predetermined anthill wins.<br/><br/>The Ants Go Marching includes anthills of different levels to allow players of different skill levels to compete more evenly.<br/><br/>",

This time, our beloved character changes the 221B of Baker Street for feudal Japan to investigate a mysterious theft at the palace. However, this is a case he can't solve alone, and he will need your help to figure out what was stolen, who did it, and where.<br/><br/>In Sherlock in Time, each player is investigating a crime on their own. You start with a hand of clue cards that show one of four suspects, one of three locations, and one of three stolen objects. One of the clue cards in your hand faces the other players, not you, and you must identify the three symbols on this secret card in order to solve your crime.<br/><br/>On a turn, place a card from your hand face up. The other players will tell you how many symbols on the revealed card &mdash; 0, 1, or 2 &mdash; match the symbols on your secret card, but not which ones. Place the revealed card on a reminder card so that you can remember how many clues matched, then either end your turn or attempt to identify the three symbols on your secret card. (Remember that you can see the secret card held by each other player, in addition to their revealed cards.) If you're correct, you score points based on how many others have already guessed their secret card; if you're incorrect, you're out of the round.<br/><br/>The game lasts three rounds, and once during the game you can spend your honor card to learn whether one specific symbol is on your secret card. An unused honor card serves as a tiebreaker, so don't spend it unless you have to. At the end of three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Once you're comfortable with the game, you can add additional clue cards that introduce a fourth stolen object, which makes the game more challenging.<br/><br/>Sherlock in Time is a game with easy and straightforward rules which you can extend with Watson in Time. With this game mode you'll get extra assistants with special skills that make the game more fun and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Will you be clever enough to solve the mystery that haunts the palace and earn Sherlock Holmes' respect?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1961 is a Cold War card game where players take turns bolstering their nation, spying on enemies, and launching missiles. As tensions mount, the threat of nuclear war looms overhead, and players strive toward technological victory, world peace, or mutually assured destruction.<br/><br/>Players take turn drawing one card, playing one card, and activating any available buildings. There are three ways to play a card - as an Action (one-time use), as a Building (permanent, destructible resource), or as Supply (face down on a building, acting defensively).<br/><br/>Launching missiles is the primary mechanic of the game. Players must take caution though, as each launch risks activating enemy counter missile known as Response Systems.<br/><br/>1) Win the Space Race by stacking five cards on your Moon Lander.<br/>2) Build 3 Embassies to achieve diplomatic world peace.<br/>3) Be the sole survivor of a nuclear wipeout.<br/><br/>- Description from the Publisher<br/><br/>",

In this game, players try to collect as many treasures as they can while they try to avoid fighting with brigands and other ruffians.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the 10 stacks (differed by color and number) of cards (with treasures and brigands) are formed in the middle of the table. Each player receives 2 or 3 characters.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they have to choose one of the following two actions:<br/>1. Take one card from one of the stacks and place it face up in front of them.<br/>2. Send all previously gathered cards to the castle using one of their characters.<br/><br/>Players try to gather as many cards as they can, but the more they have, the more risk they have to lose it all. What's more, action 2 can be performed only 2 or 3 times per game (each character can be sent once). The players also try to remember in which stack the bad cards were taken, because every stack contains the same set of cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the players have sent all their characters or when nobody has anything more to send and there are no cards to draw. Players now count up their treasure cards. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>There is also an advanced variant which players can choose to play with: It includes the 10 bonus point card, which is given at the end of the game to the player who gathered the most coins amongst their treasures. Also, when a player draws the appropriate card, they have to give it to another player, and then steal all the coins from that chosen player.<br/><br/>",

They then each secretly use their location dials to declare their intended meeting point.<br/><br/>The Mods, in a short amount of time, then have to determine where they expect the Dissidents to meet by inferring their intent from a book of every possible code set the subversives could use, and agree upon a location to direct a state raiding party.<br/><br/>Once they've agreed on a location, the Dissidents each reveal their location dials. Depending on whether the majority of Dissidents have successfully coordinated at a single location, or the Mods have caught them in an attempt at subversion will determine whether that location becomes 'hacked' or 'moderated'.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, moderated locations produce potential accomplices for the Dissidents to recruit, as undesirables are driven from now sanitized districts. However, as the Dissidents progress their mission to 'hack' as many locations as possible, the Moderators strike back with increasing numbers of surveillance outposts, installed to limit the Dissident's ability to move around the city undetected.<br/><br/>",

In Parsec: Age of Colonies you can achieve victory in different ways: taking control of space economic system, colonizing most of the planets or crushing your enemies one by one with your war fleet. Turn in your favor cosmic events like black holes, space-time distorsions, meteor swarms and much more. During the struggle for total domination, you will have the chance to break through new scientific discoveries that will let you develop your space navigation capability, your weapons and your defenses, helping you achieve your goals. Watch your enemies, because they won't just seat there.<br/>They will oppose you by all means with sabotage, spying, interfering in your commercial negotiations or stealing your technologies and vessels. Ally with your opponents in order to gain strategic advantages or striking down more powerful enemies. <br/>Will you colonize the Galaxy to control its riches or will you use them to move to war against your enemies? This call is only yours! In Parsec: Age of Colonies in order to found a new galactic empire, players must colonize the planets and take control of asteroids, building colonies and cargo ships that will let them extract the three key resources: Titanium, Gold and Energy. <br/>Using a blend of strategy and war tactics, you must find the right balance to achieve your goals, taking advantage of the peculiar abilities of your Faction and of the rich deck of Event cards divided in four categories: <br/><br/>     Strategic Events [ Technologies, Weapons, Tactical actions ]<br/>     Natural Events [ Black holes, Asteroid fields and similar ]<br/>     Bonus Events [ Additional resources, Vessels ]<br/>     Permanent Events [ Building capabilities, Attack and Defense ]<br/><br/><br/>With the modular game board, the Event cards and the Faction cards, every game will be different.

In Parsec - Age Of Colonies this is not true, the game is very simple and easy to learn. All the technology has been moved onto the cards. The cards decide your faction, the faction (almost) decide your strategy. Cards are divided in four classes (strategic, natural, bonus and permanent) and are constantly flowing through players that can buy, use, steal or sell them in order to achieve specific goals. This approach, along with dice rolling, the modular board and the factions randomness, add a virtually endless replay value to the game. Players can bind alliances on the fly to combat against other players when they are too close to victory, but without knowing the enemy's card deck it will be anyway a difficult task. Parsec - Age Of Colonies is much more deeper than it looks at a first glance.<br/><br/>Quick and easy trading capabilities also has been added, just to add some spice to the overall tense taste of the game.<br/>Over a year in play-testing, polishing the design and refining gameplay, adding more depth to various elements of the game.<br/>The game rules are rock-solid and fully scalable, and have been thoroughly tested considering all possible game scenarios.<br/>The rules are simple yet deep enough even for the more demanding gamers.<br/>The cards, as said, play a pivotal role in the gameplay.

The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Adding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.<br/><br/>Re-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guests arrive at a mansion for what they hope will be a relaxing weekend, but alas the calm of Friday night is broken when a cry of fright rings out. The guests wake up and gather only to be horrified with the discovery of the lifeless body of one of them. Who could have killed him? And more importantly, who will be the next victim?<br/><br/>Fatal Rendez Vous plays a bit like Werewolf, with most players belonging to one group while one or more of them secretly work against the group. Each player receives a role card at the start of play. Each night in the game, while everyone has their eyes closed, one of the secret assassins taps another player on the shoulder; this player counts to ten, then dies. Day comes, and everyone runs around in a tizzy &mdash; specifically turning in circles three times &mdash; during which time the other assassin winks at someone, killing that person as well.<br/><br/>The guests handcuff two players during the day, and those two players take no actions for the next day. This pattern continues until three days pass. If the assassins have been handcuffed together during the weekend, then the other guests win, having captured the evildoers; if not, however, the assassins claim the victory.<br/><br/>Fatal Rendez Vous includes special role cards that mix up play, for example, with a player who becomes a vampire after death, taking out the assassin and murdering people on his own. Another player might have a weak heart and perish after only five seconds, giving the assassin less time to find cover.<br/><br/><br/>From TricTrac:<br/><br/>Le D&eacute;fifoo Noir (subtitled Friday the 13th at the Castle) is a game inspired by Cluedo and Agatha Christie&rsquo;s 12 Little Indians and is another game in the lineage of Werewolf. It is designed by Olivier Finet, principal designer at D&eacute;fifoo SA. The game can accommodate 5 to 20 players and play time is estimated at 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Players are given a special role representing either an innocent guest at the castle or a sinister murderer. The players are invited to investigate the murders and hopefully throw the right suspect(s) in prison. In this game however, people are free to move around during the day phases and interact freely with one another, thereby using all of their senses to nab their victims/assailants. These negotiation phases however are timed and last only 3 minutes. Making things harder on the poor guests, the murders happen both at night and during the day over a maximum of 5 turns. The game components include the role cards, a pair of handcuffs (for the culprits), a timer and a bowtie for the Castle&rsquo;s host (game overseer).<br/><br/>",

Go on a quest to win silverware, build your team, trade players and show your friends who the best manager is. All the illustrations were made especially for Hattrick, completely in the Hattrick style. The cards in the game will contain the English, German, Spanish, Italian and French Language. The manual that comes with the game will only be in English, however a free downloadable version will be available for all other main languages.<br/><br/>Your task is to manage your own club and become the most successful by winning as many trophies (league, cup and international cup) as possible. To do this you need to build a strong team, and outsmart the others managers&rsquo; strategies.<br/><br/>The game is played by moving a marker around a season calendar. Whenever a match day is reached, matches will be played. The teams consist of player cards that every manager will put into formation before the games. Based on these formations, dice will then decide the outcome. As the season goes by, players can be sold and bought, contracts can be extended, injuries and suspensions may appear, players may go on international duties, and you may have to fight against bankruptcy, or end up swimming in money. But remember, money is far from everything - winning will always be about football.<br/><br/>The game contains a hundred unique player cards of different nationalities, strengths and positions. Furthermore there are international cup cards, and action/strategy cards that can be used to influence matches.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 2 to 4 people, but was mainly designed for 4 players. You decide yourself how many seasons to play, which mean you decide the length of the game. One season takes about 30-45 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

Thus Fortuna is much less random than Monopoly.<br/><br/>- There are four &quot;restaurants&quot; and three &quot;railway stations&quot; spaces instead of 4 railway stations in original Monopoly.<br/><br/>- In addition to a possibility of being sent to hospital (an equivalent of prison) players have an option to go to vacation.<br/><br/>Other rules are very similar to the rules of Monopoly.<br/><br/>The board represents Warsaw in 1901.<br/><br/>",

Based on the bestselling Love, Lies, and Hocus Pocus book series.<br/><br/>You must collect (or steal) the 5 items necessary to build your assigned artifact, while simultaneously trying to prevent the other players from collecting theirs. The first to successfully assemble their artifact will save the magical library and gain the favor of Sir Edgar Allan Kipling, Magical Talking Cat Extraordinaire.<br/><br/>Designed for 2-5 players. Gameplay lasts about 15-30 minutes. For those with younger family members who want to join, the content is appropriate for all ages, but whether they are wily and sneaky enough to win is all up to them!  During the game each player can take two actions on their turn in which they can draws cards, play items or use various action cards to steal, swap or otherwise manipulate the cards on the table or in players hands to try to gather the items needed to complete their artifact.<br/><br/>This game can be enjoyed on its own, as well as provide readers of the Love, Lies, and Hocus Pocus books amusing and delightful insights into the series. Every card contains a Sir Kipling quote from the books, and all the artifacts and items are taken straight from the book series.<br/><br/>",

Press the lever and watch his arm stretch up,up and away.  Oh No!  The tray tips, dishes fall.  Now you'll have to keep them all.<br/><br/><br/>The Stacking Game of Spills &amp; Thrills<br/><br/>This game features Manuel the waiter, who has an incredibly long arm.  At the start of the game you wind Manuel's arm into his body, place a plastic tray onto his raised hand and you're ready to play.  Each player is then given the same number of dishes (but not necessarily the same of each type) and then, in turn, each player flicks a spinner which tells him how many 3D objects to place on Manuel's tray - plates, bowls, glasses, cups and saucers.<br/><br/>So far, it's just a simple balancing game.  But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.<br/><br/>Very similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .<br/><br/>",

It is different from the adult versions due to simplified rules and illustrations designed specifically for kids.<br/>The object of the game is incredibly simple &mdash; you must get rid of your cards before your opponents do. You will be helped by a team of Superpigs. Meet our heroes: the super-fast Lightning Pork, the Greedy-Piggy, the Cunning-Piglet, the Cool-Beans Pig, the color-changing Pigameleon, the secretive Mystery-Piggy and the strict Ms. Sauerbraten.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Swintus Junior is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards. Goal of the game &ndash; empty youre hand and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs. Swintus Junior players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn. There are special piggy cards which makes game more interesting, not easy and much funny.<br/><br/>Game contents<br/><br/><br/>    28 Superpig cards of 7 types<br/>    64 Number cards of 4 colors <br/><br/><br/>",

There are also a bunch of other whimsical figures, such as killer sloths and armadillo guardians, that come with their own perks.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to ultimately protect your kingdom, by ensuring your Llama King or Queen remains standing, which you can do by keeping their cards in your possession until the very end. You can also win by collecting 3 Buddha Llamas, but this can be reduced to 2 with the right combination of cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves tactical scheming through the use of various card types: Action, Magic, and Collectibles, and drawing a card from the deck ends your go.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s essentially the luck of the draw, but you must devise strategies, use your wit, and play combinations of cards to battle against other players, in an attempt to force them to remove their valuable cards and lose the round.<br/><br/>There are other dangers lurking within the deck too, as drawing certain cards can mean instant death. However, there are ways to deflect this and Llamasters offers its players several routes back towards victory even when you&rsquo;re on the brink of giving up.<br/><br/>One of the unique points of the game is the use of augmented reality, which if used, can allow players to re-enter a round they have already been knocked out of. The augmented reality app also includes enchanting animations to complement the gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now everything is in turmoil, and people are going to search in the depths of the mountain range for its hiding place. This task won't be easy, however, as without the proper items from the village you'll have no chance of defeating the creatures waiting to be found in the dungeon. Take too long to collect the sword, shield and dragon antivenom required, though, as others might have already found the magic items or treasure of the dragon by then.<br/><br/>In DrachenSchatten, everyone is in the village and the dungeon looking for different objects, treasures and creatures, and they'll need to perform the action or function of the different items so they can reach their goal without being defeated by dragons and hydras along the way.<br/><br/>",

Players take the role of a lord or lady vying after the kingdom of Kazath after a tragic &quot;accident&quot; left Kazath's previous ruler without an heir and without a head.<br/><br/>The key to victory is holding the Onyx Crown, the symbol of rulership. Gain the Onyx Crown or help someone else take it and you earn legitimacy, gain 9 legitimacy points and hold the Onyx Crown to be named the new rightful ruler of Kazath.<br/><br/>But first, you must gain the backing of a house. Secretly bidding for a house's support. With a house by your side you must convince the others why it would benefit them if you were to hold the Crown and become Regent for the turn. Using bribery, promises and your lordly cunning. Deploy your army secretly on the field. Supporting yourself, or perhaps another. Finally, when your army emerges victorious take the Onyx Crown and be named Regent. Distributing rewards to those who are loyal to you. But beware, loyalties can change swiftly, those who may seem like your allies could actually be your greatest threat.<br/><br/>",

It is simple to learn, but has lots of room for strategy and rewards repeat playing. Speakeasy can be played at home, in a pub, or anywhere the group can fit. It is not turn-based and is played as you move around and mingle (or avoid) other players - the game happens continuously at the speed of your strategy.<br/><br/>Itʼs the Roaring Twenties, and corruption is on the rise in your city. The Mob rules the streets, and its reach extends even further&mdash;to the police force, the courts, and even City Hall. The Mobʼs crews of thieves, hitmen, bootleggers, dirty lawyers, speakeasy owners, con artists and cops on the take think they hold the real reins of power in this city.<br/><br/>The long arm of the law has grown shorter of late, but citizens have reason to hope. An organization of crime fighters unafraid to take a stand has emerged as a force strong enough to oppose the Mob. This crew of untouchables, vigilantes, undercover cops, honest politicians, and special agents are rallying under the new Federal Marshal in town, proving the city the forces of good might be down, but they arenʼt out!<br/><br/>Now itʼs time for you to choose a side and play your part in deciding the fate of the city&mdash;for better or worse.<br/><br/>Speakeasy is a game of creative deception, hidden identities, and strategy. To start, one player volunteers as Moderator and gives everyone a secret role on one of two teams: the Mob or the Feds. The fog of war is thick in the beginning, as playersʼ first task is to use their secret passwords to identify who to trust. As the game goes on, players learn how to hustle as they continue to identify and organize their teammates, discover the other teamʼs secrets, sow misinformation, infiltrate the opposition, and score points&mdash;all while watching their own backs. Play ends after one hour, and the winning team is the one that accrues the most points.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to react as fast as possible with the appropriate action.<br/><br/>When the turned card shows a team member of another player you have to take the ball in your color and throw it to this player (you shoot the player with a paintball), but the victim can protect himself by taking all the balls away so the other players can't shoot. Because citizens look the same as the other players (but they don't carry a gun) it is easy to shoot a citizen by mistake. You also should be alert for the police. You don't want to shoot when a police card is turned. A few other special cards add some extra surprises to the game.<br/><br/>(Street Paintball was released at Spiel 2008)<br/><br/>",

Monsters may not be the scariest foes you face, though, as you will also be playing against other people who have the same goal as you: survival!<br/><br/>Be assured that your &ldquo;friends&rdquo; will do whatever they can to protect themselves not only from the horde of monsters, but from any and all of the tricks that you may use throughout the game. At the end of the game, only one player&rsquo;s house will be left standing -- will it be yours?!<br/><br/>Summary of play: Every turn has several steps including Action, Player, movement/combat, cleanup.<br/><br/>In the action phase, an action card is flipped and there is a number indicating how many monsters enter the current player's field. Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player.<br/><br/>In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player's fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand.<br/><br/>In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat.<br/><br/>In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total.<br/><br/>The player who is the last person standing is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Each round, they have to outbid each other backwards so that the least greedy one may choose the first cards of the current pool; more specifically, each player in turn declares how many cards they want to take, and whoever declares the smallest number takes that many cards. (A player can declare 0.5 less than the number they want to take, and if they do so, they return one card from their hand to the center.) The remaining players then bid for the rest of the cards, with this process repeating until each player takes cards.<br/><br/>Each treasure has its own scoring rules depending on how many you have or how they combine with other cards in your collection. After resolving all cards this way, the player with the highest value of goods wins.<br/><br/>",

It uses a combination of conflicting visual and verbal cues to disrupt automated processes used by brain the for language and color identification. While the neuroscience is complicated, the game is simple and easy to learn. The inclusion of profanity adds to the challenge while dozens of optional NSFW and drinking rules escalate things to another level. In short, when the eyes, brain and mouth don&rsquo;t agree, things get tricky.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>All players start with the same number of cards and are not allowed to look at their hand. Players take turns flipping over their top card and placing it face up in the middle of the table. Depending on the card flipped over, the player that flipped the card must either read the word on the card, identify the color of the card, or shout out a swear word. If they say the correct response, the card stays on the table and the next player takes their turn. If they hesitate or get it incorrect, any other player can call out their mistake. The player that messed up must then pick up all the cards from the table. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.<br/><br/>",

You determined to keep your job, have returned &ndash; only to find the situation is even more turbulent then before: more planes, less controllers, and high competition. <br/>But that doesn't faze you, because you are an AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER.<br/><br/>In this turbulent game you control 7 planes, of which 5 must reach your landing strip to win! You have three actions each turn with which you may: Take-Off, Move across one Air Current, Rotate, or Swap<br/>Seems simple right? Not exactly. Rotating and Swapping can only be done if your planes are touching the tiles so the more planes you have on the board, the more power you have. In the mean time your opponent will be trying to get their planes in and pushing or crashing (yes you can collide into other planes) to prevent you from getting there first! You'll be swapping, pushing, rotating, crashing, landing, taking-off, and triple pushing in this game of TURBULENCE.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the prime of ancient Greece, the mightiest city states (Polis) of the peninsula compete bitterly for supremacy. This epoch is now evoked again in a playful manner. Each player represents one of the famous cities: Athens, Corinth, Thebes, or Sparta.  <br/>  <br/>In order to demonstrate power and strength, warriors and mighty heroes must be displayed in splendid parades. However, it is also valid to use the favor and gifts of the fickle Gods of Mount Olympus as skillfully and impressively as possible.  <br/>  <br/>Each City State card set has the same number and type of Warrior/Hero cards and God cards. Warrior/Hero cards have values between 2 and 10. Gods have certain abilities that can change the displayed values dramatically. In the game, each player must try to use his 25 cards as skillfully as possible in order to collect the most Fame points.  <br/>  <br/>The game extends over three Parades, each of which has three Marches. Fame scoring occurs after each March. The city with the lowest display loses Fame points. The two cities with the highest displays earn Fame points. Twice only during the entire game, each city may send emissaries to the mighty oracle at Delphi, in order to beg for her aid and, possibly, turn Fate in their favor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MTV, The Throwback Music Party Game, based on the iconic network, is for music lovers of the 80s, 90s and beyond (but don&rsquo;t worry, as long as you&rsquo;ve heard of a few artists from these years you&rsquo;ll be fine!). Open the throwback boombox, flip open the cassette player gameboard, and split into two teams.<br/><br/>First, go head-to-head in the Quick-Fire Buzzer Round. One player from each team tries to think of a song to fit the description on the Head-to-Head category card (e.g. &ldquo;Pop Anthems&rdquo;) before the 15-second timer runs out, hitting the buzzer to throw the mic back to their opponent. The first person to run out of time loses this round.<br/><br/>In the Artist Round, get ready to belt it out! Each player gets three Artist Cards and has 30 seconds to get their team to guess all the artists using one of three methods&mdash; using just one word; speaking the lyrics; or performing one of the artist&rsquo;s songs. When a team gets one right, they add the card to their collection. The first team to grab a card from all eight categories wins and has the right to party like it&rsquo;s 1999!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

As you do so, you must tell each of them which weapon you're attacking them with &mdash; but of course this DOESN&rsquo;T have to be TRUE. Remember, we&rsquo;re Ninjas. Upon receiving the face-down attack, the assaulted player must mark the kind of attack he&rsquo;s been told to be receiving by placing a black cube on top of the appropriate weapon icon on the back of the card. If a player has already received two identical attacks from other ninjas, be they true or not, you cannot repeat the same attack a third time.<br/><br/>When you attack, you can say whatever you want and gesticulate frantically or subtly wink to another player, anything you deem necessary to confuse them as to which attack you&rsquo;re really assigning. Remember, deceit will be your most powerful weapon. Once you&rsquo;ve assigned three of your ninjas to attack your rivals, the following player will do the same.<br/><br/>Once all the players have assigned their attacks, each of you will have before you three face-down attack cards, courtesy of the loving clans to your left.

Players draw cards with different places and try to locate them on a map.

A player can choose to stay on a very superficial level thus indicating that a place is either in the East or West of Germany or can be more specific. The more the specific the guess, the more points a player will get. But if only one of his choices (E-W/ North, Middle, South etc.) is not correct he gets no points at all.<br/><br/>",

The game contains 86 numbered vegetable cards (6 sorts) and 24 action cards. Each player starts with 8 random vegetable cards and a identical set of 4 different action cards. The first player announces the current vegetable (for example &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;) and plays one of his cards face down (which doesn&rsquo;t need to be a carrot!). The next player has two options. He can play a face down card and announce the current vegetable (he says &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;, but also doesn&rsquo;t need to play one). Or he can doubt the card of the previous player. In the latter case he looks at the previous card. If the previous player has lied (he did not play a &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;), that player has to draw a number of cards. If the previous player did not lie, the doubting player has to draw the cards. It is possible to play an action card in stead of a vegetable card. With an action card you can change the direction of the game, change the current vegetable or force a player to draw extra cards. The game ends when a player has emptied his hand or when the draw pile is exhausted for the second time. Remaining hand cards are penalty points. The player with the fewest points wins the game<br/><br/>",

At the start of each round, draw 16 cards and place them face-up; cards come in eight colors, and each color has cards numbered 1-6. On a turn, you roll the die, then optionally roll it again. After your first or second roll, you collect a card from the table that matches the number on the die. If you can't collect a card, the round ends and if the color of a card in front of you is present among the face-up cards, then you lose that card. You might lose everything depending on how jinxed you are!<br/><br/>Players who lost a card receive a random bonus card for any remaining rounds. These cards have different powers such as adding or subtracting 1 from the die roll, rolling a third time, and choosing a card numbered 4-6 instead of rolling the die.<br/><br/>Cards that are safe in one round might be lost in a subsequent round, so ideally you can roll well or use the bonus cards to clear out troublesome colors. At the end of three rounds, players sum the cards in front of them, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players will follow the currents and eddies printed on the tiles to send their petals downstream, leaving petals behind as they do.<br/><br/>As the river comes alive with colour, players must carefully avoid flowing into other players' petals&mdash;when that occurs, those players gain points. This is made all the more challenging as when each player flows, they swap two adjacent river tiles, changing up the river's paths.<br/><br/>Between each round, the river flows forward, washing away the furthest row of tiles and shuffling them back to the start. Hence, simply following the river's currents is easy - but mastering the game will require players to learn to read its constantly changing flow. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Flora and fauna, represented as special tiles, breathe life into the river. Every game, players replace two river tiles with special tiles, each with their own unique effects. These range from a Crab that shuffles up the board by scuttling across the river, to a Shrine that rewards players for spreading their petals across as much as the river as possible. With nine different special tiles of varying complexity to choose from, both casual and hardcore players will find something new to love each foray down the river.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French. The wily Napoleon III schemed to conquer Mexico and set up a puppet regime that would bleed Mexico of its treasures to finance a resurgent French Empire.<br/><br/>Napoleon III picked an obscure Austrian archduke named Maximilian to be his cat&rsquo;s-paw and supported the effort with thousands of French troops. Even though there was some local support in Mexico for the return to a monarchy, most of the country remained loyal to the elected president, Benito Juarez and the French spent huge amounts of treasure and blood to try to put down the Republican Forces. From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico. The remaining troops loyal to Maximilian were not enough to stop the growing Republican army, and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.<br/><br/>Can you, as the French/Imperial Mexican player succeed where Napoleon III failed and pacify a hostile land? You have some of the finest units in the French army, including the famed Foreign Legion, volunteers from Austria, Belgium and Egypt, and a growing army of loyal Mexicans at your disposal. Or, as the Republican Player, can you outwit the powerful French army and restore Mexico to its rightful ruler, Benito Juarez?<br/><br/>Design - Andy Nunez<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",

For fear of raids, the Spaniards hadn't dared to send a single one of their silver ships over to the motherland. The War of the Spanish Succession with Great Britain and the Netherlands had made shipping routes too unsafe.<br/>What was now being transported on the ships of this armada was the most precious cargo that has ever been entrusted to the seas: the ships had loaded gold and silver bars worth the equivalent of 86 million dollars. The ships also had three iron-studded chests on board, filled to the brim with priceless jewels.<br/><br/>The chests were intended for the future wife of the Spanish king, Duchess Isabella of Parma.<br/><br/>On July 29th, the fleet passed the Bahamas and headed for what is now Cape Kennedy. During the night the waves suddenly increased and a hurricane drove the ships towards the reef-strewn coast. On the morning of July 31, 1715 the storm was over. Hundreds of corpses lay among gold bars, silver coins and cannons on the Florida coast.<br/><br/>Using cards and a log puzzle deduction grid, players try to match , the captain, ship, cargo and depth of wreck for ships from the fleet.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Fleet 1715: Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

If a Donkey-3 is revealed, and another player already has a Cat-3 showing, the player with the donkey card will want to say &quot;Miow&quot; before the player with the Cat card says &quot;i-ah&quot;. If the animals matched, they would want to say the opponent's numeric value. The winner gets their opponent's faceup<br/>cards, adds them to his own, and then shuffles them into their draw deck.

        "description": "In a formidable Indian landscape, a burgeoning marketplace is forming. Opportunities are ripe in this community of traders, bankers, moneylenders, and dealers of grains and spices. Fortune awaits the one who plans well and uses his resources wisely. Oil, silk, incense and spices are the currency used to build tents, establish settlements, and amass riches &mdash; but commerce brings competition, and the space to build is limited. When there is no more room, the player who has maximized his resources to become the most successful merchant is the victor!<br/><br/>In Bania, players use resource cards to buy and build tents, then strategically place these tents on the board to earn points. When no legal moves remain on the board, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. On a turn, a player performs these actions in order, if possible:<br/><br/><br/>    Collect your bonus: If your elephant marker sits on a tent tile on the board, collect one resource card of each type in the settlement where the marker is located.<br/>    Buy and place tent tiles OR roll for resources: As explained below.<br/>    Place your elephant marker: If your elephant marker isn't on the board and you placed tent tiles that turn, place the marker on one tile you placed this turn.<br/><br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four tent tiles and eight resource cards: two of each type (oil, spice, silk and incense); one side of the tent tiles shows one of these four resources, while the other side shows three resource symbols (e.g., two spice and one silk). If you want more resources, you can roll the four dice up to three times, locking any dice that you wish while doing so. When you stop rolling, you receive one resource card for each resource symbol showing; in addition, if you have both a front and back half of an elephant showing on the dice, then you receive an elephant marker bonus as at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>If you have the right cards in hand, you might instead choose to buy and place tents; if you have twelve or more cards, then you must do so. A tent costs three resource cards matching the three resource symbols on the back and you pay this cost after placing a tent on the game board, but if you place a tent adjacent to other tents, then the cost is discounted based on the colors of adjacent tents, possibly allowing you to place a tent for no cost at all! When you place a tent on its own to start a settlement, you receive 3 points; for all other tents placed, you receive 1 point each. You refill your hand to four tent tiles at the end of your turn &mdash; but if you've placed all four, you can immediately draw four new tiles and keep building!<br/><br/>A settlement can have at most seven tents in it; when someone places the seventh tent, any elephant markers in the settlement are removed and returned to their owners. The game ends when no more tents can be placed. Whoever placed the final tile scores 3 points, and whoever has the most of each type of resource card scores 2 points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.<br/><br/>With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.<br/><br/>You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.<br/><br/>To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...<br/><br/>From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success? Start with $200 in the working class. Then try to make it to the Middle Class and High Society. You'll have to face all of life's anxiety's along the way, but there is always the chance of making it rich! Get in the Ratrace! You'll bite and claw your way to the top. You'll never know when you might need the skills this game will teach you  -  in real life!&quot;<br/><br/>",

You still want to achieve combinations with your die rolls, but now you score a combination each with the inner dice and the outer ones. Thankfully, you have some wiggle room when shooting for combination targets as you roll six double dice, but use only five outer and five inner dice when scoring combinations, with you choosing each five as you wish.<br/><br/>DubbelYatzy uses standard Swedish Yatzy scoring rules, which are somewhat different from Yahtzee rules, but can also be played with international Yahtzee or German Kniffel scoring.<br/><br/>The playing time is 15 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

The short scenarios can be completed in about four hours. The game includes a 34x22 hex map and 176 large-sized NATO-style, back-printed units. Solitaire play is doable.

For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.<br/><br/>After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

You'll call upon your favorite Ghostbusters to help you set your ghost trap and capture the highest point ghosts on the board.<br/><br/>The game is played over three rounds. In each round, players take turns, beginning with the start player and continuing in clockwise order, until all twelve cards from the circle have been captured. On your turn, carry out these three steps:<br/><br/>1. Take up to two actions, either playing or discarding an action card for each action as you choose. When you play an action card, you carry out its effect, then discard it; when you discard an action card, place it on the discard pile, then draw a new action card.<br/><br/>If any ghosts you've already captured have action abilities, you may use those during this step, in addition to your two actions. Each ghost's ability can be used only once per round.<br/><br/>2. Capture the ghost card that the ghost trap is in front of, but only if you played at least one action card this turn. Take that ghost card and place it in your player area with any other ghosts you've already captured, then move the ghost trap to the next ghost card in the circle &mdash; either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the current direction of play.<br/><br/>3. Refill your hand to three action cards.<br/><br/>The round ends when the last ghost card remaining in the circle has been captured. To prepare for the next round, deal twelve more cards from the top of the ghost deck to form a new circle, and reset the ghost trap to the top of the circle. The game ends after three complete rounds, then players calculate their score for captured ghost cards.<br/><br/>",

The blocks are part white, part colored, and on the face visible to the blocks' owner, the colors of adjacent blocks must match. Once a structure is finished, a player caps the structure with his crown block. The first player to complete his building grabs the demolition die from the table and (if he built a wall, fort or steps) receives a victory token.<br/><br/>In the second phase &ndash; the Destruction Phase &ndash; the player with the die chooses a neighboring player, then rolls the die to see whether he attacks like an Ogre (by tossing the die underhanded at that opponent's building), like a Dragon (by dropping the die straight down on that building), or with a boulder (by placing the die on the table, then flicking it at that building). If the attack dislodges that building's crown, the attacker wins a victory token; if not, the defender wins a victory token. Each type of building provides its owner a special power: Forts are immune to boulders, Towers earn an extra victory token when defended, and so on. The attacked player then attacks someone else until everyone has attacked and been attacked once, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>As soon as someone claims his eighth victory token, he wins the game. For a more difficult game, or to balance play between adults and children, the minimum distance of an attack can be increased from one foot to two feet.<br/><br/>",

Each hand consists of four tricks, players must follow suit if able and the player who takes the last trick wins. Players accumulate points whenever they lose a hand, and are eliminated at seven points. Dice are commonly used to keep track of the score. The initial value of each hand is one point. It can be &quot;knocked&quot; (raised) by one point at any time by any player, except that no player may knock twice in a row. Players can either accept a raise or fold and take the lower number of points. Upon reaching six points a player is in &quot;poverty&quot; and subsequent hands are worth at least two points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 16th century, the age of renaissance. Sailing and maritime trade are flourishing, vast fleets belonging to shipping companies are crossing the seas around the world. There is fierce competition for the available commodities which must be delivered to harbors. The shortest sea route may not be the easiest one. To achieve your goal in becoming the best captain, you need to find the best routes, deliver your goods to the harbor at the right moment and should not think twice to go raiding a little at times. Your portolan chart, a navigation map lies already in front of you, the crew is awaiting your order, and the race is just about to begin.<br/><br/>In Portolano, each players controls a ship at sea. With each step you move your ship to the next map tile (map consists of tiles randomly drawn at the beginning of the game). If this is a sea tile, the player can pick one resource (3 different goods or cannons) available on the island. Each sea tile allows for one additional special action. The most important one is ship building, letting players upgrade their ships, extend their cargo bay, increase their speed, or attacking power in battle.<br/><br/>Other possible actions include e.g. trading goods (change them to other goods or rum). Once you move to a harbor, you sell the goods collected on the islands to get coins (each harbor has differing needs for products). The more goods you can sell in one go, the  more coins you will get.<br/><br/>The players plan their next moves simultaneously, without knowing the plans of others. Therefore it may happen that a player moves to sea tile, where the goods are already taken by other players or to a harbor, where the demands have already been satisfied.<br/><br/>Once everybody has moved their ships in the round, the wind indicator will be spun, the new wind direction determines the next move of the pirates, who are also on the prowl at sea. After this, the movement phase ends. There is a battle after the movement phase if players and/or the pirate are positioned on the same/adjacent tiles. The fights use dice rolling, the winner steals goods/coins/rum from the loser.<br/><br/>Rum is considered to be an important commodity as well, it &quot;fuels&rdquo; the crew to sail the ship according to your orders. If any player runs out of rum, the crew rebels and the ship can move only in the direction that the wind takes it until the rum stock is refilled. The costs of moving the ship in terms of rum depends on your movement compared with the wind direction (upwind, tailwind, crosswind).<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as any of the goods run out. The player who has the most coins wins the game (coins can be collected even at the end of the game by unlocking bonuses).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Snollygoster is a space themed card game of survival, teamwork, and a little sabotage. The goal is to escape an alien planet before the food supply runs out. Your actions are guided by a hidden agenda given to you at the beginning of the game. Pushing your agenda earns you points, but push too hard and players may turn on you. Everyone shares a potentially hazardous food supply that your awful teammates might try to sabotage. End each turn by drawing from the Event Deck in the hopes of acquiring fuel. The more fuel you have the better. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>1) Pick a dealer. Whoever ate bacon last is a great choice. Dealer, read carefully.<br/><br/>2) Organize the cards into decks based on the colored borders on the backs of the cards.<br/>3) Shuffle these decks and place them in the center area of play.<br/><br/>4) Organize the Tag Cards by character. Let each player pick a character to play with or decide for them. It's up to you, almighty dealer. Players take their Tag Cards and keep them nearby.<br/><br/>5) Deal each player one Hidden Agenda Card. These cards will determine how you play the game. Only you can look at this card. Place this card next to your tag cards so you can reference it.<br/><br/>6) Deal everyone a hand of four cards from the Action Deck. Players can look at these cards.<br/><br/>7) Pass the Event Deck around twice. Each player selects a Food Card from the deck, safe or unsafe, and places it in any stash. (Example: There should be 8 food on the table for a four player game)<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/><br/>The player left of the dealer goes first.<br/><br/>There are three stages in a turn: Draw, Action, and Event.<br/><br/>1) Draw: Draw from the Action Deck until you have four cards in your hand. Don't draw if you already have four cards.(Example: If you are holding one card, then draw three)<br/><br/>2) Action: Play as many cards as you like and/or discard as many cards as you like.<br/><br/>3) Event: End your turn by drawing two cards from the Event Deck. Choose the one you want and place the other card on the bottom of the deck. If you chose a Fuel Card, place it next to your player tags. If you chose a Food Card place it in anyone's stash. (Don't let anyone else see this card) If you chose a Hunger Card, show it to everyone, and eat the required amount of food from your stash.<br/><br/>Play continues clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>Player Stash: Every player has a personal stash in front of them to store Food Cards. It holds up to three Food Cards.<br/><br/>Using Food Cards: Hungry and Starving Cards will instruct you to use one or two Food Cards, respectively. To do so, first select a Food Card from your Player Stash and have every player acknowledge your selection. Then reveal the Food Card. If it is safe you live to see another round. If it is unsafe you are now in Quarantine. (Continue reading to learn about Quarantine) If there is a shortage of Food Cards available to you, you have died of starvation.<br/><br/>Quarantine: If you eat a contaminated food, you are now in Quarantine. You lose all food in your stash and can no longer add any food to the table. (We can't have you contaminating everything) You continue to play as normal. You can continue to collect fuel, but you still have to eat. If you draw two food cards, you must place both in the discard pile. Unfortunately for you, you can not leave the planet while under quarantine. To get out of Quarantine, place a pair of Fuel Cards in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Inspecting Food: During your Action Stage, play an Inspect Card. Select an untagged Food Card, privately view it, and return it face down. Place one of your Tag Cards on the Food Card as safe or unsafe. You can lie your pants off.<br/><br/>Fuel: Fuel is required to launch the escape pod. Whoever plays a Launch Card can select goes with them, but there has to be enough total fuel between you to meet the required amount. Each player can hold up to a maximum of five fuel. Fuel is also a bargaining device. You can barter fuel with others to get yourself out of a jam. You also have the option to give a player one fuel to eat any one food from their stash. Fuel is also how you get out of Quarantine, by discarding two fuel.<br/><br/>You Lied: If it's ever revealed you incorrectly labeled a Food Card (even a Food Card you used), you must discard your hand immediately.<br/><br/>You Died: If a player dies by starvation, they no longer get a turn, but can still win if they accumulate enough points at the end. Their hand is placed on the Action Deck along with the discard pile and the deck is reshuffled. Without looking at the Food Cards in their Player Stash, place them on top of the Event Deck along with the discard pile, any Fuel Cards they had, and then the deck is reshuffled. Any food they tagged remains in play.<br/><br/>Ending the Game: For the game to end, one of two things needs to happen: either a Launch Card is successfully played or everyone has died. A Launch Card can be played at any time as long as the required amount of fuel is met.<br/><br/>Survivors get a point for each Fuel Card they contributed to the launch. Then all Hidden Agenda Cards are revealed and the points are tallied. Whoever acquired the most points wins! In the event of a tie, whoever played the Launch Card wins. If everyone died and there is still a tie, who ever died last wins.<br/><br/>Special Cases:<br/><br/>If you use all five of your Tag Cards, you cannot inspect anymore food until a Tag Card is returned to you.<br/>If you draw two Fuel Cards and you already have five Fuel Cards, discard both and draw again.<br/>If you draw two Food Cards and all stashes are already full, discard both and draw again.<br/><br/>TEAM GAME RULES:<br/><br/>If you have four or more players, you have the option to play in teams. Comrades vs Rogues. Your team affiliation will be stated on your Hidden Agenda card. You still cannot show other players your Hidden Agenda card. Your points will be added to your teams total at the end of the game and whichever team has the most points wins. The teams do not need to be of equal size.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players recruit one card from their hand and then pass the rest of their hand to the player on their left. Every time a card is recruited, it goes into that player&rsquo;s army pile. Only the top card is visible in each player&rsquo;s army at any given time. There are two types of cards available in the game&mdash;Monster cards and Hired Hand cards. Each Monster card has a unique scoring mechanism. Players must recruit them wisely in order to maximize the amount of points of their army.

Mr. Lincoln's War is organized into two games, the Army of the Tennessee, which deals with the western theater, and The Army of the Potomac, which deals with the war in Virginia. Each game has four short campaign scenarios that recreate the maneuvers and battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg, Atlanta and other monumental Civil War contests. A grand campaign scenario enabling the players to fight the war in the West or East is provided with each game. Both games may be combined for a grand campaign game that simulates the entire Civil War on both fronts.<br/><br/>Each game contains the following components:<br/>1) One 22' x 28' mapboard covering the eastern or western portion of the United States.<br/>2) 400 die-cut playing pieces.<br/>3) A rules booklet.<br/>4) A scenario booklet.<br/>5) One player-aid and leader display card.<br/><br/>Each hex represents about 12 miles.<br/>Each strength point represents approximately 2,500 men.<br/>Turns are monthly, except for the winter turns (November to February), which are bi-monthly.<br/><br/>Additional information:<br/><br/>Game features alternating player turns including interception movement by the non-phasing player, leaders required to move infantry, special rules for naval and amphibious operations, supply, railroad construction and repairs, a combat system featuring morale and leadership and a campaign game combining both the Potomac and  the Tennessee games. The campaign game also adds politics and production to the mix.<br/><br/>",

Players may use as many words as they wish when creating their band names.<br/><br/>The first player announces a preset goal. For example, &quot;Heavy Metal or Hip-Hop&quot;, &quot;Perverted&quot;, &quot;Food and Drink&quot;, &quot;Offensive&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>All players then create a band name they feel best fits the current theme. For example, if the theme was &quot;Science Fiction&quot; you may players play band names like &quot;Robot Death Weasel&quot;, &quot;Oprah's Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Martian Ghetto Punks&quot;, or &quot;Hairy Alien Concubines&quot;. The game is designed to create as much hilarity as possible, but may be offensive to some depending on the word combinations chosen.<br/><br/>Players then vote on who they feel generated the most fitting band name. This player wins the Theme List and one point.<br/><br/>Players then draw new cards for the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues for 10 rounds, the player who has the most points at the end of the last round is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Those who, as a narrator, manage to present their version of the story without errors will be rewarded accordingly.<br/><br/>In Fabula Rasa: Crime, players slip into the role of lawyers who &mdash; despite confusing descriptions and unclear, changing evidence &mdash; have to give the most convincing explanation possible for the crime committed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from S&amp;T press website:)<br/><br/>On 3 July 1866 the armies of Austria-Hungary and Prussia met west of the Bohemian fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz (now Hradec Kr&aacute;lov&eacute;). The battle was the culmination of a quarter-century of political and military maneuvering by Otto von Bismarck, aimed at enabling Prussia to supplant Austria-Hungary as the dominant state of the coalescing German nation.<br/><br/>The battle is presented using the folio line&rsquo;s Musket &amp; Saber system: brigade-sized units, one-fifth-mile hexes, 90-minute turns, 280 counters. The Austro-Hungarian army, chastened by a week of minor defeats, was entrenched a long line covering the fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. It occupied a central position facing three converging Prussian armies. To win, the Prussians must sweep the Austrians off the field (as they did historically), while the Austrians must maintain a presence on the field to justify their continued claim to political primacy. The game emphasizes the differences between the armies in doctrine, weapons and morale. The Prussian triumph was born of more than just the famous needle-gun: their infantry used flexible organization and tactics to mass men quickly at the decisive point, while the Austrians used a throwback to Napoleonic column formations due to a misreading of the lesson from an earlier engagement. The Prussian artillery is outclassed by the superb Austrian guns, but can be dangerous if used properly. The Austrian cavalry is superior as well, but horsed charges were already an anachronism. In the end the battle came down to crucial command decisions, giving both players an opportunity to win.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #275<br/><br/>",

During the course of the game, the males try to mate with the females in order to achieve paternity over certain eggs. However, not all the eggs are equally valuable. The first egg in a nest scores fewer points than the third. Also, there are females who are better suited for mating (they have matching color) and their eggs thus earn a bonus.<br/>The King of the Nest will, without a doubt, be the one who manages to mate with all the females, i.e. to collect eggs in all the colors.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game evolved from (or alongside) Fox &amp; Geese and seems to have appeared first in Germany at least as early as 1803, where it has been known as Belagerungsspiel (Siege Game) or Festungsspiel (Fortress Game.)  In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics. In France it was published in 1855 as Assault. In Italy it is called Assalto, Assalto al Fortino, Assedio di Sebastopoli, and Citadel. Since it is played on essentially a Fox &amp; Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox &amp; Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.<br/><br/>The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.<br/><br/>Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.<br/><br/>Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.  Sometimes published in Germany and continental Europe as Neues Belagerungsspiel (New Siege Game) or Grosses Festungs-Spiel (Big Fortress Game,) it was known in English-speaking countries as The Royal Garrison Game and has been published under many other names since then.<br/><br/>Examples of books or game compilations containing Asalto, <br/>e.g :  <br/>'The Boardgame Book<br/>'The Book of Classic Board Games<br/>or<br/>'Medito<br/><br/>",

Whether it's &quot;stomachache in the middle of a presentation&quot; or &quot;your boss's wig is off-center&quot;, what will you do when you have only sushi or a self-enrichment book? It's a test of the player's imagination and life experience!<br/><br/>Should your story be accepted by at least half of the other players, you get to keep the event card and play continues until a special event card called &quot;End!&quot; is revealed.

Li Shimin, the second son of Emperor Gaozu, planned an ambush at Xuanmu Gate leading to the Palace City and assassinated two of his brothers who were in a fierce competition with him for the throne. A few days after this coup, Li Shimin was made the crown prince. His father abdicated two months later, and Li Shimin became Emperor Taizong.<br/><br/>The Xuanwu Gate Incident is a secret identity deduction game. Each player is dealt a character card that is secret to other players. On a player's turn, they may examine one of the two cards placed facedown in the center of the table. They may choose to swap the card with their own card, or with any other players' card, or keep it where it is. After all players have had a chance to examine one card, there will be voting to determine whether the current round comes to a showdown; if so, all cards are revealed and the winning team is determined.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.<br/><br/>",

He is always inventing the most incredible creations just by observing the world around him.<br/><br/>In Leonardo, players must collect inventions, gathering the right materials (i.e., cards) for each one. Each invention has a point value based on how complex it is and based on the required materials. Before starting the game, place six collection cards and three invention cards on the matching spaces on the game board. Place the three stand-up character pawns on the correct positions around the invention cards. All players share these characters and can use any of them that they want each turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player simultaneously reveals one of three character cards and one of three movement cards. The first player moves his chosen character clockwise around the circle the number of spaces shown on his movement card, then:<br/><br/><br/>    If no cards are on the space, his turn ends;<br/>    If a collection card is on the space, he places it face up in front of him;<br/>    If an invention card is there and he has all of the required materials, he can take that card and the matching invention pawn; or<br/>    If a painting card is there, he plays it immediately, gaining that card's special effect (take an extra turn, steal a player's material card, etc.)<br/><br/><br/>The remaining players take their turns in clockwise order in the same manner, then the player to the left of the first player becomes the first player for the next turn.<br/><br/>If no invention or collection cards are available to fill spaces on the board, the game ends immediately. Players score points equal to the value of their inventions, plus 1 point for each material card they still have. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

The French player must consolidate her polyglot army and its inspiring leader, while dealing with Joan's &quot;voices&quot; via an events table that leaves him feeling slightly out of control.  The English player has to deal with Scots and herrings and trying to resist the &quot;help&quot; of an unwanted Burgundian ally.  Both players face the challenges of making siege and open-field combat work for them, in an era where artillery and charges by armored knights belong on the same battlefield. The game includes 200 counters, a full-color, mounted mapboard, and all the charts you will need to keep your focus on the Maid.<br/><br/>Joan of Arc's Victory also includes a random &quot;Joan Events&quot; table that will render the French player a sense of the uncertainty being around someone divinely inspired might provide. And it keeps life interesting for the English too, as Joan may do something very unexpected (and have surprising combat benefits too!).<br/><br/>No two games will ever be alike.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.<br/><br/>",

Take your magic wand and good luck to you because sometimes the spells will turn against you!<br/><br/>On your turn in Abra Kazam!, take the 24 cm. wooden magic wand, pick a card, then reproduce the gesture indicated on your card, trying to get others to guess your spell. The first player who finds the corresponding card on the table becomes the next sorcerer. Some spell gestures look quite similar, so it is not uncommon to be wrong in the rush! This new sorcerer has to act out the next spell challenge while following the command on the card just found, e.g., &quot;Place the thumb of your hand holding the wand on your nose&quot;, or &quot;Wedge your wand in the crook of the elbow&quot;, or &quot;Your elbows must be glued to your body&quot;.

        "description": "The game of Alquerque is played on a special board of 5 x 5 points with lines between them to indicate allowed moves.  To draw a board is easy.  First draw a 5 x 5 orthogonal grid.  The draw two diagonal lines - from each corner to the opposite corner.  Finally draw four diagonal lines in the form of a square that connects the midpoints of each side.<br/>Alquerque is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a similar way to Draughts (Checkers).  <br/>The player playing black pieces places them on the 10 points of the nearest 2 rows plus the 2 rightmost points on the middle row as the player looks at it.  The other player sets the white pieces up in exactly the same way.  This leaves only the middle point without a piece upon it. The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.<br/><br/>Play<br/>Players take turns to move one of their pieces.  A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board.  For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.<br/>Whenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured.  A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board.  Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away.  The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.<br/><br/>An ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.<br/>Finishing<br/>The game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken.   Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move. <br/>A draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.  If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed.  Draws are very common.<br/><br/>Arie van der Stoep's reconstruction:<br/><br/>In his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.<br/><br/>There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pyramid Raiders is a light back-stabbing strategy game for 3-6 players. Players are treasure hunters looking for fame and fortune in a long forgotten pyramid. With the help of their special equipment, they will compete with each other to gather the most treasure from this expedition &ndash; but watch out for The Guardian! He awakes from the darkness of the ruins to fulfill his mission, to chase all intruders and throw them out with a curse!<br/><br/>In Pyramid Raiders, players lay down action tiles to move and collect treasure tokens on a hexagonal map. Besides providing a number for movement, action tiles will also effect The Guardian in different ways, such as rotate him to face another direction or make him move faster. Used action tiles will stay on board, and will be returned to hand only every five turns when they are all used.<br/><br/>The Guardian's movement is guided by a set of rules and does not need a player to act as the GM. Each turn after all players have finished their moves, roll a die to move The Guardian, then move it extra spaces depending on the action tiles played this turn.<br/><br/>At the start of each game, randomly place 49 treasure tokens of seven kinds on the map. Players score by collecting tokens of different colors, or by specializing in only one or two colors. Twelve wooden tokens are placed on the map as obstacles, and can be placed in different layouts to change the difficulty of the game. Ten item tiles are included to provide rule-bending effects for players. And for those who are up for the challenge, two extra Line of Sight tokens will let The Guardian literally grow eyes on his back, making it even harder to escape &ndash; or easier to trap other players depending on your point of view...<br/><br/>",

Players must play off one another in order to gain points, but the highest suited card is not always the one that takes the trick, so one must be as clever as the Crow in Aesop's fable to score points and not perish from thirst.<br/><br/>The deck consists of three colored suits of stone cards (numbered 2-10) and one set of black &quot;thirst&quot; cards (also numbered 2-10); a separate deck of pitcher cards has values from 6 to 13, with some duplicates, and one pitcher is revealed each trick. One player leads the first trick with a stone card, and other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she can play a thirst card instead, and from the next round thirst cards can lead the trick. Whoever wins a trick leads the next trick, so winning tricks helps you dictate play.<br/><br/>If the sum of the colored cards is less than the pitcher value, then the lowest card matching the lead wins; this player gets all cards played (positive points for colors, negative for thirst) and the Pitcher card (worth -5 points). If the sum of the colored cards is equal to or greater than the pitcher value, then the highest card matching the lead wins, and this player gets all cards played (again, positive points for colors, negative for thirst). In all cases, cards valued higher than the trick's pitcher card do not count toward determining whether the pitcher is full.<br/><br/>If the trick is led by a thirst card, the highest thirst card wins, and that player takes all thirst cards played &ndash; so make sure you hold onto your low value thirst cards to avoid winning a thirst-led trick!<br/><br/>After three rounds, the player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

The difference here is the big and powerful Globbo grows bigger all the time (except when one of the cute little urchins has exploded and taken out a big chunk of Globbo).<br/><br/>The little angels come in three types, Biters who can attack and will explode if hit by Globbo, Blips who are created by exploding Biters and Yeasts who are also created by exploding Biters.  Yeast and Blips can combine to form more Biters.<br/><br/>Globbo has his weapons also.  His head has a big attack up to 15 hexes away but only in a straight line.  Blue Zap parts which must be adjacent to the head or another Blue Zap piece can attack up to 3 hexes away and the Red Slaps can attack adjacent spaces.  Red Slaps must be adjacent to Blue Zaps.  Globbo moves like a giant amoeba as all his parts try to stay adjacent to the proper parts to remain alive.<br/><br/>Originally published in The Space Gamer (Issue 62 - Apr 1983).<br/><br/>",

The game has a simple but refined mechanism able to represent the 24 seconds action in 3 shot-clock turns. Players move on the court, mark, dribble, block, pass, score for 2 or 3 points as in the real and amazing NBA matches! Time is running, the opponents are 2 points short and have the ball; a few seconds to the end, the public is shouting: &quot;defense-defense&quot; it is not only a game, it is really happening! GAME FOR FANS AND PEOPLE INTERESTED IN KNOWING A BIT MORE ON BASKETBALL.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: the miniatures are moved accordingly to the result of a red 6-sided die (for the ball's owner) and a green 6-sided die (for the remaining 4 miniatures). After any unit movement the defending team can reply with a unit movement trying to mark. All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values. Therefore players can manage the game as a real NBA game, trying to have the best player in the best shooting position for scoring. When a miniatures decides to shoot a 12-sided die is rolled and the result is eventually diminished by one if the miniature is marked. If the result is equal or lower than the miniature's shooting ability then there is a score.<br/>Situations like blocks, dunks, stealing the ball, illegal defenses, screening, free throws and faults add to the game a high likelihood. Special cards for special actions are present.<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, he rolls the six-sided die. If the number on the die doesn't match the number of holes on any card in the row, the player peeks at one of these cards to see whether it shows cheese or a trap on the reverse side, then returns it to the row. (With 2-3 players, the player also moves the top card from the deck to the discard pile.) If the number on the die matches the number of holes on at least one card in the row, the player can either:<br/><br/><br/>    Take one of these cards, reveal it, and place it in front of himself, or<br/>    Take one of these cards and place it on the discard pile without revealing its opposite side to anyone.<br/><br/><br/>In either case, the player then fills the empty spot in the row with the top card from the deck.<br/><br/>If someone collects a third trap, the game ends, this player automatically loses, and everyone else counts the number of holes on their cheese cards; trap cards are worth no points. The player with the most holes wins. The game also ends if the deck runs out, with the holeyist player once again winning.<br/><br/>",

The goal of this game is to sway the majority of delegates in you favor in order to be nominated as the candidate to run for office and win the game. In other words, by fulfilling the task given by &quot;headline cards&quot; you are able to conquer states <br/>with different numbers of delegates. These delegates will be counted in the end of the game and the player who has gathered the most delegates wins.<br/><br/>In  more detail:<br/><br/>You play for four rounds to complete the game. Each round has an identical structure and entails six game phases. Each player needs to complete the ongoing game phase before the subsequent phase can begin.<br/><br/><br/>     Drawing of headline cards<br/>     Rolling, selecting and placing the dice<br/>     Fulfilling headline card tasks (if possible)<br/>     Winning states<br/>     Drawing bonus cards (if possible)<br/>     Discarding headline cards and changing of starting player<br/><br/><br/>After the fourth round, each player counts his gathered delegates and a winner is declared.<br/><br/>A central game mechanism is the inclusion of dice in each of the four phases. Each number of die represents a different voting group. In order to fulfill a &quot;headline card&quot; you need to collect a certain number or combination of dice.<br/><br/>There are 24 dice in the game. All dice are being used regardless of the number of players playing. When it is your turn, you take six dice and roll them once. You can influence the outcome of your roll with your character card&rsquo;s ability to manipulate dice or in other words &quot;voters&quot;. Afterwards, you can either select two dice of any number or all dice of the same number and place them on according voter grounds on the game board.<br/><br/>You can manipulate the result of your roll with you character card. Each character has one voter group which follows him or her unconditionally and will opportunistically adopt any opinion. If a player rolls the number or numbers of his voter group, he can turn this or these dice onto any desired side.<br/><br/>You will roll the dice, one after another until there are 20 dice placed voter groups.<br/><br/>This game is not intended or meant to be disrespectful towards anyone. It does not aim at ridiculing anyone. Much rather, we would like all of us to be able to have a good chuckle over a board game which does not take itself seriously.<br/><br/>The satirical aspect of the game makes fun of the current political discourse of politicians, news media and pundits which seem to be much more about exaggeration, stereotyping, provocation and polarization than about discussion and consensus. More so, it seems that these days one is more successful as a politician being loud, oversimplifying and hyperbolical than reflective and reasonable. This is a trend which is in no way limited to the United States. We see it everywhere.<br/><br/>This idea is at the core of the game mechanics itself, most visible in our headline cards. On each card you find a totally exaggerated and ridiculous headline but at the same time the headline cards give you a task which you need to fulfill in order to win the game. So, if you fulfill the headline card or, in terms of the narrative of the cards, if you act as ridiculously as the headlines states you are successful in the political race.<br/><br/>The game, its cards and figures are fictional &ndash; not so much informed by real persona &ndash; but instead focusing on the stereotypes, simplifications and generalizations visible in news coverage and popular culture.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Employees have various skills, which allow them to place buildings and create dinosaurs for example. You spread word about the park by entertaining your visitors. However, be careful! The more dinosaurs the park contains, the greater the chance of break outs with gruesome consequences.<br/><br/>Jurassic World is a cooperative board game from 2 to 6 players. It's a combination of making the right choices with your teammates and some luck with rolling the dice. Players start their turn together by placing their banners strategically in the preparation phase. In the action phase players take actions based on where they placed their banner in the previous phase. In the action phase players take actions, for example: Digging up dinosaurs, researching dinosaurs, placing dinosaurs in their paddock, building entertainment buildings or buying upgrades. They succeed in these actions by rolling the right numbers with the dice. If all that is going according to plans, players will be able to fulfill all the requirements of a mission and win the game. But if something goes wrong and the 'danger meter' reaches 20, all players will lose the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Easy to learn and quick to play, Quadefy uses visual spatial skills and strategies that will keep you on your toes. When playing Quadefy, you have to think a little bit strategist and a little bit puzzle builder. Players take turns stacking their game pieces on the base, each attempting to keep their entire game piece &quot;in bounds.&quot; &quot;In bounds&quot; means that the piece must be completely over the game base and no more than four &quot;cubes&quot; high. The first player to force their opponent to have to play out of bounds, wins. Every move is both offensive and defensive, making Quadefy very fun to play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Quadefy is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.<br/><br/>",

Dunnigan in 1973. It presents a two-player, complex historical simulation of the air, sea and land campaigns waged on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the summer and fall of 1942. The game begins with the American invasion of that island and includes the subsequent Japanese attempts to retake it. The game is intended to be a simulation of combined air-naval-ground operations, or what are today called &quot;joint operations&quot;. Consequently it centers on modeling command and staff systems, focusing on the difficulties and advantages inherent in sequenced interactions between and among air, naval and ground forces.<br/><br/>",

It is a game of bucking the trend, keeping your options open and closing down the opposition. Will you play safe and pick up your points where you can or take a risk and hold out for a better score?<br/><br/>During Niche you play cards from your hand restricted by the previous card played. Players create an irregular grid pattern that is limited only by the edge of the table and score points depending on the length of the lines they create.<br/><br/>The rule structure of Niche involves a restriction of choices, each player must select cards from their hand, and it is these choices that give the sense of control. On a reasonably basic level this becomes a gentle balance between puzzle solving and tactics whilst at the same time I hope that players are having so much fun they don&rsquo;t realize quite how much they are using their brain.<br/><br/>Niche takes between 10 minutes and a whole evening to play.<br/><br/>The game aims to promote and support The Foundation for Conductive Education. This method works with children and adults who have conditions such as Cerebral Palsy, Stroke, M.S. or Parkinsons, helping them to lead more independent lives.<br/><br/>",

(Destination: Treasure Island) is formally a race game, but in fact you need to employ tactics to meet challenges, complete missions and earn victory points. Your decisions will largely influence your score, although elements of luck are also present in the game.<br/><br/>2-4 pirate ships set to sea to reach Treasure Island ahead of the others. But being the first is not enough: the real winner will be the one who scores best in the various challenges on the way. <br/>The pirates (48 character cards) have certain skills of different strength which can be boosted by using the appropriate weapons and tools (24 weapon cards). The set of cards held by players in hand continuously changes as cards are played and replaced during actions. This determines the actual power of a player&rsquo;s crew when facing a particular challenge.  Playing the cards tactfully can earn considerable advantage and valuable treasures for players, which will improve their final score.<br/><br/>The game starts with an empty board and a series of blank fields on the sea, leading to Treasure Island. As the ships move ahead, the board is gradually filled with event cards randomly drawn, all indicating an action. Players will gather and sell pearls, trade with weapons, spy out and occupy islands, collect treasures, complete various missions or even kidnap other&rsquo;s sailors.  Often they master their skills to compete against each other or fight the forces of nature.<br/><br/>The winner will be the player who achieves the most victory points by sailing fast, completing missions and having a valuable collection of treasures.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/>Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses Sziget!<br/>Verseng&eacute;s &eacute;s k&uuml;zdelem a tengeren<br/><br/>Az Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses sziget! formailag egy versenyj&aacute;t&eacute;k, de a győzelemhez j&oacute; taktik&aacute;ra &eacute;s n&eacute;mi szerencs&eacute;re is sz&uuml;ks&eacute;g van. <br/>N&eacute;h&aacute;ny kal&oacute;zhaj&oacute; nagy zs&aacute;km&aacute;ny rem&eacute;ny&eacute;ben nekiv&aacute;g a tengernek, hogy a t&ouml;bbiek előtt &eacute;rjen el a Kincses szigetre.

        "description": "This game L&rsquo;ATTAQUE is an early predecessor of the nowadays more widely known Stratego. It was designed by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, who filed a patent for a 'jeu de bataille avec pi&egrave;ces mobiles sur damier' (a battle game with mobile pieces on a gameboard) on 26 Nov 1908. The patent was released by the French Patent Office in 1909 (patent #396.795).<br/><br/>Hermance Edan marketed her own invention from 1909 to early 1930. In 1910, she named her game &quot;L'Attaque&quot;. Gibsons obtained the publishing rights to sell L'Attaque in English-speaking countries from 1925, but kept the French name.<br/><br/>The game is played with 36 pieces each on a 9x10 square board. Each piece has a numeric value, which is hidden from the opponent and only revealed when an attacking piece moves onto a square occupied by an opponent's piece. In most cases, the piece with the highest value wins and the losing piece is removed from the board.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player finds the opponent's flag piece and takes it.<br/><br/>There have been some revised editions of this Game, including a very rare &lsquo;5-bridges&rsquo; 10x10 board, later used as the basis of Sharpe's Attack, and a 100th anniversary of Gibsons games edition.

        "description": "Designer/Publisher's Description:<br/><br/>The object of Stonewall is to race your opponents from your starting point to your diagonally opposite corner of a 144 square grid board and back again by the roll of the dice.  Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.<br/>Stonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HERO versus GUARDIAN: A Game of Dungeon Craft is a 2-4 player card- and dice-based strategy game that takes 45-90 minutes to play. The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.<br/><br/>Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.<br/><br/>Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.<br/><br/>The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.<br/><br/>A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills&mdash;while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.<br/><br/>Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.<br/><br/>In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For 200 years, the Knights Templar were a powerful political and economic force, helping to shape Europe during the Middle Ages. Founded to protect pilgrims on their journeys to the Holy Land, the &quot;poor comrades-in-arms of Christ and the Temple of Solomon&quot; would eventually grow a network of strongholds (&quot;Commanderies&quot;) throughout the Christian world, where novice knights were trained, and trade goods could be managed and exchanged. By 1307, the &ldquo;poor comrades-in-arms&rdquo; were one of the richest organizations in Europe: one that would attract the covetous eyes of the French king.<br/><br/>In The Mystery of the Templars, players become the masters of this secretive organization. They must assign their knights to the critical task of escorting pilgrims, but also to seek out and discover long-lost artifacts of Christian lore. Using their holdings in the Holy Land, they procure valuable trade goods, which must then be transported to the hungry markets of Europe, using the profits to expand the Order&rsquo;s holdings. But along the way brigands and pirates threaten the flow of goods and wealth, and must be challenged by valorous knights to safeguard the precious caravans and trade ships. To be successful, the players must balance the needs of trade, development, and battle.<br/><br/>In time, the powerful enemies of the Templars will strike, beginning the Persecution which will eventually cause the destruction of the Order. In those last desperate days, the players must flee from their Commanderies with all the wealth and relics they can carry, seeking refuge in the farthest corners of the world. The player who can best manage the resources of the Order during the days of wealth, and who can rescue the most important relics from the Persecution, will be the victor in The Mystery of the Templars.<br/><br/>",

The Anglo-French objectives were to seize the Suez Canal, which the Egyptians had nationalized, and to possibly also overthrow the regime of Gamel Abd El Nasser. Though the invaders gain their military objectives, they unleashed a political disaster on themselves when the United States joined the Soviet Union in condemning the operation.<br/><br/>Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #226 - Jan/Feb 2005.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6-8 hours<br/>Hex: 360 yards / 329 meters<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters - 101 for Suez '56, 110 for El Arish '67, 30 errata/variant for The East is Red, 39 errata/variant for Dixie)<br/>One 16-page Middle East Battles rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-10 Hours<br/><br/>",

Standing high above all creation, the gods ruled this world and were worshipped by the creatures living there. This fact was enjoyed so immensely by the gods that some of them decided to decided to find a new world to create and spread even more of their stories and in doing so get more beings to worship them. On this new world, 7 gods from different ancient cultures send forth their envoys to spread word of their greatness, each aiming to become the most popular god of this new world.<br/><br/>7 different gods with 7 different powers use their Envoys (player tokens) to gain points by Telling Stories (rolling D4 dice) and gain control over villages on Islands. One random god is always excluded in the game; this god will cause disturbances for all players during the game.<br/><br/>During the player&rsquo;s turn she draws a card from her unique player deck and a dice from the shared Well of Wonders. By playing a card she moves her Envoy to an Island and with the Dice she can Tell a Story (roll the dice) or perform other god actions. When you use the card to move you cannot use the card for other actions that might be on that card. You must make decisions every turn on what part of the cards you use; move or action.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches a certain amount of victory points or when a certain amount of dice is in the Otherworld (the island in the middle of the game board). This threshold is determined at the start of the game and is affected by the number of players and / or experience. The player with the most victory points after the scoring phase wins.<br/><br/>The game is for 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "London is one of the four original Crime Scene Games. It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:<br/>1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.<br/>Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.<br/>The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;<br/>The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.<br/><br/>Challenge Level 3/5<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player moves one piece in a direction matching one of the movement arrows on that piece, with the maximum distance moved being equal to the number of arrows on that piece.<br/><br/>The blue pivot spaces on the game board allow for tricky plays. If a player moves a piece onto one of these spaces, he can rotate that piece, allowing it to move in any direction for the remainder of its movement. For example, if you're one space away from a pivot with a piece that has three arrows (and is pointing at the pivot), you can move one space onto the pivot, rotate your piece, then move the remaining one or two spaces in any direction now indicated by the piece's arrows.<br/><br/>You capture movement arrows two ways:<br/><br/>&bull; Land on an opponent's piece, and you remove a movement arrow of your choice, then place that piece on an unoccupied blue pivot space in any direction you wish.<br/>&bull; Jump an opponent's piece, then remove the one or two arrows on that piece that are parallel to your direction of movement.<br/><br/>You win by being the first player to capture 17 of your opponent's movement arrows.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional Hawaiian game.<br/><br/>From Katie Harris's review:<br/><br/>The gameboard is made up of rows and columns, like a checkerboard. However, you can have as many rows and columns as you would like (and your board accommodates). To set-up the game, fill each square with a playing piece, alternating between black and white pieces.<br/><br/>Black moves first, by taking off one of his pieces. He may only remove a piece from the middle of the board or from one of the corners. White removes one of his pieces that is adjacent orthogonally to the empty square created by Black. There should now be two empty squares next to each other.<br/><br/>From there on, players take turns jumping their opponents&rsquo; pieces. A jump may only be made orthogonally, never diagonally. A player may make multiple jumps with the same piece in a turn, provided that he does not change direction. Making a multiple jump is optional. Pieces that are jumped are removed from the board.<br/><br/>When one player is unable to jump during his turn, his opponent wins the game.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/</a>  - igGameCenter (real-time, bot)<br/><br/><br/>",

Collect 3 sets of dim sums cards and 1 pair of tea cards!<br/><br/>10 cards are dealt to each player. All remaining cards are placed in a deck faced down. Players take turns drawing a card from either the deck or any card from the centre. The player then decides which card they want to keep and end their turn by discarding a card into the centre face-up.<br/><br/>Play strategically and collect small, medium, big and dessert dim sums to wrap up the game quickly, or go for glory and collect the super, special and top dim sums to score as many points as possible. You are in control of your own fortune.<br/><br/>A round of Yum Cha ends when a player draws the eleventh card which makes a complete hand, revealing 3 sets of dim sums and 1 pair of tea. When they do so, they announce Yum Cha! and the round ends. A set of dim sums consists of three unique dim sums from the same tier. Duplicate dim sums cannot form a part of a set. A pair of tea consists of two tea cards of the same flavour.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Charleston?<br/><br/>No, it's the Adriatic, in a short and violent naval war between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Yes, you heard right. Finally, you'll have a chance to see the Austro-Hungarian navy in action. Historically, they did very well. How will you do?<br/><br/>The &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; of 1866 is also known as the Third Italian Independence War. The Italians want Venice. The Austrians have it. But the Italians are allied with up-and-coming Prussia, and the Austrians have a hard time on land. On the Adriatic, the Austrio-Hungarian fleet is outnumbered and out gunned, more to 2-1 in both categories. But they have aggressive commanders and a willingness to &quot;Ram anything painted grey!&quot; That was the signal from the Austrio-Hungarian flagship (the Italians would be the folks with gray ships). The same signal included the sentence, &quot;There must be a victory at Lissa.&quot;<br/><br/>And now it's up to you to find out if there will be, or if the Italians succeed in making the Adriatic &quot;an Italian lake.&quot;<br/><br/>It is a classic confrontation, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, of numbers versus quality, with over 200 multi-sized counters featuring individual ships and the admirals who commanded the fleets. Players maneuver on an operational map and then shift to smaller battle maps when it's time to put their iron to the test.<br/><br/>Two scenarios - just the conclusive Battle of Lissa or the entire campaign, along with important random events, intrusions by the French and Turks, optional rules for ships and events that could have happened, and more. Will you, as Italian Admiral Persano, see that the Austrian flag is &quot;swept&quot; from the Adriatic? Or will you, as Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff prove that your rams and unusual &quot;flying wedge&quot; formation can overcome superior firepower?<br/><br/>The choices are yours!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ruckus: The Goblin Army Game is a tactical war game that introduces an innovative army formation mechanic to create fast, intense combat for 2-4 players. Players choose from one of four unique Goblin Guilds, each with a special set of skills and tactical advantages, and build their army to destroy anyone that stands in their way. As battles are won and lost, players gain Victory cards, Victory Points, or the ability to upgrade their army. Who will be victorious, the mighty Fighters, the cunning Thieves, the powerful Clerics, or the magical Necromancers?<br/><br/>To begin the game, players set up the Camp, the area of the game board housing Victory Point Tokens, action markers, the Kicker card deck, the Victory card deck, and the Upgrade deck. Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.<br/><br/>Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Who will be victorious? Will it be the Mighty Fighters, the Cunning Thieves, the Powerful Clerics, or the Magical Necromancers? Choose your guild! Draft your army! Destroy your enemies!<br/><br/>",

The game depicts sixteen famous battles from the introduction of the bayonet to the invention of rifling. Because of the tactical scale of Grenadier some of the battles are represented by crucial segments, isolated and simulated. For example the Battle of Waterloo (1815) is represented by the attack of Napoleon's Old Guard on the center of the British line, The Battle of the Pyramids (1798) by the attack of the Marmeluke cavalry on the most exposed French infantry. Several other battles such as Palo Alto (1846) from the Mexican War are covered entirely. Commanders represented include Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Ney, Wellington, and Zachary Taylor. Some of the 16 battles depicted in Grenadier are Blenheim, Austerlitz, Marengo and Jena. Attacks are divided into fire (musket and cannon) and shock (bayonet and saber) modes. There are nine types of infantry units, three cavalry and five artillery. Grenadiers combat resolution systems depends less on chance (die rolls) than any game then yet developed.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player can either add her two tiles to the growing hexagonal mess or add one tile to the central display, then play a scoring card. Each scoring card is read as follows: &quot;If the largest contiguous mass of color A is larger than the largest contiguous mass of color B, then score points equal to the number of hexes in the largest contiguous mass of color C.&quot; Lots of contiguity in there!<br/><br/>A player draws one or two new tiles at the end of her turn, and the game continues until either someone runs out of scoring cards or a player can't refill her visible display of tiles. In either case, each player again receives 3-5 scoring cards adding those to any remaining in hand then players start taking turns removing one or two tiles each turn, playing a scoring card if the player removes only one tile. The game ends once all the tiles have been removed from play, and the player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The object of Alcazar is to either immobilize your opponent's pawn by enclosing it within four walls or to occupy his/her starting square.  The game comes with a red and a green pawn, 8 walls, and a board with a 4x4 grid of what appear to be castles.  Walls can be placed between any two adjacent castles forming a border.<br/><br/>The two pieces begin on their respective starting squares, which are located diagonally across the board from each other. Each piece begins surrounded by 4 walls. The object is to move one of the walls on each turn in order to either move your piece to your opponent's starting square or to enclose your opponent's piece so that it can no longer move.<br/><br/>",

It is basically a competitive game, but with a dose of semi-cooperative element.<br/><br/>Each player personifies a &quot;professional thief&quot; who attempts to retrieve valuable objects (tokens) from various cities of the world. Each city has its own security level, which is represented by the number of dice a player has to roll. The special d6 die has one &quot;fail&quot; side and five &quot;success&quot; sides. For instance, if a player wants to penetrate a level 4 city, he or she rolls four dice and all four dice must show &quot;success&quot; sides.<br/><br/>There is a unique semi-cooperative aspect here. If a player wants to penetrate a city, he or she can ask another player to join the heist. The main player and the collaborator roll the dice, and the heist succeeds if any one of them rolls all &quot;success&quot;. The main player takes the valuable object from the city while the collaborator receives points for compensation. If the heist fails, both the main player and the collaborator receive an investigation token (potential penalty points).<br/><br/>Players continue to gather valuable objects, which can be sold for immediate points or displayed to claim &quot;fame titles&quot;.  Whoever earns the most points wins the game and is declared the greatest thief of the world.<br/><br/>",

Fantasy themes and RPG tropes are turned on their heads in this game full of clumsy and unfortunately ill-fated heroes. Your job, as leader of your Venture Party, is to decide which characters are putting their lives on the line for the team. Discard the unlucky heroes and collect loot to build the strongest party! With the new 16 card built in expansion pack, there is even more potential for mayhem before you reach the bottom of the deck! The land is ripe with opportunity, and only one Venture Party will come out on top. Will it be yours?<br/><br/>The game begins by dealing 2 Party Members, and 1 Loot Token to every player. At the start of each player turn, they must draw one party member and play one party member from their hand. These heroes are disposable, each with a Power Level value from 1 to 16. Every number has varying effects depending on their Power Level (gathering loot, removing player cards, look at a players hand etc.) Since a Loot Token adds +1 to your party's overall power, Loot handling can sometimes make the difference between the winning and losing parties.<br/><br/>WINNING: When the deck runs out the game is over. You want to end the game with the strongest venture party. The strength of your party is determined by combining the numbers on your cards with the number of loot tokens you have you your possession.<br/><br/>Ex: If Pedro has the Necromancer (Level 12) and the Blind Monk (Level 6) and 5 Loot, his score is<br/>12 + 6 + 5 =23<br/><br/>",

You want to find cheese in these decks, but you must also avoid the traps they contain. When it's your turn, you must roll two dice (or in the advanced rules four dice). The dice represent the actions available for this turn: draw cards, steal cards, send the cat to eliminate the competition, heal yourself, etc. Unfortunately, you may not use the dice you roll! You must choose one or two partners to whom you will give the dice. They decide which action they keep for themselves and which action they give back to you, so discuss and choose your partners carefully!<br/><br/>Rat Trap&nbsp;is a 15- to 25-minute family game that may also be played with gamers who want a quick and fun game with a bit of treachery in it.

        "description": "Package!? is an abstract strategy game, designed with very quick play in mind (roughly 5 minutes a game), and is played without the need for a board, or a great deal of space. Each player is responsible for depositing a number of packages to 5 different locations, as well as moving packages about between these locations, and creating openings to remove opposing packages from the game. Each turn the current player will roll the die, and take one of the available actions dependant on the number rolled, taking into account the current location of the player, and the number of opposing packages at surrounding locations.<br/><br/>Points are scored for each package left in play at the end of the game depending on its location. When all players have placed their packages, the one with the most points is declared the winner&hellip; Simple. Sort of!<br/><br/>The decision behind what&rsquo;s in the packages, and what each player represents, is left to you&hellip; Maybe you are couriers taking parcels to businesses? Maybe you are spies leaving bombs in enemy facilities? Maybe you are fishermen bringing the days catch into harbour? &ndash; Lets be honest, if we told you who and what, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be abstract anymore!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Soldiers: Decision in the Trenches, 1918  is a two-player tactical wargame of low-intermediate complexity simulating the first 30 to 60 minutes of a hypothetical (though typical) attack by an American infantry division somewhere along 1st US Army&rsquo;s area of operations on the Western Front in the late summer or early autumn of that year. The American player is on the offensive, attempting to use his division to break through the German defense line that covers almost the entire map at the start of play. The German player &ndash; in the historical role of a Kampftruppenkommandeur or &ldquo;K.T.K.&rdquo; &ndash; commands, in total, a reinforced infantry regiment that&rsquo;s fighting to prevent a breakthrough, or any significant penetration, of its position. The game is won by playing once, noting the depth of the American penetration (failing a &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; breakthrough victory), then switching sides, playing again, and comparing that game&rsquo;s depth of penetration with that of the first match. Draws are possible and solitaire-play is doable.<br/> Each game turn of Soldiers is equal to five to 10 minutes of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the tempo of action in each turn, and each hexagon represents 25 yards (22.8 meters) from side to opposite side. Each unit-counter represents a platoon of infantry or heavy machineguns. Tactical support units &ndash; such as light artillery (&ldquo;one pounders&rdquo;), mortars, engineers, etc. &ndash; are assumed to have been broken up and parceled out among the infantry squads, as was the usual practice historically.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>",

Or you can ally with consorts plotting to gain favor, the queen ruling the royal harem, or the queen mother reluctant to let go of the puppet string. Even those seemingly innocent maids, or eunuchs murmuring in dark corners can get dirty jobs done. No king rules forever: proper use of limited resource and correct judgment of opponents and situations can help you to take advantage from different sides, survive in merciless conspiracies, and dominate the court in the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Entropia gives you the chance of stepping into the shoes of a young powerful star, fighting to forge your own planetary system out of chaos. In this chaotic universe, each player is a young star trying to control the galaxy where they live, and prevent the other players from seizing power. Why on earth would you dream of controlling the chaos and fighting against other stars? Well, to become the brightest and the most powerful star of the galaxy! Do not miss your chance, show the other stars how badass you are!<br/><br/>Playing the Game: To start playing Entropia, deal three cards to each player and place the deck on the centre. One of the players goes first and the game starts. During your turn, you can choose and perform only one action, which can consist in drawing a card from the deck or playing one of your cards, then the turn passes to the next player in rotation.<br/><br/>All cards in the deck stand for a planet and you can use them to perform different actions: for example, you can use your card to attract planets with your gravity by putting the card on the board in front of you (using the keyword Attract), you can convert the mass of a planet into pure energy (using the keyword Fuse) in order to draw new cards from the deck, play an extra card during your turn or scupper the strategies of the other players by destroying their planets. Moreover, you can also discard your cards when your planets have the same mass of your adversary&rsquo;s planets (using the keyword Annihilate) in order to stop other players heading all the way to the winning.<br/><br/>Since the first person to control four planets wins the game, every player should develop unique strategies to destroy other players&rsquo; cards and conquer the four planets as fast as she/he can. Even though the game looks simple and easy to play at first glance, you will need to devise strategies to control overpowered cards and use them wisely. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to greedily take over all the four planets or slowly destroy your enemies&rsquo; resources: there are more methods and strategies you can use to win over the other players, so come and discover them while playing. You need to sharpen your weapons and grit your teeth to be the next champion of Entropia!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players must also pay close attention to their bellies as their hunger level drops with each passing round.  So, finding food is also a top priority.<br/><br/>Life on the streets is tough as not only must players search for food and bones, but they also must fend off rival dogs and that pesky dog catcher.<br/><br/>",

Summon the right characters at the right time to outwit your opponents; use whatever strategy you can muster to overcome the randomness of the brawl! Amass the most glory along the way to become the ultimate champion in this crazy contest of luck and wits!<br/><br/>For basic gameplay, players shuffle their deck and draw five cards to start the game. Each player simultaneously selects a character from his hand and plays them face down at the current location. Once all the players have selected their characters, flip over the cards to begin the brawl!<br/><br/>After triggering any abilities revealed by the flip, players then compare their power type and power levels to determine who wins each scrap and the overall brawl. The winner gains one Glory (VP), plus activates any abilities their character may have that trigger off of winning. Each player then discards the played character, and draw one new card before the next round begins. The first player to reach ten Glory wins the game!<br/><br/>Each card in IncrediBrawl has a unique ability, and each player will start the game with a copy of the same set of cards. Choosing which character to play and what ability to trigger at just the right time is key to collecting the most Glory and winning the game!<br/><br/>",

Races are held in three &quot;phases&quot;: first a curve (where more maneuverable cars will prevail), a straight-away (speed rules here), and finally another curve. In addition to the various maneuver cards, you can play &quot;navigators&quot; (addition passengers in your car) which can improve your chances of crossing the finish line first.

Components include a set of trivia cards, a game board and tokens and a game cd.<br/><br/>During the game, players select one trivia category (pop music, movies, tv, news etc&hellip;) from which they must answer a question. Each question is linked to one of 99 sound clips on the cd. The difficulty of the questions varies from simply identifying where the clip originated, to providing information loosely related to the sound. Some categories are more &quot;activity&quot; based, such as short term memory, where one has to identify something heard in the clip. In the earlier parts of the game, players can choose their own categories while in the latter, the opponents select.<br/><br/>In answering questions, players move around a small circular board. The first to make it to the &quot;winner's circle&quot; is the victor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here's a description of the game from Cocktail Games:<br/><br/>Brouhaha is a game by Jean-Marc Pauly which interested us because of it's intergenerational nature, as well as the pleasant ambiance it generates around the table. The basis of the game is simple but highly effective: 42 Animal cards (21 pairs) and 4 Hunter cards are dealt out among the players. Each player then takes his cards into his hand without showing them to anyone else. Each player chooses a card and plays it face-down in front of himself. He then tries to mimic the cry of the animal on the card he has chosen, with the objective of finding its mate.<br/><br/>As soon as two players think they share the same animal, the both knock the center of the table. This action suspends the game while the players check to see if they were correct. If they were, they are awarded their respective cards.<br/><br/>At any time, a player who can't find his mate may take his card back into his hand and play out another, henceforth imitating the cry of the new card's animal instead.<br/><br/>Players have to watch out for the Hunters, which let one imitate an animal's call...<br/><br/>A game of hilarious cacophony for players 7 and up and which has an impressive variant intended for 42 players.<br/><br/>",

Every turn, you&rsquo;ll add, twist, rotate, and flip tiles to reach your goal.  This is achieved on the unique, patented Four Corners game board, which allows tiles to rotate and move without affecting neighboring tiles.  You score a goal either by creating sequences of four identical images, or by completing a full image from the corners of four tiles.

When an Alert is played, the convoy is vulnerable to attack by warships (carrier beats destroyer beats frigate and so on down to the sub, but two subs beat the carrier); if you cannot defend against the attack, your convoy is sunk (score is based on the convoy's tonnage). Otherwise it survives and the alert is passed. You can play an End of Alert, of course. Two Airplane cards in a row (by the same player) will also sink the convoy; the Airplane Hit card defends. The Mine sinks the convoy outright unless a Minesweeper is played. The Storm slows you down but you cannot be attacked except by the Mine. You can fly the Neutral pavilion, which protects you against anything but the Mine.<br/><br/>Radar cards can reveal the convoy's value. This may be good, revealing the decoy Fishing Trawler (of no value), or bad --the revealed convoy is worth double, either to the sinker or the player!<br/><br/>The game is played in several hands until a set score is reached.<br/><br/>",

Monogamy is a two player game meant for committed couples to get to know each other better.<br/><br/>Some alcohol and your partner and you're ready to start.  You move a playing piece around a board and land on squares which involve kissing, drinking, taking clothes off, or taking a card which asked the partner something about themselves or reveals something about you.  Every time you complete the board once you move up a level and the questions, and the kissing become more intimate.<br/><br/>The game starts slow and warms up very nicely.  Not at all tacky although it gets quite exciting at the end!  It is really good to find an adult game not aimed at large numbers of drunken party-goers but at improving the romance and sex-life of a committed couple.<br/><br/><br/>From the rule book: A Hot Affair will have you loving, laughing and lusting after each other with just a few throws of the die. It all begins with a loving gaze into each other's eyes. The last to blink throws the dice to start the game!<br/><br/>As you progress round the board, the questions become more intimate &amp; the challenges more steamy.<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll experience new, exciting and occasionally hilarious challenges with stimulating, sexy and wild conversations.<br/><br/>The game climaxes with the winner choosing to make real one of fifty breathtaking fantasies!<br/><br/>A Hot Affair brings back the art of fun, laughter and lust through a game so neither of you needs to be the instigator. It really does lead to the feeling that you are having an affair... but with your partner!<br/><br/>The other great thing about the game is it can be played on a number of different levels, depending on how you both feel. If you just feel like a romantic and fun night, you can play with the first two levels; if you are both feeling a little more romantic, just shuffle the fantasy cards and have fun! With over 400 ideas at three progressive levels and 50 scenarios, the game can be enjoyed over and over!<br/><br/>",

Players take the role of robots that awaken after an upgrade to find their three laws replaced with nonsensical directives such as &quot;Explore Breathing&quot; or &quot;Improvise Science&quot;. Players race to complete objectives based on these directives, the first player to complete all three directives wins the game.<br/><br/>The game opens with players drafting directives, providing them with a partial knowledge of each others' objectives. Each turn the ship encounters an obstacle, such as a meteor or enemy ship. Once that's been revealed the (relatively helpless) human crew make a quick reaction. Then the bulk of the turn is spent by the players choosing actions for their robots to take in service to their directives, before finally the event is resolved if it has not been neutralized in some way. The game ends once a player completes all three directives or the ship has encountered ten events.<br/><br/>The actions are general (move right, move left, turn on the machine in this room) and the directives might specify interactions with any part of the game (events, items, crew, machines, other robots). The wellbeing of the ship or its crew has no special place in the victory conditions, the state of the ship at the end of a game where a robot has to &quot;Empower Technology&quot; (repair at least two damaged machines) might differ from one in which a robot is trying to &quot;Improvise War&quot; (fire a living crewman and hit an enemy ship).<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of each round players will reveal which character they will be playing in a rock, paper, scissors mechanism. When it is the player's turn their character activates an attack (a resource bonus) if another player has played the targeted character and an extra character specific bonus. If a player is successfully sabotaged they also gain a sabotage card decreasing their &quot;Impact point&quot; total (see end).<br/><br/>Players will then purchase lab item cards into their lab area from their hand. Lab items can combine to create combos which give the player more research points of the drawing of more cards. Players may also play action cards which have variable effects. Players gain action cards by the successful sabotage of another player or by playing the professor card.<br/><br/>If players have enough research points they can purchase from an open supply of 3 different &quot;impact cards&quot;. They become more expensive to purchase as they get bought up. Players need impact cards to give themselves impact points which are needed to win the game.<br/><br/>Once the player has finished their turn the next player has their turn. Once all players have finished their turn players start over and reveal which new character they will be playing that round. From the beginning of the second round and future rounds each player receives 2 research points and 1 lab item card from the lab item deck.<br/><br/>How to win and end the game:<br/>The game ends at the end of the round when 2 of the 3 supply cards have run out, with the player with the most impact points winning the game. Bonuses are also given to those with the most remaining research points, lab items in their lab area and Nurture paper impact cards.<br/><br/>",

Some stations will be intersections of numerous lines, others will be on a single line. The first player lays a card face up and players in turn play cards that are on a line that matches that of the previous card. If they cannot lay a card, they draw a card. The winner is the first player to exhaust their hand. There are special cards that use phrases that will be well known to London Underground travellers and which affect game play. For example, 'Planned Engineering Works' allows a player to specify a line that is 'closed' and so cannot be played until that player's next turn. The short rules include a variant that allows multi-game scoring.<br/><br/>The cards replicate the iconic design of the London Underground map, and the game is licensed by Transport for London. It comes in a tin box that replicates the London Underground symbol (red circle crossed with a blue bar).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RANDOMISE is a mainstream, family-friendly party game that revolves around guessing random (silly) identities.<br/><br/>It consists of 110 cards and is played with a minimum of four players in two teams (no maxiumum player number). Each turn, a player draws cards to get a random identity and must choose whether to draw (90 seconds), act (60 seconds) or describe (30 seconds) their identity to their team mates. They can also choose whether to take on an easy or hard identity (with more points on offer for hard identities). <br/>  <br/>Maybe they'll become a ticklish turtle baking a cake, or a blushing robot scuba diving. With more than a million different identity combinations possible, every game is different.<br/><br/>The first team to score 30 points wins. And that's pretty much it - although there are a range of alternate gameplays that can be introduced later.<br/><br/>",

The only hope is to get a dog on board to keep thing in order. Players will have to demonstrate their cunning and a good memory to transport their animals and cabbage to the island.<br/><br/>Each player receives the same set of cargo cards with wolf, goat and cabbage. Each round a player draws a ship card which will tell him where she can place one of his cards (out of 6 ships available). Everybody needs to remember what is on each ship already, because when the ship gets 3 cards it arrives on the island. But then the rules of food chain apply, so the goat eats the cabbage and wolf eats all goat on the boat. So not everybody will actually reach the island. The goal is to deliver the most cargo cards.<br/><br/>Players have also 3 special cards which they may use at any moment during their round. Those cards allow them to sink one boat or to make the wind push the boat to the island before it gets full. The animals on the selected boat can also get seasick and return to their players hands.<br/><br/>",

That struggle historically pitted Rome against Carthage in a titanic clash that shaped the fate of the Western world for the next several centuries. The historical scenario therefore also pits two players against each other, one commanding Rome and the other Carthage.<br/><br/>Third and fourth players can be added, however, to explore the possibilities had the 2nd Punic War grown even larger through greater Gallic and Macedonian participation. Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to carve out an empire and annihilate his foes. The game uses an evolution of the system first presented in the earlier, and much liked, S&amp;T game &quot;1066.&quot;<br/><br/>The square-grid map shows all the western and central Mediterranean from Iberia on the west to Greece in the east. Each square equals 100 Roman miles from side to side.<br/><br/>Each of the iconic units within the large-size counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi, represents about 5,000 to 20,000 combatants. The unit-types represented include: legions, phalanxes, Gaesati (fanatic barbarian warriors), light infantry, cavalry, garrisons, war elephants, and fleets.<br/><br/>Each of the 17 game turns equals one year, and experienced players can count on being able to finish a match in about four to six hours.<br/><br/>",

This continues for six total rounds, with each round using one less die.<br/><br/>During the Time Phase, you'll evaluate the time of day based on the numbers that you had set aside for the roof selection.<br/><br/>The Occupancy Phase is similar to the Construction Phase, with dice rolling (no re-rolls this time) followed by choosing which dice to use to populate buildings, then setting aside a die each round for end game weather scoring.<br/><br/>This goes on for six rounds.<br/>Scoring is based on how successful you were in constructing and occupying your buildings.<br/><br/>-user summary<br/><br/><br/>Postcard release in the February 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.<br/><br/>The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Step by Step is a push-your-luck dice game in the spirit of Sid Sackson's classic Can't Stop as players try to push their pieces to the top of multiple columns on the game board &ndash; but players win by scoring points and that can be done two ways.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with their pieces in the start spaces of five columns on the game board &ndash; a space worth -5 points at game's end, mind you, so don't stick around too long! (The game board is double-sided, with one side for 2-3 players and the other for 4-5 players.)<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses a column, then rolls 2-6 dice depending on which column he chose. After rolling the dice, the player then makes a bid &ndash; either &quot;higher/same&quot; or &quot;lower/same&quot; &ndash; that lasts for the remainder of the turn. After making a bid, the player chooses one or more dice from among those he rolled previously and rerolls them. If the sum of all the dice matches his bid, then he advances a runner in the column he chose, skipping over opponents' pieces on the way.<br/><br/>The player then either ends his turn (moving his pieces to where the runner sits) or rerolls one or more dice to try to match his bid once again. If a player ever fails to match his bid, his turn ends without moving his pieces.<br/><br/>If a player ends his turn with his piece on one of 14 tokens that start on the game board, he claims this token.<br/><br/>Each column is divided into two zones, and a player cannot advance into an upper zone unless he has moved at least three pieces from the start spaces. The game ends as soon as one player piece is in each upper zone. Players score points based on the height they reached in each column (-5 to 12 points) and the number of tokens they collected (-3 to 5 points). The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

The base game includes over twenty explosive Power cards and many iconic Energy Sources, and a randomized subset of these will be selected for each game. It's an exciting array of possibilities for your customized super-powered Hero.<br/><br/>Heroes of Metro City uses dynamic deck-building combined with unique Energy Source slots to create a power management mechanism (using your Hero Placard) that lets you decide which powers and abilities are most important for each turn. The Hero Placard also helps to guide you through the six phases of each turn.<br/><br/>To succeed, the Heroes must do battle with hordes of Minions, diabolical Villains, and the Archenemy who leads them! The more Energy and Powers a Hero develops, the closer he gets to defeating their Archenemy. The first player to defeat the Archenemy wins the game...unless the Archenemy destroys so much of Metro City that there's nothing left to save!<br/><br/>",

It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.<br/><br/>User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.<br/><br/>Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&rsquo;s key cities.<br/><br/>The player who eliminates all of the opponent&rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.<br/><br/>[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961. It was designed by three Life magazine staff members. This Parker Brothers edition was published subsequently, and is thus more accurately described as the second edition. Refer to the brief clip from Life magazine in the graphics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "No Regerts: The Game of Art and Poor Life Choices is a light hearted, fast paced, pvp style card game that plays 2-6 players. Your objective is to be the most badass by the end of the game while making your friends look lame.<br/><br/>Now how? With the playing deck, each player has a &quot;formation card&quot; to show you how your &quot;body&quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).<br/><br/>To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).<br/><br/>Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.<br/><br/>1. Get tattooed:<br/>This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.<br/><br/><br/>    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.<br/><br/><br/>2. Open play:<br/>This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.<br/><br/>3. Is a require discard.<br/>This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.<br/><br/>4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).<br/><br/>The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner. So just because you finished first, it doesn't mean you've won.<br/><br/>",

Gamers can take both games and compare just how much each side learned about amphibious operations in the three years that separated the two battles.<br/><br/>The game has an 11&quot; by 17&quot; map, 95 half-inch counters, 2 pages of charts and tables and 10 pages of rules. The game covers the Allied landings just after the Royal Navy went in and blew out of the water the German destroyer flotilla (that had just landed their troops).<br/><br/>The game uses a clever mechanic that ties in units' Fatigue Levels whenever they perform any sort of operation (move, attack, defend, retreat, you get the picture). The terrain and weather were so inhospitable that units can get worn down pretty quick, and players have to be thinking ahead to win the game.<br/><br/>Rules cover formation integrity, air support (mostly the Luftwaffe), limited intelligence, combined arms, even an armistice and/or internment of German units in Sweden. There is a lot packed into this little game, and we're very happy to be able to &quot;shoe-horn it in.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In the three main chapters of the game, you will migrate from island to island, vying for control of the islands and their resources such as commerce, aloha and people. You will be able to play event cards based on the history of the islands, and you will elect chiefs and kings and a even a queen. Between chapters you will score victory points and generate the actions necessary for success in the next chapter. In the Epilogue, all of your planning will come to fruition as you try to become elected governor, the most valuable position in the game.<br/><br/>The game takes 10-15 minutes to learn, and 60-90 minutes to play. It is recommended for ages 10 and higher. It plays well for 2,3 or 4 players due to the scaling of the scoring &ndash; to keep all the games tight and fast paced. The theme is inviting and a great experience for hobby gamers and those just getting into euro-style games.<br/><br/>",

A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.<br/>2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.<br/>3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. <br/>4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)<br/>5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.<br/>6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.<br/><br/>The game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. <br/>The City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards.

In this simultaneous-play game, players form teams of expert thieves and attempt to steal valuable treasures from the museum in a series of heists. Each round, new treasures become available. However, treasures may be stolen only by experts in the specific field. The masterminds must try to assemble the best team to send in. The treasures collected range from valuable jewels, to ancient artifacts, to priceless paintings, so the team assembled must match the treasure available.<br/><br/>To play, each mastermind commits to their team by choosing one card from their hand. These are called &quot;plan cards&quot;, and they have a variety of experts on each card. Players keep their teams hidden until everyone is ready to reveal their cards at once.<br/><br/>The smallest teams get to collect treasures first, but teams with more experts can collect more items. However, larger teams move slower, so treasures may not be available when they arrive. Teams with matching experts cancel each other out, so players must form the right teams, while also sending them in at the right time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the treasures have been collected. Each item is worth victory points, and complete sets of any treasure earn extra bonus points. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four Mafia &quot;Families,&quot; controlled by two to four players, vie for control of the island of Sicily. Each Family consists of a Boss and two gangs of young thugs (picciotti).<br/><br/>The mafioso are opposed by the forces of the Italian State who are controlled by an additional player (except under the four-player rules, where the players share responsibility for moving the State's counters). The State player controls the Prefetto (Prefect), three Carabinieri (military police) units, and a secret-service (SISDE) agent. The State has also established some static roadblocks around the island which can snare careless mafioso. Through their combined efforts, the forces of the State seek to arrest as many Bosses and picciotti as they can.<br/><br/>Two decks of cards are used to reflect events stemming from the influence of mafia allies in the United States and support for the Prefetto from the Italian continent. A third card deck represents the evidence the secret-service agent can gather to establish grounds for the Prefetto to arrest Bosses.<br/><br/>But the justice system is weak. Detainees and arrestees will be released without warning. Shootouts erupt across the island. Innocent diners can face repeated attacks at their favorite ristorante. The violence is unending, with ambushes and assassinations seeming to be as common as the leaves on the olive trees. However, there is no player-elimination element, or even permanent elimination of units. Replacements will always arrive from the continent, although that will take a variable amount of time.<br/><br/>The playing board is a track of 26 loosely-defined spaces running around the perimeter of the island of Sicily, and through the center, in a sort of a B-shaped pattern. The board includes three significant Sicilian cities (Palermo, Catania, and Enna) which can serve as headquarters for the Mafia Families. Units move by a roll of the dice in a clockwise fashion, using the combined total of the dice to move one unit, or the individual numbers shown on the dice to move two units.<br/><br/>The Families are in a race to be the first to control four spaces on the board, but the State can prevail if it imprisons enough Bosses and picciotti to remediate the plague of criminal violence.<br/><br/>Mafia is a straightforward game with an unusual setting. It aroused some discussion in Italian newspapers when it first came out. The game approaches its deadly serious subject with a sarcastic tone, and somewhat sanitized violence, for a strategic and thematic gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scene It? is a trivia game based on movies.  Roll the dice, move around the board, and answer trivia about anything from movie slogans to the romantic lives of actors.  Two categories, however, allow you to watch questions presented on a DVD.  Some questions let you watch a movie clip, then answer questions about the clip, the movie, or the actors/directors involved.  Other questions have everyone racing to fill in the blanks of a movie title, guess the actor by his voice, or figuring out image puzzles to find the name of the movie (Fish Hair King = The Fisher King).  The deluxe edition comes with 6 playing pieces opposed to the 4 included in the regular game.  It also comes with a 2nd DVD, doubling the amount of DVD-based questions you can play with.  A DVD player is required to play this game.<br/><br/>",

Quad system that were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #186, Jul/Aug 1997.<br/><br/>1 turn = 1/2 day, 1 hex = 2 miles.<br/><br/>Mons, 23-27 August 1914 : &quot;As the right wing of the German Army swept through Belgium in the opening days of the World War, the British landed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the continent. Taking up position on the French left, they prepared for the German onslaught at the town of Mons. German General Alexander von Kuck's First Army was quick in coming. After a day long fight at Mons, the British fell back in a delaying action, eventually making a stand at Le Cateau. But the time they had bought proved critical in the upcoming Battle of the Marne&quot;.<br/><br/>The Marne, 5-10 September 1914 : &quot;Following their defeat in the &quot;Battle of the Frontiers&quot;, the Allied armies retreated westwards, pursued by the Germans. The French chief commander, Field Marshal Joffre, decided to make a stand south of the Marne River. The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength. At the critical moment, the French Paris Garrison counterattacked on the extended German right flank. The resulting conflagration caused the German to pull back. The Allied armies were saved and the deadlock on the Western Front would soon begin.<br/><br/>",

Choose your favorite pups to enter a competitive dog show and use cards to improve their rating, bring down the competition, or cause chaos for a puptastic good time! Only one dog can be named the Goodest Dog, but not to worry: no dog will ever be less than a 10/10!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: Each dog has a set of six scored categories (none less than 10/10) and an overall &ldquo;Goodness&rdquo; score. After adopting dogs from the shelter, players join a dog show and, when one of the six categories is chosen for judging, send their best doggos into the ring to compete. Players can then play event cards for any number of game-changing results, including lowering or increasing a certain dog&rsquo;s rating number, changing the judging category, distracting dogs out of the competition entirely, swapping dogs with other players, and so much more! Each judging round includes three chances to play event cards, so players can strategize and play for the long or short term&mdash;the dog with the highest rating at the end of the judging round will go to the winner&rsquo;s circle! Once the Winner&rsquo;s Circle is full of good dogs, there is one final judging round for overall Goodness&mdash;but event cards can still provide chaotic and unexpected results before one dog is finally named the Goodest Dog!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So for any given trick, your options are to either follow suit, or trump.  You can throw anything you want if you do not have a card of the suit led.<br/><br/>The first person to score 12 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Galaxy Command, 1 to 4 players take the role of a galaxy commander. Each tries to maintain a delicate balance of resources, military power, and technological achievements as they explore the galaxy.  Game play is fast and fun with varied decisions to be made by each player during their missions.<br/><br/>In each game of Galaxy Command there are near and far systems that must be overcome in order to bring in new resources and wealth.  Near systems must be explored before attempting to reach far systems.  Some far systems require key technology to be reached with any chance of success. Near systems provide resources that can build your military strength and develop technologies allowing you to overcome challenges as you go deeper into space.<br/><br/>During a turn players reveal a system card (starting with near systems) on their mission path and try to overcome its obstacles.  Next they collect wealth and resources and build military strength and technology.  And finally a random event card is drawn that may affect one or all players in the game.  The event cards are also the timer on the game.  When the event cards run out the game is over.  The Galaxy Command (all players) saves or fails in its mission by reaching enough far systems to sustain its empire.  Each Galaxy Commander (individual player), provided the empire is saved, can be the best among peers by his contribution (score) to the overall mission success.<br/><br/>No two games will play the same as the systems you get, and the decisions you make will change game to game.The event cards affect different players during each game.The game plays in 15 to 45 minutes depending on the number of players and how quick they play.The game is playable for ages 8 to 800 (if you're from planet Cirius...).<br/><br/>Originally published by Robert as a print and play solitaire game with 19 cards. In this version we have taken the original game, added a multi-player element by expanding the deck to 54 cards, new artwork, planets, and challenges but keeping the clean mechanics in place. The game was well received as it was and now we have made it playable from 1 to 4 players yet still keeping it playable in under 45 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The battle for Mlawa was the first of many battles that occurred in the Northern Mazowsze in 1939 (Polish territory north of Warsaw).  Here the German 3rd Army, commanded by General Kuchler, fought against the Polish Army &quot;Modlin&quot;.<br/><br/>The Germans had tremendous superiority; in the main sector they had five divisions, including one armored division, while the Polish had only one division and two cavalry brigades.  Although there was one Infantry Division (8th ID) in reserve, it was too far away to intervene in the first days of the operation. <br/> Despite their great advantage, the Germans did not break through the Polish front lines because the 20th Polish Infantry Division, which defended the Mlawa position, was strengthened by permanent fortifications whose flanks were situated on swamps and wet terrain.  The Germans stormed the defenses for more than three days before they were able to take possession after the Poles abandoned them.  As the German commander of the 3rd German Army could not overcome the Polish positions frontally, he ordered Mlawa to be flanked from the south.<br/><br/><br/>The box edition (third) comprises a 39&quot;x27&quot; full color map, 400 die-cut counters and a couple of sheets of informational markers that need to be cut.

He places it in front of him turned and leaves the used token on it being unused. He will play with one less chip.<br/>If other players 'tokens are found on the card to be lifted, they return to their owners' reserve.<br/><br/>GAME OVER:<br/>The first player to get 3 cards in their possession wins the game.<br/><br/>ADVANCED VERSION<br/>It is played the same as the base game but the 4 effect cards are mixed, the first 2 are taken and placed on the table. The remaining 2 are removed from the game.<br/><br/>These letters have actions. Some are executed immediately and others on the next turn of whoever chose it. A player achieves an effect when one of his pieces is placed in the middle position of a card with its numerical value in white.<br/><br/>At that time you can select one of the 2 visible effects. Then that card must turn it over and the effect of its reverse will be the one that can be chosen in the future.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the publisher:)<br/><br/>Downfall is a wargame simulating the planned but never executed US invasion of the Japanese home island of Kyushu during the last quarter of that year. The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from X-Day +1 through X-Day +30. One player acts as the overall commander of the Allied invasion effort; the other takes the role of the leader of the Japanese defense force. The burden of attack is generally on the American, but both players attempt to win by controlling key terrain on the island and destroying opposing forces. A complete game of DF takes from two to four hours to complete and it's suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The approach we've taken here is called, among those who deal regularly with alternative history &ndash; which is itself also known as &quot;virtual history&quot; and &quot;alternative outcome analysis &ndash; the conservation of historical reality. That is, to make the assumptions and results of our simulation as valid as possible, we made the fewest possible changes needed to the historic timeline in order to put our alternative one in place. The basic assumption here, then, is that the Japanese simply refused to surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That would have likely meant one or another of the coups plotted during those desperate days actually went through, putting in place a new war cabinet of ultimate hard liners, men determined Japan should fight to the end no matter what.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals 4.4 miles (about 7 kms) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents one day. Every ground unit represents a division, division-equivalent, or brigade of about 5,000 to 20,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles. Designed by Ty Bomba.<br/><br/>Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #230 (September-October 2005)<br/><br/>",

The battlefield is always the same, but the enemy changes; some nights, taking the form of spiders and creepy-crawlies, other nights, taking the form of unknown shapes that shift on the edge of your vision.  Your duty is to defend the serenity of dreams from the corruption of the Nightmare by ensuring that the Nightlight stays lit. Take control of a stuffed animal animated by the Child&rsquo;s imagination and given strength by the magic of dreams themselves!<br/><br/>Rounds are divided into phases, with the players and the Nightmare deck each taking turns to act.  First, the stuffed animals raid the Toy Chest for Weapon and Skill cards that they can use to defend against the enemies of the Nightmare.  Then, each player is dealt two Nightmare cards, which could either be enemies or Crises, that their stuffed animal must deal with during the next phase.  Finally, the dreamscape shifts, and a new Dream card is flipped, adding a new weakness for the Nightmare to exploit.<br/><br/>After each side has prepared, the enemies and stuffed animals take turns attacking.  Once every enemy has attacked, each side is granted a short reprieve before starting a new round.<br/><br/>Every round is more dire than the last, but if at least one stuffed animal survives until the end of the third round, the Nightlight has survived until dawn and the players have won the game!<br/><br/>Fight hard, but don&rsquo;t let the changing nature of dreams distract your stuffed animal and give the Nightmare an opportunity to strike!<br/><br/>",

Set up the game by dealing out the entire pack of cards equally between the number of players and leaving one card in the middle to start the snap pile.<br/><br/>Each player must then draw the top 3 cards from their respective<br/>draw piles to create their hand (make sure the other players don&rsquo;t see your hand). Snap down any card from your hand onto the centre piles each time there's a match by colour , symbol or number. Only when you have used all three cards in your hand are you able to draw a new hand. Everyone plays at once in a furiously fast race to get rid of their cards fast.<br/><br/>To make things even more fun, there are action cards throughout the pack - a freeze card, a new peachy pile card and a clear hand pile. Any card can be played on top of an action card.<br/>When you play the freeze card you are then able to nominate any player who then can not play until 5 cards have been played in the game.<br/><br/>The new peachy pile card allows you to start another brand new pile in addition the the main snap pile.<br/>If the clear hand card is among the three cards in your hand you are able to discard your entire hand onto the snap pile with the clear hand card on top.<br/><br/>The first player with no cards left wins by saying 'Peach Snaps!'<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead of donating this to museums, they decide to organize unusual auctions amongst themselves to distribute the spoils.<br/><br/>The innovative bid mechanism is that players cannot bid a number whose &quot;ones&quot; digit matches the number on any card they have previously won. Thus, if you have cards showing &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, you cannot bid 2, 4, 12, 14, 22, etc. What's more, when someone wins an auction, the money is paid out to those owning a card whose number matches the &quot;ones&quot; digit of the winning bid. Thus, while you need to acquire cards in order to win the game, you don't want to enrich your opponents too much.<br/><br/>Templari differs from the earlier releases Don and Serengeti in that the game has a maximum count of five players, all players start with twelve coins, and in each round players bid on lots of exactly two cards (whereas in earlier versions, the lots would have one, then two, then three cards, then back to one).<br/><br/>",

The goal is to successfully deliver cupcakes without running out of them on your way.<br/><br/>Step 2.

Players represent houses, comprised of two to four villagers, one or more of whom may be a witch. The zealots win by uncovering the identity of all witches in play&mdash;a discovery made only through fire. The sympathizers win by keeping the witches&rsquo; identities hidden. With witches forming a small minority, the sympathizers&rsquo; only chance for success depends on their ability to employ cunning and misdirection as they seek to outwit the other players by turning the zealots&rsquo; xenophobia and pyromania back onto themselves.<br/><br/>The game typically goes for 45-75 minutes and concludes when either every witch in the village has been uncovered or enough innocents have been wrongly condemned that the witch hunt is called off, and the sympathizers win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Armed with only your wits and a list of antidote ingredients, you must battle the wilds, monsters, and your fellow players to be the first to return to the apothecary with the items you need.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull; 1 Game Board<br/>&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Pawns<br/>&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Breath Trackers<br/>&bull; 6 Sets of 10 Ingredient Cards (60 total)<br/>&bull; 50 Monster Cards<br/>&bull; 18 Meddling Cards<br/>&bull; 10 Loot Cards<br/>&bull; 8 Drop Cards<br/>&bull; 1 10-Sided Battle Die<br/>&bull; 1 6-Sided Movement Die<br/>&bull; 1 Wooden Debris Token<br/><br/>Preparing the Game:<br/>Each player selects a colored pawn, the corresponding breath-tracker token, and the corresponding deck of ten Ingredient Cards. Players place their pawns on the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut in the center of the board and place their breath-tracker tokens on the number 50 on the breath tracker.<br/><br/>Next, players shuffle their ten Ingredient Cards and randomly select four ingredients. These will represent the ingredients they will need to collect for their unique antidotes. Players will place their four Ingredient Cards on the table in front of them face-up with the black vial at the top. Each player&rsquo;s remaining six Ingredient Cards can be returned to the box.<br/><br/>Players are dealt Meddling cards based on the number of players:<br/>&bull; In a game with two players, five Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>&bull; In a game with three players, four Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>&bull; In a game with four or more players, three Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.<br/>Meddling Cards are dealt face-down and go into the player&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>Rules &amp; Gameplay:<br/>Health:<br/>Each player starts with 50 &ldquo;breaths.&rdquo; Every time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die or a 10-sided battle die, he/she loses a breath and gets one step closer to expiring. All players&rsquo; breaths are tracked around the edges of the board on the breath tracker grid. If any player is reduced to zero breaths, that player expires and is out of the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Tip: Select one player at the start of the game to manage the breath tracker.<br/>         Note: Even with bonuses, no player may have more than 50 breaths at any point during the game.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Movement:<br/>Each player will start his/her turn rolling the 6-sided movement die to determine how many spaces to move on the board. That player may choose any path and may move spaces forward and/or backward in any direction, even in the same turn.<br/><br/><br/>     Remember: Each time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die, he/she loses a breath on the breath tracker!<br/><br/><br/>Fighting a Monster:<br/>A Monster fight is triggered when a player approaches a Monster Deck and lands on a red space leading to the Monster Deck. However, if a player lands on a red space while traveling away from a Monster Deck, no Monster fight is triggered. In other words, if traveling in the same direction as the red arrow is pointing, you enter combat; if traveling in the opposite direction of the arrow, no combat is triggered.<br/><br/>When a Monster fight is triggered, a player flips the top card of the Monster Deck and must defeat the revealed Monster before moving on&hellip; or die trying. Players may also retreat and reverse direction if they have any movements left from their movement roll.<br/><br/>The Monster&rsquo;s level is listed at the top of the Monster Card.<br/><br/>To defeat the Monster, a player must roll the 10-sided battle die and get a number that is equal to or higher than the Monster&rsquo;s level. The player rolls until the Monster is defeated or until he/she decides to retreat. Once a Monster is defeated, it is put in a discard pile on the table.<br/><br/>Bonuses &amp; Drops:<br/>Some high-level Monsters, though difficult to beat, may offer helpful bonuses or valuable drop items that can greatly assist a player. Bonuses and drops are listed at the bottom of high-level Monster&rsquo;s cards. Some drops benefit the player for the remainder of the game while others are used once and then discarded.<br/><br/>Meddling:<br/>Meddling Cards can be used at any point during the game to hinder fellow players from advancing. Meddling Cards can also be traded in at any time to regain five breaths on the breath tracker. Once a Meddling Card is used or traded in, it is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>Collecting Loot and Ingredients:<br/>To collect an ingredient, a player must land on the corresponding starred green space on the board. Once an ingredient is collected, the player flips his/her corresponding Ingredient Card.<br/><br/>To collect loot, a player must land on the starred yellow space that abuts it. If a player gets a Loot Card, it is added to his/her hand and may be used at any time. Like drops, Some Loot Cards give players temporary abilities while others award advantages.<br/><br/>Dueling:<br/>During a player&rsquo;s turn, if he/she ever occupies the same space as another player, then he/she may challenge that player to a duel. A player can only challenge another player to a duel when that other player has an ingredient that the challenger still needs.<br/><br/>During the duel, each player rolls the 10-sided battle die. Whoever has the highest roll wins, and in case of a tie, the advantage goes to the challenged player. If the challenger wins the duel, he/she takes the needed ingredient item from the challenged player, who now has to either go back and get the ingredient again or give chase to get it back. If the challenged player wins, then the challenger automatically loses 5 breaths and cannot duel that player again this turn.<br/><br/>Note: Players may use any applicable Drop Cards or Loot Cards during their duels.<br/>Looting:<br/>If a player runs out of breath, his/her pawn is left on the spot of expiration. Each other player may loot the body if they ever occupy the same space as the expired player&rsquo;s pawn. A player may only loot an expired pawn once per turn and only for needed ingredient items or unused or perpetual drop or Loot Cards.<br/><br/>Ending the Game:<br/>The first player to return to the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut center of the board with all of the necessary ingredients for his/her antidote is victorious! Sometimes, though, all players expire and the game wins!<br/><br/>",

Place the timer, the die and the Cranium Clay container on the table.<br/><br/>3 The first team must choose its character box and draw a card. Follow instructions on the card. The player whose birthday is closest is the first player to go on the team.<br/><br/>4 Roll the die and move the appropriate number of spaces only if your team has completed the character card activity successfully; otherwise, pass the play to the team on the left. Stop on any Planet Cranium spaces you pass over during your move forward.

Continue play with the team whose turn it was before the bonus round.<br/><br/>9 Enter the Cranium Central at the end of the game board. When you roll, advance to the appropriate character box as indicated by the color rolled on the die.<br/><br/>10 Complete the activity in Cranium Central. Advance to the next character in clockwise motion. Wait for your next turn to complete that activity.<br/><br/>11 A team wins when it is the first to complete the four activities in Cranium Central.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player draws either the top card of the deck or a face-down card that was placed on the table earlier by a player. If you draw a basket, you can place it in front of you; each basket has one of three animals in it &mdash; dog, cat or badger &mdash; with 1-3 animals of that type. If you have a basket and draw a balloon of the appropriate color &mdash; red for dog, blue for cat, brown for badger &mdash; you can add the balloon to the basket; if the basket now has as many balloons as animal adventurers in the basket, place the basket to the side to score points for it at the end of the game. If you draw a finish line card, you can place it face up on the table.<br/><br/>If you don't want to use a card or can't use it &mdash; such as when you draw a badger basket and are already working on one &mdash; place it face down on the table where someone else can draw it later. You can discard your gear wheel from the game to draw a second card on your turn.<br/><br/>When three of the five finish line cards are face up, the game ends and everyone scores one point for each animal adventurer in a balloon you've completed. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>For younger players, leave out the finish line cards and have the game end when only a single card remains in the deck. For older players, have them score negative points for baskets started and not finished, with each such basket worth -1 point and each balloon attached to these baskets also worth -1 point.<br/><br/>",

The player who finishes the game with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Everyone has two choices in their turn: either recruit safe-crackers or attempt to crack a safe. One of these two must be chosen every turn.<br/><br/>The first choice is to take one of your own safe-crackers and put him on any of another player. Put this safe-cracker in that team before you. This way you can build safe-cracker teams in addition to individual safe-crackers. The piece lying on top shows who has the safe-cracking team under their control.<br/><br/>The second choice is to crack the safe. First a gaze at the safe cards: On each safe card, a value that this safe contains is printed - the loot. Simultaneously it also portrays how large the safe-cracking team must be in order to crack this safe; the team may also be bigger. Place the team on the desired safe, dismantle it and share the loot.<br/>The card with the cracked safe is set aside and a new safe card is uncovered.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the safes are cracked.

        "description": "Energi (Swedish for Energy) is an educational game constructued in the 80's.<br/><br/>Each player is leading a part of the world (&quot;West&quot; - north America, &quot;East&quot; - eastern Europe, &quot;North&quot; - western Europe and &quot;South&quot; - the middle east, each of these have a slighty different setup) during a ten year period. The goal is to use the natural resources available (Oil, Coal and Uranium) to earn as much money as possible. Money is mainly gained by having factories, but factories need energy and they pollute. To create energy you need power plants, to run the plants you need natural resources which are limited. When creating the energy you also pollute and this you must compensate by cleaning the environment, but to do this you must have energy.<br/><br/>So all in all, this is a resouce management game. It is also an educational game and tries to simulate the actual situation in the 80's.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Satirical card game Antyszczepionkowcy.biz (anti-vaccers.biz) is designed to trick players to becoming aware of the value of vaccinations. <br/>Players can expect perverse humour and fun with friends. The game shows the consequences and realities of the activities of businessmen profiting from alternative medicine.<br/><br/>Players try to gain influence at all costs by selling useless goods in their online stores. They also collect signatures and lobby for harmful laws. Their actions affect the population resistance index, and over time, cases of various diseases become more dangerous. This may harm the anti-vaccers themselves ... unless they are smart enough to vaccinate.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them on the table. If the player draws a disease with the same name as a disease already on the table, he was too greedy and his turn ends immediately. All the cards were drawn in this turn being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then earn as much money as much card he draws and buys one card (Product / Signature for Law / Action). Of course, players can vaccinate themselves: this hypocrisy costs them -1 point per vaccinate but give them a possibility to ignore the first card of a disease per turn.<br/><br/>When one player has at least ten influence points the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

For putting, if the number rolled on the putting column is greater than or equal to the distance left to the pin, the putt is good.

The deck consists of four copies each of ten pandas, numbered 1-10, and four Panda Law cards [High(6-10), Low(1-5), Even, Odd]. On your turn you will play one hidden panda face down, and one panda face up.  Your face up panda uses a special ability to do something -- steal a panda, change the Panda Law, or even gain bamboo!<br/><br/>The Red Panda sits in the middle of the table, ready to award bamboo. If your turn starts and you can see four currently adorable pandas (by the Panda Law), scoring happens. You take the Red Panda card, and follow the instructions on the back. All hidden pandas are revealed, and everyone with at least two adorable pandas in play gets a bamboo. The player(s) with the most adorable pandas get a second bonus bamboo. Then, all adorable pandas are shuffled back into the deck (Other pandas remain). You choose a new Panda Law, and play continues. When someone gets to five bamboo, they win!<br/><br/>Games last 5-15 minutes, and Adorable Pandaring can be played with 3-5 players.<br/><br/>",

The last king of the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d, III. Andr&aacute;s is likely to be a victim of poisoning and the real power is in the hands of the most powerful barons, who rule as kings in their own realm. Waging war against each other, the country is essentially torn into several parts. Everyone is preparing for the final showdown... and the war has begun!<br/><br/>The country is divided into six provinces, each ruled by a different baron and all they want is the crown. But only one of them can succeed! The game is about this decade, until K&aacute;roly R&oacute;bert consolidates his power. Diplomacy has a very important role, from the money you gather you have to bid on the offices of the Palatine, the Judge and the Treasurer. The game is immediately won, if someone manages to acquire all three offices, or the barons of the other players are defeated and killed in battle, or specified castles are occupied or rules 3-4 separate parts of the country. Lots of intrigue and bloody battles are waiting!<br/><br/>We can call Sword and Crown the Hungarian version of the well-known game Risk, but with completely unique solutions, even greater game experience, with real battles, sieges, where only the size of your army and the dice rolls decide the outcome of a battle.<br/><br/>Andr&aacute;s has died, with him the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d.

During two and a half months, 22 German divisions were sieged in the city, defending themselves from the Red Army onslaught, street by street and house by house. All the German attempts were <br/>in vain.<br/><br/>Attacks and counterattacks were continuous and the casualties for both sides were very high.

Too bad it can carry just one person.<br/>To make things worse, there&rsquo;s no fuel in the Minivan and the Keys are lost somewhere in one of the Shops. It will take both brawns and brains&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to make some heads rolling, betray all the others and run away to safety!<br/><br/>Night falls over the happy looking Evans City Mall.<br/>Just a few Humans are left roaming all sad and alone with nobody caring for them. No one willing to hug them, no one that loves them. They all roam around that old Minivan, that&rsquo;s weird. And much too weird, they run away or try to hit us with heavy things instead of joining us in a big hug. They are confused by fear and loneliness, but the Horde will never stop loving! It will take some effort and a big heart but we will finally hug and cuddle them all to be happy ever after! Love will finally win over everything else!<br/><br/>Aim of the Game<br/>Players in Hug Me all starts as humans. But life is hard in Evans City and during the game they can become Infected and later on Zombies.<br/>If you are Human, you must escape the City Mall. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first, then the Key (or the Spare Key) and take them to the Minivan.<br/>If you are Infected, you must blow up the City Mall so that the Horde cannot spread outside. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first than the Lighter and take them to the Boiler Room. If you are a Zombie you must hug all humans so that love wins over everything! Zombies win all together when there are no more humans in the game.<br/>Zombie players must really hug Human players to validate the Hug, otherwise the contamination is void!<br/><br/>Quick Rules<br/><br/>Dawn: If you are a Zombie, draw a Zombie card, secretly choose one or more Room Cards and place your Zombie Character and the Zombie Card in one or more Rooms.<br/><br/>Day: According to turn Humans can move and take an action (or vice versa). They can choose one of these Actions: Stealing (Challenge another player to take an Item from him/her), Barricading (Block a Room so that for the rest of the Day and the next night nobody can move to or from that Room also getting a bonus to Zombie Assaults) Searching (Draw an Item from the Deck in the Room where your Character is).<br/><br/>Night: All Room Cards chosen by Zombie Players are revealed. If there are Humans in those Rooms, Humans face the Assault. If any Human survives, they draw one Zombie Card each and face the normal Assault for that turn.<br/><br/>If Humans lose an Assault, they try to Escape and if they fail they are Infected and from now on they roll the Zombie Die each turn. If they fail the roll, they become Zombies.<br/><br/>If an Infected becomes a Zombie, he/she removes his/her Keyholder from the game and starts playing as a Zombie from the next Dawn phase placing his/her Zombie Character and a Zombie Card secretly in one or more Rooms.<br/><br/>Humans win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Key, they get to the Minivan.<br/>Infected win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Lighter, they get to the Boiler Room.<br/>Zombies win if there are no more Humans in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This harness racing game is one of a number of Alga games that deals with horses and horse racing. See also Jägersro and Månvalla med V5.<br/><br/>A full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.<br/><br/>Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.<br/><br/>The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.<br/><br/>After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.<br/><br/>Approximate play sequence:<br/><br/>1) Auction - buy a number of horses<br/>2) Train them for the race<br/>3) Select horses for race 1<br/>4) Betting phase<br/>5) Run short race<br/>6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.<br/>7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race<br/>8) repeat 1-6 twice<br/>9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.<br/><br/>",

It marked the introduction of hex based maps to the hobby (contemporaneously with D-Day and Gettysburg) It also marked an unfortunate experiment in early wargame map graphics -- instead of using illustrations to depict terrain features, the hexes were simply filled with a single color. The result was more mosaic than map.<br/><br/>After a couple of years, Chancellorsville was dropped from the The Avalon Hill Game Co line. In 1974, The Avalon Hill Game Co released Randall Reed's revision of the game. However, by the mid 1980's Chancellorsville had vanished from the The Avalon Hill Game Co catalog.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Chancellorsville (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

Collaborative in nature, players work to tell the story of the monster's defeat, but unlike many storytelling games, the ending is not set. Within the storytelling are mechanisms for unexpected turns of events...<br/><br/>Players begin with a hand of cards, each an element to work into the story being told.  As they tell their story, they play a card, and if they can link multiple cards from their hand together, they receive a bonus of some sort usable later in the defeat of the Great Old One (or his ascension if the player turns out to be a cultist).  If something is mentioned and another player has a card matching what is mentioned, he takes over the story and uses his cards at that point.<br/><br/>The objective is to tell a great story and then reach the climactic fight between the investigators and the Great Old One which is told in story-format as well.<br/><br/>Cthulhu's Vault is co-designed by Richard Launius and Jim Dietz.  Launius is the designer of the classic 'Arkham Horror' while Dietz is the author of 'The Cthulhu Rainy-Day Activity Book' and the Lovecraftian novel 'The Last Post'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ethereal pirates swarm back and forth over each other's ships as the seas toss in the midnight storm. The decks of each vessel shift in and out of reality as the fighting begins. One captain and crew will emerge triumphant, and the loser will be damned to stalk the bowels of Davy Jones' locker.<br/><br/>Ghost Pirates is a tactical board game in which two ghost pirate Captains encounter each other on the high seas; based on old rivalries, grudges, or whatever it was that happened on Skull Island, they each turn broadside and lay-to. Each crew, following captain's orders, fights, fires cannons, and swarms their enemy's deck, attempting to force the other captain to walk the plank. Each player's turn consists of drawing a card, playing one or more cards to strengthen their ship and tactical position, moving your pirate crew, and finally, having them fight the foeman or take advantage and pillage the enemy&rsquo;s ship. The goal of the game is to force your opponent&rsquo;s captain to walk the plank.<br/><br/>Gameplay is designed to emulate tactical melee battles with a unique dice mechanic that is easy to learn and quick to play, especially for beginning gamers. It bears certain similarities to wargames like Axis and Allies, but on a much smaller, more fast-paced scale.

Your aim is to become a world-class climber by reaching the top of the mountain first and getting one up on your opponents.<br/><br/>Roll &amp; Wall is a fast-paced family dice racing game, for 2 to 5 players, in which you try to climb as high as you can by using dice. During your turn, you have six dice and you have to decide how many of them you want to use for each step. Climbing up requires to roll dice with matching or higher value than those printed on your chosen space on the board. You can take a risk and try to roll &quot;4&quot; or higher by using only one die or play it safe and use three dice. Used dice become unavailable until your next round, so you should choose wisely. Throughout the race, climbers can use handy items which they picked up at the beginning of the game. Special amulets, energy bars, and professional climbing equipment help players to reach the top faster or (if you are a mischievous rascal) to make climbing harder for other players.<br/><br/>The game contains three modular two-sided race tracks which allow for the track to be changed at the beginning of each game. Inside the box you will find an awesome cardboard dice tower, making rolling the dice a much more charming experience. Gather friends and family and check if you got what it takes to become master climber!<br/><br/>",

The potions (large tiles) are placed on the track on the game board, the witch is put anywhere between two potions. Now a die is rolled. It determines how many steps the witch should go forward - but she doesn't actually move. Instead, each player calculates in his/her head where she should land, then looks at the next potion. The first player who can tell which ingredient is missing scores a point. <br/>When the players are familiar with the system, various difficulty levels can be added by rolling more than one die:<br/><br/>- One die to determine the movement direction<br/>- One die to determine whether the witch looks in the cauldron ahead or the one behind<br/>- One die to determine whether the witch is used or the fox - who always does the opposite of what the dice say (including finding out which ingredient is used twice instead of missing)<br/><br/>The more dice are in play, the trickier it is. Another way to increase the difficulty is to use the dice cup and only leave the dice visible for a short moment.<br/><br/>The first player to collect a certain number of points is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

Players are working together to gather clues, kill monsters, close gates and eventually defeat the Great Old One (Cthulhu).<br/><br/>Players will select characters, each with a unique special ability.  During a player's turn they will roll 5 dice with unique symbols on each side, after rolling they have the option of re-rolling 3 more times.  If the &quot;Monster&quot; symbol is rolled on a die it is locked and cannot be re-rolled.  If 3 Monster symbols appear a new gate opens and a monster appears in Arkham.  The other sides of the dice include movement points, clue tokens (used to close gates), healing, and combat symbols (used when fighting the monsters guarding the gates).  Each player must carefully choose how to use their symbols to move around and try to close and collect six gates.  If six gates are open on the board the players automatically lose..  However if the players manage to close six gates Cthulhu awakens and players must try to defeat him with their remaining items and abilities.<br/><br/>This game is in no small part inspired by Felbrigg Herriot's (FNH1) wonderful Dune Express game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dragonball Ball Z CCG was created by Score and had a good number of expansions or sets before finally dying.<br/><br/>All players start the game with a character from the series, called the main personality. Each main personality character usually has three levels, to a maximum of five. Throughout the game, the main personality can get stronger via gaining anger, replacing the previous version played.<br/><br/>Decks are divided into seven different styles: Blue, Red, Orange, Black, Saiyan, Namekian and Free-Style. Each style focuses on a different aspect of combat. For instance, the Red style focuses on gaining anger, while the Namekian style focuses on life and energy. If a player uses nothing but one color or style in his or her deck, the player would be able to declare a Tokui-waza at the start of the game, allowing various benefits, such as certain cards allowing additional powers, as stated in the card's text box.<br/><br/>Later expansions allowed you to play Mastery cards that allowed abilities that always stayed in play. Sensei cards were also eventually introduced, allowing for sideboards to cater against one's opponent.<br/><br/>There are three ways to win the game. First is to reduce your opponent's deck to zero cards. Second is to win via having the most powerful personality, via gaining anger. This win condition may sometimes be not available, depending on who one's main personality is. Third is to play or capture, all seven Dragon Balls. Again, this win condition may sometimes be unavailable, depending on how decks are constructed.<br/><br/>The bulk of the Dragon Ball Z CCG focuses on combat. Players alternate as attacker and defender. Attacks are divided into physical and energy attacks. Physical attacks reduce the opponent's power levels, eventually dealing life damage. Energy attacks deal damage directly, but usually costs two power levels to perform. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense, as cards are discarded from one's deck upon taking damage, making it possible for a certain card to be discarded from play, even before being used.<br/><br/>The game was criticized to be highly random and greatly dependent on having better cards than one's opponent, as opposed to simply being the better player. Nonetheless, the tournament scene was quite popular during the game's existence, and the secondary market remains strong even after the game has died out.<br/><br/>",

Brave parties of heroes are gathering to hunt them down in an attempt to restore the balance of power.<br/><br/>Each player in Dice &amp; Dragons plays a mighty hero, chosen from five basic classes: warrior, wizard, ranger, cleric, and rogue. Each has a unique set of skills, which can be developed and leveled up using a simple character-building system. Each game represents a new challenge as you will be hunting a new breed of dragons. After each successful hunt, your party goes back to the village to claim its bounty.<br/><br/>",

Be the first to get rid of all of your cards, and win. But watch out for the sassy talking pawn. It dishes out extra cards, and attitude, too.<br/><br/>Each player starts with seven cards and follows play directed by the talking pawn as, one by one, they try to play cards from their hand onto the discard pile by matching either the color (and playing one card) or by playing a sequence of cards in numerical orders. Sorry! cards can be played on opponents who then have to face the direction of the talking pawn after tapping the unit on the head. The pawn takes sweet revenge on players by doling out additional cards and attitude.<br/><br/>",

To do so, you must get a variety of scratching styles from unique dogs. The dogs at this bar are picky and all have different criteria you must meet before they let you pet them. You also need to be a good patron of the establishment by buying drinks.

But best of all, Linkage was designed and themed around a process normally taught in high school biology, DNA Transcription, (when an RNA copy is made from DNA for protein synthesis or other in a cell) and in this way offers a unique, engaging and tactile experience for someone to familiarize themselves with this fundamental concept of biology.<br/>  <br/>In Linkage, DNA cards are randomly aligned side-by-side creating a DNA template strand. Players compete to build the most accurate RNA copy of this DNA Template by connecting their own RNA Cards side-by-side to match the DNA Template.<br/><br/>During a turn, players choose between one of four actions: Building onto their RNA Strand, Fixing their RNA strand, Mutating an opposing players RNA Strand, or Mutating the actual DNA Strand. Players can also pay (discard) cards from their hand to take extra actions during their turn.<br/><br/>Players are awarded points based upon the number of RNA Cards in their strand that correctly pair with the DNA template. The game can be played in as little 10 to 20 minutes but additional rounds can be added for a longer, more in-depth game. Multiple decks can also be added together for a game with more than 4 people, or a longer overall game.<br/><br/>",

Players become detectives and work alone or with a partner and choose a murder, robbery, or swindle investigation. Players visit crime scenes and gather evidence. 16 scanner cards are shuffled and one is selected at random and inserted into the Clue Scanner. This provides the clues that the detectives will need to solve the crime. Each player is provided with a detectives handbook to record clues and a readout book that lists known suspects for the different types of crimes. Clues can be obtained by visiting the crime scene, talking to witnesses, stakeouts, and at the crime lab. Suspects are eliminated by looking at behavior patterns consistent with that criminals past crime record. Clues can be taken from other detectives, but at the risk of giving up other clues as well. The first detective to identify the correct culprit wins. A fun game but a little dated by todays technology.<br/><br/>",

To win the game, a player or team must be the first to score five goals.<br/><br/>To set up each match, players shuffle their deck of sixty cards, their goal cards, and the communal set of 24 field cards. They lay out five fields cards in a row to create the playing surface; each field card has a number on it. Each player randomly chooses one of his goal cards and places it face-down at one end of the field. Each goal card has a 1 on it. Players then get their cards and wait for the whistle.<br/><br/>At the same time, players start going through their decks, one card at a time. If a card is unplayable, the player places it face-up in one of two reserve stacks in front of him. A card is playable or not based on this restriction: Moving from left to right, players first need to play a 1 to cover their own goal, then they must play one or more cards that sum to the value on the leftmost field card. Once that card is covered, they play one or more cards that sum to the value on that field card. And so on.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the opponent's goal, he flips over that goal card to reveal a picture of a goalie and a ball entering the net. He then needs to mix together all of his discards and played cards, flip them over, and start looking card-by-card for four cards that can be fit together puzzle-style to resemble the picture on the back of the goal card. The first player to do this scores a goal and keeps the opponent's goal card; if he made a mistake anywhere, he scored an own goal, so the opponent gets a goal card from him.<br/><br/>Players then shuffle the cards and go at it once again. The first player to score five goals wins!<br/><br/>",

The board features a unique, 3D design with one half the board containing the castle grounds and the other half containing the castle stairs and castle. The castle stairway is a molded plastic insert into the board with slots on each stair for the vampires to stand in vertically. At the back edge of the stairway, a cutout for the castle itself rises vertically from the board.<br/><br/>The game setup includes populating the castle stairs with 11 vampires (6 castle guests, and 5 butlers). On each player's turn, they can take one of three actions: 1. Move their vampire hunter, then move the vampires, 2. Draw hunt cards, then move the vampires, or 3. Move the vampires, and then throw a garlic clove.<br/><br/>Moving the vampires involves turning over a vampire card and sliding the number of vampires the number of spaces indicated on the designated rows.<br/><br/>If the player throws a garlic clove, they declare how many hunt cards they would like to use, and then they turn over hunt cards one at a time. The hunt cards either move the garlic clove toward the vampires on the stair within the column or forces both the hunter and clove backward. If the clove reaches a vampire, the vampire is captured, removed from the stair, and replaced from the supply. When all vampires in the supply are exhausted, the Count is brought out.<br/><br/>When the Count is captured, the game is over and the player with the most points in captured vampires wins.<br/><br/>",

If you pick the right branches, they are yours. Remember where each color of jewel is in the circle. Remember which jewels your opponents won, too, and you can steal them.

        "description": "Fate of the Norns: Gulveig is a highly competitive card game themed around the struggle for supremacy involving four clans of nordic gods and mythical giants.<br/><br/>Play is simple and quick, based on bidding for a power total against the other players.<br/><br/>The game is based on a northern European card game called &quot;Tukstantis&quot;. The 4 &quot;clans&quot; have a parallel to classic card &quot;suits&quot; and achieving clan &quot;supremacy&quot; is akin to having a suit being &quot;trump&quot;.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt to each player, and then players bid for the three treasure cards in the center of the table. The highest bidder receives those cards.<br/><br/>A trick is led, and players must follow suit if they are able. If not, they may play a card of another clan, but the combat strength is reduced.<br/><br/>Advanced rules:<br/>- Certain cards can be swapped out for others that add another dimension to play<br/><br/>- Players can be dealt &quot;roles&quot; which grant them access to 2 &quot;powers&quot;: one activated if they lose the high bid, and another if they win the bid. The powers range from forced card exchanges to card value shifts.<br/><br/>In 2016 the base game comes bundled with the &quot;Dwarven Kingdom&quot; expansion (PNH0301).<br/><br/>",

The game was played on a hex map and a CRT was used to resolve combat. The primary distinction between Civil War and the Tournament series wargames is the use of pawns instead of counters. It appears that this was done in an effort to introduce casual gamers to the Tournament style games.<br/><br/>Civil War was dropped from the AH lineup in 1963.<br/><br/>",

The game has several scenarios, representing the initial Mongol explosion out of Central Asia, the later campaigns of consolidation in the era of Kublai Khan, and a grand scenario representing the entire era.<br/><br/>Khan is a two-player game. The Mongol player controls the forces of the Mongols themselves, as well as their various subject peoples. The Kingdoms player controls various independent states and rebels who are opposed to the Mongols. The Mongol player, representing a single, centralized empire, has more direct control over his forces. The Kingdoms player, representing a range of sometimes competing powers, will find the game system causes various subordinate forces to enter and exit from his control at different times. Both player's forces are represented by military units and stratagem markers. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning strategy to expand their power or defend their independence.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents five years. Each hex is approximately 100 miles across. Each military unit represents 10,000 &ndash; 100,000 troops, plus pack animals, camp followers, bureaucrats, etc. Each leader represents a single great person or cadre of generals and officials, plus an elite bodyguard.<br/><br/>",

Players then compare cards in hand to see who holds a majority of each type of animal. If a player holds more giraffe cards than each other player, for example, then that player keeps one giraffe card (worth 9 points as nine such cards are in the game) while all other giraffe cards are discarded. (A player can hold a majority by having one card and no one else having any cards.) After all animal types are compared, whoever has the most points loses no life cards; whoever has the fewest points loses two life cards; and whoever has a total between these extremes loses one life card.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if during a round a player collects all four cats or all five rabbits or pigs in hand, that player can end the round immediately, with all other players losing one life card.<br/><br/>If a player runs out of life cards, they're out of the game. At the end of a round, shuffle the cards and play again. Whoever last clings to life wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Foe Hunters is an exciting co-operative, multiplayer deckbuilding/adventure game set in the realm of high fantasy! Players take the role of heroes that are working together to thwart the evil Foe. On their adventure the heroes will work together in an effort to bolster their party and fend off this powerful enemy. The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.<br/><br/>After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects. Each Hero turn plays out very simply, they can play a card from their hand, buy a card from the city (using their experience), and use one of their heroic Feats. Each Hero has a completely unique starting deck and plays totally different from each other Hero!<br/><br/>Play continues until the Foe is defeated or the party is destroyed, whichever happens first. In Foe Hunters, players don't use cards to buy cards like most deck building games. Each Hero has their own experience pool that they draw upon to purchase cards, and when these cards are purchased they go directly to hand instead of to your discard pile. This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.<br/><br/>The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.<br/><br/>Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!<br/><br/>",

These artifacts were alledgedly hidden by a secret order in various mythical places, and hardly has the first information about this treasure been leaked before archaeologists and adventurers race off to try to discover this artifact before anyone else can.<br/><br/>In Artefakt, each player starts with three experts (game pieces) to send on a treasure hunt, using dice and cards to try to get them to the most rewarding locations in order to find fragments of artifacts. Each round, after rolling the dice and laying out new fragments to discover, players secretly assign one of their four movement cards (numbered 1-4) to each of their three experts. In turn order, players reveal the first card, move that figure clockwise or counterclockwise that number of spaces around the circle of ten tiles, then reveal the second card, and so on.<br/><br/>Once all experts have moved, the tiles are resolved in numerical order. Any player who stands on a tile with no competition takes all the fragments located there; if more than one player is on a tile, the player with the most experts either takes all the fragments on that tile or one face-down fragment from another player on that tile. After a player takes or steals fragments, he can choose to use the special power on that tile: break a tie in your favor on another tile, take a fragment from the pool, move one expert owned by another player one space, and so on.<br/><br/>In the basic game, only four of the tiles are face-up with active powers; in the advanced game, these same four tiles start face-up but at the end of a round the starting player turns one tile of his choice face-up before passing the starting player marker.<br/><br/>As soon as one player collects all four different fragments of one artifact, he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fishermen fish for fresh, fat, and colorful fish &mdash; and if you feel like it, you can join in! In Fat Fish, each player is out to find fat fish of different colors. The fatter the fish, the bigger the haul, and the more colorful the catch is, the more successful the fisherman will be. The player who fishes fabulously and secures the most valuable haul prevails over the other players and wins the game.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game contains one hundred fish cards in five colors, with the cards numbered 1-6. To set up play, shuffle the deck and deal each player a face-down deck of twelve cards, with everyone drawing a hand of four cards from their own decks. Place three cards face up to form the start of lines, then place another 3-15 cards (depending on the number of players) face down to form a reserve. On a turn, a player chooses one line on which to play, then plays 1-4 cards on this line, playing all the cards in a row from left to right. The color of each card played must match the rightmost card in this line. Thus, if the three starting cards are red, yellow, and blue, you can't play both a red and a blue card since you can play in only one line; you can, however, play a blue card onto the line that ends with a blue card, then play a green card onto the blue since no line has a green card at the end of it. At the end of their turn, the player refills their hand to four cards.<br/><br/>As soon as a line has five cards in it, the player who laid down the fifth card must take this line and end their turn. They choose one card of each color in the line and place them face up in their positive points pile, then place all remaining cards face down in their negative points pile. (If the line has five cards of one color, the player places two cards in their positive pile instead of only one.) The player then draws a card from the reserve pile to start a new line.<br/><br/>Once players have played all twelve cards from their personal decks, the game ends and players sum their positive and negative points to see who has the highest score.<br/><br/>As a variant, Fat Fish includes nine fishing license cards that give players bonus points, sometimes for being the first player to meet a certain condition, such as claiming a line that contains cards of only 1, 2, and 3, and sometimes for meeting a condition at the end of the game, such as having collected the most 1 cards in their positive pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Similar to Cosmic Wimpout, but much easier and kid friendly.  This is a very simple point-scoring/risk-taking game in which players roll a set of two dice, where the &quot;1&quot; has been replaced by a picture of a skunk.  Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of &quot;Skunk.&quot;<br/><br/>At least one BGG member has a copy dated 1953, but it's possible the game came out earlier.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns quickly adding more fuse cards to a continuously growing fuse until someone lets the bomb explode by playing one of his bomb cards, thereby earning him all of the fuse cards in play. He takes these cards, leaving only the starting match in play, then the fuse is lit once again.<br/><br/>Each fuse card has a value, and playing the bomb cards too early doesn't bring many points; that said, waiting too long to score lets others play their defuse cards &mdash; which cuts the fuse back to the match and removes those fuse cards from the game &mdash; or jump in with a bomb card of their own (which nets them any defuse cards played since the previous bomb). You might want to hold on to high-valued fuse cards rather than let others snatch them up, but the game ends when all bombs have been played or the time bomb (inserted in the deck at the start of play) goes off. When that happens, everyone tallies their cards, then loses points for all the fuses in hand. Whichever bomb thrower has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Next to the board lies a face-down pile with the remaining tiles. Each player receives a player board, and on this board you will build a city. In your turn, you have to perform actions of the architect which will enable you to take one tile from the main board. In the current turn, you can perform two more actions. You may exchange all of the revealed tiles with those from the pile, place a tile on your board, or change the places of two tiles on your board. Each building added to the city results in its development: number of residents, number of workplaces, ecology, revenue or the satisfaction of residents either increases or decreases. The most important thing is to fill the board with city tiles so that each tile is connected to the center of the board. You cannot forget to fulfill the needs of the residents. The winner is the player who not only builds and develops the city fastest, but avoids unemployment and takes care of the residents' needs.<br/><br/>",

Power up and scan the battlefield for locations to conceal your highly detailed, movie-based ships. Then, brace yourself for battle as electronic voice commands and sound effects signal your search-and-destroy mission to take out your opponent&rsquo;s ships. Play on your own or battle a friend, and choose from three edge-of-your seat missions!<br/><br/>Deluxe Battleship Movie Edition has its gameplay based upon Battleship Advance Mission. There are three game modes: Classic game (One attack per turn), Multi-attack game (go again if you hit an enemy ship), Salvo game (make 1 attack for every ship you have in play). Deluxe mission also has two weapon modes: attack with only one coordinate at a time, or use advanced weapons that let you scan for enemies, shoot down enemy plans, or launch missiles for massive attacks.<br/><br/>Differences from Battleship Movie Edition:<br/><br/>Has a computer, and adds search jets, and has a 10*14 field. The two player boards are joined in the middle. The ships are smaller and less detailed. Does not come with cards.<br/><br/>Identical to the Advanced Mission version, with the exception of alien ships, a lighter board, and and an alien voice instead of a female one.<br/><br/>Green Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission differences from the earlier, blue box edition:<br/><br/>- improved voices and sounds (earlier said to be hard to understand)<br/><br/>- the original game play in a bigger, 10 x 14, grid, Salvo mission, and Target Plus One Mission, or Bonus Mission.<br/><br/>- advanced weapons can now be used in Salvo and Bonus Missions<br/><br/>- the Attack Squadron planes now move and scan on the same turn, and the planes now scan the space immediately underneath them.<br/><br/>- the Aircraft Carrier missiles were eliminated. The Attack Squadron planes are equipped with a one-time use only missile that automatically hits every space where it detects an enemy target. It does that on the first target found only, and then it only scans.<br/><br/>- the Battleship has one Tomahawk missile that hits everything in the 3 x 3 square where it lands.<br/><br/>- the now-called Light Missile Cruiser has two Harpoon Missiles that covers three vertical or horizontal spaces.<br/><br/>- the Fast-Attack Sub has two torpedoes that travel from one side to the other of the grid unless it hits a target first. The Sub also has a scanner that will tell you that an enemy ship is in the vicinity but will not tell you the precise location unlike the Attack Squadron Planes.<br/><br/>- the new design has a raised, inverted-Y design.<br/><br/>- the ships are redesigned.<br/><br/>-  there are different colored lights to indicated launches, scans, hits and misses.<br/><br/>",

Players use transparent shape cards to build simple pictures. Other players guess what the picture might be. Young players learn how pictures are created from shapes and improve their perception skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Overview and Components:<br/><br/>Squint Junior has 42 shape cards, which are transparent, so that they may be flipped and overlapped (unlike the 72 opaque shape cards of the ages 12+ version, Squint). Both versions include 168 word cards, but the Junior version has only one word per side as opposed to three randomly chosen words of varying difficulty. The Squint Junior cards also show a picture of the word made from the card shapes, so the child just finds the right cards and duplicates the image. For a Light version, the sand timer is not used, and for an Expert version, the player ignores the picture on the card and comes up with their own interpretation.<br/><br/>Reimplements: Squint<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Feed the Shoggoth is a fast and furious card game, in which players each control a different cult faction, facing a very angry and hungry Shoggoth in the middle of the table. To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!<br/><br/>During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).<br/><br/>If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.<br/><br/>The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards. However, this isn't yet another game with the name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; tacked on at the end (and in fact, Cthulhu himself never directly makes an appearance in the game). The theme has been interwoven into the game play itself.<br/><br/>",

YOU take the role of a sniper and his spotter in search of your target and completing your mission.<br/><br/>The most deadly thing on a battlefield is one well-aimed shot.  &mdash; Sgt. Carlos Hatchcock<br/><br/>You and your spotter enter play on one of four terrain maps: jungle, desert, countryside, or ruined city. Though you are at distance from your mission target, you will need to score morale points to be able to move into new zones, getting closer to your target. As you do, enemy hostiles may be seen, forcing you to avoid detection or they may need to be engaged to complete your mission. Movement into new zones closer to the target, is achieved by KIA enemy hostiles which gives you morale points that are expended in order to move but beware of the trip wires and claymore mines. Doing this all the while trying not to draw too much attention to yourself. The enemy may call in reserves looking for you. Many items may help you such as scopes and med kits and other useful equipment.<br/><br/>A hand of cards gives the player options to fire, move, crawl, and hide. Location cards are used in each zone and the player will gain cover from these cards but also may find a surprise event. The player will need to earn morale points to be able to move into the next zone, these are earned by killing enemy hostiles. A player only has a certain number of wounds that can be taken during a mission and critical wounds will see the player in real trouble. Taking a shot is a tense moment the wind and other factors could affect the shot, if missed enemy hostiles will move closer towards the sniper and may even attempt to conduct an assault against them.<br/><br/>Not only may single missions be played. A campaign is also possible consisting of ten missions. As each mission is completed, you will accumulate kill points which may be used to upgrade your weapons or obtain additional equipment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Well, okay, not literally throwing the cards, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player receives a hand of seven cards from the 110-card deck; card types are water, sand, umbrella and special. On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.<br/><br/>After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round. Players then tally the sand and water points in front of them, and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Every single thing that comes out of that cesspool has SOMETHING wrong with it. How do you make a profit out of this thing?<br/><br/>Discount Salmon is NOT a trick taking game (but claims to be) in which players simultaneously try to resolve fish quality issues or make it more difficult for other players to do the same by making bad fish even worse. Fish problems include Stinky, Dry, Poisonous, Ugly and Not a Fish. The conditions are resolved by Perfume, Lotion, Antidote, Make-Up and a Fish Costume respectively. If a fish does not already have a condition it can be added by playing Rotten Eggs, Blistering Hot Sun, Nuclear Waste, Mustache or Fish Decoy. As it's a speed game, all players are applying modifiers to the fish simultaneously. The player that resolves the last of it's remaining conditions wins the fish. The winning player is the one who has accumulated the most fish when all the fish cards have been resolved.<br/><br/>",

At the start of a round, someone chooses a category from a randomly drawn card, then rolls the order die, which indicates first, second or last. Someone then rolls the letter dice, and players compete to yell out words in the chosen category that have one of the letters rolled in the first, second or last position in the word. As soon as you yell out a word, grab the die! Once time runs out or all the dice have been claimed, you score points equal to the value of the letters you grabbed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you can come up with three words in the category that use a particular letter die &ndash; whether already claimed or still on the table &ndash; in the first, second and last positions (e.g., using &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Touchdown&quot;, &quot;sTance&quot; and &quot;punT&quot; in a football category), then you can shout &quot;Show Me The Kwan!&quot;, which ends the round immediately. In addition to any other points, you score three times the value of the letter used, plus 5 points. (If you used an opponent's die to create the kwan, that opponent doesn't score for the die.) Whoever scores fifty points first wins.<br/><br/>",

It has mighty warriors, mysterious artifacts and deadly missiles. They are represented by disks of varying sizes and colors that have to be sent flying towards their targets with a well-aimed flick of a finger. Choose a side of the table and lead your order&rsquo;s army into a campaign of world conquest.<br/><br/>Desktopia games can vary substantially. The battlefield landscape is formed by the random conglomeration of objects that can usually be found on your desk or table. These may include books, cups, your laptop, a mouse or a remote control. The game pack includes a set of riveting scenarios. You can take part in a massive melee, rob caravans, perform speed missions under a hail of arrows and even solve riddles!<br/><br/>Each player will have his own small army represented by discs of different sizes and corresponding reference cards. Legendary heroes, tough veterans and faithful fighters each of them with unique abilities described on reference card will be at your disposal. Likewise there will be small missile disks, which can be used by some of your characters, and mighty artifacts, which you can take under control during the course of a battle.<br/><br/>In your turn you can activate three of your characters: flick the disk to attack or use a missile instead or cast a spell. There are a lot of interesting choices you will have each time - whom and how to activate, trying to make a risky long short or just safely moving your warrior into an advantageous position for the next move. In this game your tactical choices are much more important than anything else. You also have to try to make the best use of the synergy of the different warrior types in your army!<br/><br/>We actively encourage players to use everyday objects from their tables. Imagine a turned glass as a sphere of ice which could freeze some disks of your enemy, a book as an impregnable cliff, from which your archers could safely attack, or a vase as a control tower with 10 hit points.<br/><br/>",

But no sooner has your ship landed than others show up to capture the most valuable things for themselves. What's more, the island is stricken by evil curses...and then there is also the kraken &mdash; which is both a blessing and a curse at the same time.<br/><br/>In 7Seas, you want to use cards in hand to capture those on the table, but if you can't grab something, then you'll end up leaving goods for others to grab.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 40 cards in four suits (gold, rum, crystals, and curses); each card shows a strength value (1-10) and a booty value (from 7 to -7). Each player has a ship that starts at the beginning of the track, and a game lasts until a player reaches 7, 11, or 14 on the track, depending on the length of the game desired. To set up a round, deal 4 cards face up as a display, deal each player 8 or 11 cards depending on the player count, then place 3 or 4 cards aside as a special booty pile.<br/><br/>On a turn, play one card from your hand. If a card in the display has the same strength as this card, you collect both cards. If instead two or more cards sum to the value of your played card, you collect those smaller cards and your played card. If you play a non-cursed 1, you can collect a 10 in the display (along with your 1), assuming no 1s are present. If you play the kraken (the cursed 1), then you can take all of the cards in the display along with the kraken &mdash; but the kraken is -7 points, so it better be worth it! If you can't collect a card, then you add your card to the display. If you ever clear all the cards in the display, then you steal one card, either from an opponent's collection or from the booty pile, looking those cards over and choosing your prize.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played &mdash; and cards are played in two cycles of eight cards in a two-player game &mdash; players score points depending on what they've collected:<br/><br/><br/>    The player with the most cards moves their ship one space.<br/>    The player with the most gold coins moves one space.<br/>    The player with the pirate lady or pirate king (respectively the 1 crystal and 1 rum) moves one space.<br/>    The player with the highest booty total &mdash; that is, the sum of the highest card in each suit &mdash; moves two spaces.<br/><br/><br/>Continue playing rounds until someone moves their ship to the finish line.<br/><br/>",

A spinner with pictures of the different player's characters is spun and characters are moved up the floors of a several story hotel. If other players are occupying floors above the player that the spinner pointed to, then that player skips ahead to the next open floor. The first player to reach the top luxury penthouse floor of the hotel is the winner.<br/><br/>A slightly more involved version of Hotel is also being developed, with the help of Becca's daddy, which offers options including: changing the spinner to a rondel; multiple paths/lanes of hotel rooms, allowing players to choose to move their character and other characters up, down or sideways; and a simple monetary system for &quot;upgrading&quot; your rooms to a higher level.<br/><br/>The basic game is playable by Ages 4 and up and the more advanced game intended for Ages 7 and up (with younger kids able to play with a little help from their parents or older siblings).<br/><br/>",

Two to four expedition teams are ready to try to secure the most promising sites in the digging field. Each square on the game board contains valuable finds. Each team would of course like to occupy the best sites, and then dig away in peace and quiet. Players use their archaeologists and assistants, while the workers ensure that the digs are supported. The game is different each time, since the board consists of 7 large and 7 small board segments that are combined differently each time, leading to different dig configurations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For some reason, several portraits from famous painters have poured out into the market. Most of them have to be fakes, but even the experts are having difficulty distinguishing them from the real thing. The price, of course, will vary greatly depending on whether it is assessed to be genuine or not. In Fake Art Inc., you are expert brokers who must collect fake masterpieces and distribute them in the market. After all, you need to make a profit. Increase the emotional value of all the art in your collection, and disrupt the market by dropping the appraisal value of other player's art. With the right timing, even an artwork of no value can be sold at a high price to another broker. See how easy it is to make money by selling art?<br/><br/>In more detail, players first decide the turn order by bidding. On their turn, players can either trade their hand with others or place it on a space between players to set up an auction. Cards are placed face down, and equivalent cards are placed down together. You can make money by selling your hand cards, and the price is determined by the number and location of &quot;genuine&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; cards that have been placed down. Players can change the selling price by replacing existing cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If your pack gets too tired, you may have to go home empty-handed. Can you outwit the other coyotes and survive the heat?<br/><br/>In this fast-paced bluffing game, each player is leading a pack of coyotes and attempting to deceive their opponents in order to enter their territory and acquire precious food for their pack. The players hold their coyotes in their hand, and either invade, defend, and/or rest coyotes each turn. As the coyotes fight, they become tired, and are eventually too exhausted to continue. One of the challenges of the game is trying to score as many points as possible, while at the same time managing the overall strength of your pack. You must skilfully deplete your deck to capture or defend coveted food and leverage your opponents&rsquo; current situation to your advantage.

Each player gets dealt four dominoes and makes two pairs. A player wins (loses) if each matching pair is better (worse) than the dealers. If they split, it's a draw. The only decision made in the game is how to split the original four tiles.<br/><br/>Because of the rules, the game is often a draw. The ranking of hands is traditional and not obvious. For example, the best pair is (4/2)(2/1).<br/><br/>",

As you move down the trail, you'll draw cards, which might be good or bad for you, bad for opponents, or terrible for everyone at the table. You'll also acquire useful items and specialties &mdash; with each character having a different set of things to find &mdash; have adventures, and come into conflict with other players. Conflict in Cross Hares takes the form of either shoving each other back and forth around the map or stealing items.<br/><br/>Don't worry if you're far back on the path away from everyone else as with the right events or die rolls, you can race ahead of the others! Once you get to the factory, though, you'll need all of your skills and items to defeat it, so be sure you save some of your strength for that.<br/><br/>",

Work hard. Learn to control the elements. Study each recipe and combination, no matter how impossible they may seem. Face your worst fears. And trust fortune as well because it's wise to admit that not everything is in your hands. That's the only true way to become an alchemist.<br/><br/>In each turn of Los Aprendices, players throw all their dice at the same time to get resources. With these resources, they place their tokens in one or more of the six boards on the table, and on these boards they can get abilities or knowledge (depending on the area the player wants to develop). The game is all about gaining resources, using the abilities to transform them into other resources (or multiply them), and rising in the different boards to gain as much knowledge as possible. When a player has more than 42 victory points, that triggers the last round, then whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Your knowledge and intelligence will be the key to your becoming the next alchemist!<br/><br/><br/>Ahora sois aprendices y os queda un largo camino por delante. Un camino de conocimiento que estar&aacute; lleno de trampas, de amenazas que no imagin&aacute;is todav&iacute;a y que os pondr&aacute; a prueba. Esforzaos. Aprended a dominar los elementos. Memorizad cada f&oacute;rmula, cada combinaci&oacute;n posible o imposible. Plantad cara a vuestros miedos. Confiad, tambi&eacute;n, en la suerte porque es prudente reconocer que no todo est&aacute; en nuestras manos. S&oacute;lo as&iacute; os convertir&eacute;is en alquimistas.<br/><br/>El primer jugador que llegue o supere los 42 puntos de conocimiento cierra la &uacute;ltima ronda. El que tenga m&aacute;s puntos en la &uacute;ltima ronda gana.<br/>Al principio de cada turno, los jugadores tirar&aacute;n sus dados para obtener recursos seg&uacute;n sus resultados. Con estos recursos se colocar&aacute;n en los tableros que m&aacute;s les interesen. En cada una se obtendr&aacute;n m&aacute;s conocimiento o m&aacute;s habilidades (seg&uacute;n el campo que cada jugador quiera desarrollar).<br/>El mecanismo del juego consiste en obtener recursos, usar las habilidades para transformarlos en nuevos elementos (o bien multiplicarlos) e ir ascendiendo en los distintas tableros para obtener tanto conocimiento como puedan.<br/><br/>Los Aprendices es un juego en el que tendr&eacute;is que usar vuestros conocimientos e inteligencia para convertiros en alquimistas.<br/><br/>",

Where needed the Luftwaffe will support you, tackling any possible opposition by the RAF or Royal Navy. And hopefully you will not hit any mines...<br/><br/>As the British player you hope to raise the alarm as soon as possible. Depending on the level of alert you can deploy the RAF and Royal Navy and sink the Kriegsmarine's hope of dashing through unscathed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Rival Kings, two royal families compete for the country and its people. High-ranking personalities prevent the members of the opposing family from using their subjects for their own purposes and from erecting valuable buildings &mdash; but everything comes at a price. Who will lead his family to fame and honor?<br/><br/>Text from publisher:<br/><br/>The position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.<br/><br/>Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.<br/><br/>After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted. The player who has collected the best combinations and has as few Conflict markers as possible lying in front of him has the best chance of assuming the throne.<br/><br/>",

The main objective of the game is to defeat the Tyrants, close those Rifts  and to kill as many creatures as possible without destroying the planet in the process! Only once the Tyrants have been defeated, the Players of War Titans: Invaders Must Die, will have the chance to uncover the Final Episode card, complete a last epic mission and thus finally free the children of men!<br/><br/>",

The game play has two phases: inhabiting and conquering. In the first phase each player deploys its pieces (knights) one at a time. In the second, players take turns to conduct an attack. No dice are involved. The only random element of the game is the decision at the beginning of each phase which player goes first. The player with the highest number of territories at the end of the game, is the winner.<br/><br/>It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules. However, this is deceptive, for the game requires good grasp of strategy in both phases.<br/><br/>For complete rules and additional information see Revaler&rsquo;s website on Farlander <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.revaler.ee/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.revaler.ee/</a><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the publisher's website :)<br/><br/>Soft Underbelly: Italy, 1943 (SU) [...] is an intermediate-complexity, two-player wargame simulating that historic World War II campaign. It may also be used to explore the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; inherent in the situation had the German high command chosen to react to the Allied landings in a much different manner: making that effort&rsquo;s defeat Berlin&rsquo;s main strategic goal for late 1943 (Operation Wacht am Tiber). The design therefore combines factual historical detail with studied counter-factual analysis to present players with a situation that will be familiar to most of them, while at the same time allowing for an easy and seamless transition into the less certain realm of alternative history.<br/><br/>Each extra-large-hex on the 34x22&rdquo; mapsheet equals 11 miles (18 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents between two and 15 days, depending on the exact time of year of each one. That is, as the autumn weather worsens, and attrition and the inevitable declines in soldier morale and force-robustness take their tolls, each game turn comes to represent a longer period of time. That approach allows for the smooth building into the system of what would otherwise be burdensome factors of weather, ground conditions, operational tempo, etc. Every ground unit represents a division or division-equivalent (176 large-size NATO-style).<br/><br/>The game uses the well-liked system originally created by Ben Knight for Victory in Normandy. There are approximately 14,500 words in the rules. A complete game of SU generally takes from four to five hours to complete, and it&rsquo;s suitable for solitaire play. Rules cover such things as: Allied end-run second invasions, Luftwaffe seaport raids, reinforcements, withdrawals, paratroop drops, naval gun support, both sides&rsquo; army and corps organizational schemes, German tactical superiority, tactical and strategic airpower and much more. The turn sequence is as follows:<br/><br/><br/>I. Allied Player Turn<br/><br/>A. Allied Reinforcement Phase<br/><br/>B. Allied Command Point Expenditure Phase<br/><br/>II.

Two different levels of play are available, one involving simply scoring (per hole or per course) and the other involving play money (included).<br/><br/>On your turn you play a card from your hand which shows you a number of yards and a direction (hook, slice, or straight).  You can take a chance and play a hook or slice for greater distance, but if you end up in a woods, water, or sand space must draw the respective card to get out of the hazard.  Some of the hazard cards are worse than others ...<br/><br/>There's a bit of math involved, as you look for cards that have totals that will put you right on the green - you don't want to overshoot it.  Once on the green, there are two methods provided to resolve putting: an actual indoor putting cup (!) or putting dice.  The dice show the ball in the cup or outside of it, requiring a re-roll.  The red die is for long putts, and the green for short putts.<br/><br/>An eighteen-hole course is provided, nine on each side of the colorful board.  The pieces are cute little golf balls mounted on tees.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Background:<br/><br/>This game is a forerunner of many &quot;dice&quot; games and the game younger children play today which is known as Jacks. The game was &quot;old&quot; by the time it was played in Ancient Rome, since it had been played in Greece and other parts of the ancient world before it found its way to Rome. The game has many counterparts throughout the Middle East and Asia. Some historians indicate that the game may have had its origins in some religious rite, while others believe the game was always just a gambling game.<br/><br/>Knucklebones are the dried ankle bones of sheep. They have 4 different sides - one flat, one concave, one convex, and one sinuous side. Values were assigned to each side. In ancient times, adults as well as children played Knucklebones. The Greeks and the Romans modified the equipment and play of this gambling game, eventually passing on to us six sided cubed dice rather than the four sided Astragali.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>The game is played with two or more bones. One player tosses the bones in the air and either catches them on the back of the hand, or lets them fall to the ground. As in dice games, assigned values determine the outcome of each toss.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by Oss<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Transformation of metals into gold? <br/>It&rsquo;s possible &ndash; any physicist will say nowadays. In the 16th century, alchemists made attempts to do that in their laboratories, aspiring to gain wealth and never-ending fame. Some, as Edward Kelley, thanks to royal sponsors, achieved all that, nevertheless they never succeeded in transmutation of metals&hellip; In this magical game that you are holding it&rsquo;s very simple. <br/>Build a laboratory and collect the necessary components. And transformation of metals? If you manage to adjust to the changing moods of the Spirit of Transmutation, then it&rsquo;s really not complicated at all. So, what is the game about? You have competition in your town &ndash; other alchemists who also know the right technology. Only the one of you who is the most efficient will win recognition and fame. It will surely last until the next game, or, who knows, perhaps eternally&hellip;<br/><br/>Players will try to be the most effective alchemist.<br/>To achieve that they will need to build buildings, represented by cards. In these buildings, they will acquire resources, transform them into gold and finally sell them for victory points or cards. Selling gold isn't only way to win the game.<br/><br/>Game is using Rondel mechanic to pick an action by players and hand management, where cards represent buildings, currency and resources.<br/><br/>Alchemicus was designed as a family game with little negative interaction. Requests planning but also concentrating on other players movements and predicting them. Many beginners forget it, being focused on their own technology structure, so very often they fall behind. We think that this game style can be useful for teaching young players to think beyond their own needs. Anyway, the game is not for kids. The youngest of our testers who was able to win the play against his father was 12 years old (consider that his father is lawyer, so probably he is quite smart ;))) hahaha one of them. Father or son. we are not sure which one :D).<br/>Because the factor of negative interaction is not very strong the play goes ahead in a nice atmosphere which is fun for family play.<br/>Older players can play a bit differently, by using the position of The Transmutation Ghost to foil your opponents' plans. This strategy can be counteracted by defending yourself with buildings and goods in circulation which are resistant to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>",

Avoid the hungry hydra to win a place among the stars!<br/><br/>In Greece Lightning, you race around a circular track, trying to be the first to complete two laps. On a turn, you roll two dice to move your boat: a navigation die (1-3) and a movement die (1-6). You can roll a second movement die to try to go farther, but if the roll is lower than your first movement die, you bust and keep only your navigation die.<br/><br/>The circular track is comprised of twelve wedges, with the wedges being randomized each game. In general, the track consists of four paths orbiting the central hydra, but these paths criss-cross a lot, with movement dots and bonus icons at various spots on the movement paths. When you move, you must move clockwise a number of spaces equal to the sum of your dice, but you often have freedom to weave from one path to another. Here are the icons you might encounter:<br/><br/><br/>    Fish: Collect one fish. You can have up to three fish on hand, and you can spend a fish to re-roll your navigation die or second movement die. You might also need fish to navigate whirlpools.<br/>    Favor of the Gods: Draw a favor card, and place it face down before you. At the end of your turn, reveal the card and use it immediately, save it for later, or give it away, depending on what card it is.<br/>    Track wedges: Collect one wedge and place it face up before you. At the start of your next turn, after determining your total movement, place the wedge on the game board (but not on the starting tile or a player's ship). Use these to make your path easier or to place a hydra directly in your opponents' way.<br/>    Whirlpool: When you land on a whirlpool, you often have multiple exit paths from it &mdash; but you might need to pay fish or have a die with a certain number in order to take a particular path.<br/>    Hydra: Spend a fish when you land on a hydra space or else your movement will vanish for the rest of the turn as you must fight it off.<br/><br/><br/>When you land on or cross the starting line, thereby finishing one lap, you receive a fish, a wedge, and a Favor of the Gods card. When someone has completed their second lap, you finish the round to ensure everyone has the same number of turns, then whoever has gone the farthest wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A game of the Starcup Challenge Racing Series&quot;<br/><br/>Demon's Run is a simulation of the most demanding and deadly race in the Starcup Challenge Racing Series.  A course constructed in a savage area of turbulent space studded with rotating black holes, fluctuating intense radiation zones, space-time disruption fields and randomly moving hunter-killer mines that will test your piloting skill and courage to the fullest.  Set within this field are a series of Buoys that must be recovered to score victory points.  Some of the Buoys are in fixed positions, others move randomly.  The most valuable of all are the Astaroth, Belial and Lucifer Buoys which are locked in tight orbit in the intense radiation zones surrounding the monstrous Hell2 and Hell3 black holes.  Players must design their ships' maximum function levels in each category of ship operation and must pilot the ship through the treacherous course in the quest of Buoys.  Players must always be aware of the course obstacles, the positions of the other racers, and the remaining fuel supply of their ship.  Demon's Run is a game that is played in a delicate balance between success and disaster.  It is not some simple couple hundred laps around an oval track.  Demon's Run is a wide eyed, full power leap into the mouth of Hell!<br/><br/>You design your ship before each race by distributing points between Fuel, Structural Integrity, Pilot Integration, Main Engines, Manoeuvre Engines, Tractor (used to recover buoys), Laser (used to attack buoys, mines and other players' ships), Scrambler (used to disorient an opposing player), Screens and Velocity.  Campaign rules are provided so pilots and ships can improve between races.  It is relatively easy to make the game playable by more than four --you need only make up more ship set up sheets and a few counters.<br/><br/>",

Each tile depicts one-quarter of a symbol on each corner. When you place a tile, the corners of your tile must match the corners of the adjacent tiles. If your tile provides the fourth corner of a shape, thereby completing it, you earn a point token of that color. At the end of your turn you draw a new tile, and the game ends once all the tiles have been placed or no one can add a tile to the field.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players tally their points. Here's the fun scoring twist - each point token is worth as much as the number of tokens of that color not claimed. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are only 10 tokens available for each color, so if all of them are claimed, each one is worth zero points! Thus, you need to be watchful of what tokens you claim. Sometimes, less is more.<br/><br/>",

The first encounters between them did not go peacefully. During centuries, war and conflicts expanded affecting almost every corner in the galaxy.<br/><br/>During the longest part of the galactic history, different species used to settle on the systems they arrived to. Instead of just exploring the galaxy, they were sending their overpopulation to colonize new homes. That caused many wars, because it&rsquo;s not easy to share your home planet with a foreign species who has nothing in common with you. But everything changed when The Plague arrived.<br/><br/>The Plague was an illness that affected all intelligent species all across the galaxy, decimating their population to the brink of extinction and ending wars.<br/><br/>Survivors of each species regrouped as well as they could and, following severe isolation protocols, finally the Plague was almost eradicated although their customs changed forever.<br/><br/>Since that day on, all species are nomads, because the void of space is the most aseptic environment, and they no longer settle on the systems they visit. The biggest part of the population stays on the surface of a planet the necessary time to get their  esources and nothing more.<br/><br/>Space Opera  is a card game for ages above 14. 2 to 4 players.

If you manage the latter you take back your coaster(s) to play them again and any opponent's coaster goes under your fist as points to be scored in the end.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player doesn't have any more coasters to play. All coasters inside the box are worth twice their printed value to their owner and any opponent's coaster under your fist is worth their printed value in points.<br/><br/>For the second round, do the same, except the lid goes on top of the box and you try to flick your coaster on top of the lid.<br/><br/>For the same round, place the trampoline coaster in the middle instead of the box.

        "description": "The Battle of Champion Hill game uses the Blue &amp; Gray system.  It was included in the Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Issue #103.<br/><br/>The May 16, 1863 Battle of Champion Hill was the largest, bloodiest, and most significant action of Grant&rsquo;s Vicksburg Campaign. 32,000 advancing Union soldiers met 23,000 Confederates in a fierce struggle for a vital crossroads roughly halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. The field was dominated by bald Champion Hill, from which Confederate artillery opened fire on the Union army at 9:45 A.M. The first Federal assault on the hill drove the Southerners back with bayonets and clubbed muskets. As the Union soldiers tried to reform and consolidate their gains, they were swept away by a counterattack led by John Bowen&rsquo;s Missourians and Arkansans. Ulysses S. Grant ordered more men towards the hill and Bowen&rsquo;s Confederates were themselves driven off, compelling a general retreat. Southern Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman was killed while directing a desperate rearguard action that enabled most of the Confederate army to escape towards Vicksburg. The decisive Union victory at Champion Hill was instrumental in forcing the Confederates out of the open field and into a doomed position inside the walls of Vicksburg.<br/><br/>Brief summary of rules:<br/>Stacking:<br/>&bull; Up to 2 units may stack, unless optional stacking rule is used, which allows 5 units in one hex, as long as only one is of brigade level or higher.<br/>&bull; Units in a stack must attack the same target.  If desired, one unit of the stack may be withheld from attacks.<br/><br/>Zone Of Combat/Enemy Zone Of Combat:<br/>&bull; ZOC extends into all 6 adjacent hexes.  ZOCs do not extend across river/creek hexsides, except at a ford or bridge.  ZOC does extend across streams.<br/>&bull; Units entering EZOC must stop moving.<br/>&bull; No unit may voluntarily leave an EZOC except by combat results<br/><br/>Combat Restrictions:<br/>&bull; Units may only attack or be attacked once per phase.<br/>&bull; Units may not split up their strength points to attack into separate adjacent hexes.<br/>&bull; Units may attack all adjacent units of a group if desired.<br/>&bull; Before rolling  the die, the attacker may choose to reduce the combat odds (e.g., use the 2:1 table when attacking at 3:1).<br/>&bull; Cavalry units attacked only by infantry may retreat 2 hexes before combat is resolved (opt.).  The attacking units may enter the cavalry unit&rsquo;s vacated hex, but they may not select an alternate target.<br/><br/>Attacker Effectiveness (&ldquo;Ar&rdquo; results):<br/>&bull; Attackers forced to retreat are flipped to their ineffective side.  Attackers remain ineffective until a night turn.  (Retreating defenders remain effective.)<br/>&bull; Ineffective units may not attack, i.e., they may not enter EZOC.  Ineffective units that begin their side&rsquo;s combat phase in an EZOC must retreat.<br/><br/>Retreats/Advances:<br/>&bull; Units may not retreat off the map or through EZOC.<br/>&bull; One unit of a stack may retreat one hex to make room for another unit retreating into its hex (displacement)<br/>&bull; Any unit that cannot retreat is eliminated.<br/>&bull; A unit that participates in an attack/defense resulting in a hex being cleared of enemy units (i.e., the enemy retreated or was eliminated) may advance into that hex.<br/>&bull; Artillery may not advance after combat.<br/><br/>Artillery Range Fire:<br/>&bull; Artillery may attack units within 3 hexes.  It may only do so if there is no adjacent enemy target.<br/>&bull; Artillery ranged attacks must be made at odds &ge; 1:3.<br/>&bull; Artillery units may never suffer adverse combat results when engaging in ranged fire.<br/><br/>Night:<br/>&bull; No combat phase.<br/>&bull; Units adjacent to enemies may not move.<br/>&bull; Units may move, but may not enter EZOC.<br/><br/>",

If it's another player's item, that player becomes the Auctioneer. Bidders (non-Auctioneers) all roll 2d6 secretly, and are allowed one reroll. Then reveal your dice: from high to low, players get the option to buy the item for the sum of their dice, paying the Auctioneer. If the token belonged to a player, that player also gets a bonus $3-7 (depending on how far in the game you are). If no one buys it, the current player gets it for free (if it's another player's item, they keep it)! The game ends as soon as someone gets $45 = winner!<br/><br/>",

Time is precious and it is vital to plan your actions wisely!<br/><br/>Dwar7s Duel is a fast-paced, worker placement and resource management game for two players. It plays in 30 minutes, making it perfect for a quick match on the road or on game night! Dwar7s Duel is a 2 player version of Dwar7s Fall and compatible with Dwar7s Fall expansions.<br/><br/>In this game, players take turns performing up to 3 actions, then resolving cards in the tableau, and finally discarding down to 9 cards. An action can be playing a kingdom card from their hand to a shared tableau, moving a dwarf, or upgrading a worker.<br/><br/>Resolving cards is is done by removing dwarves from the card (if the dwarves on the card are all the same color), and collecting the rewards. Using these rewards allows the player to complete private and public goals.<br/><br/>Be careful, because discarding down to the hand limit of 9 cards can include having to discard recently acquired gems and ogres, as players cannot discard kingdom cards.<br/><br/>These player turns will continue until one player has completed at least three goals. At this time, the other player will get one last turn, if they haven't already had a turn this round.<br/><br/>Finally, victory points are tallied from completed goals, defeated monsters, gems in hand, and kingdoms.<br/><br/>",

Basically, you each have a base with 5 or 6 targets (some require multiple hits or hitting things in order). You also have about 10 men. You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.<br/><br/>You each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like. You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets. You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.<br/><br/>You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles. You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier. However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.<br/><br/>In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.

Cultists around the globe are mobilizing, preparing the Seals to open the Gates, hearkening the Elder Gods return. Their goal, to usher in the Age of Madness! Will you heed the Master&rsquo;s Call?<br/><br/>Cthulhu: Age of Madness (C:AoM) is a competitive strategy card game for 2-4 players, each assuming the role of Cultists of an Elder God. Azathoth, Cthulhu , Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth are commanding their minions to unlock the four Seals, open the Cosmic Gate, and create the path for your Elder God to cross the Void and reign Madness upon humanity. Will you be the first to usher in the Age of Madness?<br/><br/>Each player chooses an Elder God Card, and places it in front of them. A Player is chosen to be the dealer, shuffles, and deals 5 cards to each Player. The Player to the Dealers left plays first, and play continues clockwise.  On your turn, you perform 2 Actions, and then draw. Actions include playing a card, Sacrificing a Cultist, or Exchanging Cards. A &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; is also a valid Action.<br/><br/>Play a Cultist - Play any Cultist to your Pool. Matched Cultists are grouped together.<br/>Play an Elder Sign - Elder Sign unlocks a Seal; Place it on your Elder God, activating its Cosmic Primal Power.<br/>Play a Power Card - Powers are played to the Discard, with the Target chosen by the Player.<br/>Play an Advantage Card - Advantages are played directly to your Pool.<br/>Play an Eldritch Power Card - Eldritch Powers are played to the discard pile, with the Target chosen by the Player.<br/>Sacrifice a Cultist - Send a Cultist from your Pool to the Discard, gaining an instant Convert Cultist Power.<br/>Exchange Cards - A Player can choose to discard their entire hand, or a portion thereof, and redraw to their current Maximum Hand Size (usually 5). This counts as both Actions.<br/><br/>After all Actions have been completed, draw until you have five cards in your hand, and play continues to the left.<br/>Grouping 4 Cultists of your Elder God, in your Pool, unlocks a Seal. Move these cards to your Elder God Card, activating its Cosmic Primal Power.  When all 4 Seals have been unlocked, your Elder God&rsquo;s Gate opens, and you win the game.

        "description": "Evade is an old (1971) 3M game, part of their  series of 'Gamettes', games which were released in very small, fold-over bookcase type boxes.  There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.<br/><br/>Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.<br/><br/>Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>",

Based on the CW Americanime, Huntik: Secrets and Seekers has characters from the show, like Lok and Dante, powerful Seekers who can summon a variety of creatures to do battle with the Organisation's army of &quot;Suits&quot;.<br/><br/>This game uses a unique &quot;Mission Card&quot; format that either pits the players against each other, forces them to work together, or can even accommodate solo play.<br/><br/>The main set &quot;Secrets and Seekers&quot; [183 cards] was followed by two expansions; &quot;Legendary Saga&quot; [95 cards] and &quot;Omens and Legacies&quot; [100 cards], each in 9-card boosters, sold in boxes of 24.<br/><br/>",

The players are trying to save different species of whales from extinction.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Very few games are based on cooperation.  However, in this game, all players work together, trying to save eight Whales.  Your goal is to beat THE SYSTEM - the worldwide forces which are causing our great Whales to become endangered species and extinct.<br/><br/>&quot;The only way you can really 'win' this game is to save all eight Whales.  However, this is a game of fun, so enjoy yourself while trying to do the very best you can.  As you play, you'll discover various strategies you cause to SAVE THE WHALES.  Naturally, the more you play, the better you'll become.&quot;  (End quote.)<br/><br/>The game comes with a board, pewter miniatures of eight different whales and a ship, 42 cards comprising two different &quot;chance&quot; decks, and two six-sided dice with the '1' replaced by a picture of a whaling ship.  There are also various chits and a rulebook, which also contains a lot of information about whales, and how to find out more.<br/><br/>",

You can learn to play the game within minutes and be engrossed for hours.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, players must set a game grid by randomly picking4 cards from the deck and form them into a square with the different colors and shapes facing upward.<br/><br/>Inspired by International Chess, each player is given a total of 3 mins for the entire game. Players get 3 cards at the start and take turns to form a roll of at least3 matching shapes or colors by stacking 1 card from their hand onto the game grid. Players who do not have any stackable card will have to end their turn by drawing a card.<br/><br/>The player starts their countdown at the start of their turn and pause the timer at the end of their turn, the countdown resumes when it's come around to the same player. The game ends for the player when their clock runs out, while others continue to finish the game with their remaining time. When the time runs out for everyone, the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Points are awarded for each roll of 3 matching shapes or colors at the end of the player&rsquo;s turn. Points are also awarded when the player finishes all the cards in their hand. The player will also need to draw 3 more cards to continue playing.<br/><br/>Players get extra points by forming both vertical and horizontal combo in a single turn. Combos can be combined to get even more points!<br/><br/>There are a variety of starting game grids to choose from and many other ways to play Threepia.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It would be a shame to encourage them, unless of course you're making a profit off of it.<br/><br/>In Secret Tijuana Deathmatch, it is your job as wrestling promoter to go to the United States, hire five of the best (or most desperate) businessmen and then pit them against your opponents' wrestlers in fights to the death.<br/><br/>Is your goal glory?  Of course not!  Your goal is money!  You earn money either by defeating another player's wrestler (in which case they pay you the purse) or by picking the winner of another two players' match (in which case you share a side bet with the others who guessed correctly).  The winner is the one who earns the most money before someone's stable runs out.<br/><br/>Interesting bit of trivia: this game is limited to 5000 copies, as the modifier tiles for the matches are from an overprinting of Atlas Games' Spammers.<br/><br/>",

It seemed that he has everything anyone could ever want: son of a wealthy prince and highlander, descending from the famous winemakers, heir to the fortune, chief to the conscript army of the east flank, university scholar, educated, handsome and desired by ladies of all ages... And somehow there was always some kind of melancholy and sorrow written on his face. Once during shared meal, the noble confessed what grieves him: he never tasted what real adventure is. He heard tales of heroes and journeys &ndash; he wanted it himself but did not know how to begin. So I helped him by taking him to the Adventure's Gate, notorious inn where you can find adventurers ready to brave the world.<br/><br/>And this is how it begins...<br/><br/>Tavern Tales is a card-game in which players build their decks on their own. Their deck consists of adventurers who crave fame and, well, adventure. Each of 15 characters in the game possesses their own unique ability, so the choice of characters that the players recruit has direct impact on their win chance. You need to choose your party members so their abilities complement each other. Although rules are easy, winning the game is not. Players have to demonstrate their strategic thinking, long-term planning, and ability to react to the other players' moves.<br/><br/>The game is divided into nine rounds. In each round, each player performs their turn. During this turn, player must perform two out of three available actions<br/><br/><br/>    Play a card face-up and use its ability.<br/>    Play a card face-down and recruit a character or take on a quest.<br/>    Play a set of cards from the same character.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks to synergy between cards, players try to recruit as many characters as possible and complete as many quests as possible. At the end of the game, players earn prestige points for characters met during the game and for completed quests.<br/><br/>",

Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent two groups or air regiments (six to eight squadrons). Ship units mostly represent one fleet aircraft carrier, 'divisions' of two light or escort carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, squadrons of six to eight destroyers (plus Japanese light cruiser destroyer leaders), and various numbers of other ship types. On the area map, each inch equals 90 miles. Each turn represents from two weeks to two months, depending on the tempo of action at any given time.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: random events, reinforcements, withdrawals, refits, fog of war, off-map bases, interceptions, invading Australia, long-range bombers, protected targets, shore bombardment, commandos, airborne units, seaplanes, and the Tokyo Express. The game uses the system originally created for our earlier-published game, Red Dragon Rising. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>Originally published in World at War magazine #18 (Jun-Jul 2011).<br/><br/><br/>I. Japanese Random Event Check<br/>II.

A Starter Deck provides a randomized selection of 50 cards and 3 dice. A game requires two players, each with their own Starter deck. Actually you can play two different exciting game variants, Quick Shot or Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge, with a starter deck. Both games employ similar game mechanics, but the overall game play, strategy level, and details for each are very different. Quick Shot is a fast action, easy to learn, quick playing contest while Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge is a more complex game and it will take time and practice to understand its complete strategy and play possibilities. The rules for Quick Shot are presented to give newcomers the opportunity to get started quickly and become familiar with many of the basic game mechanics. For most Collectable Card Game players and as newcomers gain experience we invite you to give the complete Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge game rules a shot.<br/><br/>",

And, security must work together to spot the fake using clues in the subtle size differences in the diamonds. But be careful! There are also burglars hiding among the security. Don't let them fool you in the discussion...!<br/><br/>The Diamond Swap combines trying to spot the difference and tricking your opponents. All 30 diamond chips are slightly different in size. In this identity-concealing type game, you are divided into two groups: the burglars whose mission is to deceive, and security, who needs to see through the subtle size changes after the diamond swap.<br/><br/>The player who draws the &quot;burglar&quot; card steals one of the five authentic diamonds in the center and secretly replaces it with a fake from their hand. All within the time the security guards are counting to 10 with their eyes closed. After everyone has opened their eyes, as a group, everyone has to deduce which diamond has been swapped. Though, the differences in sizes are hard to distinguish.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this guesswork, the burglar tries to deceive the security guards and lead them astray. Sometimes the burglar isn&rsquo;t alone, and has partners in crime to help with to disrupting deductions. Can security avoid being deceived by the burglars and reveal the diamond that&rsquo;s been swapped?<br/><br/>",

The victor wins the treasure - and even more priceless - a place in dragon-racing history!<br/><br/>The goal is to race from start to finish using a handful of cards to make strategic choices.  Special cards that block other players' actions mean you must pay attention - even when it is not your turn.<br/><br/>With the ability to steal other players' cards and cards that are character-specific, sudden and significant reversals of fortune are common.

        "description": "Stealth Chess is a chess-under-imperfect-information variant, a kind of cross between chess and Stratego. In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.<br/><br/>Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.<br/><br/>The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.<br/><br/>There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup. You'll know which piece is which at the beginning of the game and the trick is to remember.<br/><br/>",

This two-player game may or may not be a trick-taking game, and is, in a sense, intended to live on the edge.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards (numbered 1-21) and two optional scoring cards. To set up a round, shuffle the cards, remove five from play, then deal each player eight cards. The starting player plays any card, then the next player either plays a card at most three higher than the previous card &mdash; so on a play of 5, the next player could play 6, 7, or 8 &mdash; or passes. When a player passes, the previous player collects the played cards, stacks them as a scored trick, then leads a card. When a player is out of cards, you resolve the current trick, then the player who has collected more tricks wins the round; in case of a tie, the player who collected the last trick wins.<br/><br/>The first player to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

As the boss of your mining company, it's your job to sit at your desk and plot where to send your most influential foremen. By successfully influencing the price of coal, permits, utilities, and construction, your company can expand and boost the profitability of its operations. Your job as boss is made all the more difficult by the ever-shifting nature of the markets, from turn to turn, round to round, and game to game. It is your responsibility to determine when &mdash; and how &mdash; to act in order to capitalize on a potentially beneficial marketplace. If your mine is not built wisely and safely, a share of your company's profits will be lost after the end-of-year visit from the mine inspector. The mining company that has the most money at the end of the year wins.<br/><br/>",

The table value determines how many hot dogs can be sold at that table.<br/>The remaining dollar cards are sorted according to value (1, 5, 10 $) and also placed on the table. The start player gets the ketchup/mustard card.<br/><br/>All players simultaneously decide at which table and how many hot dogs they want to sell. Each player puts the corresponding table and hot dog cards on the table, face down. They can also put down dollar cards to reduce the price of their hot dogs.<br/>When all players have made their decision, the cards are revealed and tallied up, beginning with the lowest table. <br/>When several players want to sell at the same table, the player who wants to sell the lowest number of hot dogs at this table puts them next to the table first, followed by the player who wants to sell the second lowest number at that table etc. Once the number of hot dogs from the players' cards has reached the maximum specified on the table, no other players can sell hot dogs there and any unsold hot dog cards are returned to that player's hand. Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4). If hot dog prices are equal, the player with the ketchup/mustard card goes first.<br/>As soon as a table is full, each player receives one dollar for each hot dog he/she has at this table.<br/>At the end of the round, each player takes back the table card he/she played and the ketchup/mustard card is passed on to the next player.<br/>A new sales round starts.<br/>When someone plays out his/her last hot dog card(s), he has to announce this by saying &quot;last hot dog&quot;, otherwise he may not sell them. When one player has sold all of his/her hot dogs, the game ends. If tables have become full that round, there is a last payout.<br/>Then all players count their dollars and write down their points. After three games, the richest player wins.<br/><br/>",

The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.<br/><br/>The german Schmidt Spiele edition was published as a game of the Schmidt Spiele-Bar series in book case format.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a pirate captain, it's hard to steal booty &mdash; but it is even harder to share that booty equally. If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you'll probably end up with the most valuable loot!<br/><br/>Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).<br/><br/>Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.<br/><br/>When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.<br/><br/>After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &mdash; but only for the complete groups that they've collected. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &quot;Captain Sly&quot; variant in which an opponent who can't take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing. Good luck trying to make those unfair trades!<br/><br/>",

In Crystallized, players will match up colors on the hexagonal cards in their hand with those already played in the play area. Once the color or colors have been matched up, the player will deposit the appropriate number of crystals to the facet board. If a player makes a match with a card that scores more than enough to fill the facet board with that color, they may take the leftover crystals, and dump them on an opponent &ndash; as long as that player has at least one of that color in their collection. They are stuck with those unwanted crystals for the rest of the game.  Don&rsquo;t forget that cards can also be built on top of other cards within the play area, making the game even more complex and challenging. The game is made up of high-quality components that feature a satisfying tactile experience. The beautiful, jewel-colored crystals along with the beautifully designed hexagonal cards make up a gorgeous, abstract play area that&rsquo;s different each time.

Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.<br/><br/>When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value. Whoever has the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Each and every one strives only for the opportunity to dethrone the Sultan and grasp the power for himself.<br/><br/>To reach this goal each player must send his vizirs to the remote cities at the outskirts of the Realm, in order to acquire troops, weapon and bribes (in form of Power cards). Being absent unfortunately reduces the vizir's influence and importance at court and makes him an easy target for intrigues, and suspicions of betrayal can quickly lead to the dungeons - or to the Island of Banishing disappearing forever. Therefore a Vizir should not leave court for longer periods of time, and on his return should he always seek out the best place - such as one carrying a large number of votes (the seat-number).<br/><br/>Only the player who is capable of balancing the various facets of the game - and most intelligently maneuvers his vizirs - will have a chance to win the struggle for subversion in the palace.<br/><br/>",

To complete a challenge, you lay out the insects as shown on the challenge card, then place the chameleon token adjacent to one edge of the grid. A move consists of eating (i.e., flipping face down) all the insects of one type in the row/column next to the chameleon, then advancing the chameleon clockwise around the perimeter as many spaces as the number of insects you just ate. If you land on a row/column with no uneaten insects &mdash; yet insects remain elsewhere in the layout &mdash; then you've lost the challenge; if you eat all the insects, you win.<br/><br/>Kameleo can also be played as a two-player game. Lay out the insects on a challenge card, then the first player chooses where to place the chameleon token. Players take turns eating a type of insect and moving the chameleon. Whoever can't eat on their turn loses the round, and whoever first loses three rounds loses the game.<br/><br/>",

Will you be it?<br/><br/>Game Story<br/>You are monkeys in the Wild West trying to prevail against each other. Manipulation and deceptive alliances determine the rambling for bananas. And in the saloon, sticks are some-times used to attack one another.<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME<br/>There are two ways to win: <br/><br/>     The player collects victory points. You get one victory point in exchange for five bananas. Once a player has collected five victory points, they win the game. <br/>     The player collects symbols. Each character card shows a certain combination of three symbols (stone / water / coconut) located at the top of their character card. A player wins as soon as they have collected their three symbols. These symbols are activated by playing coresponding action cards. <br/><br/><br/>So if you are the first to collect five victory points or the three matching symbols on your character card, you win the game.<br/><br/>How to Play <br/>Phase 1: Draw a reward card <br/>The player who monkeys around the most begins. They draw any one reward card in the display in Phase 1 of which they see only the front side. However, they receive the reward on the front and the previously hidden back side of the reward card. The drawn reward card then must laid on the discard pile.<br/><br/>Phase 2:<br/>In Phase 2 the Player can choose between the following options: Activate action card, play an effect, disable action card<br/><br/>The character cards <br/>There are six different characters. Each character card shows a combination of symbols for the symbol victory at the top. As soon as a player has activated the action cards with all the corresponding symbols, they win the game. Under the symbols the character is pictured with the respective special effect. The special effect can only be played once in the entire game. It can be done anytime during your own turn. To do this, the player places the character card face up in front of them for the rest of the game, so that the symbols are also revealed.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>Once a player has five victory points or their combination of three required symbols in front of them, they win the game. It is also possible that four symbols are laid out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Ihr seid Affen im Wilden Westen und versucht euch gegen die anderen Affen durchzusetzen.

To set up the game, lay out the six animal tiles in a circle; each tile shows a die face next to the animal: zebra is 1, mouse is 2, etc.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player secretly rolls two dice in a cup, rerolling if necessary to get different results on each die. The player then starts to draw one animal that has features of both animals rolled, say, a zebeera or a pifrog. When any of the other players think they know what is being drawn, they grab the grunting plastic zebra-schwein and give their answer. If wrong, that player is out for the round; if correct, that player and the drawer each win an animal card. Then the next player clockwise starts a new round.<br/><br/>Whoever collects the most animal cards wins!<br/><br/>",

The Warsaw Pact player must capture Munich and drive back the NATO forces in southern West Germany. A variety of NATO forces have gathered to stop the onrushing Soviet and Czech forces.<br/><br/>The Across the Rhine Scenario begins at a later stage in the conflict, with the assumption that the Warsaw Pact has broken through the &ldquo;forward defense&rdquo; lines of NATO. The Warsaw Pact player tries to move his substantial forces over the Rhine River and into the open country beyond, while retreating NATO units stream onto the map, trying desperately to evade the closing Soviet pincers and to fight a successful delaying action.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of double impulse game turns, during which the initiative (first move and attack) may pass from player to player. Movement and attacks are halved in the second impulse. The ground scale is 4 kilometers per hex, with each game turn representing about 24 hours.<br/><br/>The Game Map:<br/>The Drive on Munich map covers the area from the Austrian border to Munich. The Across the Rhine map covers the area from the Ruhr to Belgium. A hexagonal grid has been superimposed on each map to regulate movement; each hex has an identity number.<br/><br/>GAME PARTS:<br/>&bull;    One 22 &quot; * 32.5 &quot; game map<br/>&bull;    One counter sheet of 200 cardboard playing pieces<br/>&bull;    One 16-page rule booklet<br/>&bull;    One six-sided die (not included in magazine version)<br/>&bull;    One game box (not included in magazine version)<br/><br/>(from the rulebook)<br/><br/>",

Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, while the other player represents a combined Lincoln/Grant persona.<br/><br/>The game postulates that on the second day at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Confederate attack began earlier... Little Round Top was overrun and the bulk of the Army of the Potomac was forced to fall back on Baltimore to regroup.<br/><br/>The Confederate player is trying to conquer the City of Washington while (optimally) also destroying the Northerner's high command. The degree in which the Rebels succeed or fail is measured in victory points... the Confederate must gain 5 or more points to win. This basically means, barring Lincoln's death, the Confederate player must gain control of the Capitol and the White House hexes to win.<br/><br/>",

The players take the roles of some of the important characters from the film (Ash, Henry, etc.) and try to defeat Evil Ash and his horde of Deadites.  The game can be played cooperatively where the evil forces are controlled by predetermined objectives, or instead one of the players can control all of the evil forces.  Game play consists of players searching the castle for allies and equipment they can use to fight the Deadites (flaming arrows, explosives, etc.) and the actual combating of the evil army.  Players win if they defeat the four evil champions.  Evil wins if Evil Ash gets the Book of the Dead out of the castle or if the Deadite army kills all of the players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DinoBattle is a card game for 2-5 players, consisting of 45 dino cards, 6 survival cards, and 6 event cards. The dino cards show an image of a dinosaur or a meteorite. At the top of the cards there are one or more small icons of dino&rsquo;s that can be defeated by that dino card. In DinoBattle every player receives four dino cards, and the player whose turn it is has to act on the last played dinosaur.<br/><br/>The smallest scavengers are eaten by the medium sized hunters. Medium sized hunters are in turn eaten by the bigger dinos that also eat each other or can be defeated by smaller dinos working together well. Even the biggest dinos are not safe, because the meteorite can be fatal for them and thus mark a new beginning for the scavengers.<br/>After playing a card, the player replenishes his hand, unless the player failed to play a card that fitted the previous dino card. In that case the player plays on with a hand with one card less. The game ends when a player cannot play his last card, and the player with the most cards in hand wins the game. In case of a draw, the winners play a knock out round until one winner is left.<br/>It is also possible to play multiple rounds. In that case, each remaining hand card counts as 1 point, and the game ends when a player has 10 points or more.<br/><br/>The basic game of DinoBattle is already very playable for children from 8 years, but the game contains optional cards that can make the game more challenging and interesting for older players<br/>and veterans.<br/>The survival cards offer each player a second chance and give players the possibility to survive for longer in though situations. There are three different survival cards, each with two different options that can offer salvation.<br/>Event cards add new tactical elements and offer players the possibility to achieve a unique advantage over the other players. These cards are face up on the table, visible for all players. Each player can use one event card during his turn. Used event cards are no longer available for other players. Which event card can be played depends on the dino card that is on top of the discard pile.<br/>When these optional cards are used, it is no longer possible to play another card than the askes card.<br/><br/>If you cannot play a matching card, you are out of the game for this round. The last remaining player wins the round, and the player who wins the most rounds, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's engaging enough for serious players, or casual enough to enjoy while having a conversation with a friend. Not to mention, it's a superb way to pass the time during the current lock-down.<br/><br/>The game is presented in a classic Moroccan style lending an air of timelessness to it. It's perfect for seasoned board game players and for new-comers alike. We especially like that it does not take up a lot of room on the table, so it makes a perfect coffee date companion.<br/><br/>The game comes with 8 full colour hexagon tiles, 6 dice, 4 blue player markers, 4 gold player markers, an instruction booklet (with a thank you page for backers!) and a beautifully presented box that it sure to catch the eye.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to get all four of their player markers into the center tile.<br/><br/>Players roll dice, and use the dice to perform 1 of 3 actions.<br/><br/>The actions include placing a player marker on the board, moving a player marker, and attacking an opponents player marker.<br/><br/>While the mechanics are fairly simple, it still allows for several strategic choices throughout the game, but not so many that you end up with decision paralysis.<br/><br/>The game runs between 15-20 minutes each and is suitable for ages 8 and older.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The card is placed in a plastic bookshelf, which allows each of the letters (or spaces) in the word to be viewed individually.<br/><br/>Players then send their monks and novices to collect clues; six clues may be easily obtained from books found around the monastery, but the other four can only be viewed within the locked laboratory. The first player to correctly determine the word wins.<br/><br/>This game is a redevelopment of Abtei der wandernden Bücher in a more affordable edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from publisher)<br/>Egypt 1926. The Valley of the Pharaohs holds many secrets, but none so great as the Scepter of Amun-Ra. In this grand adventure you play a character tasked with collecting the legendary Scepter. As you make your way to the Valley of the Pharaohs you will face desert bandits, blinding sandstorms and the ill wishes of your fellow players. But safe haven and good fortune can be found within the oasis of the friendly Bedouin. If you&rsquo;re feeling lucky you can spin the Wheel of Fate. Collect resources to overcome obstacles or lay obstacles to hinder your opponents. Roll doubles and you control the mummy, but beware no one masters the mummy for long. Valley of the Pharaohs comes packaged in an authentic wooden book-box and is played on a beautifully illustrated map of Egypt. Cast metal playing pieces, metal coins and individual character cards provide rich context and detail to this exciting game of fortune and peril.<br/><br/>",

He hopes for an easy conquest of the rich province at a time when the Austrian Empire appears vulnerable following the death of Charles VI, King of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor. But despite internal opposition to the &lsquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rsquo; that allowed a woman to inherit the throne, Austria&rsquo;s new Queen, Maria Theresa, is cowed neither by Frederick, nor by France&rsquo;s scheme to place a Bavarian puppet candidate on the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, nor by Spanish designs on Austria&rsquo;s holdings in Italy. Amid these conflicting dynastic ambitions, Frederick&rsquo;s local territorial coup proves to be only the opening act in a major European war that none of the great powers had anticipated - but all wished to profit from. It would ultimately span eight years and half the globe.<br/><br/>&quot;Clash of Sovereigns&quot; (COS), GMT&rsquo;s 2-4 player card-driven game of the War of the Austrian Succession, has been 9 years in the making. It is a free-wheeling, faster-playing, stream-lined &ldquo;nephew&rdquo; of the widely-regarded Clash of Monarchs (COM).<br/><br/>COS features asymmetrical armies with distinctive national characteristics and capabilities that have banded together in alliances that often struggle with conflicting goals. Both the Bourbons and Pragmatics will benefit &ndash; or suffer from &ndash; interactions among the various nations in their respective alliances.<br/><br/>COS&rsquo;s replay value is high because the multiplicity of belligerents and theaters of operation ensure that the game will never play the same way twice. Vienna may fall to the Prussians or French; Paris and Naples may see Austrian white uniforms in their streets; and London may be beset by Bonnie Prince Charlie &ndash; or invading French troops. Will the French get Bavarian Charles VII onto the throne of the Holy Roman Empire? Will Marshal Traun and Austrian Croats take it back? Will Louis XV and George II clash in Flanders? And will anyone be able to stop De Saxe? -- Find out!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each of these must be determined by the player from a fixed number of points.  To make a Hero super-strong will mean that some other category must suffer (super-strong and a lackwit?).  Monsters include such loathesome creatures as trolls, ogres, zombies, goblins, lycanthropes, men, and the horribly alluring succubus.  Each has an offensive potential as well as a defensive capability based on the type of creature vs. the Hero's weapon and how mightily he wields it.  Your Hero must avoid traps, slaughter monsters, gather gold, and make it to the end of the labyrinth to win the hand of the stunning, voluptuous daughter of the most powerful wizard in the land.
